       My dog died this morning. She has been rather strange for a few days, and had a massive stroke last night. Not a pretty sight, something twitching and frightened, unable to move, covered in it's own bodily fluids. We called the vet around and he gave her a massive dose of anaesthetic to put her out of her misery. He had trouble finding a vein though, and in the end injected her directly into her jugular and heart to do it quickly. She'd had a good life though, she was around 16, a fair age for a dog. We just have Bilbo left now, who although old and rather smelly is full of life and will hopefully stick around for a while yet. Happy new year everyone, have a fantastic night tonight and wipe the slate clean for a new start. Remember, life is short and precious - make the most of every possible moment.

       Disney may not be allowed to  urlLink sell Winnie the Pooh merchandise in future , which would mean a loss of about 25% of their revenue. I was never a big Disney fan, anyway.  I once went to the Disney park in California, and it was fucking awful. They only had one good ride, and I think Caroline doesn't work there anymore anyway. Who cares about a mouse with a head like a wingnut pissing around with brooms and books? Compared to the mighty bastion of cartoons, " urlLink "Looney Tunes?"    It must be time for Disney v Looney Tunes!   ROUND ONE      V        +       Mickey Mouse v. Tweety Pie, but Tweety Pie has a Glock 17.  Mickey has large, flappy ears, which he could use to distract Tweety before Tweety had time to clok his 'G. Tweety also has no opposable thumb, which could prove a problem when aiming the 9 milly. However, 3 seconds later Mickey would be smoked.  ROUND TWO      V        +      Marvin the Martin v. Bambi, but Bambi has a AK-47.  On the face of it, Bambi has no chance. However, Marvin would teleport back to his space ship and Death Star Bambi's skinny ass with his fricking laser.  ROUND THREE      V        +      Foghorn Leghorn v. Hercules in a B2 Stealth Bomber.  Hercules is cleared for take off and makes good progress towards Foghorn's chicken coup. However as he tries to release his payload his biceps get caught in the cockpit and put him in a flat spin, screaming "Goose" I can't reach the ejection handle!"  End Result: Warner Brothers 3, Disney Nil.

       Something quite unexpected happened to me last Friday and it really made me think! The following day, another similar and unexpected happened!! Take a look at the following questionaire and try to determine if one of your supposed mates is a bastard:       1) Would your friend lend you money if you were in a fix?       2) Would your friend give you a lift if your car brakes down?       3) Would your friend always be honest to you?       4) Would your friend ever let you down?       5) Would your friend ever go behind your back and make off with your girlfriend?       6) Would your friend on the other hand ever try making off with you!?       7) Would your friend ever steal from you?       8) Would your friend ever take a bullet for you?       9) Would your friend make a birthday cake for you?           10) AND LASTLY, WOULD YOUR FRIEND EVER FUCK YOU AND YOUR MATES OFF TWICE IN A ROW, GIVING YOU NOTHING BUT A TOTAL LOAD OF BULLSHIT EXCUSES!!!!!!!!! WORST YET, WOULD YOUR FRIEND NOT EVEN HAVE THE CONCIENCE TO TELL THE TRUTH???       Hopefully once you have answered this little questionaire you will know wether or not any of your friends are bastards!!! Hope its been helpful.

       Bored during meetings? Do you need some Presentation technique training?   Why not try some of these little exercises. Not only will it make meetings more interesting, but your fellow work mates will become suddenly more alert, aware of your presence and maintain a respectful distance.     During a meeting ...   1. Discreetly clasp hold of someone's hand and whisper "Can you feel it?" from the corner of your mouth.   2. Draw enormous genitalia on your notepad and discreetly show it to the person next to you for their approval.   3. When refreshments are presented, immediately distribute one biscuit to each of the attendees, then systematically smash each one with your fist in front of them.   4. Chew tobacco   5. Wear a hands free phone headset throughout. Once in a while drift off into an unrelated conversation such as, "I don't care if there are no dwarfs, just get the show done!"   6. Write the words - "He fancies you" on your pad and show it to the person next to you while indicating with your pen.   7. Respond to a serious question with - "I don't know what to say,obviously I'm flattered, but it's all happened so fast".   8. Use Nam style jargon, such as "what's the ETA?", "who's on recon?" and "Charlie don't surf".   9. Reconstruct the meeting in front of you using action figures and when anyone moves, re-arrange the figures accordingly.   10. Shave one of your forearms   11. Draw a chalk circle around one of the chairs, then avoid sitting on it when the meeting starts. When someone does eventually sit in it, cover your mouth and gasp.   12. Turn your back on the meeting and sit facing the window with your legs stretched out. Announce that you "love this dirty ole town".   13. Walk directly up to a colleague and stand nose to nose with him for one minute.   14. Mount the desk and walk along its length before taking your seat.  15. Reflect sunlight into everyone's eyes off your watch face.   16. Gargle with water.   17. Repeat every idea expressed in a baby voice while moving your hand like a chattering mouth.   18. Gradually push yourself closer and closer to the door on your chair.   19. Hum throughout.   20. Bend momentarily under the table and then emerge wearing contact lenses that white out your eyes.   21. Drop meaningless and confusing management speak into conversations, such as: "What's the margin Marvin?", "When's this turkey going to get basted?", "If we don't get this brook babbling, we're all going to end up looking like doe-eyed Labradors".   22. Produce a hamster from your pocket and suggest throwing it to one another as a means of idea-exchange.   23. Use a large hunting knife to point at your visual aids.   24. Announce that you've run off some copies of the meeting agenda. Then hand out pieces of paper that reads: My Secret Agenda. 1.Trample the weak. 2.Triumph alone. 3.Invade Poland. Re-collect them sheepishly and ask everyone to pretend they haven't seen them.   25. Attempt to hypnotise the entire room using a pocket watch.   26. When referring to someone in the room, always call them your homey"or"dog".   27. Leave long pauses in your speech at random moments. When someone is prompted to interject, shout "I AM NOT FINISHED".   28. Project the rudimentary computer game Tennis from your laptop.   29. Pull out a large roll of bank notes and count them demonstratively.

       A long time ago...  In a galaxy far, far away...  "This hilarious parody will guide you through the tormented mind of Wank Solo in his search for anything to get laid. When he receives a message for help from the horny princess kept captive on the Ass Star, nothing can stop him. Don't be surprised if you see familiar faces, déjà vu movie scenes and a lot of sex."  21/1/02 - Edited this post, looks like Starballz got sued once too many and their ISP ditched the site. :-(

       The true mixture of the distinct modern art creation by Baity is: 1 jug of tequila sunrise  1 shot of slippery nipple  1 Smirnoff ice   Hence the name, Three Drink Baity  And also, there are women out there that want the nice guy/bad guy combination, but they always go off and shag/get engaged/marry someone else. Says the voice of experience.

          This is a little demonstration in the art of projectile vomiting. If you too, want to take part in the sport of what I call 'Pro Street Sicking' then you must first learn how to produce the correct mix of stomach churning material. The following is a small example of the ingredients that made up this little winner:     1 deep fried chillie beef                                           1 chicken fried rice                                           1 sweet and sour sauce                                           3 vodka/orange                                           2 smirnoff ices                                           2 jugs of tequila sunrise, It is imperitive that once consumed, you mix the ingredients thoroughly by dancing and jumping around for about three hours! Start training now if you want to take part in C.U.N.T.S ( Covert Under Night Time Sicking) Tournament, coming to a streeet corner near you...SOON!

       Nice guy/Bad guy  Sometimes I want a relationship. Long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners and cosy nights in. Then sometimes I want pornstar sex. Dirty, sweating thrusting and plenty of screaming and moaning. Is it really possible to get two different things from the same woman? Or in Alex's case, the same lumberjack?  Oh, and one more thing. I had links to two other sites because I liked them and wanted a link back. I emailed both guys twice and never got a response. So from now on i'll only be linking to sites that I really like or ones that link back. I am not going to share my readers (both of them) with anyone.

       Now, now Custard. Zippy isn’t that boring anymore. He has a Job now...  Admittedly all he does is watch Fellowship of the Rings (not the porn version) and handle his hotdogs.  Just don’t reply to him if he asks "Salty or Sweeet?".  Besides, when Baity prefers to talk to your girlfriends over his own, it does tend to draw people to the conclusion “Is Custard gay?”  Either way, remember, YODA said to Luke, “Cum, good eating! Cum!”

       Howdy pps it’s been a hard day over here doing nothing (that’s why I love days off) but anyway the topic for today is “Alex is the gay boy” and the main reason he is not me zippy!!(Look at “who is this guy” and you will understand) And that he stays in all day doing nothing but playing on he’s computer no women just the computer. If there was a sex drive he would have one and most likely he wouldn’t even know how to get it up!  Sorry for that had to get my own back anyway talk to you guys soon I need some sleep. cya

Expect a 'Mark about page' coming soon, complete with photos of our recent exploits around St Helier... off to Follies tonight, free entry.. just the way we like it.

       More Apple beating... seen the new iMac? Wooooo.. it's a anglepoise lamp on acid. Eugh!  My MCSE studying is going well, i'm getting good results on the mock tests and getting my head around the finer points of Win2K wierdness..  In November I had a random text message from a strange number, saying "Friends leave their footprints in other people's hearts, and you left yours in mine". I replied "Did you want Adam in Jersey, because that's who you've got?" and the reply came back "Martin stop messing around". I decided to call the number, and spoke to a charming young lady called Donna form Nothern Ireland. The conversation was a bit strange but we kept in touch and have been good buddies since. She is back home in Northern Ireland for Christmas and returning to Jersey in a few weeks to work. She's a good buddy and I can't wait to meet up. :-)

       Why the hell didn't Apple make their new  urlLink swank MP3 player  compatible with Windows from the start? I know you can buy  urlLink third party software  to get it working, but surely that's missing the point. The iPod isn't cheap anyway at £300. Why would I want to pay again for the software to get it working under Windows? Or was Apple expecting Windows users to buy a iMac just to use a iPod? Chaaaaaaa, right...  I would give it about five months before Microsoft release a MP3 player of their own, almost identical to the iPod, and blow it out the water. The sad thing is, i'd much rather give my cash to Apple than Microsoft.

       Argh, i'm sick! I've got a large red rash all around the base of my neck.. and my slightly itchy scalp has overnight got worse and kept me awake. I went to the doctor and he's given me a medicated shampoo and some tablets. He said it's some kind of allergic reaction. Great, start the new year off looking like boiled lobster. What's even worse than looking like a lobster, is having to suffer daytime television. Crap talk shows and "How to make the perfect pasta dish" presented by some pointy haired moron.

       Hello boys and girls. This is my first post so i shall start as i mean to go on...........BADLY! I would like to thank Adam for giving me the title of Dirty Joe, but i would like to point out to our reader, that this is totally untrue. I take personal hygine in the upmost regard and bath at least two or three times a year. And just so you are aware Adam, the cheese around my genitalia is simply an experiment in the making of organic produce. (Serving Suggestion: Goes well on toast with Oregano) Anyway, i would like to leave you all with this.

         Are you European?   Are you ready to join a Federal Europe?     Try this simple quiz to determine just how European you really are...     1.

Take your place in line and wait patiently to be served.   b. Put the bra back on the shelf and return later when the queue is shorter.   c. Barge directly to the front of the line and scream, "Ich leber stomph das bustenholten!"     2.

Beep your horn at the offending motorist to let him know you're annoyed.   c. Screech to a halt diagonally across the front of the other car, leap out and bang your fists repeatedly on his bonnet shouting, "Bastardo! Bastardo! Mamma Mia! Bastardo!"     3. You are walking along the pavement when a rather attractive looking woman passes by. Do you:     a. Look away modestly, perhaps blushing slightly.   b. Smile and maybe say, "Hello".   c. Smear a tub of Brylcreem all over your head, pinch her bottom then proceed to follow her around for half an hour, together with twenty of your mates, all riding pathetic little scooters,  making a variety of crude and suggestive remarks.     4. You're busy at work when suddenly you realise its 12 o'clock. What do you do?     a. Have lunch, read the paper, then return to work 45 minutes later.   b. Ignore the time and keep working until you've finished the task at hand.   c. Sit down under a tree and go to sleep for six hours.     5. You're holidaying on a beach when you see a rather old and weary looking donkey giving rides to children. What would you do?     a. Pay no attention. It's a fairly common sight.   b. Pat the donkey on the head and offer it a lump of sugar.   c. Goad it with a sharp stick, then get 50 of your friends to jump up and down on its back until it falls over and dies. Then go to sleep for six hours.     6. You wake up in the middle of the night feeling a bit peckish. Do you:     a. Roll over and go back to sleep.   b. Pop down to the kitchen for a quick cup of tea and a biscuit.   c. Phone twenty of your friends and invite them to come round and spend the next five hours eating snails, frogs, onions and garlic, smoking Gitane and drinking 48 litres of wine.     7. You arrive at work first thing in the morning. What is the first thing you do?     a. Start the day's work straight away.   b. Sit in the loo for twenty minutes reading the paper.   c. Spend three hours shaking hands with your colleagues, hugging them and kissing them on both cheeks as though you have not seen them for twenty years.     8. You admire your neighbour's lawn which is particularly well kept. Which of the following would you do?     a. Nothing. You're quite happy with your own patchy area of grass.   b. Ask his advice to enable your lawn to look as good as his.   c. After promising him that you won't do it, you move your garden fence onto his land making his lawn part of your garden. If he complains, shoot him.     9. You are walking down the street when you see an old lady being mugged by two youths. Would you:     a. Wade in without regard for your own safety and try to fight the youths off.   b. Run to the nearest phone box to call the police.   c. Ignore the fracas completely; declare your neutrality by waving a little white flag above your head, then scarper back to your underground  nuclear bomb shelter and try to work out how  much money you've made by selling vastly overpriced timepieces and multi-purpose folding knives.     10. Your local football team has won a game. How would you celebrate?   Would you:     a. Go down the pub and have a few pints with your friends.   b. Just stay at home. You aren't that interested in football.   c. Drive around in circles in a stupid little twenty year old Fiat with six people on the roof, screaming Ole' ole' ole' ole' at the top of your  voice waving your arms out of the windows and  honking the bloody horn all night.     If you answered mostly "A" :-  Your upper lip is so stiff that clearly you are English and proud of it.  You will never believe the damned lies and statistics put about by wooly headed idealists,  who claim that joining a federal Europe would somehow be a good idea.     Mostly "B" :-  You are more normal than a cheese sandwich.     Mostly "C" :-  You are filthy European scum already.

       I am now Mr Adam John Currie CCA MCP MCSA MCSE. Woohoo!  I've actually got one exam left to take tomorrow, but because I paid for 218 it doesn't matter if I pass or not. I can't wait to come back home and get drunk with my buddies. My head feels firmly wedged up my butt with all these exams.  Instructor: "Where would you find a routing table?" Me: "In a router" Instructor: "Hmmm... anyone else?"

       John, why on earth are you wearing a strap-on-slut? :-)  I've passed Network Infrastructure, the hardest exam of the Windows 2000 MCSE. Who wants to touch me?  MALE COMEBACKS TO FEMALE COMEBACKS TO MALE CHAT UP LINES    Man: Haven't I seen you someplace before?  Woman: Yes, that's why I don't go there anymore.  Man: Really? I heard it was because everyone there calls you a fat slapper.    Man: Is this seat empty?  Woman: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.  Man: Probably because you will be on your knees sucking on my co*k.    Man: Your place or mine?  Woman: Both. You go to yours, and I'll go to mine.  Man: That's cool, cause after I'm done shagging you in the back of my car, I don't give a sh!t where you go.    Man: How do you like your eggs in the morning?  Woman: Unfertilized.  Man: No problem, I can always shoot my load in your face.    Man: I would go to the end of the world for you.  Woman: But would you stay there?  Man: Probably, cause you seem like a right clingy bird that is impossible to get rid of once you shag.   Man: If I could see you naked, I'd die happy.  Woman: If I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing.  Man: That works for me....as long as you are still a little warm when I shove it up your @rse.    Male: Would you like to dance?  Female: I'd rather die.  Male: I think you mis-heard me. I said your arse looks fat in that skirt.   Credit to  urlLink Dan  for the above...

       Hello Baity here, just a quicky to say go and see 'From Hell'!!! Its fucking quality. When I left the cinema I wasn't quite sure wether or not I had just stepped out into some other, new and perverted world! It wouldn't be an understatement if I said my mind has been even more corupted by the content of this film, Johnny Depp sporting an unusually astounding cockney accent, Heather Graham wearing a totally outstanding push up dress ( which lets be honest, wasn't really needed), Robbie Coltraine playing yet another police seargent and the most disturbing thing..................... fucking BILBO BAGGINS going out on killing escapades, murdering and mutilating whores left, right and center!!! Can you imagine if all hobbits were like good old Bilbo? The 'Shire', full of little evil murderous pecks that run about in the night, looking for another 'Unfortunite' midget!! Anyway go and see the film if you still want to and remember to make sure you take a packed lunch ha ha!

       Had a nice weekend with my dad, chilling out and playing guitar.  I went to see "From Hell" the new Jack the Ripper movie... it's ok but for me the starring role was Heather Graham's left breast.  A man walks into a bar and stars chatting up a woman... "What's your name?" he asks. "Carmen" she says, "because I love cars and men. What's your name?"   "Charlie Beercunt"

       Congratulations mate, your now professionally certified....    A man and a woman who have  never met before find themselves in the same sleeping carriage of a  train.  After the initial embarrassment, they both manage to get to  sleep, the woman on the top bunk, the man on the lower.  In the middle of  the night, the woman leans over and says, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm  awfully cold and I was wondering if you could possibly pass me another  blanket." The man leans out and, with a glint in his eye, says, "I've got better idea - let's pretend we're married."  "Why not?" giggles the  woman.  "Good", he replies. "Get your own f***ing blanket."

       So i'm walking down the street in King's Cross, heading towards my training centre. On the side of the road is a huge van, with "POLICE HORSES" written on the side. It's parked outside a dodgy looking house. I start imagining a team of elite SWAT horses, running around on hind legs with bullet proof vests and MP5's, about to storm a crack house. I start grinning and a policeman walks out past me, giving me a really evil look like i'm hiding a recent bank robbery or something.  Apart from that, the course is going great. Server and Professional exams on Wednesday and Active Directory on Friday. Scary, but bring it on..

       Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighbouring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long e could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.  The question was: "What do women really want?"  Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.  He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princesses, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, and the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first. The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!   Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises, and had discoloured skin. He had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden. However, Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big a sacrifice in order to save Arthur's life and preserve the Round Table.  Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question: "What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life."  Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it went. The neighbouring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom. What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish. Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display and generally made everyone very uncomfortable. The wedding night approached: Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night,entered the bedroom. What a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened.  The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self and the otherhalf, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day and which during the night? What a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament - during the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments? What would you do? What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read on until you've made your own choice....   Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.   What is the moral of this story? The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly. Underneath it all, she's still a witch and don't you forget it.

       I am working up a fantastic tan. Kirk and I hired a speedboat yesterday and went out to the reef in a group to do some snorkelling.. nice fishes! Speaking of which we have got a group of us charting a boat to go deep sea fishing on sunday. Going to catch a big barracuda! Also been out on Jet skis yesterday.. EXCELLENT fun!  MTV were at the same club as us yesterday doing a spring break feature. Kylie Minogue was here on the day we arrived and tomorrow Paul Van Dyke is playing at the club next door to our resort. They play a wierd blend of music out here though. Last night at Fat Tuesdays they played Vanilla Ice, Guns N Roses, then Puffy Daddy. When the guys are pulling the girls, they pretty much just go right up to them and grab them and start grinding into them. If you did that in Follies you would likely have a glass in the face. Oh yeah, Americans cannot dance for SHIT :-)

       It's cold, wet and depressing here in Jersey today. People shuffle along King Street with grey faces, framed by a hood or umbrella. The boredom and depression flows like a sad, tired, river down the high street. Even the brass cows in West Centre seem to being mooing a little quieter than normal. It's as though the very air itself pushes down upon the citizens of Jersey, crushing spirits and smiles. Oh well, who gives a fuck because today I’m off to CANCUN!  Yes, in less than 48 hours me and my buddy Kirk will be frying to gas mark five, heavily marinated in tequila and served with an assortment of young American college girls. So long, suckers! Muahahahah!!!!

       I'm so knackered today.  I've been doing loads of overtime at work, building Win2K servers and racking them up. I almost crushed my pinky into a red sticky mess, experimenting with Compaq's new "tool-free" racking kits.  I guess pretending it was a lightsabre was partly to blame.  I've been spending so much time in comms rooms recently I am physically incapable of hearing the noise a fan makes anymore. This is not good. Bring on Cancun baby!

       If you've been cut short by Morpheus shutting the doors on file swappers, you might want to try  urlLink WinMX  instead.  During the week I've tried most of the peer to peer file swapping apps, and found most of them contain spyware (software that downloads adverts to your computer, and it some cases reports to marketing companies on the kind of web sites you visit. Better get that midget/donkey site out of your favourites Grist.) WinMX is pretty stable and doesn't have any of that crap in it.

        Isle of Man Reported Stolen   James Smith, businessman from the Isle of Man, was dismayed yesterday when his flight back home from Gatwick was cancelled. "I went to the check in desk and asked for information.. " said 25 year-old James. "They said they had to cancel the flight because they Isle of Man had vanished"  A Manx airlines pilot had discovered the disappearance of the 227 square mile landmass on his return flight. He then called over the intercom to the passengers that they would be diverted to Dublin instead, and free drinks were served by the stewardesses, in a reportedly 'carnival like atmosphere'.  There was no wide spread panic at the airport, with only two members of the public requesting information. "Isn't there where they hold the TT?" commented one man. "Bugger.. I guess it'll be Le Mans this year instead."  The theft of the island and population of 76,300 has been reported to the authorities, who replied "Yeah.. we heard something about that. If you seen any sheep or branches of Pickwicks being held ransom, then please let us know."   Before:    After:

       Greeting all, its been a while since I have posted anything and for that I would like to give you all my deepest........AH! Fuck it who am I kidding, I just haven't bothered for a while!!!  Well it appears that I have been punished for having such a hectic and dangerous lifestyle!!! I guess it was only a matter of time until playing with explosive chemicals and swiss cheese got me hurt!!!   Picture a warzone, a bullet riddled landscape, pitted craters caused by endless bombardments from above. Imagine the feeling of blood stained sweat dripping down the back of your neck, sending shivers down your spine like thousands of tiny needles pricking your very soul. You look all around and realise to your horror that your whole platoon has been wiped out like cum stains in the wash (couldn't think of anything else!). Suddenly it hits you as if you just just stepped out in front of a train. Rounds wizz pass your ears and crack off the wall your cowering behind! In a last dip attempt you spot your salvation...........THE MARSHAL!!! Yes theres the marshal, the man in the bright yellow shirt, the man who can dodge those paintballs as if they weren't even there, the man who is supposed to be your holy protector. In the back of your mind you hear him crying to you to press on and take that bastard enemy trench, and like a twat you listen!!! So you brase yourself for the push, you ready your gun and take a deep breath, you assure yourself that you are invinsible, the enemy is only twenty foot away behind his little bit of wall and he doesn't know the fury thats about to be unleashed..........ITS PERFECT AND NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.........YOU CHARGE.................YOU STEP ON A MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok it didn't quite happen like that but the long and short of it is that I made the charge, slipped, and knocked my front tooth out!!! FUCK IT!!!! THere goes my prince charming smile (Tears begin to well) I even managed to get a few nice photos of the aftermath ha ha. Well I guess its time to go meet that nice man in the white coat (No, not the loony bin guy) the DENTIST!! Yup that guy that smiles after doing his job and presents you with the bill for £6000. I will post the final cost and the photos when I have them, but until then tata.

       What a storming night!!  We ended up going to Follies instead of GAP, and it was fantastic. This surprised me immensly, normally Follies makes me want to kill myself because it gets too packed with Versace bound muscle boys and girls with egos the size of a small family saloon. It was mostly old-school dance and rave music which was okay, except if I here "Set you free" one more time i'll rip out the speaker cones with my teeth.  Custard and Mr. Speed left about quarter to two, and I left about ten past two and got invited to a party at the nurses flats near the hospital.  The rest i'm keeping for myself, but it involved and stethoscope not very much sleep!

       I seem to be making girls cry a lot recently. The last two weekends in GAP i've made two small brunettes burst into tears for no apparent reason.  Okay, there might have been a smidge of a reason.  The first time I was dancing with this girl and she was grinding around me, she went to put her hand on my shoulder like a Ricky Martin video and slide down me.  Unfortunately, she lost her grip and fell flat backwards onto her arse in the middle of a packed dance floor. I burst into hysterics and she fucked off, crying.    Last weekend I told a girl that was apparently getting engaged that she was acting like a bit of a slapper, and she also burst into tears and called me a bastard before squealing off like one of the possums I blew away in New Zealand. Silly fraggles, get some emotional self-control before you head out into the wilds of St Helier!  Anyway, off to find somone else to persecute with Custard and Baity (if he comes out, probably staying in shagging and moaning about money). Goodnight America, wherever you are.

       Hello Pimps and Whores! Low, I returneth with dire news.  Enough of the Shakespearean crap! Seriously though people, I do have some very bad news indeed. Recently, as I am sure many of you readers have too, I asked myself about the possibility of a third world war. Given the current climate of political conditions, and the uprising of many terrorist organisations, it seems there it is only a matter of when, not if, this catastrophic event would occur. To give myself piece of mind, I decided to browse the net to find information on what could safeguard me during this time of unrest. To my relief I discovered the US military forces, ever present and always ready to pick up the torch of freedom if some Nation or Organisation decide to take it from us. But should rest easy? America may have the largest armed forces in the world, but as this article shows, it also has the dumbest!  This is the transcript of the ACTUAL radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995. Radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations 10-10-95.  Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees the North to avoid a collision.  Canadians: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.  Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.  Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER- MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.  Canadians: This is a lighthouse... Your call!  Now peeps, here is the question, just how fucking stupid do you have to be, to command the second biggest ship in the American fleet! And more to the point, with modern sonar and radar, not to mention EYES, how much of a FUCKING MORON do you have to be not to spot a fucking lighthouse!!!!!  Anyway, speaking of another bunch of dumb US wankers, Microsoft. (Did you like the transition there? I thought that was smooth :-)  Microsoft has recently come under fire for there terrible operating systems. Weather you are using 95, 98, 2000, NT, XP or even good old 3.1, the windows OS has been failing users in every area. Multiple crashes, blue screens and the inability to download porn easily have made many people switch their OS to something more stable. Just a few hours before this post the Microsoft Press Office unveiled their new, and possibly best, OS to date. They have claimed that it will revolutionise the modern PC.  Now you may be sceptical of this, given their track record who could blame you. But I have lucky enough to review this latest offering for the Microsoft Corporation, and can safely say without a doubt, that it is the best, most bug-free, and most stable version of Windows there is. And more than likely ever will be. But don't just take my world for it, check out the new  urlLink WindowsRG!!!

       Eugh. I am so hung over it's not even funny. I've been working my ass off this week on an e-commerce project at work, and we went out for a curry last night as most of the work is done now. I had a wicked strength Chicken Jalfrazi then met up with Custard in the Sports Bar, then to Follies, and lastly GAP. I was chatting to Custard and a tall brunette (who bared a striking resemblance to Harry Potter) pulled me onto the dance floor and started dancing with me. After about 10 minutes she drags me over to the side of the club, next to this big body builder type. Then she says.. "Listen.. I’m married. You're a really nice guy and my husband and I would like to buy you a drink." She motions to the gorilla standing next to me, who looks me up and down and gives me an approving wink. I make a break for it and clear the dance floor in three strides, grabbing my coat and drinking buddy en route.

       I have to take back some of the nasty things I have said about Microsoft.  I dropped my Wireless USB Intellimouse the other day, shagging it up good and proper.  I didn't have any of the paperwork or the packaging, but they are sending me out a replacement free of charge. I guess even multi-millon-dollar-super-corporations still have time for the man in the street during global domination.  Oh yeah. I got all my hair shaved off too.  Before:    After:    My buddy Danny sent me  urlLink this cool flash game  - perfect for anyone that's ever owned a Scalextric set!

       These are (allegedly) extracts from letters sent to various councils and housing associations throughout the U.K.   1. I want some repairs done to my cooker as it has backfired and burnt my knob off.  2. I wish to complain that my father hurt his ankle very badly when he put his foot in the hole in his back passage.  3. And their 18-year-old son is continually banging his balls against my fence.  4. I wish to report that tiles are missing from the outside toilet roof. I think it was bad wind the other night that blew them off.  5. My lavatory seat is cracked, where do I stand.  6. I am writing on behalf of my sink that is coming away from the wall.  7. Will you please send someone to mend the garden path. My wife tripped and fell on it yesterday and now she is pregnant. We are getting married in September and we would like it in the garden before we move into the house.  8. I request permission to remove my drawers in the kitchen.  9. Can you please tell me when the repairs will be done as my wife is about to become and expectant mother...50% of the walls are damp, 50% have crumbling plaster and the rest are plain filthy.  10. I am still having problems with smoke in my new drawers.  11. The toilet is blocked and we cannot bath the children until it is cleared.  12. Will you please send a man to look at my water, it is a funny colour and not fit to drink  13. Our lavatory seat is broken in half and is now in three pieces  14. Would you please send a man to repair my spout, I am an old age pensioner and need it badly.  15. I want to complain about the farmer across the road; every morning at 6am his cock wakes me up and its now getting too much for me  16. The man next door has a large erection in the back garden, which is unsightly and dangerous  17. Our kitchen floor is damp. We have two children and would like a third so please send someone round to do something about it.  18. I am a single woman living in a downstairs flat and would you please do something about the noise made by the man I have on top of me every night.  19. Please send a man with the right tool to finish the job and satisfy my wife  20. I have had the clerk of the works down on the floor six times but I still get no satisfaction.  21. This is to let you know that our lavatory seat is broken and we can't get BBC2  22. My bush is really overgrown round the front and my back passage has fungus growing in it.  23. And he's got this huge tool that vibrates the whole house and I just can't take it anymore.  24. ... that is his excuse for dogs mess that I find hard to swallow

       The boys hit the town again last night, and amazingly John didn't get thrown out of GAP as normal!  We started off with beers and steaks at BIGA, and then headed to the Sports Bar.  They have changed the DJ in there now, (so long Neville.. don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, hahaha) and it's a OK blend of commercial dance/trance.  We had our normal jug each, and a blonde/brunette tag team was soon sniffing Custard. We had the presence of mind to buy a disposable camera, so expect pictures very soon. Then we headed over to Traders and had a flat liner each. Flat liners have achieved legendary status with us. A shot glass, half tequila, half sambucca and about 10 drops of Tabasco sauce. John nailed his and pelted it across the dance floor to the bogs, me and Custard chasing him with the camera to catch the infamous "Mallet pavement pizza", which never happened. Maybe he's learning some self-control in his old age?  So then we went into Follies for a bit, the music was OK but it got too packed as normal so we split for GAP at about half one. That's about as much as I can remember, except deciding to leave Custard's house because John has a snore that could cut through bank vaults.  Highlight of the evening - John running full pelt into a Euro bin, assisted by Custard. (Pictures to follow..)  Who says you can’t have a sophisticated night out in St Helier ?

       The following from Dirty Joe..  *** The following are more transcripts of exchanges between airline pilots and control towers from around the world:  A DC-10 had an exceedingly long rollout after landing with his approach speed a little high.  San Jose Tower: "American 751 heavy, turn right at the end of the runway, if able. If not able, take the Guadalupe exit off Highway 101 and make a right at the lights to return to the airport."  ***  While taxiing, the crew of a US Air flight departing for Ft. Lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727. The irate female ground controller lashed out at the US Air crew, screaming:  "US Air 2771, where are you going? I told you to turn right onto Charlie taxiway! You turned right on Delta! Stop right there. I know it's difficult for you to tell the difference between C's and D's, but get it right!"  Continuing her tirade to the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically: "God, you've screwed everything up! It'll take forever to sort this out! You stay right there and don't move till I tell you to! You can expect progressive taxi instructions in about half an hour and I want you to go exactly where I tell you, when I tell you, and how I tell you! You got that, US Air 2771?"  "Yes ma'am," the humbled crew responded.  The ground control frequency went terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air 2771. Nobody wanted to engage the irate ground controller in her current state. Tension in every cockpit at LGA was running high.  Then an unknown pilot broke the silence and asked, "Wasn't I married to you once?"  ***  The controller working a busy pattern told the 727 on downwind to make a three-sixty (do a complete circle), a move normally used to provide spacing between aircraft. The pilot of the 727 complained, "Don't you know it costs us two thousand dollars to make even a one-eighty in this airplane?"  Without missing a beat the controller replied, "Roger, give me four thousand dollars' worth."  ***  Unknown aircraft: "I'm f...ing bored!"  Air Traffic Control: "Last aircraft transmitting, identify yourself immediately!"  Unknown aircraft: "I said I was f...ing bored, not f...ing stupid!"  ***  Tower: "Eastern 702, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7."  Eastern 702: "Tower, Eastern 702 switching to Departure. By the way, after we lifted off we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of the runway."  Tower: "Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7. Did you copy that report from Eastern?"  Continental 635: "Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, roger; and yes, we copied Eastern and we've already notified our caterers."  ***  The German air controllers at Frankfurt Airport are a short-tempered lot. They not only expect one to know one's gate parking location, but how to get there without any assistance from them. So it was with some amusement that we (a Pan Am 747) listened to the following exchange between Frankfurt ground control and a British Airways 747, call sign "Speedbird 206":  Speedbird 206: "Top of the morning, Frankfurt, Speedbird 206 clear of the active runway."  Ground: "Guten Morgen. You vill taxi to your gate."  The big British Airways 747 pulled onto the main taxiway and slowed to a stop.  Ground: "Speedbird, do you not know where you are going?"  Speedbird 206: "Stand by a moment, Ground, I'm looking up our gate location now."  Ground (with arrogant impatience): "Speedbird 206, haff you never flown to Frankfurt before?"  Speedbird 206 (coolly): Yes, I have, actually, in 1944. In another type of Boeing, but just to drop something off. I didn't stop."  ***  O'Hare Approach Control: "United 329 heavy, your traffic is a Fokker, one-o-clock, three miles, eastbound."  United 239: "Approach, I've always wanted to say this... I've got that Fokker in sight."  ***  A Pan Am 727 flight engineer waiting for start clearance in Munich overheard the following:  Lufthansa (in German): Ground, what is our start clearance time?"  Ground (in English): "If you want an answer you must speak English."  Lufthansa (in English): "I am a German, flying a German airplane, in Germany. Why must I speak English?"  Unknown voice (in a beautiful British accent): "Because old boy you lost the bloody war!  ***

       The following from Don...  15 Easy Steps to Poo like a Woman:     1. Under no circumstances use any other toilet than your own, regardless of any stomach pain may be caused whilst waiting to get home. 2. With the toilet-brush, clean any residue left on the pan by your boyfriend / husband. Also wipe his pubic hair off the seat with some toilet paper. 3. Flush the toilet before starting. Then wash your hands 4. Line the toilet seat with toilet paper (as other people may have sat on the toilet since it was last bleached). 5. Stuff toilet paper inside the pan to prevent splash-back. 6. Pull panties down and sit. Some women may still prefer to squat over the seat as opposed to taking the risk of touching it with bare flesh. 7. Release solids, but strain to avoid making any sounds. 8. Rise and quickly flush before direct eye-contact is made with any faeces. 9. Take a length of toilet paper and fold it several times to positively guarantee that no residue will touch bare skin (about five or six applications per roll). 10. Wipe once and throw paper into the pan. Do not look at the paper. 11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 at least thirty times. It may be necessary to yell for your boyfriend/husband to find some more rolls to pass through the door while promising not to open his eyes or pass any comments. It is traditional to do this while he is trying to watch sport.  12. Flush the toilet and replace the lid. 13. Wash hands at least three times with disinfectant soap. 14. Open all windows and spray approximately half-a-can of air freshener. 15. Pick up all reading material left behind by your boyfriend/husband and leave bathroom, closing the door firmly behind you.  15 Easy Steps to Poo like a Man:     1. Select reading material (can be anything except a porn-mag; tried by every man once, but never repeated - see step 4). 2. Tell everyone along the way, "Just going for a dump, okay?" Always tell girlfriend/wife, especially when she has visitors. 3. Pull pants and trousers around ankles, then sit down. 4. Adjust penis and testicles to hang comfortably without touching the toilet rim. 5. Open reading material and relax. 6. Whilst waiting, it is traditional to audibly fart. 7. Sigh loudly as the first one bullets out. It is quite normal to experience a cold jet of water rocket up your anus as a result of the first bomb. This is to be endured if you want to be a real man. 8. Remain sitting and reading until pins-and-needles set in to your legs and buttocks. 9. Rise and look at the poo. Make mental notes of any irregularities to report to friends and girlfriend/wife, e.g. colour, consistency, any visible traces of peanuts, etc. You must tell people about it. 10. Take long length of paper and wipe anus. You must look at the paper before throwing it into the pan. 11. Repeat step 10 until there is no longer any evidence of faeces on the paper. 12. Flush. If there is any residue left on the pan, under no circumstances attempt to cleanit off. In due course, it will come away by itself. Or, when your girlfriend/wife next uses the loo. 13. Leave the seat up. Leave the reading material on the floor (you can use it again later). 14. Wash your hands once. 15. Vacate the bathroom, leaving the door open. It is important to a man's self-esteem that other people smell his produce.

       I still haven't recovered from Cancun.  I have a superman style triangle of sunburn on my chest, my throat is sore, my stomach has threatened to go on strike and move into a Vegan if I so much as LOOK another fajita in the eye.  As Kirk said during our trip, wherever you go in the world.... there's stupidity:                                                            Also from today's Inbox..  Moods of a Women... (Sent in by Don P)    An angel of truth and a dream of fiction, A Women is a bundle of contradiction.    She's afraid of a wasp, will scream at a mouse, But will tackle her boyfriend alone in the house.    Sour as vinegar, sweet as a rose, She'll kiss you one minute, then turn up her nose.    She'll win you in rage, enchant you in silk, She'll be stronger than Brandy, milder than milk.    At times she'll be vengeful, merry and sad, She'll hate you like poison and love you like mad.

       Hello Thrill seekers.. I have returned from the wilds of Mexico, sunburnt, partied-out, jet lagged and grinning like an idiot.  My observations about Cancun are as follows:  1.  Working your way through a cocktail list is not good for your sense of balance. 2.  Dancing on a stage in front of three thousand people with a pair of glow sticks brings out an enormous sense of well-being. 3.  I want a jet ski for Christmas. 4.  American college lads have all the subtlety and stealth of an earthquake when it comes to picking up girls. 5.  Mexicans are generally polite, helpful and have a good sense of humour. However, customs officers are complete wankers. 6.  Hell is being stuck on a boat in a rough sea, throwing your ring up over the side and having your buddy laugh and take photos... 7.  ... or a nine hour flight with Airtours in 'scum-bag' class, the only film being shown is "The Little Vampire". 8.  Doing back flips off the ceiling rails in a bus is fun, but hurts your shoulders. 9.  Hot pants are a privilege, not a right. 10.  Don't trust dolphins.  They tell you what you want to hear, get you to caress their blowhole and you never hear from them again.

       I've just driven Custard out to the Splash in the KITT mobile.  Decided to have a night in tonight.  As we were heading up I got pulled over by the cops. The conversation went like this:  Me (to Custard): "What the fuck? I wasn't speeding.. probably thinks I’ve stolen the fucker.." (Policeman walks over) Policeman: "Good evening Sir. Are you aware you've been driving with your rear fog lights on?" Me: "No, sorry officer. I've only just bought this car and I’m still getting used to it" Policeman: "Best excuse I’ve heard tonight." (I find the lights and flick them off. Cop looks over my car and then at Custard and me. Driving at night with the roof off. I can see the cogs grinding.) Policeman: "Nice car. Honda, isn't it?" Me: "Yes Officer" Policeman: "Keep it waxed, don't you?" Me: "Yes, Officer" Policeman: "Goes fast, does it?" Me: "I wouldn't know Officer. I haven't taken it to France yet" (Custard starts giggling) Policeman: "Yes...well.. drive safely" Me: "Of course, Officer."

       It's summertime in Jersey, and the streets are awash in talent.  Maybe it's because i'm single again, but everywhere I look there are gorgeous women.  Walking down Bath Street in the lunch hour turned into a Miss World Beauty Pagent.  Brickies and plumbers in vans mowing down grannies because they are rubber-necking and not paying attention to driving.    A stunning brunette was walking past me, and she had a arse like two midgets on a fucking trampoline.  Before I knew it, I was on autopilot and on a direct course into a perfumerie. Luckily I snapped out of it before with only seconds to spare.  The problem is, this is Jersey.  Home of some of the most egotistical, gold-digging, drama queens this side of a Prada convention.  What every man wants is the perfect combination of a woman with a great body and a IQ over 14. So I have devised these simple tests to make sure that your potential girlfriend isn't too Jersey for you:    When she is asleep, insert a small tyre pressure gauge into her ear. If it reads over 20psi, get the fuck out.   Buy a normal, medium sized bucket from a DIY store. In freezer marker, write "Versace" down one side. Leave it near the hat stand. If she wears it, get the fuck out.   Glue a pound coin to her driveway.  Retire to a safe distance.  If she spends over 20 seconds attemping to remove it, or employes the use of any kind of crowbar, get the fuck out.   Over three flicks of her hair a minute, get the fuck out.   Check her CD collection. Anything related to Pop Idol, get the fuck out.  It's not worth the risk.

       I have done nothing this weekend except ride around and look cool in my new car.  Here's a picture of one very similar:     It's a Honda CRX (know in the USA as a Honda Del Sol)  I am totally smitten with it.. drives like a dream, smooth with plenty of power and looks fantastic. I loved my Mini to bits, but this thing rocks. The gearbox is smoother than a snake covered in vaseline riding a water slide.

       Toaster, Its happened to me plenty of times - and I am the best of us!  Just remember that women are like Jersey Bus companies. You think your getting a decent ride whilst on it but afterwards you feel ripped off and unsatisfied. Everyone says how great it is you’re on it until its gone... There may be plenty of other ones around but everyone will slag you down if you try riding a new one when the old still has the contract. and finally the ride wont take you where you want to go and even if it does, not frequent enough.  Oh and be careful of the bubble gum on the seat.

       Toaster mate, it has happened to the best of us.  You know, it seems harder and harder in these dark times to find the true object of our hearts desire, and when we think we have, it is lost or taken away from us for reasons known not to ourselves! Perhaps then, these grief and demoralising occurenses are tests from a higher (or lower) power? If so then certain questions must be answered, such as ' Why did this have to happen to me!' or ' 42 is the answer, but what was the question?' It is important then, to remenber that we are merely human and therefore are subject to the hurting ways of unwanted change in our lives, whether we had influence over them or not.   Through life we will experience heart breaks and suffer from the effects of gross body fat, our very souls are nibbled at by the cruel and punishing earth on which we inhabit. The spirits within call to us to strengthen ourselves against these attacks, and thus fuel the desire to be other than that which we are. We are left wanting to be someone or somewhere else, maybe even in a different time.  It is imperetive then that we must do our best to suffer no longer from the truely evil malevolence which plagues our lives every day. It must then be urged that we all go out into the streets and buy guns, knives, flash bang grenades, toilet paper, rubber chickens inside big plastic bowls, stress squeesers, ping pong balls, or any other items which will make us feel protected against this harsh reality we call life....................... Well thats it for todays show, tomorrow we will be discussing gay narcoleptic migets and their strange relationships with their dogs. Till next time I thank you and GOOD BYE.................(music fades in).............ogy ogy ogy ogy..........clap clap clap.....Baity, Baity, Baity........clap clap clap........fight fight fight fight.............clap clap......ogy ogy ogy.......clap clap.........(fade to black).

       Ok, maybe a explanation is in order for that last post.  My girlfriend and I split up.  We hadn't been seeing each other long, about two months.. but I was really happy with the time we spent together and I am gutted now it's over.  I have used this site for funny jpg's and jokes but it was originally intented as a kind of 'online journal'. I don't know who would care to read about the events in my life (apart from the people that know me maybe) but people have been reading, which is kinda cool.  The older I get (and hopefully a little bit wiser too) the more I believe that people come into your life and leave for a reason.  You can't hold too tight to somebody or something, because it's never really yours. You're born alone and you will die alone, it's sad but true.  Maybe I worried too much about the future and didn't enjoy the present moment as much as I could have.  Thanks to Baity & Custard for being great buddies and getting me drunk at the weekend to drown my sorrows.  I'm going to sign off now, before this sounds anymore like Jerry Springer's Final Thought.

       You sick puppies.. I'm not mention any names but this is a example of the kind of person that reads my site:     I've set myself up another box now, so I can play around with linux without the fear of loosing my entire rig if I accidently shaft my hard disk. Queeg is a Pentium 2 400mhz, with 256mb, made completely out of old parts I had lying around. A couple of ethernet cards and a hard disk later, she's up and running. Queeg is getting my old IBM 8gb disk and a shiny, spanky new Western Digital 80gb is now in Holly. It freaks me out though as it's TOTALLY QUIET. It's a ninja hard disk.  I did my reiki master teacher attunement at the weekend, and a Native American workshop, where i met my 'spirit guide' totem animal. It happened to be a wolf, which is a bit of a cliche as they always seem to be a wolf, but I went with it.  I did nearly burst out laughing at one point during the meditation, where the tape says... "See yourself and your totem animal flying through space... " I then look left and see wolfy floating on his back, paws crossed against his chest. What a show-off. There's me trying to get to grips with astral projection and my spirit guide is performing a circus act.   Oh my god, there's a group of German people having group sex on Sky one.... eugh.. :-[

       This was a REAL Rainbow episode...   Almost too ridiculous to believe... These are taken from original Rainbow scripts and there's no way these could have been done by accident. Innuendo all the way....   The sketch opens with Zippy peeling a banana.....    Zippy: "One skin, two skin, three skin, four "  George: "Zippy, where is Bungle?"  Zippy: "I think Geoffrey is trying to get him up"    We see a view of the door and hear Bungle moaning from behind it.   Bungle: "Geoffrey, I can't get it in"  Geoffrey: "You managed it last night"  Bungle: "I know, lets try it round the Otherway. Oooh, I've got it in"   Bungle and Geoffrey enter the studio with Bungle carrying a hammer and peg kit.  Bungle: "Would you stick this on the shelf, George"  George: "I can't reach, you'll have to stick it up yourself, Bungle."  Geoffrey (to camera) "Hello everyone, today we are talking about playing"  Bungle: "Playing with each other, Geoffrey?"  Geoffrey: "Yes Bungle, do you have a special friend that you like to play with?"  George: "Yesterday we played with each other's balls. Are we going to play with our friend's balls today?"  Bungle: "Yes, and we can play with our twangers as well."  Geoffrey (to camera) "Have you seen Bungles twanger?"  Zippy: "Oh I have, I showed him how to pluck with it."  Bungle: "It's my plucking instrument."    Geoffrey asks the audience if they can pluck like Bungle Zippy: "I can, I'm the best plucker here."  George: "And I'm good at banging. My peg's hard isn't it Zippy?  Zippy: "Well of course it is, Your peg wouldn't go in if it was soft."  Geoffrey: "Let's get back to Bungle's twanger."  Bungle (excited) "Oooooh Geoffrey, we could all play with our twangers couldn't we? Let's play the plucking song. Rod and Roger can get their instruments out and Jane has got two lovely Maracas."   Singers Rod, Freddy and Jane enter.    Freddy: "We could hear you all banging away"  Rod: " Banging can be fun."  Jane: "Ooooh yes, and I was banging away all last night with Rod and Freddy."  Freddy ( looking sad ) "Yes, but it broke my plucking instrument."  Rod ( to Jane ) "Do you want to blow on my pipe while I'm twanging away?"  Jane: "Oh no, I was banging away with Freddy last night. But would you like to play with my maracas?  Zippy: "No, let's just pluck away with our twangers."  George: "Yes, it doesn't matter what size our twanger is."  Zippy: "I've got a big red one."  George: "I've only got a tiny twanger. But it works well and I like to play with it."  Geoffrey (to viewers) "Well, have you got your twangers out? And remember, you can bang your balls at the same time. If you haven't got any, ask a friend if you can play with his. Now, let's all play the plucking song."   Everyone in studio: "Pluck, pluck, pluck along, we're going to pluck all day."

       Eugh. I just ate half a tube of Pringles and they realised that they went off in March. Of 2001. Bleugh.  Quiet weekend for me, went bowling with the lads on Friday night. Baity launched the ball about 10 foot up in the air by accident, and it landed in the next lane, almost going straight through the floor. The manager gave us a disapproving look but didn't say anything. I was going to head into town afterwards but the atmosphere there was crap, everyone seemed in a really shitty mood and gagging for a fight.   One girl I used to work with was in the taxi queue at the same time as me, and the bloke behind me put his burger carton into the bin and returned to his place. She shouted at him that he was pushing in, calling him every name under the sun. She hadn't noticed me and I said.. "Hey, it's me... Adam" and she said "Uhh, Adam.. hi" I motioned to the poor sod she was screaming at, "This guy wasn't pushing in.. he was just put his rubbish in the bin" and she said "Well FUCK YOU ADAM!" Charming.. it's amazing what alcohol does to some people. I really am going off town now. I'd much rather stay in with a bottle of wine and a DVD, or go out for a nice meal instead. Dear lord, I am getting old...  I even did some gardening today, how scary is that? I'm turning part of the garden into a Japanese theme, with a Buddha and a water feature. It'll be great for chilling out and meditating under our big apple tree.  Crap link of the day -  urlLink see how fast you can type.

       Ugh.. I did some work on Custard's PC last night and he took me out to Follies afterwards.  It was a wierd night, it started off with about 3 blokes to every girly, but improved slightly as the night went on. Thankfully I left before he the DJ stuck the Outhere Brothers on. I got back home and had the drunken muchies really bad, the only thing I could find in the fridge was this awful chorizo sausage thing, bleugh.. Respect to Custard, not only is now drinking Tequila & Lemonade, he also parties hard these days.. always staying out till 2. Perhaps i'm losing my edge ?  Our Irish lass Tanya sent in this oldie but goodie..   How To Keep A Healthy Level Of Insanity     1. At lunch time, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars. See if they slow down.  2. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that.  4. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it "In Tray"  5. Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.  6. In the memo field of all your checks, write "for sexual favors".  7. Finish all your sentences with "in accordance with the prophecy."  8. Don't use any punctuation marks. 9. As often as possible, skip rather than walk.  10. Ask people what sex they are. Laugh hysterically after they answer.  11. Specify that your drive-through order is "to go".  12. Sing along at the opera.  13. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don't rhyme.  14. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play a tape of jungle sounds all day.  15. Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party because you're not in the mood. 16. Have your coworkers address you by your wrestling name, Rock Hard Kim.  17. When the money comes out the ATM, scream "I won!", "I won!" "3rd time this week!!!!!" 18. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot,yelling "run for your lives, they're loose!!"  19. Tell your children over dinner. "due to the economy, we are going to have to let one of you go."

       I was supposed to upload the Summer Ball pictures tonight but didn't have time, i'll do it tomorrow.  I have been out playing football in People's Park with 'Dougal' and a few other mates.  We teamed up against some German lads and gave them a damn good thrashing.  I now hurt in about five different places and am hitting the space bar with my one working thumb. However one of them did have a very fit girlfriend, I had hoped she would rush to my aid when I was fouled but she just stood there and took pictures with her digital camera. Bugger.  Here's today's collection of crap I have found, bobbing up and down in the filthy brine of cyberspace:                  Also, if you have a extremely childish sense of humor like me.. turn up your speakers and visit  urlLink http://www.introducingmonday.co.uk/

       A bloke on his way home from work in Leeds comes to a dead halt in traffic on Kirkstall Road, and thinks to himself : "Wow, this traffic seems worse than usual."  He notices a police officer walking back and forth between the lines of cars so he rolls down his window and asks: "Officer, what's the hold up?"  The officer replies: "It's a Man United fan - he's so depressed about losing the premiership to Arsenal, being knocked out of Europe and the prospect of winning f**k all after gobbing off all season, he's threatening to douse himself in petrol and set himself on fire.  He says his family hates him, his mates are all laughing at him and he has never had a job, so I'm walking around taking a collection for him."  "Oh really?" says the chap "How much have you collected so far?".  "Only about 1/2 a litre, " replied the policeman, "But a lot of people are still siphoning ."

       Ok, time to get on my soapbox. Stand back a bit, just to be safe.  A bit further. Ok.  Big Brother. Just fucking stop it! Nobody cares anymore! I pray for a cloud of cat-shit to rain down those idiots. I have watched about ten minutes in total of this series, and seven minutes of that consisted of a fat bloke reading a copy of Vogue.   That blonde one, Jade I think her name is.. she's about as bright as a set of fairy lights from Woolies.   The only possible way they could claw it back, is if you could call in and administer electric shock therapy by telephone to the housemates. Or they released a set of rabid, starving, pit bulls into the house, on the hour, for the next week. Years of technological advancement in television should not culminate in a blonde airhead insisting that Sherlock Holmes is a real person.

        EVER WONDER   Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin?  Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?  Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"?  Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?  Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?  Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"?  Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?  Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?  Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?  Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?  When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?  Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes?  Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?  You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff?  Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?  Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together?  If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?  If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?      In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.  On a Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping. (and that's the only time I have to work on my hair).  On a bag of Fritos: ..You could be a winner! No purchase necessary.Details inside. (the shoplifter special)?  On some Swanson frozen dinners: "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's "just" a suggestion).  On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): "Do not turn upside down." (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!  On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:"Product will be hot after heating." (...and you thought????...)  On packaging for a Rowenta iron: "Do not iron clothes on body." (but wouldn't this save me more time)?  On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:"Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication." (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.)  On Nytol Sleep Aid: "Warning: May cause drowsiness." (and...I'm taking this because???....)  On most brands of Christmas lights: "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what)?  On a Japanese food processor: "Not to be used for the other use." (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)  On Sunsbury's peanuts: "Warning: contains nuts." (talk about a news flash)  On an American Airlines packet of nuts: "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts."( Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)  On a child's superman costume: "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly." (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)

        Your daily dose of Zen ...   1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me the hell alone.  2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a leaky tyre.  3. It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal your neighbour's newspaper, that's the time to do it.  4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you aren't getting any.  5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.  6. No one is listening until you fart.  7. Always remember you're unique. Just like everyone else.  8. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.  9. It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others.  10. It is far more impressive when others discover your good qualities without your help.  11. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments  12. Before you criticise someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticise them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.  13. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.  14. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat & drink beer all day.  15. If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.  16. Don't squat with your spurs on.  17. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.  18. If you drink, don't park; accidents cause people  19. Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.  20. Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.  21. Good judgement comes from bad experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgement.  22. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket.  23. Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome of a rain dance.  24. A closed mouth gathers no foot.  25. Duct tape is like the force. It has a light side & a dark side, and it holds the universe together.  26. There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.  27. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is moving.  28. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.  29. Never miss a good chance to shut up.  30. We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse

       Overseas correspondant, Daniel "Pinky" Rihoy here.......  Well well well the Argie Bargies on their way home too thats such a shame..... NOT!!!!!!!  Although to be honest i guess is its a shame in a way that France and Argentina have gone out as both are great footballing nations. Except this time round the majority of the French players were too old and too slow, and as for the Argies they just assumed they were gonna steam role the competition (what with being most peoples fav/tip to win as well) but they forgot one simple rule...... THIS IS THE WORLD CUP YOU PRATS!!!! THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN EASY GAME. These are the best footballing countries in the world and no one comes just to make up the numbers so you cant expect just to whip everyone.   HAHA what makes it even sweeter tho is the comments made my an Argentinian player before the game against Sweden.... he said that they would beat sweden and then hammer England when they played them in the later rounds....... yeah on a playstation game maybe.

       Damn, Jersey needs some new nightclubs. Right now. I'm not talking about, 'paint-job, new sofa's, guest DJ nobody has ever heard of... that'll do it' I mean something brand spanking new, utterly cool and unlike the the normal places we end up.  I think the new Friday's is a step in the right direction, but it's not a club is it? Some of the best nights out i've ever had were at La Cala. Nice big bar area, decent music, good interior.. why don't they rebuild the bastard and we'll all be happy.   I am SO bored of Follies now.   GAP is laughable, I went there on Friday night at about 1am, and the place was like a fucking Butlins holiday camp in January. 20 blokes and one very drunk girl, shit music and Smashy and Nicey on the decks. Dear lord. It's not been that same since that Harry Potter incident anyway.  I like Madison's but never really make the effort to work out what's on when, and I heard it's getting turned into a giant filing cabinet for some bank now anyway.  Of course there's always the Splash.. but I could write down the playlist on a saturday night by heart... and downstairs is like a freaking youth club.  Young alcoholics of Jersey unite, we demand new clubs!

       Ode to a Demigod,  A Girls Prayer Lord Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray for a man, who's not a creep, One who's handsome, smart and strong, One who's willy's thick and long. One who thinks before he speaks, When promises to call, he won't wait weeks. I pray that he is gainfully employed, And when I spend his cash, wont be annoyed. Pulls out my chair and opens my door, Massages my back and begs to do more. Oh! send me a man who will make love to my mind, Knows just what to say, when I ask "How big's my behind?" One who'll make love till my body's a twitchin, In the hall, the loo, the garden and kitchen! I pray that this man will love me no end, And never attempts to sh@g my best friend. And as I kneel and pray by my bed, I look at the w@nker you sent me instead. Amen.  Custards Prayer: Lord I pray for a lady with big t!ts. Amen

       I really hate miserable b@stard Boyfriends who wont let their girlfriends enjoy themselves on their birthday!!!  I mean, I get asked if I want to have a threesome on Friday night, Of course I say "Yes and if your boyfriend runs out of steam I can push his arse for him for a bit."  I'm even polite enough to ask him if he wants front or back, as she wont have both of us behind ;-)  But no.  He just mumbles something about if she brings me home too, that he is leaving and that's the end of their relationship.  Not one to break up a couple, I decided its time to leave, She knows my number and when she leaves the most boring Irish bloke I ever met, she will contact me!…  My weekend brightened when four, Yes Four! Girls invited me out to the School girl fancy dress party… That's more girls than ever invited you out at once Custard! That should be fun!  Humm, Me, with my reputation? At Girls collage sixth form leaving do, with a bouncy castle?

       I'm a demi-god according to that quiz.... spookily correct! :-)  I went to see The Time Machine tonight with Baity & Custard. Baity hated it, even though it had legions of demonic hordes in it, must be his hay fever. I thought it rocked. Samatha Mumba... yum.  Had a nice BBQ on sunday, me and a friend of Scott's bought little water pistols for the kids... and then busted out of £25 super soaker, causing chaos in the bouncy castle and over the sausages.  I can't see what all the fuss is over the Queen's Jubilee.  Stupid amounts of people standing around the capital, just gagging for the old girl to stick her head out of her balcony.  So she comes out, with a not-so-bright-slightly-pissed-off experession on her face, waves a couple of times and the crowd go FUCKING WILD!  What's the point? She should at least have done a strip-tease, or some cabaret or something.  Prince Philip is a god though.  Here are some of his pearls of wisdom:  (On receiving a gift from a Kenyan native woman) "You are a woman aren't you?.." (To a Cayman Islander) "Aren't most of you descended from pirates?.." (To a British ex-pat in Hungary) "You can't have been here that long, you haven't got a pot-belly yet.." (To a Scottish driving instructor) "How do you keep the natives from being inebriated long enough to pass their test?.." (To a blind woman with a guide dog) "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?" (To British students in China, during the 1986 state visit) "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."    Wit sharper than a pimp's suit - HRH Prince Philip.

       Monday morning and my neck is still in pain from sleeping on Simons sofa, Like my ex, its two sizes too small to fit me all in.  Aha Saturday Night at the Splash. I got six drinks poured over me and a kick in the bollocks and all I got that night was a snog? It would have been less painful to wonder round asking women for a shag. Not that I have tried that before. Yet. The things you do for a friend.  I hope you remember that Baity, the next time I ask if I can watch…

       Hello all, just thought I'd make a quick post because I am currently bored stiff!!! I had my belated 21st birthday coach party last night and it was a blinder hehe, well it was until we got to Tam's Bar down St.Brelades bay, where they subsiquently gave me the birthday bumps.....twenty one times into the bloody sea!!  We all got dropped off at the Splash (best club in the island), by which time I was nearly dry, and that was sound too. All in all I had a totally good time, and I even met up with my X, I still reallly like her but we have to see what goes. Well I am gunna go catch a flick later so I'm off.....Baity signing off...

       Toaster's rules for life;  #1 - The grass is always greener on the other side.  If you're single, you want a girly. If you're with somebody, you want to be single again. I say live for the moment. Get crazy. Fornicate in the streets and dance like everyone's watching. Love like you've been hurt all the time and don't give a shit anymore. Anything to escape a mundane day to day existence. If you're doing something that's embarassing and your feeling nuts, then you're going to be smiling about it later.   Ok, that's enough bollocks for one post..  I was sent this ages ago and just found it again...  urlLink Pooh Bear goes ape shit!

       Hello all, I'll get straight to the point, I am now single ( says with a mournful expression ). Thats right, after ten of the best months of my life, me and my girlfriend have split! To be honest I don't know how I feel, what to do, what to say.....I'm gutted ( bottom lip starting to quiver ). It's like a great big whole has opened up under my feet. The only thing getting me through this is my mates such as Custard and Toaster, it really does help. I don't know how things will turn out, in fact I can't focus on tomorrow at the moment! All one can do is grin and bare it and take it like a responsible person I guess. Cheers to my mates, and a big 'FUCK YOU' to whomever, or what ever, wrote this event into my fateful destiny. I know it will work out one way or another, just got to play it out. Sorry for being totally depressing...Baity signing off...

       My friend Damien has set up a local website for single people,  urlLink http://www.dateinjersey.com.  It's totally free, so if you're single and in Jersey why not join up. Come to think of it, if you're single, female, cute, intelligent why don't you  urlLink e-mail me  as well?  A nice, relaxing sunny day in the back garden... I came in and made a drink, flipping across the channels and Big Brother was on. For ten minutes the camera showed Jade, sitting down in the garden, covered by a quilt, with a not-so-bright expression on her face. It occured to me that perhaps 25 thousand people were sitting at home, covered in a quilt, watching Jade doing the exact same thing. God bless technology.

       Damn, looks like my trusty UNIX server hidden away deep in the bowels of a forgotten comms room has been... unforgotten. I'll give it a few days to see if the site comes back up, and if not i'll move all the images to another place. So please bare with me while you get lots of little red crosses where a picture should be.  Went out last night with Custard, Baity, Baity's lady and a few peeps from work.. all good fun. I ended up in Follies but I was pretty slaughtered. I even knocked somebody else's Southern Comfort over myself in a rather embarassing  Not-I-haven't-pissed-myself-it's-a-spilt-drink  kind of way, so I decided to make like a tree at about 12:30.  I don't mind though as I'm not headed out much these days. I'm teaching Reiki this weekend so no booze for me tomorrow night.  Maybe I should enter this  urlLink blog  competition...*ponder*...   Oh and a special mention to "Monkey Boy" Parker... who will be leaving my place of work. Remember folks, it's always the quiet ones you should watch out for.

       The Toaster Files crew were laying low this weekend. Afraid of revenge attacks by lardy Hector's waitresses and the people that look after the Libby Square fountain, we lay dormant in our underground missile silo somewhere in a field in St Clement's. I don't want to speak too soon, but it looks like our few weeks of summer might just be starting. Myself, Grist, Dougal and Dougal's lady met for a top-level executive lunch at a secret location (Pizza Express... damn!) to drink Peroni and survey the beauty of Jersey's finest female talent.    Jersey Girls, a poem by Toaster.   Your skirts are short, just like your temper. You crashed daddie's Merc, but it was just a fender-bender.  You can smell a fifty note from a four mile radius, But in that denim catsuit you're looking truly dangerous.  You don't know the capital of Brazil, But if you tickle the right spot - my god can you squeal.  Drawn to a camera like a moth to a flame, Since we had sex on the steam clock i've just not been the same...

       The pictures from last weekend  urlLink are here...   Also i've put a random quote on the page now.. enjoy :)   How to be offensive at a funeral:   Tell the widow that the deceased's last wish was that she make love with you.  Tell the undertaker that he can't close the coffin until you find your contact lens.  Punch the body and tell people that he hit you first.  Tell the widow that you're the deceasd's gay lover.  Ask someone to take a snapshot of you shaking hands with the deceased.  At the cemetery, play taps on a kazoo.  Walk around telling people that you've seen the will and they're not in it.  Ask the widow to give you a kiss.  Drive behind the widow's limo and keep honking your horn.  Tell the undertaker that your dog just died and ask if he can sneak him into the coffin.  Put a hard-boiled egg in the mouth of the deceased.  Slip a whoopee cushion under the widow.  Leave some phony dog poop on top of the deceased.  Tell the widow that you have to leave early and ask if the will can be read before the funeral is over.  Urge the widow to give the deceased's wooden leg to someone poor who can't afford firewood.  Walk around telling people that the deceased didn't like them.  Use the deceased's tongue to lick a stamp.  Ask the widow for money which the deceased owes you.  Take up a collection to pay off the deceased' gambling debts.  Ask the widow if you can have the body to practice tattooing on.  Put crazy Glue on the deceased's lips just before the widow's last kiss.  Show up at the funeral services in a clown suit.  If the widow cries, blow a trumpet every time she wipes her nose.  When no-one's looking, slip plastic vampire-teeth into the deceased's mouth.  Toss a handful of cooked rice on the deceased and scream "MAGGOTS! MAGGOTS!" and pretend to faint.  At the cemetary take bets on how long it takes a body to decompose.  Goose the widow as she bends over to throw dirt on the coffin.  Circulate a petition to have the body stuffed instead of buried.  Tell everyone you're from the IRS and you're confiscating the coffin for back-taxes.  Promise the minister a hundred dollars if he doesn't keep a straight face while praising the deceased.

       WHAT A WEEKEND!!!  Greetings faithful readers, this summary of the seventy two hours that my weekend was comprised of is a tale of booze, laughter, torment, games, girls, whore-bag waitresses and well…more booze! So sit back and read in intrigue at life in the shoes of the Toaster Squad.  Picture any normal Friday in Jersey, that’s right, rain falling in complete supremacy, the sun just a meagre forty amp bulb behind dark clouds. All the summer totty has retreated back to their secret location beauty holes, leaving town looking as ugly as Dougal’s arse (yet to come)!   Well, all that crap still couldn’t stop me from being on top of the world, for I am now twenty one and I feel good…but still evil (says with a hell fire glaze in his eyes). I had a superb party at the ‘Monterey Hotel’ to whom I give the biggest thanks due to their excellent service and first-rate food, and alcohol. Also a big ‘up ya’ the the Toaster crew who also made it a great night to remember…videos to follow soon hopefully.  The real party though started on Friday at about half past six when Custard and I met Toaster, Dougal, Bret (Dougal’s brother), Phil, Donna and Crissie at the Wine Bar. We started on the drinks straight away and inhibitions were soon fading away. The lads (God/Satan, which ever you prefer, bless their souls) had a big surprise birthday present for me, can u guess what? … That’s right, I received my official ‘Toaster Files’ T-shirt!!!!!!!!!  After the Wine Bar we headed to Bella Pasta for some food and it was quite good. Next we went to my cousin’s birthday party, which was a great, crack, lots of punk music and sound people. Toaster couldn’t deal with all the excitement and left along with Dougal, Donna and Crissie, oh and Bret. Later in the night Custard and myself left the party and met up with everyone else in the Zebra Square. Now for those of you that havnt yet been to Zebra Square, let me give you a little insight… This place is filled with townies (puh), and the walls are covered in furry zebra style stuff and well…FUCK THAT!!! I went home.  Saturday morning I woke up with a mild headache and went to a private landscaping job which I’m doing for ‘Zippy Alex’s’ dad, at eight in the morning!!! The rest of the day went ok, but the oncoming night was even better hehe. Toaster, Custard, Speedy, Grist, Mash-Boy, Dougal, Bret, Ian, and of course me met up at the Post Horn pub for a few beers, which soon turned into a drinking game called ‘Chicken’ where beer was exchanged for tequila, oh dear! Subsequently I lost four rounds and got quite pissed.  Next all of us decided to get some food so we went to ‘Hectors Fish and Chip Restaurant’ BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!  We were greeted by what I think was a waitress, whom protested against our entry for some totally unknown reason other than her attitude sucked. However also present was a nicer waitress who said we could sit down, “Hooray” I hear you cry…I think not! That whale-like waitress wasn’t finished with us yet!! … After moaning for about five minutes she decided to take to take our orders, which went about as well as the greeting. Half way through the ordering process she had another flip and ripped up our order and started again… FUCK YOU HECTORS!!!! I DON’T NEED YOUR SHIT OR YOUR SHIT FOOD!!!! To state the obvious, I walked out and met up with Grist and Toaster, whom had both had enough of the bitches whining five minute before me, and we went for a lovely Burger King.  To end the night out we all went to the SPLASH. It was just fucking superb!!! I met loads of old mates of both sexes and partied the night away, THANK YOU SPLASH.   After the Splash, we all waited for a coach back to town. Whilst we waited we had a strenuous session of fighting with each other (don’t ask). Once back in town we decided to throw Bret into Liberation Square pool and laughed as we realised he had his mobile phone in his pocket at the time!! HEHE!  Well that was it, a great couple of nights out with the lads, followed by a recuperative BBQ at my cousins on Sunday. The weekend don’t get much better than that…Baity signing off…

       My god.. what a weekend this has been. I had polo shirts printed up with the site on and our nicknames, and it seems to have activated some hidden party animal in each of us. Friday night was good fun, we started off at the Wine Bar, had some food at Bella Pasta and then went out to a private party near first tower. We were accompanied by two Toasterfilettes, Chrissie and Donna. Fantastic girls, really flirty and great fun. We stayed at the party for a bit then headed back to check out the new "GAP", Zebra Square. The place is a pimp heaven - walls covered in furry zebra print, and the staff wearing Randy "The Macho Man" Savage Zebra hats. I met a nice Irish lass and somehow convinced her that we should snog, so we are going at it and I bump into somebody. Brett, Dougal's brother, snogging the face off Irish girl's mate. Outstanding! 2-0 to the home team :)  I had the hangover from hell and just about recovered ready for a night at the Splash. We started at the Post Horn, having a few beers to grease the wheels. Sitting outside we played a drinking game I learnt in Australia - Chicken. The noise of about eight largered up lads screaming  "BUCKEEEEEEEEEEYE!"  at the top of their voices echoed around St Helier, a mating call to attract female talent. It was time to get some food and somebody suggested Hector's fish-n-chip place. We were greeted with almost blind hatred by the cholesterol fuelled waitress, who at first wouldn't let us in. She then told us to keep quiet (while we were taking a photo of us sitting at the table). It was like being back in school - fuck that, I’m not having a restaurant treat me like they are doing me a favour by serving me. Hector's, you can kiss my ass. We went to Burger King instead and had some good, old-fashioned western consumerism instead.   Anyway, we head out to the Splash and the place is MOBBED. There's a fancy-dress party up there, and in front of me in the queue is Elvis Presley talking to Osama Bin Laden. More Splash craziness ensues, and we roll out at 2am to find the coaches are packed. So as we wait for the next one we have a bit of 'male-bonding' on the sand, wrestling and pile-on's. Very immature but great fun, and much to the delight of the Splashers when we brown-eye'd the coach. Eventually we get a ride back into town, and decide to throw Brett into Liberation Square fountain. The poor git was soaked, as was his nice Ericsson phone.   All in all, a magic weekend. The pictures are going to be up very soon.  Now, where'd I leave my Alka-Selzter...

       Twenty facts that are almost all not true about Baity  1) Baity likes to cover himself in Dutch edam cheese and dive into the cool blue waters off the west coast of the island. 2) He once accidentally sliced off his right nipple whilst shaving his chest and now has a false removable nipple he keeps in a glass jar whilst he sleeps. 3) Baity managed to drink forty-eight litres of strawberry flavoured milkshake in just under six hours because he "was thirsty" 4) He was raised by a pack of Saint Ouen's Boars, until found by the caring mallet family in a field-side ditch 5) Before puberty, Baity sang the theme song "I'm walking in the air" for the animated Christmas film, The Snowman. 6) When he was seven, his toenails reached a length of three meters and curled under his feet.  Specially constructed shoes had to be worn. 7) Baity is unable to see a missing number in a consecutive sequence 9) Baity cannot pronounce the words Woman, Lady or Girl. Due to continuous contact with custard, he pronounces these words as Prey, Dinner and Nice respectivly. 10) Baity has succeeded in projectile vomiting over the distance of two football pitches. 11) If he eats peanut, or its extracts, Baitys left arm withers to the size of a three-year-olds. 12) His favourite position is the lotus position. 13) Baity likes to show off his toned muscular and tanned physique in front of girls during their GCSE exam breaks. 14) Baity was in 'Nam and fought with the 106ers before the Sargent realised that he was under age and sent him home. 15) His diet between the ages of 13 and 15 consisted of nothing other than Jaffa cakes and other peoples sweat. 16) Baity once managed a stretch of 96 hours without consuming five units of alcohol. 17) Margarine frightens him, although Lard, strangely, excites him in an erotic way. 18) Five units of alcohol will make Baity vomit in the projectile variety 19) Baity attained a doctorate in quantum mechanics during his A-levels. 20) He only professed his heterosexuality on his nineteenth birthday. To great shock to his friends and family

       Baity through time - a story in pictures:                   Three interesting facts I know about John: 1) He once caught his bollocks in his flies and was taken to hospital to have his joy department untangled from the zip. 2) When he was six his cousins dressed him up in a negligee and make-up. 3) He's a top mate and going to have an awesome birthday this weekend. :)

          Hello all, it's been a while since I had anything to say or pictures to post, I have just had my PC rebuilt by Toaster.  "So what has that lazy head-banging son of a bitch been up to then!" ...Well just that really, I have been spending allot of time up at the Splash (best club in the island, and I will make anyone who disagrees hurt real bad). Custard and myself went up this Saturday gone with a few mates and proceeded to get very, very pissed! I even managed to knock someone out cold with my thick skull (by accident of course, don't want a lawsuit). All in all it was a sound night except for the fact that I missed a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently away in Belize (that’s South America) for three weeks, and that really sucked! Guess that’s the price you pay for listening to 'Satan’s Music'.  Like I said my girlfriend is away at the moment for three weeks and I really am missing her. The funny thing is that I am dealing with not seeing her for three weeks, it's just the fact that I can't even contact her. It really is amazing how much this sort of separation makes you realise just how important a special person is to you! Whilst the body can cope without any contact for such a period of time, my mind yearns to be able to simply talk to her. What can I say.... It’s the simple things that we take for granted that we really miss. Oh well, she'll be home in twelve days now so I will deal with it. Oh by the way...  HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY TO ME!  That’s right, its my 21st birthday today and I am going to get pissed at the Splash this Saturday, and if any readers of the Toaster Files are up there then feel free to buy me a drink hehe. Well there may be some photos kicking about soon so keep your eyes open. Baity signing off...............................................................

         My computer totally hates me!       About a month ago, I got a new computer here at my office in Jersey, and, boy, does that thing have it in for me! I am not kidding. When it sees me coming, I swear, it must be all like, "Oh, goody, here comes Denise... time to go on the fritz!" I mean, my computer seriously hates me!   Now, I'm not exactly a computer person. I've never been what you'd call "user-friendly" or anything. But, for the life of me, I can't think of what I did to make my computer despise me so much! Whoever set it up, instead of putting in anti-virus software, must have accidentally put in Anti-Denise software!   I'm pretty sure “The Purchase Orders Dept” bought it used, which would explain why it's so darn screwy. Whenever I try to type in user information for a new call, the keys always get stuck. And whenever I try to get archive info for a current call, it totally doesn't want to let me into the program! I'll be waiting and waiting for, like, two minutes while it groans and grinds before, finally, the screen comes up. I'll be like, "Well, it's about time! What were you doing, surfing the Internet?"   And then there are the times when I'll want to print out an email from a user, and it simply won't do it for me. I'll be like, "Come onnnnnn! Are you trying to give me even more curly hair than already have?" I am telling you, if there's a meaner computer out there in the world, I haven't met it yet!   Yup, that darn computer of mine is having a great big laugh at poor Denise's expense. Lots of times, I'll be online, e-mailing a friend or checking out the Dancing Hamsters if I need a pick-me-up, and the screen will just completely freeze. I had no idea computers could have "one of those days," but go figure! There's nothing I can do but unplug the thing, plug it back in, and start all over again.   Don't get me wrong; it's nice to have a new computer. But sometimes I think I'd rather go back to my sweet old little one than spend all day fighting with Mr. Moody here.     God I hate that bitch!         Jesus Christ. Where should I start with this ignorant cow?   Actually, let's start with me. I am a brand-new, state-of-the-art Dell Dimension 4100, although, if all you had to go by was Denise, you'd think my name was "Tweety Bird Sticker Receptacle." She's got me faggoted up like a 10-year-old girl's notebook.   Never mind that purchase orders screwed up and bought this colossal ditz of a helpdesk operator more computer than she could ever possibly need for logging a call. (As if 40 unused gigs of hard drive are necessary to a reminder that a call is still open from the 11th.) I'm powerful enough to monitor a cooling tower, but that's not even what I'm bitching about. I'd rather be owned by some acne-scarred teenage girl who only used me to write shitty poetry, so long as she actually read the manual that came with me. "Programmed in some anti-Denise software." Holy ****, I want to kill her.   I feature a one-Gigahertz Pentium III processor and 128 megabytes of RAM. And this broad is whining that I'm not fast enough. A fucking Lamborghini isn't fast enough if you don't know how to shift, brainiac. And, believe it or not, you actually have to exit a program when you're done with it. Not just close the window. You actually have to select "Close" from the File menu. Or, better yet, Alt-F4 on your keyboard. I'm not gonna take the fall just because you left RealPlayer, AOL Instant Messager, Microsoft Word, ACT! 2000, WinAmp, McAfee First Aid, and the sound- and video-card software all open, and you're trying to open Excel! All that stuff costs RAM, dumbass. Maybe if you'd check the system tray once a month. The precise reason I'm "groaning and grinding so much" is that your stupid catalog of open programs is so taxing to my RAM that it forces me to open virtual memory, which is gonna be slow as hell no matter what computer you're on.   And, hey, Denise, if you're having trouble with sticky keys, maybe you should think about not eating so goddamn many bags of crisps while you're at your desk. (This Einstein seems to think the area beneath my keys is a gateway to an interdimensional netherworld where crumbs are magically whisked away, never to be seen again.)   Oh, and technical wizards who roamed the Earth generations ago came up with a magic fix-all for a printer that doesn't work: Turn the fucking thing on. That cable connecting me to the printer isn't a friggin' power cable. You actually need actual electricity to actually flow into the actual printer for it to actually work.   Now, as for system freezes: Maybe if you didn't install that gay-ass shareware inspirational-saying screensaver, you wouldn't have had so many software conflicts. But, with the damage already done there, you could at least hit Control-Alt-Delete and click "End Task" to close down a frozen program. That's Control and Alt and Delete, all at the same time! Isn't that fascinating?   Oh, before I forget: If I do freeze up, my reset button is located in the front. Press it and... voila! Do not unplug me and then plug me back in. Do you have any clue how much that fucking pisses me off? (Why did I even bother asking you that? Of course you don't. You're Denise, the world's dumbest helpdesk tech.)   I don't even have time to go into this sad excuse for a computer user's misuse of the term "user-friendly." If there were a merciful God in Heaven, He would give me arms that I might strangle this bitch.

       Never, ever, go into Follies sober. I've never done it before, but I was supposed to meet a friend in there on Saturday night. I'd been working (sad, I know) and walked around about half one. There was about six lads in the Follies uniform (crap Ralph Lauren shirt, with spilt drink and diced carrot motif next to the little dude on the horse) who were rolling from one side of the club to the other. It was like something outta 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I slid up to the bar, trying to look drunk and like I wasn't alone waiting for somebody. Then I was spotted by a fifty-something Anne Robinson lookalike. She made her slippery way across the dancefloor towards me, licking her lips (I shit you not). I made a quick exit by ducking behind a depressed looking hen party and got the hell out of there...

       Two Scousers are riding a motorbike along the M62. They break down and start hitching a lift. A friendly trucker stops to see if he can help and the scousers ask him for a lift. He tells them that he has no room in the wagon as he is carrying 20,000 bowling balls but will take a look at the bike for them. He tries everything he knows but is nable to repair it.   Time is getting on now and he's late for his delivery so he tells the scousers he has to leave. The scousers put it to the driver that if they can manage to fit in the back with the 20,000 bowling balls, will he take them, so he agrees. They manage to squeeze themselves and their motorbike into the back of the wagon so the driver shuts the doors and gets off on his way.  By this time he is really late and so puts his foot down. Sure enough PC Plod of Greater Manchester Police pulls him up for speeding. The good officer asks the driver hat he is carrying to which he replies with sarcasm  "Scouse eggs". The policeman obviously doesn't believe this so wants to take a look. He opens the back door slowly, but quickly shuts and locks it back up. He rushes back to his cruiser and gets onto his radio and calls for immediate backup from as many officers as possible. The dispatcher asks what emergency he has that he requires so many officers.  "I've got a wagon with 20,000 Scouse eggs in it - 2 have already hatched and the fuckers have managed to nick a motorbike already!!"

       Well, I was somewhat inebriated, besides English is my second language, I am fluent in bullshit.  I donno why I got talked into hanging around in a hour long queue just for follies? I'm glad I had my MP3 player with me...  Its weird, If been through the Lib a couple of times recently and I havent seen many kids drunk on watered down shandy.  Maybe its because of the exams, but maybe because they have found somewhere else. Think I might have to go there this weekend, havent had sex in the square yet.

       Dude.. you just walked off from that? What WERE you thinking!?! You should have slipped her the tongue. :) I took the liberty of spell checking your post - you must have been off your face when you got back in.  We had a Wednesday night blow out as well.. went to watch the film in the park (with a few bottles of red) and then ended up in the Zebra.. it's getting better in there, not as many cheezy tunes and more fun than Follies... shame about the decor. I managed to scoop myself a Zebra square bandana after flirting with one of the bar staff. Rock on!  So Grist are you back down Libby Square this weekend, in your Slipknot hoodie and a bottle of Diamond White??

       What a very weird night. I spent my usual Wednesday night in my drunken mid-week relief stupor but at the end, after seeing two friends into Liberation Square, I set of for the fifteen-minute walk home when....  This gorgeous, sexy girl jumps up from a bench, my eyes, always looking for an opportunity to perv, scan across to her as she moves perpendicular to my path, noting that she is of legal age by a sufficient margin (hey it was the Lib). As she approaches to intersect me, I wonder, "is she asking for a light, shit, I don’t smoke!" but no!  Wonder of wonders, she asks me for a hug!!! "Do you mind if I give you a hug?" she enquires!!! Confused as to why, I agree and wrap my arms around this angel. After a brief tangle, we thank each other and part ways, me wondering why someone would ask this? Nay, Why people don’t ask this more often!!!  As I said, A weird night.

       Brett, AKA "HotLips" "Danger" and "Florence" has headed over to the UK to start a new life. We are drawing straws on how long he lasts, but he will be missed in the mean time. Especially by that old Thai lady he snogged in Zebra (love you long time)  Tonight we are heading Howard "Jurassic" Davis Park, and plans are afoot for the weekend - even though myself and poor Dougal will probably be working. However, the overtime cash will come in very handy for New Years eve - Toaster Files crew live and direct from Times Square, baby!  If you're not doing anything this Friday night - get your ass down to see the Dapper Crew at the Q Bar. It's r&b, hip-hop, raggae etc and a fantastic night. I maybe playing again as well, if you're lucky. :)  Here's some pictures from the last night we played..                           urlLink Watch the world's population change before your eyes...

       My hand tightened around the cold steel of my blaster pistol. The thick, acrid smoke around the landing bay clouded my vision, and my eyes tightened looking for movement in the haze. It was in there, I knew it was. I felt the drips of sweat running down my cheeks. I was going to have to move. I willed my body forward and ran towards the entrance of my craft. I heard the alien's squeal as it chased after me. Must go faster. Must go faster.  It was gaining on me, and I heard it leap at my back. The impact sent me crashing forward and it was face to face with me. My pistol skidded across the floor, well out of reach now.  It's sticky, hot breath  was choking me,  then it showed it's teeth, rows of razor sharp minature daggers. It's head cocked to the side and it said, "Adam... looks like we can't sign in. Any chance you could take a quick look?"  You SEE! I'm even dreaming of work!! I don't mind on this occasion because I was doing my Sigourney Weaver. But when i'm having a oil massage by Rachel Wiez it's going to be really off-putting. Bring on my freakin' holiday.

       Mr Bear and Mr Rabbit lived in the same forest, but they didn't like each other very much. One day, while walking through the woods they came across a golden frog.   They were amazed when the frog talked to them. The golden frog admitted that he didn't often meet anyone, but when he did, he always gave them six wishes, so he told them that they could have three wishes each.   Mr.Bear immediately wished that all the other bears in the forest were females. The frog granted his wish.   Mr Rabbit, after thinking for a while, wished for a crash helmet. One appeared immediately, and he placed it on his head. Mr.Bear was amazed at Mr Rabbits wish, but carried on with his second wish. He wished that all the bears in the neighbouring forests were females as well, and the frog granted his wish.    Mr Rabbit then wished for a motorcycle. It appeared before him and he climbed on board and started revving the engine.    Mr Bear could not believe it and complained that Mr Rabbit had wasted two wishes that he could have had for himself. Shaking his head, Mr Bear made his final wish, that all the other bears in the world were females as well, leaving him as the only male bear in the world. The frog replied that it had been done. They both turned to Mr Rabbit for his last wish.    Mr Rabbit revved the engine, thought for a second, then said, "I wish that Mr.Bear was gay!" and rode off as fast as he could.

       Sad, isn’t it. Someone willing to get into a fight all because you got your hands on their girlfriend to nudge a few knots with your knuckles - of the non-sexual kind. You try to help one friend and another gets something into their head and suddenly you have lost a different friend. And they never bother to ask the full story.  Oh well, whenever isn’t life interesting?

        How long can you hold a grudge for? (till it's a joke..)   I only ask due to my experience on Friday night. I was out on the town with my friend Frank, when we bumped in to an old acquaintance of mine. I was a bit drunk and tried to start a conversation with him. He started trash talking at me and telling me that me and my brother are slimy backstabbing scum. I was taken off guard by this as I thought we where friends! I asked him for an example as I could think of nothing I had wronged him by. He reminded me of a time 5 years ago when we had a small disagreement.  I was out on a work drinks night and the person in question had just started dating one of my work colleagues (but they had only been going out for like 5 days) We where sat in the cafe du Paris drinking and joking around when (I'm not sure how it occurred) I started giving the said girl a shoulder massage, nothing over the top just a joke around.. Well this guy found it very insulting and pulled me aside for a chat!!  He was all in my face asking how I would like it if the roles where reversed.  I said.. "Gee mate it was like 5 years ago and not really a big deal at the time"  Well the only reason I didn't get my head kicked in by him this Friday was due to Frank the Kick boxer being there. But thanks mate - I have had a good laugh over how pathetic it all was it really made my weekend.

       I went to a house party last night along Victoria Avenue. We watched the Battle of Flowers floats from a balcony, drinking beer and stuffing our faces. Later on the "Pop on the Rock" concert began. The crowd had really started to fill up - despite the weather - and Ian Van Dahl came on. I thought i'd make the best of some decent music so I ran out into my friends front garden, scooted up the wall and onto the roof of his garden shed, which overlooked the couple of thousand people that were watching the concert going on next to the house. I began to strut my funky stuff, and even got some crowd participation and cheers. The security guys ran over and were motioning for me to get down, and I gave them a subtle and polite reminder that it was private property (something like "Iz my facking shed! Feck off!! *burb*)  Louise Nurding - sorry I upstaged you. You should have gone on naked. :)

       Sorry i've not posted for a while. I've been on constant cycle of work/Reiki/work/study/work/Reiki.. you get the idea.  However, here's a big fat list of one liners I found..   Funny One-Liners    100,000 sperm and you were the fastest?  42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.  99 percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name.  A bartender is just a pharmacist with a limited inventory.  A clean desk is a sign of a cluttered desk drawer.  A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.  A closed mouth gathers no foot.  A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.  A day without sunshine is like, night.  A diplomat is someone who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you will look forward to the trip.  A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries.  All generalizations are false, including this one.  All men are idiots, and I married their King.  Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.  Always try to be modest and be proud of it!  Anything worth taking seriously is worth making fun of.  Artificial Intelligence usually beats real stupidity.  Assassins do it from behind.  Atheism is a non-prophet organization.  Auntie Em, Hate you, hate Kansas, taking the dog. Dorothy.  Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home.  Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder.  Beer: It's not just for breakfast anymore.  Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.  Better to understand a little than to misunderstand a lot.  Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks  Borrow money from a pessimist, they don't expect it back.  Boycott shampoo!

Daddy, why doesn't this magnet pick up this floppy disk?  Death is hereditary.  Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how popular it remains?  Did anyone see my lost carrier?  Diplomacy is the art of saying good doggie while looking for a bigger stick.  Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me alone.  Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.  Don't drink and drive. You might hit a bump and spill your drink.  Don't piss me off!

Energizer Bunny arrested and charged with battery.  Error, no keyboard. Press F1 to continue.  Ever notice how fast Windows runs? Neither did I.  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?  Everyone has a photographic memory. Some don't have film.  Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.  Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.  Few women admit their age. Few men act theirs.  For every action there is an equal and opposite criticism.  For Sale: Parachute. Only used once, never opened, small stain.  Forget world peace. Visualize using your turn signal.  Friends help you move. Real friends help you move bodies.  Friends may come and go, but enemies tend to accumulate.  Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is moving.  Genius does what it must, talent does what it can, and you had best do what you're told.  Get a new car for your spouse; it'll be a great trade!  Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.

Oops. My brain just hit a bad sector.  Out of my mind. Back in five minutes.  Pentiums melt in your PC, not in your hand.  Plan to be spontaneous, tomorrow.  Pride is what we have. Vanity is what others have.  Puritanism: The haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be happy.  Quantum mechanics: The dreams stuff is made of.  Quickly, I must hurry, for there go my people and I am their leader.  Reality is a crutch for people who can't handle drugs.  Remember half the people you know are below average.  Save the whales. Collect the whole set  Save your breath. You'll need it to blow up your date!  Sex is like air; it's not important unless you aren't getting any.  Shin: a device for finding furniture in the dark.  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.  Smith & Wesson: The original point and click interface.  Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.  Some drink at the fountain of knowledge. Others just gargle.  Some people are only alive because it is illegal to shoot them.  Success always occurs in private and failure in full view.  Suicidal twin kills sister by mistake!  Support bacteria, they're the only culture some people have.  The Bermuda Triangle got tired of warm weather. It moved to Finland. Now Santa Claus is missing.  The colder the x-ray table, the more of your body is required on it.  The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.

The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket.  The secret of the universe is @*&^^^ NO CARRIER  The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  The sex was so good that even the neighbors had a cigarette.  The shortest distance between two points is under construction.  The sooner you fall behind the more time you'll have to catch up.  The universe is a figment of its own imagination. There's no future in time travel.  There are 3 kinds of people: those who can count & those who can't.  There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.  There's too much blood in my caffeine system.  Things are more like they are now than they ever were before.  Time is the best teacher; unfortunately it kills all of its students.  Time is what keeps everything from happening at once.  Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome of a rain dance.  To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research.  To succeed in politics, it is often necessary to rise above your principles.  Very funny Scotty, now beam down my clothes.  Wanted: Meaningful overnight relationship.  Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.  We have enough youth, how about a fountain of smart?  We were born naked, wet and hungry. Then things got worse.  Wear short sleeves! Support your right to bare arms!  What happens if you get scared half to death twice?  What is a free gift? Aren't all gifts free?  What's the speed of dark?  When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane and going the wrong way.  When there's a will, I want to be in it.  When you don't know what you are doing, do it neatly.  Who is General Failure and why is he reading my hard disk?  Who stopped payment on my reality check?  Why do psychics have to ask you for your name?  Why is abbreviation such a long word?  Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds?  Women who seek to be equal to men lack ambition.  You are depriving some poor village of its idiot.  You can do more with a kind word and a gun than with just a kind word.  You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be misquoted then used against you.  You're just jealous because the voices are talking to me and not you!  Your gene pool could use a little chlorine.  Your kid may be an honors student, but you're still an idiot.

       I made my DJ'ing debut last night at the Q Bar. What a mental night. I played for about half an hour between 12:30 and 1. The place filled up about midnight and it was a fantastic atmosphere. I think my slot went pretty well, I wasn't planning on using the mic. much as my experiences of Karoke in the past leave my filled with a kind of, cold dred.   Also playing were Don P, Andy, Wayne (The Dapper Crew) and DJ Ryan. I took a camera and got photos of the luverly ladies and us DJ'ing lads, which I will post soon..  Funniest moment of the night - when it was just filling up I noticed Alice was in. Alice is something of a nightclubbing legend in Jersey, a dancing and bopping granny in a flashing headband, armed with a ninja tambourine. She was sitting by herself looking rather lonely so I went to say hi.  Me: "Hi Alice.. nice to see you out again" Alice: "Hello there" Me: "Can I get you a drink?" Alice: "Oh, no thanks. I'm on cranberry juice at the moment as I am having bladder control problems." Me: "Ahhh. right. Er, catch you later.."

       My god, I have had the hangover from hell all day.  My head feels like a large, painful hot air ballon. My eyeballs have been replaced with two pickled onions. My stomach has been filled with battery acid and given two hours on spin-cycle. Still, I met some lovely young ladies and had a fantastic night so who gives a shit.. if that hot little Irish blonde reads this then please get in touch, call it crazy but I experienced a serene moment of peace and tranquility with your butt grinding away in front of me. :)  This saturday i'll be doing a spot of DJ'ing at the Q Bar with the Dapper Crew. If you like R'n'B and hip hop, or fancy some different music for a change, come on down. It starts at 10PM and it's £3 entry.   Here's the latest bollocks from my Inbox..

       In the JEP it said Islanders called the police, worried that it was a explosion... dickheads. What kind of explosion shakes your house for 30 seconds? I was on my bed in a rodeo position, screaming "Yeeee-haaaaaaaaaa!"   Can you imagine something REALLY bad actually happening over here.. some kind of industrial gas leak or King Kong, running up and down King Street knocking over the blue-rinse brigade? The JEP would have a fit and come in a hard back edition!

       Wow, an earthquake at 4.5!!! Even I felt it. It woke me up this morning, so must have been a biggy. And even better, it was in France so there must be a God.  Sorry all but I am a bit annoyed with the French. More so than normally, My digital camera got knicked from the Hautlieu 50 anniversary meal held at the Hotel de France by a bastard European waiter who walked off with it after clearing up the napkins at our table. I suppose the 500+ people helped hide his larcenous tendencies and I literally only left it there for 30 seconds!  oh well, Scratch one Digital camera. Silly Grockle, cant even sell it on easily with a broken display screen, no cable to connect it to a PC (not even a standard size) and no software.  Serves the bastard right for stealing from me!

       My eye isn't as as swollen today, which is good. I'm on anti-biotics for the infection. As if that wasn't bad enough I shredded my buttocks this morning. I was getting out of bed and I didn't notice a spring from the matress had broken and was sticking out of the bed. I slid out and now have a 'rainbow' style red motif across both my ass cheeks. Och. Good job I don't have a digital camera at the moment or i'd stick a picture up on here, and ruin your lunch.  Custard and Baity are off parachute jumping this weekend in Poole. I wouldn't be surpised if Custard packed an anvil into Baity's backpack instead of a 'chute. That'd be kinda funny.  All you Hotmail users, listen up.. I'm fed up of hearing my friends moan about getting nothing but "Enlarge your penis now" mails. Do something about it. Sack Hotmail off, go over to  http://www.netaddress.com  and sign up for a account there. It's only about $20 a year and you never get ANY shite in it. Also be senisble where you give out your address. If you think the place your giving it to my pass it onto others and give you penis-enlarging info or Japanese schoolgirl pr0n, use  Sneakemail . They create an alias for your real address, when your alias starts getting spam, delete it then create another one.

       Today is defiantly a day of contemplation for me  Yesterday my Mother Passed her Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Exam Yes that makes her more Qualified as a Computer Engineer than Myself  What does this all mean? Is it her way of saying that I haven't really done as well as I thought I had. or one of those "if you can do it" "I can do it better"  I can't help but wonder what her plans are??  Is she planning on starting a Mother and Son Consultancy  Is She after my Job???? How embarrassing would it be for her to apply for your Job and get it What if she proves to be much better than you were how would you face your old work colleagues again Maybe that's it  "She wants my Job!!"  OMG What should I do??  Is it time to get the holiday Pictures of her in that orange swim suit that she had hoped had gone missing and post them all over the Works Network "I knew I would need them some day"  All Joking aside!!  Well done Mum I'm Proud of ya!!  P.S. Toaster  you can't say your mother didn't warn you that staring at woman's breast's all day would make you go blind!!

       I would like my first statement to the world to be informative, enlightening and be able to put a smile on the face of anyone who reads it.  However this has now been spoiled by Custard who decided to hit me round the head several times with a beer bottle last night, splitting my ear open and causing me to loose several pines of blood.    “Custard you’re a CUNT”  Toaster thankfully was there to save the day and tried to drag me off to the toilets before to many people noticed.  We decided to call it a night after that and I stumbled back to my brother, Dougal’s flat to sleep on his couch.  Even with all that excitement we still had a really good night.  Toaster and I also bumped into our favourite toasterette, Chrissie.  I’m happy to inform the world that Chrissie in still not wearing any underwear and has been given the privilege of a toaster nickname of “Commando”.  For those of you read and don’t know who Chrissie is,  urlLink click here .  She is the one, second from the right being hugged by Toaster.  Chrissie you’re a Star!!!!

       Hangover Star Ratings   1 Star Hangover *  No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere 'disco nap', which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Still able to function relatively well. However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the Sahara. Even vegetarians are craving a bacon buttie with chips.    2 Star Hangover * *  No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler. The coffee you hug to try to remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling guts, which are craving a Full English Breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed by aimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.   3 Star Hangover * * *  Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space-cadet and so not productive. Anytime someone walks by, you gag because their perfume/aftershave reminds you of the andom gin-shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching Trisha. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 sausage rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.   4 Star Hangover * * * *  You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or you might honk. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for  reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgems, depending on your gender. Your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the class picture of Moss Side secondary modern school circa 1976. You would give a week's pay for one the following:   * Home time  * A Doner Kebab and somewhere to be alone  * A time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before.   5 Star Hangover * * * * *  You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy You still have toothpaste-crust in the corners of your mouth. Your body has lost the ability to create saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body. Death seems like a pretty good option right now. Your boss doesn't even get cross and your co-workers think that your dog must have just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe . . .Very gently.   6 Star Hangover * * * * * *  You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi You get about 2 hours sleep and the noises inside your head wake you up. You notice that your bed has been cleared for take-off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you know you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in a yacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls, knocking all the pictures off, you find the dunny If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls. You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting and farting... Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and it goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your bum come out of your mouth on the last occasion. You lie there cold and shivering, with eruptions now occurring at 1 hour intervals. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed. You are abused again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair. You reluctantly accept the advice and have a shower in exchange for her driving you to the hospital. The whole day spent (as hangover 4 star) you finally feel well enough to eat again on the following day, with the mention of alcohol making your stomach churn lasts for a week and publicly you vow never to do it again.   I'm about two stars today. Not bad considering.

       Weird Things You Would Never Know!! (and might not ever care to know.. sent in by Joe..)  Butterflies taste with their feet. ............wait.......they get better!!!! A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why. In 10 minutes, a hurricane releases more energy than all of the world's nuclear weapons combined. On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year. On average people fear spiders more than they do death. Ninety percent of New York City cabbies are recently arrived immigrants. Thirty-five percent of the people who use personal ads for dating are already married. Elephants are the only animals that can't jump. Only one person in two billion will live to be 116 or older. It's possible to lead a cow upstairs...but not downstairs. Women blink nearly twice as much as men. It's physically impossible for you to lick your elbow. The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch every year because when it built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. A snail can sleep for three years. No word in the English language rhymes with "MONTH." Average life span of a major league baseball: 7 pitches. Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing. - SCARY!!! The electric chair was invented by a dentist. All polar bears are left-handed. In ancient Egypt, priests plucked EVERY hair from their bodies, including their eyebrows and eyelashes. An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. TYPEWRITER is the longest word that can be made using the letters only on one row of the keyboard. "Go," is the shortest complete sentence in the English language. If Barbie were life-size, her measurements would be 39-23-33. She would stand seven feet, two inches tall. A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out. The cigarette lighter was invented before the match. Americans on average eat 18 acres of pizza every day. Almost everyone who reads this will try to lick their elbow.

       Well that was a fairly dangerous night out. Started off with steaks in the Sports Bar, and then went to a birthday party at the Africa House. Loads of young, nubile, good looking chicks, mostly heading back to Uni unfortunately. We knocked back a few wobbly monkeys and played nice with the ra-ra crowd, who were actually cool..  ("i'm in a society at Oxford University!" - Sophie "Is that like the Brownies?" - Me)  and then we got a ride out to the Watersplosh. The highlight was of the evening was seeing Bobby doing a few laps of the coaches with nothing but a sock covering his modesty. Nice one bruva..  If I see another Burberry baseball cap i'm going to beat the wearer to death with a shoe. Just say no!   Live webcam feed from Liberation Square:

       Holy shit.. somebody else posted something.. well, I am still alive too.. i'm seeing a girl called Eve at the moment, how funny is that ? We need another night out lads.. let's organise a shirt night this Saturday at the Splash and get wasted. All those in favour ??   Grist sent me this one.. I think i've met this girl..  An Englishman, an Irishman & a Scotsman are having a game of golf with their wives.  The Englishman's wife steps up to the tee and as she bends over to place her ball a gust of wind blows her skirt up and reveals her lack of underwear.  "Good God! Why aren't you wearing any knickers?" her husband demanded. "Well, you don't give me enough housekeeping money to afford to buy any." The Englishman immediately reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency woman, here's 50 pounds. Go and buy yourself some underwear."  Next the Scotsman's wife bends over. The wind also takes her skirt over her head to reveal that she too is naked under it.  "Hoot, lassie! Why d'ye have no knickers?" She too explains, "You don't give me enough housekeeping money to be able to afford any." The Scot reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency here's 20 pounds. Go and buy yourself some underwear!"  Lastly, the Irishman's wife bends over to set her ball on the tee. Her skirt blows up to show that she is wearing no undies.  "Bejesus woman! You've no knickers - why not?" She replies, "I can't afford any on the money you give me." He reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency, here's a comb. Tidy yourself up a bit!"

       Hello all, Just a quickie to say 'Yes I am alive!!!' A whisper has been growing in the west, an untold fear that Baity hath past into the land where he could no longer post to his fans (couldn't resist). Well life has continued to go on, much as it has the past few months. I think the last thing I posted was about my girlfriend and me breaking up......well we gave it another shot.....and we almost made it to a year, but not anymore. Some things just aren't meant to be at the moment and although it hurts I must reflect and become stronger.   Well there you go, thats it, thus ends the catch-up lesson, Baity's back, Baity's stronger and I am definitly..............................off to bed, I shagged!   Baity signing off...........

       Sent in by Dangerous Dave..  WHAT MEN LEARN FROM WATCHING PORN!  1. Women wear high heels to bed. 2. Men are never impotent. 3. When going down on a woman, 10 seconds is more than satisfactory. 4. If a woman gets busted masturbating by a strange man, she will not scream with embarrassment, but rather insist he have sex with her. 5.Women smile appreciatively when men splat them in the face with their muck. 6. Women enjoy having sex with ugly, middle-aged men. 7. Women moan uncontrollably when giving a blowjob. 8. Women always orgasm when men do. 9. A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. 10.All women are noisy f**ks 11. People in the 70's couldn't f**k unless there was a wild guitar solo in the background. 12. Those tits are real. 13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his half-erect penis and slap it repatedly on a woman's butt. 14. Men always groan "OH YEAH!" when they cum. 15. If there are two of them, they "high five" each other (and the girl isn't disgusted). 16. Double penetration makes women smile. 17. Asian men don't exist. 18. If you come across a guy and his girlfriend having sex in the bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. 19. There is a plot. 20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by giving her a gentle slap on the butt. 21. Nurses suck their patients' cocks. 22. Men always pull out. 23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, she'll only be momentarily pi$$ed off before f**king the both of you. 24. Women never have headaches ... or periods. 25. When a woman is sucking cock, it's important for the guy to remind her to "suck it." 26. Assholes are clean. 27. A man ejaculating on a woman's butt is a satisfying result for all parties concerned. 28. Women always look pleasantly surprised when they open a man's trousers and find a cock in there. 29. Men don't have to beg. 30. When standing during a blowjob, a man will always place one hand firmly on the back of the kneeling woman's head and the other proudly on his hip.

       I'm back home from sunny Dundee.. the wedding was a blast and it was fantastic breakdancing in a kilt. I got this in a e-mail from my friend Lisa..   Last week I was with one of my summer interns in the lobby when a receptionist complained that her printer wasn't working. The intern discovered a pen stuck inside the printer. He started to jam his fingers down to the printer to get the pen, but I told him we didn't have time for that now, just put a note on the printer telling folks not to use it and then report it to the Help Desk. So he grabs a piece of paper and starts scrawling on it. I left before he finished the note.   About 20 minutes later, one of my techs comes in and says he was just in the lobby, saw a piece of paper on a printer and went to investigate.   The picture below is what he found.. sometimes things don't always come out the way they were meant to...

          I'm up in Dundee now for Daniel's wedding. It's an interesting place. Our first night here and I witnessed a "Police, Camera, Action!" style car chase. Asda is extremely popular, as is Bingo for some reason. But the local Bingo crowd appear to be 20-somethings, and not the blue-rinse mob I would have expected.  My flight over was also funny. I was delayed and arrived in London City at 4PM. My connecting flight to Dundee was at 4PM. I pelted down to the check in desk, and the rather lovely brunette attendant said that the flight was over-booked and I may not be able to get on. As she rang in to check, I overheard the conversation between a stewardess next to us and an Arabic-looking gentleman. "I'm sorry sir" she said, "You cannot sit at the front of the plane as it would be nose-heavy and crash"..  OMFG.. What a thing to say, especially as I was shortly to be strapped into the aeronautical equivalent of a Morris Minor. Big up to Scot Airways. During the course of my one hour flight, I was offered two sweets, a caramel biscuit thing, a scone, a packet of those little pretzel things AND two cups of tea!  There's also some GREAT looking women up here. I think it's to do with the air. It's like breating Evian instead of swamp water. They are fresh faced and have a naughty sparkle in their eyes. You can bet my radar is well and truly tuned into 'Babe FM'. Anyway, I shall continue to report on my findings... Toaster out..

       Hi Folks,  John, I'm hurt.  I spent most of the night with you guys and do I get one mention?  No!  Much to my surprise last night our Mr Grist turns out to be an accomplished dancer on stage.  I had a really good night last night; it always makes an evening more fun when the Toaster crowd get together.  I have to dress up for hallowe'en tonight and I don't have a clue what to do about it.  My Boss is throwing a party at his after work for us all with strict instructions that you will not be admitted without fancy dress.  For those of you who don't know, I started working at the Sports Bar about four weeks ago and I'm having an excellent time.  When you start they give you a Magic Shirt to wear which enables you, free entry into any Club plus makes you instantly attractive to women!  (Great, Kate has just come in to help me with my spelling and grammar).  That is no mere statement either.  I have pulled every night since Friday.  I even woke up on Monday on a sofa next to a pretty young lady and to my horror looked around to see pictures of one of the Toaster files team all over the living room.  Panicking at first I wondered what horrible mistake I had made, then I remembered the girl I was with, was on holiday and this was not her house.  Well I better get onto making my costume for the night.  Danger out.....

       Hello all it's the 'Piss Artist', formally known as Baity!! I have just returned home from a hard day at work, and I am totally bollocked as I got three hours sleep this morning and I woke up still drunk!  Last night I decided to let myself be tempted out on the piss with the crew and Princess Kate (lovely girl), so I headed out for a night of booze, birds and..um.....bloody town. Anyways, heres the rundown of the night........... I met up with the guys at Sports Bar, and to my suprise I even got to finally meet Princess Kate! Now I happen to already know a few Canadian people and it was a pleasure to meet yet another. I did my best to be myself, although it was bloody hard because going out in town is very very very different to going out to the Splash!! I had to make sure I didn't hurt anyone in a whirlwind of headbanging, and I had to do that sort of townie style dancing later on in the night (which I can usually pull off, although in a sort of mocking way....BITE ME! Libbies!). I digress, anyway I got on really well with Kate and I think we got on sound. So there we all were in Sports Bar when suddenly I see Brett (Danger) working behind the bar, well shock horror! We all let the drinks go back easy and generally had a good time whilst gawping at the local talent. At one point I spyed Danger walking back to the bar with about fifteen empty glasses stacked in his arms, now at this point I was presented with a very hard moral dilemma!!!  Do I:  a) Watch him struggle through the throngs of people clapping in support of his efforts,  b) Ask him if he needed assistance and then refusing with a big grin on my face, c) Pinch a passing girls arse and claim it was Danger which would result in a hefty slap causing him to drop the glasses, (or, and this was my favourite), d) Weave my way between the masses of people in pursuit of Danger and then when level with him give an accidental push causing him to fall and once again breaking the glasses.  Well being as I'm not a total asshole, I decided to stick with plan A.  So, after a while we all left on our way to Follies D'amour (translated to Follies D'meat market). Actually it was cool as I saw a load of people that I hadn't seen in a while, whilst having a laugh with my mates, which afterall, is what it's all about. We drank and danced the night, and some of the morning away, and watched several fights (a sad happening involving two townies batter the 'Tommy H' out of each other!). At around 2am Custard and I left and walked home. Nothing much happened after that, apart from having to wake up at six to go to work!  Um......well fuck this, I need a shower, cya all.  The Piss Head formally known as Baity signing off....................

       Hello folks. First of all I apologise for this blog. You see, I am considerably pissed… But not too pissed to use word for its spell check ability :-)  Today was a fun if not abnormal day in the life of a Grist. To start, it was a normal day, with the standard, “go to work” routine followed by the “the rest of my department go for a fag break, I shall go for a Internet break at the same time as their cigarette smoking siesta. The first one being the moment I walked in the door – the next most remember able one was at 12:00 pm, exactly the time I go for lunch. “John, We are just going for a ciggy” says my boss, disappearing down the corridor closely followed by my other departmental colleague,  My only other colleague, leaving me the only person to man the phones… Any way. With a blog to the Toasterfiles, I feel better… Even more considering that I stand an opportunity to meet the wonderfull women (well 2/3rds of the women) that make up our companion blog at  urlLink Shut_it..  Princesses Kate and the Slapper McSlapperson Andy. What a surprise (sarcasm to those of you that don’t know me)  it was to find the lovely miss slapper has missed the ferry to our lovely island (I say, bighting my finger) Oh well, As I have planned for it anyway, Alcohol beckons me. So I go to the Sports Bar to meet Baity, Toaster and Custard. To my surprise, I am not only ten minutes late, but no one else has tuned up yet… Toaster turns up next to my surprise, quickly followed by the lovely Princesses Kate. Who not only put up with me for the entire night, but actually remained on speaking terms with me after… Anyway, Drink ensues in a bar that caters for the sports fan. Football is on television. (for those Americans out there, Football is a game you call Soccer, You know, the game you use your foot and a ball as the main game constituents? Much like American Football where you pick up the ball and run. Except for the picking up the ball part.) After a few pints, (those of you that are Australian, that’s a couple of Jars per Pint, We are multi national here) Custard and Baity both turn up. To my surprise Kate hasn’t made her excuses yet to leave. Which makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Knowing someone’s life from a web page before meeting them made me feel like a Stalker of sorts… Which I am not. Except for the going through your garbage bit…. Kate reminds me much of the only other Canadian person I ever met. The same one that let me share a bedroom with her and her best (female) friend one night. That night happened to be after Custards 21st party, I was blond.. Oh and Psycho also shared the bedroom. Anyhoo. She was nice too. And if Andy is anything to go by, I think Canadians will feature on my all time nice people to speak to, along side the Aussies. Because they have my cousins there.  More Alcohol ensures and we end up in Follies. I was drunk. So drunk. So drunk that I danced That’s bad. I cant dance. Kate sait “Im gonna have to find you a woman” I laughed. Andrew Arnold hasn’t got engaged again, so how am I supposed to get a girl. ( that’s because I did a hat trick. Sleeping with all three of his fiancées. None of which were going out with him at the time. Except for the middle one. Who got engaged even though she had been going out with me for a year and a half…) I saw my new boss and his girlfriend and understood why he is always late to work. I got drunker. Great night. I also apologise to the wonderful Liane, Andy and Princesses Kate, who have kept me amuse throughout my trials at work. I have not commented on your site for a while, even though, Big feet = big Socks, Kate, you didn’t upset me, it take a lot more, a hell of a  lot more than you are willing to do to me to upset me. Cross Blog posting is a thing that I am trying to cut down even though its been hard most of the time, I have also found it difficult not to post to you folks, but if you click on my name at the bottom of this post, it will give you my E-mail address :-) Im not sobering up quickly so I wil leave it there and regret what I have posted tomorrow. My Bosses last day (her last *Working* day was a couple of weeks ago) Ho humm...

       I don't know why girls snogging other girls is a such a turn on. But it just works.. and i'm not talking about those daft bints in Sports that dance around each other and wind up all the builders clutching onto their pint of John Smiths.    "Fooking 'ell John.. see them girls then? They were grinding right up each other.. I think we are on a winner 'ere lads.."   No, because Jersey girls do it just to make mugs of fellas. However, out in Cancun they don't mess around...                Bisexual women of the world, we at The Toaster Files salute you.

       Can we all say "HAIL TO THE KING!". The unwritten rules of girl on girl action? Adam, you are a genius! What every man wants to know, (except possibly gay men, but then again, all men are curious at heart) For you women out there that actually read this site (God bless you all) I could simply answer you with the phrase "It's a man thing". If you still don't understand, follow my simple steps. 1) get a man, any man, if you have a boyfriend, it will make them worship you, If you have a male friend, they will do anything for you. If not, well, why are you asking? 2) get a close female friend. Closer the better, Make sure that they are in on this too, otherwise it could be messy. 3) arrange to go out together for a meal/clubbing/general piss up. 4) find a place when you are next to your female friend and also opposite your male partner/friend. 5) when the male in question is looking, lean over to your female friend and start kissing her, Tongues, hands everywhere… 6) continue for a minimum of 10 seconds to let the situation settle into the oft thick and unaware male mind 7) stop, lean back and look at your male friends expression. Also look at every other male person in the room. 8) as a friend, Pick up your male friends jaw and return it to the anatomically correct position.  Simply being every mans fantasy (if they admit it or not) is an understatement. It is genetically encoded into every mans loins. Besides, anything that a woman can do to another woman that we can't, intrigues us, for some its an inferiority complex, for others its an opportunity to learn. What more can I say, HAIL TO THE KING!!!  Anyone know where I can get my head wax stripped? Oh and I know the people that own La Friggate… Oh and one of my ex's worked there for a bit. Until she got fat eating their cakes, no kidding, she put on over 8 stone since I left Uni. Ok, admittedly I'm not the slimmest of people, but I have only put on 1 1./2 stone since I last had sex. With a person. With a live person. I'm a born again virgin. Virgin on the ridiculous! Oh I rant. Boss leaves tomorrow. Cut hair on Saturday. What else could I ask for in life? One thing. Liane? When are you gonna visit our lovely Island?

       Just a quick update for Toaster.......... If their the people I think they are, I used to live a few doors down from the propriators whom run La Frigate, however they have since moved on. Even so, if you would like me to deal with them just send me a job description in secret code through the JEP, and I will deal with it, It would be my pleasure!  Yes the service at La Frigate is SHIT!! Yes the food at La Frigate is SHIT!! Yes La Frigate is SHIT!!  Baity signing off.......

       Just come back from lunch and it was CRAP. Three of us went to the Frigate to try something different and have some fresh air. We all went for "Chicken and Mozzarella" roll, which was in reality cold chips, crappy salad and luke warm chicken with cold, sliced mozzarella. I went back inside to get more ketchup for this banquet and was given a single sachet the size of a contact lense. I asked for a few more and I got another, tiny sachet. What a bunch of shite. God knows how much that place cost to build, and it's utterly depressing with rank food. The chocolate vending machine upstairs is just as polite, and more fulfilling.

       Plans are afoot for my 23rd on the 15th November. I am heading over to Guernsey with some lads from work and the usual TF reprobates, for a 60's themed party. I have a white hessian shirt and psychedelic pants, with a blonde woman's wig and John Lennon glasses. Stand well back :)  December is looking pretty booked out on the party schedule as well. I have four, yes four, seperate works bashes to go to, (benefit of getting moved around different departments so much I guess) and I think I can gatecrash at LEAST another two on top of that. Also we have go to have a TF night out, so that's in there as well.. I think you can say December is going to be one long alcoholic blur.  TF Posse: Slapper McSlapperson (aka Mad Chica Canadian Andy) is over tomorrow and i've agreed we are going to take her out and get her dancing on tables naked. Txt me for time/place. Muahahaha.  I have to go now. I am quizzing a bisexual girl in a chat room and she's telling me all the unwritten rules of girl on girl action. Thank you lord.

       Schweet jesus, what a night. I started off in the Sports Bar, and met Nelson an avid Toaster Files reader - thanks for the beer buddy! Unfortunatly I was then attacked by a blonde bunny boiler (if you speak to me again i'm going to post your name on here, we were never 'an item' and frankly, you scare me. So fuck off..  ok?) anyway, had a few more drinks and laughs then headed down to Q Bar to play my set with the Dapper Crew. It was a quiet night, apparently some loser called Boy George was playing in Follies and he stole my dancing girls. I ended up with some buddies from work and Danger in the Zebra. I think with distressed people with our experimental dancing techniques.  A few weeks ago at the Splash, we stripped one of our friends naked and made him do a couple of laps. Below are the photos from that night. Let's play,   "Spot the naked guy!" (TM)      In the queue.. too early and sober for nakedness yet...   Catty cat cat and the schoolgirls. Good name for a band.   In summary, breasts are great. John Grist, news at ten, the Watersplosh.   Wazzzzzzzzzzzzup!   I'm doing a survey on barmaids underwear for the site. Any chance you could...? No.. fuck off? ok.. sorry.   Bounce in the mosh pit. No naked guy though...    There we go!! Who is that masked man??

       The following are a sample of e-mails we have received, maybe these emails may help someone out there.  Dear Mr. Gristy,  I have been trying to get a woman for a long time (about 200 years) but I don't seem to be able to find one that suits my needs!!!  You see the trouble is that I need a female that won't feint at the sight of blood, doesn't moan when her veins are lett, and looks good in the afterlife (this is very important!).  All the women I've dated so far have run away when I have mentioned that I'd like to become a fully-fledged vampire, not to mention when I tell them I have a neutral and good side!!   Oh please help me, and post my letter, along with your esteemed advice, and help me through these rough times! Yours faithfully,   Townie Goth Prat PS- Think you look lovely in uniform!  I am very sorry to hear about your problem, Mr Prat. You have two options.  Firstly, you can get a life. Live with normal people and stop painting your fingernails black. Vampires don’t exist, and for goodness sake, get some protein in your diet. Secondly, you can invest in some good volumes of text from renowned authors such as Alistair Crowley. The Necroconinum would be a start. These handy tomes would allow you to animate your very own loving corpse. Try not to do a Frankenstein and build you own companion, you could get things sloppy unless your needlework skills are very precise.  Either way, young Townie, let us know how it goes.   Dear Mr Grist  I was just having look at the Toaster Files today, I confess mainly to perve at the pictures of fit birds that Adam occasionally posts there.  To my horror I discovered a picture of you dressed up as a policeman.  I am quite frankly mentally damaged having geared myself up to look at ladies and met instead your leering face suggestively clutching a truncheon. My only hope is that next time I get it on with some impressionable young filly I will not have flashbacks of the horrible visions that I have endured today.  I am quite frankly afraid.  Donatello,   Mr Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Whereas perving over some very sexy women is a perfectly healthy hobby, and in fact, The Toaster Files is the best outlet for your raging teenage hormones. It combines witty humour with fine booty. Every thing a man could want. Of course, a man cannot live on nothing but water without appreciating the joy of champagne. In this respect, your poor right arm will be working overtime unless you get a change of view. Whilst many people find the picture of me as a policeman rather disturbing, you should consider it a change from young scantly clad women and look at it once a while to remind yourself of all that is beautiful by comparison.  Remember that my truncheon maybe rather threatening but its no reason to stop reading the site.  Contact me at:  urlLink gristadviceline@hotmail.com  and your question and my advice will be printed here (with your name changed for legal reasons)

       Oh Adam!!!! All sooooo true!!! Why oh why does it have to be this way??? Why can't all the lovelies out there remain in short numbers with small nipple bearing tops??? Why does the world seem damn right ugly now??? Why do all the townies remain as dumb now as they were in the summer??? Why aren't tight tops for women made without any material over the breasts, for surely if they didn't want us seeing their nipples they wouldn't wear them??? Why do birds sing so gay??? Why does the winter have to be so dull??? Why is Follies such a meat market??? Why do the Toaster crew find it so neccessary to get totally fuck-faced all the time hehe??? Why do baby antilope birth sacks dangle from the mummy deers hole??? Why do I have an obsession at the moment with the word 'Arse Chicken'??? Why can't Narnia be real??? Why didn't the fucking lion in that brain fucking closet show get hunted down to make a fir cloak??? Why oh why can't there be an end to the amount of questions I want answered??? Why is Mark gay (according to Alex)??? Why does Gristy visit us in our dreams, to taunt us with rubber and latex, when we sleep at night??? Why do I feel the need to make sweet love all the time??? Why isn't heavy metal the christian rock??? Why don't we demolish all the nightclubs in town and reproduce the SPLASH many times over??? Why do the lickle bunny rabbits brandish shotguns at night to hunt humans??? Why do Simon (SHREIK) Surcoufs cats threaten to kill me everytime they see me??? Why aren't civil servants working under the manual workers??? Why do people in suits think they are better then the people that get their hands dirty??? Why are the smelly poo people from south park taking over schools??? Why are neon lights so sexual??? Why (according to some people) do manga women make some guys spaff their pants!!!??? Why did Jack run up the hill, instead of fucking Jill back at his pad??? Why do hedgehogs cross the roads??? Why isn't the sun black??? Why don't we put a section up on our site for people to post??? Why why why why why why why why why why why do I have soooooo much spare time to post all this shite???.........................................................................................WHY????????????

       It's dark. It's raining. Dark, rainy Jersey. I hate to bang on about summer and winter but it's amazing what an affect the changes have on everybody. Just to think, only a few, short months ago.. we were outside, al fresco drinking, checking out the beav.. um... ladies walking in little more than a greyhound skirt (one inch from the hair, get it?) and tight tops.. and now.. well, like a pack of fickle geese they have migrated, to be replaced with kagool wearing stony faced ice queens.  Where is this mystical place that the summer talent goes for winter? I'm convinced that somewhere there's a bedroom wardrobe with a secret door at the back. Only this door doesn't lead to some farcical winter wonderland called Narnia, it leads to summer-talent-bikini heaven.  Now, you may say.. "Shut up about the chicks Toaster. Stop being so shallow." and you'd be right. But you have to look at the big picture. Less pie hitting the streets, means less men getting laid. Less men getting laid means more fighting and aggression. Aggression leads to hate. Hate leads to fear. Fear leads to the dark side. The dark side leads to..  .. umm.. well, i've haven't got that bit totally figured out.. but it's just not good, is it?    Summer talent at the Splash, sadly now a distant memory.  As part of our ongoing campaign here at TF for all things sexual, we I introduce:   Officer Grists Sexual Advice Section:      The earl of all things sexual is now able to offer his impartial advice to others, free, via Toaster Files. Now problem too big or small, contact him at:  urlLink gristadviceline@hotmail.com  and your question and his advice will be printed here (with your name removed, obviously.. this IS Jersey, backwater gossip mongering inbred central, remember)

       I would love to know who rated The Toaster Files as "I hate it" on the poll on the left… I mean, I don't like jacked potatoes, but do I complain about every jacket potato web site on the Internet? No!!! Get a life you sad, sad monkey. There is more to life than complaining. If you don't like our site, don't read it. Of course, you would miss all the things that make the Toaster crew what we are, including Johns in Thongs and the T man himself! What else can a sad computer geek, who sits at his computer naked looking for porn on the net want?  You are just annoyed we featured your picture on the 15.10.02 after you started stalking poor Alex, wanting him as your love slave, wanting him to cover you in a thin coating of Vaseline. Wanting him to scoop the dried pizza crusts from out of the folds of flesh that make your abdomen.  God I'm bored.

       What a strange day. Woke up this morning in the mistaken belief that the world had tilted on its axis. No, it wasn't a mid-coital experience (if only…) but shock and amazement at the soft glow that shrouded every outdoor item, the trees, the birds, the houses, the dirty old man in the trench coat behind the bushes, the cars… Yes folk, Its SUNNY. If still a bit wet. But Sun it was. And with that shocking display off astronomical certainty I even cycled to work without a jacket. Made my nipples pointy, but hell. I like it. Good thing to, with my orange shirt (its Wednesday, Wednesday = Orange shirt day) only one idiot in an estate car, padded out to hold dogs in the back, no doubt wearing socks :-) attempted to ignore me on my bike. Good job I swerved to miss that puddle, I could have been nice and let her drive by ignorant to the fact that she must be blind not to have seen my arse on the road.  Ho hum. Today the faint snivelling of a cold has come back, funny, it didn't exist yesterday, maybe she was too busy to fake it.  For those of you who care, today, on a scale of one to take the mickey out of Americans, she scores Starship Troopers.

       Monday, and the start of another wonderful week. At least it wasn't raining when I left the house this morning, It had been raining, so I don't know what's worse. At least for those of you that walk, I feel for you when a car goes through that puddle and splashes you with a wave that would make the Japanese wince with sympathy. But then I remember that I cycle to work each day. There is nothing quite like getting a stream of dirty road run-off water directed straight at your rectum whilst struggling to keep in a vertical position on a bike that, for all intent and purpose, renders itself and the rider, ie me, invisible to approximately 70% of car-bound road users.  Why, with very slippery wet roads, do cars think that is perfectly safe to overtake me, doing 25 mph on a 90 degree corner and only leave me three and a quarter inches to manoeuvre? Then they complain at ME for the reactionary size 14 (49 Europe, 15 USA men's sizes) shoe print on the side of their polished car? Humm, the phrase "Give a cyclist the same room as a car when overtaking" springs to mind. If I can put my foot through your passenger window, you shouldn't be so bloody close mate!  Me getting my latex, My hair is as long as the time I dyed it blond and I have some clippers… Looking forward to Halloween!  And today, on a scale of one to cant be botherd to work, my boss scores  "Cough Cough, I have a bad cold. Sorry, I Shave da bad colshd."

       I didn't really plan on going out last night but I ended up at a cocktail party with Dougal's girly and some other peeps. I made a long island iced tea that could have been used to degrease an engine, it was excellent. Baity came around as well and we played a cool drinking game (but not as good as the infamous  "Chicken" .. BUCKAAAAYE!) where you throw a fag packet in turns and have to drink depending on how it lands. An hour later everyone was pretty well plastered, Baity especially, performing his ritual technicolour yawn party piece. I found him passed out on the floor of the bathroom (silly, silly, silly..) and covered the poor sod with a towel and stuck a pillow under his head. I woke up this morning with a red PVC bra stuck to my face, which I seem to remember wearing on my head at some point.  Anyway, splashing it tonight. I'm in the mood for some loud, jumpy jumpy RAWK music. Toodles.

       Well, It would be a change to see something a bit bigger than your wallet in your trousers. What has gotten into me, , My posts have been a bit bitchy recently, sorry everyone. Except Custard, who still has yet to explain how he knows so much about thermometers of the non oral type. Baitys Visual Spaff Wagon is a great trip back in time, but it is missing a couple of photos that truly show us in a good light… JOHNS IN THONGS.

I have just been reading the 'Shut It' website and I have to say that I kind of got a bit pissed off at myself! The thing is that I would have loved to of gone out with the lads on the piss last night, had a laugh, met Princess Kate and generally had a crack. Unfortunitly my work hours at the moment are really pants and theres nowt I can do about that (says with a quivering bottom lip). Well I am going to be working winter hours now so hopefully I'll be coming out very soon haha!  Anyway, a big hello to Princess Kate, if she reads this, hopefully we will meet at some point. Oh and a big hello to Liane and Andy whom I had a cool chat with last night. Hope 'Baity's Spaff Wagon' ain't too boring, we will all have to live with cameras in our pockets and get some cool snaps ok guys!! Baity signing off......

Now, after I realised that I had been a total blind tit I decided to have a look at the site today.....very cool! Hopefully now I have seen the light I may even be able to get to know the crew. Anyways I got to go train now......oh god 200 sit-ups and 50 press-ups!!!!! Well I guess thats the price for being fit (says with a saddened look lol).

       Hello children of the 80's. Read this, it will take you back... (thanks to Kerrie for this)  Um Bongo, Um Bongo, They drink it in the Congo  Friendship bracelets were ties that couldn't be broken.  You know all the words to "Ice Ice Baby".  You wanted to be on "Jim'll Fix It".  You can remember what Michael Jackson looked like before he had plastic surgery.  You had a Global Hypercolour t-shirt.  You know the profound meaning of "Wax on, Wax off".  You were upset when She-ra, Princess of Power and He-Man got cancelled.  You remember Madonna in her cone stage outfit.  You knew "The Artist" when he was humbly called "Prince."  You wore fluorescent-neon clothing... (if you can call it clothing!)  You could break dance (ok, you wished you could)  You remember when Amiga was a state of the art video game system.  You remember M.C. Hammer.  You can still sing the rap to "Fresh Prince of Bel Air"....  You can remember when it was Jazzy Jeff and The fresh Prince and NOT just plain Will Smith!  You own any cassettes.  You carried your lunch to school in a Gremlins, ALF or ET lunchbox.  You have ever pondered on why Smurfette was the ONLY female smurf.  My Little Pony, Gummy Bears and Transformers are familiar to you.  You had a Swatch Watch.  You believed that "By the power of Greyskull, you HAD the power!"  Big wheels and BMX's were the way to go.  With your pink (or blue) portable tape player, you sang to Kylie and Jason!  You owned Polly Pocket or Micro Machines.   You made Ken fall in love with Barbie.  Partying "like it's 1999" seemed SO far away.  You knew that Transformers were "more than meetsthe eye".  You wore a banana clip at some point during your youth.  You were led to believe that in the year 2000 we'd all be living in space.  You know what leg warmers are and probably had a pair.  You wore cycling shorts underneath a short skirt and felt stylish.  You recorded songs off the radio with your boom box.  You never questioned why the A-Team were always imprisoned in places that had sufficient tools to build an armoured tank.  Dungeons & Dragons was your favourite programme. (WHAT do you mean, WAS? - Toaster)  You said "bright light, bright light" in a strange high-pitched voice.  You fell out with friends during heated arguments about the relative merits of Male characters out of beverly hills 90210.  Cerise pink, electric blue and banana yellow have ever featured in your wardrobe or make-up collection.  You did the top toggle of your coat up around your neck without having your arms in the sleeves, and you knew you looked like a superhero.  Your new winter coat was best used to demonstrate that your wings were like a shield of steel.  You still remember when the A-ha video was the pinnacle of modern technology and you can still sing all the words.  Your best party dress was either a ra-ra or puff-ball skirt.  You remember watching a house inhabited by a jester, a pantomime horse and a woman who sneezed, and thinking that this was perfectly normal.  You tried to convince your Dad to fit a strip of red lights on the front of the car so it looked like KITT.  You had more than 10 sweets in a 10p mix-up.  You hid behind the sofa whenever you heard the word "Exterminate!".  Girls - You owned a pair of Pixie boots,generally worn with leg warmers.  Boys - You owned a pair of pale grey slip-ons,generally worn with white towelling socks.  Ooh, you could crush a grape!  You held a chicken in the air or stuck a deckchair up your nose.  You wore legwarmers & tried to do the splits while jumping in the air while singing you were going to live forever.  Your best mate had a Soda Stream at home and you were jealous.  Any elderly Scottish lady sounds like Supergran.  When 'Computer' Tennis, Pac-Man and Donkey-Kong ruled.  You remember hearing the tune then running out to buy an ice cream cone on a warm summer night - 99's, screwballs or a cider lolly.  Water balloons were the ultimate weapon.  Important decisions were made by going "eeny-meeny-miney-mo."

       You know, the most amusing thing about the recent posts was Custards comments on rectal thermometers. I am curious as to how he found out about the quote in comment 6, He must have a J&J thermometer at home so why has he got one when a normal oral one would do? Hell put it in the armpit if you have to but that place is the last place I would want any medical diagnostic equipment placed. Again.  More to the point Custard, why did you read the pamphlet that came with the Thermometer? That pamphlet is more commonly known as "The Instructions". Why do you need to know how to use an anal thermometer?  Ooh, gone a bit to far into the psyche of Custard there.

       Right this is the last post on the whole subject ok. Yes I was in a restaurant, ant yes I DID draw the Twin Towers onto a place map which depicted a view of the New York skyline, however...above that drawing I wrote the sentence 'Your memory remains forever'. Anyway, to move on from the subject I would like to offer Alex an apology for the crude remark I made about his life style, I is not my place to criticise you mate and I hope you will accept my apology to you, I have known you longer than anybody else in the Toaster crew (ten years plus!), and I also know that we wouldn’t fall out over this dispute (although I do expect that you might ask me to grovel haha.....not a chance!! lol). We have all had our say in this political discussion but lets call it to an end.  THE END.  Now as far as the weekend goes, my body is telling me to 'Go the fuck away!!!' as I have been abusing it for the last forty-eight hours and plied it with all sorts of alcohol, leaving no unit of blood untouched haha! Went to the splash last night and I gave it all I had left which wasn't much, must be getting old!!! Well thank you to Kate for the cool party on Friday night, thank you to my cousin Noel whose party I went to on Saturday lunch onwards and a 'Big up ya' to the splash.   Oh and one last thing. The upcoming 'Lord Of The Rings' film has a new trailer available and I advise any LOTR fans to download and check it out at  urlLink www.lordoftherings.net   Baity signing off....

       Oh god guys can u please shut up about all this just leave it as it is ok?  Right I thought I would put this up just to get away from what u guys are saying. When you have an "I hate my job/ college course/ school" day try this: 1. On your way home from work, stop at your local pharmacy, and go to the thermometer section.  2. You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by "Johnson and Johnson." Be very sure you get this brand. 3. When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes, and disconnect the phone, so you will not be disturbed during your therapy. 4. Change into something far more comfortable, such as a sweat suit and then lay down on your bed.   5. Open the package and remove the thermometer. Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken.   6. Take out the material that comes with the thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a statement:    "Every rectal thermometer made by Johnson and Johnson is personally tested"      Now close your eyes and repeat out loud five times:  "I am SO glad I do not work for quality control at the Johnson and Johnson Company"

       I am now very confused, In one sentence, Baity is having a go at Alex for a post he finds offensive because  quote you wouldn’t like it if one of your family was shot by that sniper! unquote. The very same evening he is drawing two sky scrapers in a restaurant onto a place mat depicting the New York sky line… I’m sorry for the people affected by the sniper, but far more people world wide were effected by the attack on the Two Towers last year. That single moment depicts you, Baitey as a hypocrite. And I think you should apologise to Alex for the unkind remarks which you made when you have done FAR worse only hours afterwards. Just because the September the 11th incident happened last year doesn’t make it ok to poke fun at. According to your own moral standards, you are completely out of order.  :-)

       Baity..no one has said they find the shootings funny, I would have trouble believing it if anyone did find such a thing humorous. Different people deal with tragedy like this in different ways (il use this sniper situation as an example) some people will try to forget about such things as soon as they can, others will sit and mourn and some will make cartoons like this one, maybe they believe it helps people see the reality of the situation. Everyone has there own way of dealing with such things. That said I don’t think anyone has he right to say “that is wrong” or “no one finds that funny”. I realise I may have offended people by posting that picture and I apologise to them, but I don’t apologise for actually posting it (if that make sense) although next time I post something that my offend people il put it in a link making clear not all people will find it funny…   In regards to your comment about my lifestyle even if you didn’t mean any offence by it im still offended, just because I prefer to spend a lot of my time on the internet or rather not going out all the time and talking to “real” people does not mean I don’t know about the world and it certainly doesn’t give anyone the right to post such a thing a in a very public place like here, tho il say no more about it.   Well sorry again to anyone who was offended by that, it was in no way meant to do so, but it did give us something to talk/read about, thats why we are here after all.

       John, please don't try to condone Alex's post! To suggest that Alex is one of those people that finds that sort of thing funny is bullshit!! Not trying to be horrible but to be honest Alex hasn't got a clue about the outside world!! He goes to work and then goes home to sit at his computer all day and night!! (no offense meant Alex). I maintain that this post was not in the best interest of our readers. Anyone who thinks that the unjust murder of anyone is funny is a prick in my books.

       Ohh I shudder at the thought of my puckered lips hovering towards Baitys winking chocolate starfish... Tonight promises to be fun. I would of course take my camera if some bastard didn't knick it from under my nose. I'm not bitter, just annoyed. I would add that although I don't condone Psyco's post, I do feel that he has just as much right to post his views as anyone else. Laughter is the only multicultural expression that can be understood across the language barrier. Even the western Ok hand single means something else in eastern Europe (go there and do it… see what I mean) But the object of laughter is different for different people. Jokes about the Challenger space shuttle disaster, Princess Diana's death or even September the 11th were not funny at the time, and to some people never will be, but after??? To some people laughter is a way of releasing stress from a very serious situation. Enough bad things happen in the world, we cant be sad for all of them. Is not a nervous laugh is better than a hysterical psychopath? I laughed at the post. I feel sad for the people in America terrified with the same situation, but the reality of that situation is NOT the reality of a drawing on a computer screen. I for one can separate the two. And  I sincerely hope that they can catch the idiot doing the terrorising before he ruins someone else's life. I will not even broach the subject of American gun law and how it (allegedly) improves the quality of life as this is not the place to discuss such a subject. Needless to say, after that rant, I am dropping the subject.

       First of all I'd like to say that although I find most things funny, I must mention that I do NOT find Alex's last post funny in the slightest!!! I believe that cartoons such as this are a total disgust and should have no place on our site! These cowardly murders taking place are barbaric, against all that we consider civilised and are VERY VERY real! These murders affect people and this sort of exploitation only exists to encourage the WANKER thats doing it!!! Alex I would greatly appreciate an apology for this post mate.  Now I have voiced my opinion I would like to say hi to everyone out there. This week has been quite a good week as I have made some really cool mates, going out to parts this weekend, and generally sorted loads of heavy shit out haha. Tonight its Dougal's  girlies birthday and the crew are going out on the lash!! Well I have to go and get myself all ready for the girls hehe, talk you all again soon, Baity signing off...........  PS- Alex I mean it mate! And if anyone dissagrees with me, then I believe you can kiss my arse!!!

       Today, the boss would have to score "He's dead". *  Pity really, she is a wonderful person, kind, funny, and best of all, she puts up with me! She has been crying this afternoon due to the workload given to her before she leaves at the end of this month. Not something I would wish upon anyone, but my personal feelings towards her are completely separate to my feelings on her ability to do her job. SHE CANT!!! My five years to her six months of experience should suggest that maybe, just maybe I might be able to suggest something helpful? But alas, to be ignored and returned to the pale of insignificance is frustrating to say the least. Ohh how I look onto the time when she leaves and I am left to do the work left behind…  Today is also Think Pink day for breast cancer. As a fund raising event, everyone in work had to wear something pink. So far I have seen multiple blouses and shirts, one bra and two pairs of thongs.  Brilliant day.  The highlight was walking through town.  You see, I not really an exhibitionist by heart… but I had two choices of pink for today. Either the 1920's style pink dress I have from Custards Gangsters and Molls fancy dress party, when I went as a Moll.  Or I had the size 14, custom made to fit, Pink Fluffy Bunny Rabbit slippers. I went for the slippers and everyone that I passed (and even some cars) looked, smiled, and once I passed, laughed out loud. Makes me feel warm inside…  *On a scale of one to spoil the ending of Sixth sense

Tongues don't shrink with age. 2) even if it was recent, in four years she will be the most wanted person by man and woman alive.  Oh and Adam, I dont mind you slandering my "good" character, it can not be worse than what others have done, You are just not that way inclined.  it is nice to know that I have finally gained a measure of infamy on the net :-)

       Fame at last. I have been recognises by the people over the pond at Shut_it… All because of a request for a threesome.  Andy, Liane, Kate, its not as interesting as you think.   Today the boss scores "loaded weapon"* for the brilliant comment of "Do you mind waiting for me to have a fag before you go to lunch at 12?" then leaving to smoke said cancer causing carcinogenic cylinder at 12:25. A what point did I realises that she didn't mean straight away? Could it be the one that relates to my single hour of peace and quiet called lunch?  Only 15 more working days till she leaves.  On a brighter note, Are the Toaster crew gonna hit the public on All Hallows Eve? I have a tub of latex and a bag of makeup and I can do wonders with the combination!  Seriously, I havent been out on the pizz in halloween costume since last weekend, sorry since University (went trick or treating and ended up sleeping in the same bed as Melissa and Karen.

       Well sports fans, it looks like the summer of love has finally drawn to a close.  I think we are all a little older and wiser, with a few less brain cells and tad more liver damage. It was this glorious summer that saw the formation of this, Jersey's most awesome website, beating even Jersey European and Les Follies in the local web site rankings. It was a summer where a group of ordinary guys got together, and decided to throw off the shackles of women calling the shots and we reclaimed our hunting instinct, armed with credit cards and razor-sharp wit. It saw Custard in numerous violent outbursts, Baity in and out of love like granny doing the hockey cockey, Speed ruling the local Karaoke scene with a iron fist, Danger getting thrown in Libby Square fountain, Danger getting thrown off the Miss Battle of Flowers float, Grist offering group sex to a birthday girl standing in line at the taxi rank with her boyfriend ( "I'll even push his arse in for him if he's tired.." ) the hi-jinx and joviality have been hard and fast.  But don't you think for a second that we are going to slow down now the weather's gone a bit shit. Bleak October is pregnant with the promise of office parties, Christmas parties, new year's.. You name it.  It may be cold outside but it's sunny in our hearts, and girls to sunbathe. You see where i'm going with this?

       Two glorious days off work and I felt sooooo relaxed. Pity I had to return to work today. I would have been nice for my boss to have actually organised for someone to do my work during my absence, although that's far more than what I expected…  What I expected was for her to actually do the *Small* job I left her to do, sort out some filing into date order for our auditors.  Why then am I surprised that it hasn't been done? Why do I even bother… All I ask for is some R&R   For a slight smile…  A guy with a black eye boards his plane bound for Pittsburgh and its down in his seat. He notices immediately that the guy next to him has a black eye, too. He says to him, "Hey this is a coincidence, we both have black eyes; mind if I ask how you got yours?"  The other guy says, "Well, it just happened. It was a tongue twister accident. See, I was at the ticket counter and this gorgeous blonde with the most massive breasts in the world was there. So, instead of saying, 'I'd like two tickets to Pittsburgh, 'I accidentally said, 'I'd like two pickets to Tittsburgh', and she socked me a good one."  The first guy replied, "Wow!

       Two builders (Dave and Stuart) are seated either side of a table in a rough pub when a well-dressed man enters, orders a beer and sits on a stool at the bar. The two builders start to speculate bout the occupation of the suit...   Dave: - I reckon he's an accountant.   Stuart: - No way - he's a stockbroker.   Dave: - He ain't no stockbroker ! A stockbroker wouldn't come in here!   The argument repeats itself for some time until the volume of beer gets the better of Dave and he makes for the toilet. On entering the toilet he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal. Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder...   Dave: - Scuse me.... no offence meant, but me and me mate were wondering what you do for a living?   Suit: - No offence taken! I'm a Logical Scientist by profession   Dave: - Oh! What's that then?   Suit: - I'll try to explain by example ...Do you have a goldfish at home?   Dave: - Er ... mmm ... well yeah, I do as it happens!   Suit: - Well, it's logical to follow that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it?   Dave: - It's in a pond!   Suit: - Well then it's reasonable to suppose that you have a large garden then?   Dave: - As it happens, yes I have got a big garden!   Suit: - Well then it's logical to assume that in this town if you have large garden then you have a large house?   Dave: - As it happens I've got a five bedroom house... built it myself!   Suit: - Well given that you've built a five bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you are quite probably married?   Dave: - Yes I am married, I live with my wife and three children.   Suit: - Well then it is logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis?   Dave:- Yep! Four nights a week!   Suit: - Well then it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often?   Dave: - Me? Never   Suit: - Well there you are! That's logical science at work!   Dave: - How's that then?   Suit: - Well from finding out that you had a goldfish, I've told you about your sex life !   Dave: - I see! That's pretty impressive... thanks mate!   Both leave the toilet and Dave returns to his mate.   Stuart: - I see the suit was in there. Did you ask him what he does?   Dave: - Yep! He's a logical scientist!   Stuart: - What's that then?   Dave:- I'll try and explain. Do you have a goldfish?   Stuart: - Nope   Dave: - Wanker.

       Sent in by Justin..  Brother John entered the 'Monastery of Silence' and the Chief Priest said: "Brother, this is a silent monastery, you are welcome here as long as you like, but you may not speak until I direct you to do so."  Brother John lived in the monastery for a full year before the Chief Priest said to him: "Brother John, you have been here a year now, you may speak two words." Brother John said, "Hard Bed." "I'm sorry to hear that" the Chief Priest said. "We will get you a better bed." The next year, Brother John was called by the Chief Priest. "You may say another two words Brother John." "Cold Food." said Brother John and the Chief Priest assured him that the food would be better in the future.   On his third anniversary at the monastery, the Chief Priest again called Brother John into his office. "Two words you may say today." "I Quit." said Brother John.  "It is probably best." said the Chief Priest. "You've done nothing but fucking moan since you got here"

       Greetings all you fans out there....  Its been a while since I posted anything, but there is a good reason for it. I think the last thing I informed everyone about was the breaking up of my relationship with my girlie for the FINAL time! Well I am happy to announce that I am still single and loving it hehe, of course that is unless any nice ladies come along. I have finally managed not to get pulled in by the same old female tactic of ' But I miss you! '. No I'm now content with being alone for a while, until I meet a woman thats cool.  Anyway, 'What the hell have you been doing with yourself lately' I hear you cry! Well let me fill you in.......(especially if your an attractive bird if you know what I mean hehe).........  It all started last Friday, when Custard and myself boarded a water transport known only as the Condor Express, our destination......England, our goal.......to go SKYDIVING YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes thats right fans, I have been skydiving for four days!!! Now let me give my opinion on a common topic of skydiving 'It is better then sex' Or at least any sex that I'v had so far. The adrenalllin is STILL flowing through my veins and I havn't been able to sleep since!  I am now a CAT 2 Skydiver, and it's bloody great, this is because it has been one of my lifes ambitions to jump out of planes and it is something that I intend to do on a regular basis from now on. I can't begin to explain the rush you get when you are at four thousand feet and the door opens, only to look out and see nothing but open sky and the airfield below you, looking like a model you built as a child.  The instructer tells you to position yourself in the door, you do. Then he say 'GO!!' And you do!!!!!! The initial feeling as you freefall is beyond anything I have ever experienced in my life and it seems to last an age when it happens. Then you count....1000....2000...3000...4000...Check canopy (thats to make sure your rig has opened properly and deployed your parashute), now at this point, if your canopy is fine then all you have to do is enjoy the ride down, and thats just as fun! So there you are sailing down to earth as the dots become larger due to falling at around fourty miles and hour or so. You pull on the brakes and you slow down almost to stop in mid air, then you release the breaks and feel the rust again as the canopy rushes downwards! Next you lock the steering cords far to the left or right and start a spiral even faster downwards! Then you just keep on playing hehe. Finally you have to land and that is just as much a thrill as the rest or it!  Well I meet some real cool people over there and a few lovely ladies (jumps for joy) and I am going to go back as soon as I can afford it. Sorry that my account of my trip was brief but I now have to go to the harbour and catch a boat to 'Donkey Land'..oooppppsss....I mean 'Guernsey', sorry!!! Lifes hard lol, Baity signing off........................

       Life is shit.  Drastic statement but let me explain one little side of my life to help you understand the fevered emotions behind my mind.  "Well what's wrong?" I here you cry,  "Work" I proclaim,  "But no one likes work, apart from those weirdo's, you know the ones, Americans", I agree with your witty but true remark but counter with  "Not just work, my Boss", I sigh with resignation,   "The only way you can like your boss is if she is a part time lap dancer and wants to practice her Pole technique on you during your lunch breaks" you say, knowing that I will fantasise just such a scenario. "But mine can't even file things properly" I retort. Now I don't mean file in an obscure manner, such as by the national debt of the country the last person to deal with it last visited, or by the volume of water displaced if you feed the work to large shaven horses. But something EVEN SIMPLER THAN FILING IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER!!!! Yes, even simpler. Date order. That's right, something dated the 03-Oct-2002 is filed after, yes after 02-Oct-2002, not before, not in-between, before. I know what you’re thinking; it's a simple mistake to file it after, but NAY!! NAY!! And thrice, for continuity sake NAY!!! In any normal circumstance I might agree, but in my work we have a separate file for each day.  That file is clearly labelled that a midget nymphomaniac with an oversized forearm can read at three nautical miles away! Putting work labelled the twenty-sixth of august in the forth of September is plane STUPID.  No wonder 70% of my day is spent correcting my boss’s mistakes. No wonder I am busy, no wonder I don't have time to waste three hours a day (no exaggeration, this time) eating breakfast/lunch/afternoon snacks/chatting on the phone to mum/brothers/husband/friends on the phone/ reading books/magazines.  Roll on next month.  Did I say she has been made redundant?  Do I blame myself for bringing the above facts and more to my superiors? Did it improve for about seventy-six minutes after she had been told?  Only you can tell!  Now I have to re-order three years of filing before 5:30 tonight…..

       Ok, so we went out.. again.. that makes Friday, Saturday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Wednesday. Och.  A scary woman was stalking me last night, and it wasn't vampire girl. She was about 6 foot 5 and the size to go with it, she certainly would have whupped my ass at an arm wrestle. Never go out with a chick that could beat you in a fight, that's what I say. She came up to me and said...  Her:             "You were in Sports earlier, weren't you?" Me:              "Yeah" Her:               ................. Me:              "Well. eruhm... cya..!  I also did something exceedingly wicked and evil. A very drunk young brunette came up to me and was flirty, poking me in the ribs, etc. I responded by reaching tenderly down her back; slide my hands into her jeans and pulling her thong a good two feet up into the air. WEDGIE!!!!  Her mates gave me evils and the boys were in a foetal position on the floor with hysterics. Anyway, I bought her a drink in Follies to bury the hatchet so it's all good.  Custard, if you're out there we are all very worried about you. We know that you were playing tonsil tennis last night, and more importantly, we know whom with. I for one am scared. I hope she didn't bite if clean off when you left with her, and I hope you're not buried under somebody's patio right now. Please post a message to let us know you're OK :)  It's not very often I post something serious on here, but I have read something today that is very sobering and I'd like to draw attention to it here.  The Chinese goverment heavily censors the use of the internet, blocking sites such as the BBC and Amensty international, even Google. China is able to block sites from its citizens because there are a finite number of internet backbones running into the country, and it has control over all of them. According to Amnesty International, 33 people, including political activists, writers and follows of the  urlLink Falun Gong  (a spiritual practice similar to Taoism and Buddhism) are currently detained and being tortured for browsing internet sites or expressing their views on the internet. Some are have believed to have died in police custody.  You can read Amensty's  urlLink full report on the situation  and  urlLink what you can do to help.

       Finally I met the infamous Kate last night (no not my Kate) PK!! As she put it on her post in shut it "what a laugh".. I was only planning on going out for a couple (not expecting to the last person alive last night at 2am) so I didn't take the camera. Sorry.  I found myself at the bar in the sports bar arguing with good dougal and bad dougal whether I should buy 2 jugs of sex on the beach but luckily good dougal won!! Till the next time it was my round to buy drinks, I think good dougal had fallen unconscious by this point and two jugs of that evil cocktail appeared on the table. Well we ended up in the meat market (Follies) where I was DANCING thx guys for not stopping me. It was a really good night though Custard ended up leaving with what was explained to me as the STALKER (Please post if your still alive) I met an old friend who gave me back the camera I left in their car 2 years ago. Not to sure what the pictures are of, I think I have some pictures from the Old La Cala night club on there so I will get the film developed tomorrow and post them as soon as I can.

       Ugh.. My liver feels fucked. I was out both nights the weekend before last, the Wednesday in between AND both nights last weekend. I ended up In Zebra on Saturday and it was like Celebrity Deathmatch, but without the celebrities. I saw some 30 year old chick screaming at her boyfriend at the bar, and the poor fella was there drinking his beer and grinning. Women, eh. :P  Right, I think the time has come to reveal our mystical plan for our Christmas do. Danger's idea, and i'm helping him draw up the (laminated) rules.. it's based loosely on the book "The Diceman" by Luke Rhinehart. Basically we are going to go out, taking a few dice with us. (Benefit of being a sad role-playing geek - loads of different sided dice..) So we well have a six-sided dice for the bars we can go to.  1 - Sports 2 - Chambers 3 - Royal Yacht 4 - Trader 5 - Whorehouse 6 - er.. We must have one more.. um... Jurassic Park for comedy value  You can see where I am going with this, the places we go, the drinks we have, and even the poor, naive and unsuspecting women we unleash our libidos on - all decided on the roll of a dice. Of course we may have to scale the drinks down a bit or we'll all be fucked by 8 PM. Say a random shot an hour and normal drinks otherwise.  Also, Zoolander rules apply. No turning left, shoot-out, left hand drinking etc...etc.. Maybe even a few rounds of CHICKEN if you're good little campers.  So post your choice now, Friday or Saturday... ?  Pics from Looane..

       Little joke for you all whilst I have a mo at work...  Sam has been in the computer business for 25 years and is finally sick of the stress. He quits his job and buys 50 acres of land in Vermont as far from humanity as possible. Sam sees the postman once a week and gets groceries once a month. Otherwise it's total peace and quiet. After six months or so of almost total isolation, he's finishing dinner when someone knocks on his door He opens it and there is a big, bearded Vermonter standing there.  "Name's Enoch... Your neighbour from four miles over the ridge... Having a party Saturday... Thought you'd like to come." "Great," says Sam, "after six months of this I'm ready to meet some local folks. Thank you."  As Enoch is leaving he stops, "Gotta warn you there's gonna be some drinkin'." "Not a problem... After 25 years in the computer business, I can drink with the best of 'em." Again, as he starts to leave Enoch stops. "More 'n' likely gonna be some fightin' too." "Damn", Sam thinks... "Tough crowd." "Well, I get along with people. I'll be there. Thanks again." Once again Enoch turns from the door. "I've seen some wild sex at these parties, too." "Now that's not a problem" says Sam, "Remember I've been alone for six months! I'll definitely be there... By the way, what should I wear?" Enoch stops in the door again and says, "Whatever you want, just gonna be the two of us."

       Ok, so I did something last night I swore blind I would never do.   I went to Jurassic Park.  No, I don't mean the secret island where angry dinos run around after Jeff Goldblum. I mean the Havana Club. I know! I know! But hang on.. I was really drunk and.. ok, I know there's no excuse.. but we were in Follies and really bored and somebody that shall remain nameless (Franki) said we should go "just for a laugh".  As it happens, it was OK.. it's actually pretty big, which I didn't know, and has a stage on which you can bop around to Bryan Adams or the Sluttybabes or whatever crappy commerical shite the DJ occasionally throws on. Yes, there were some scary women in there - but it was a surprisingly mixed crowd. There was the odd honey mixing around with the MILFS, which was a very welcome sight. It just seems to be the place for people that are too bored/old/normal for Follies. I would still rather go there than Cosmopolitan.. and don't give me that crap about  "But you haven't seen the show, Toaster.. it's SO FUNNY. There's guys, that wear MAKE UP and dresses and do dances and songs and stuff!"  I don't give a fuck. Gay doesn't bother me at all. Camp and scary bothers me.  Plans are afoot for the christmas Toaster Files night out. Danger has had a STUNNING idea, sure to chaos lots of chaos and liver abuse. I'm not going to reveal the details at this early stage.. just get those TF shirts ironed boys, because it's a going to be a long, drunken december...

       Hello fans, I just want to inform all our viewers of a couple of things......  a) I have uploaded a few more pics into Baity's Spaff Wagon,  b) I would like you all to observe that there is a new link to a great website on our main page called Gias Web, this is the site for a really groovy shop in Guernsey that sells the coolest and most outragous stuff I have witnessed in the Channel Islands! I recently took a return trip to their place and once again got loads of new clothes, so check 'em out!  More from me when I next have something to say...   ROCK HARD!  ROCH HEAVY!  ROCK ANIMAL!

       Sent in by Gayle..  Stupid People  Recently, when I went to McDonald's I saw on the menu that you could have an order of 6, 9 or 12 McNuggets. I asked for a half dozen nuggets. "We don't have half dozen nuggets," said the teenager at the counter. "You don't?" I replied. "We only have six, nine, or twelve," was the reply. "So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?" "That's right." So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets.  I was checking out at the local Foodland with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those "Dividers" that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the "Divider" looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it. Not finding the bar code she said to me "Do you know how much this is?" and I said to her "I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today."  She said "OK" and I paid her for the things and left. She had no clue to what had just happened.....  A lady at work was seen putting a credit card into her floppy drive and pulling it out very quickly. When I inquired as to what she was doing, she said she as shopping on the Internet and they kept asking for a credit card number, so she was using the ATM "thingy".   I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car. Do you need some help?" I asked. She replied, "I knew I should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. Now I can't get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenient store) would have a battery to fit this?" "Hmmm, I dunno. Do you have an alarm too?" I asked. "No, just this remote thingy," she answered, handing it and the car keys to me. As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, "Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries. It's a long walk.  Several years ago, we had an Intern who was none too swift. One day she was typing and turned to a secretary and said, "I'm almost out of typing paper. What do I do?" "Just use copier machine paper," the secretary told her. With that, the intern took her last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five "blank" copies.   My neighbor works in the operations department in the central office of a large bank. Employees in the field call him when they have problems with their computers. One night he got a call from a woman in one of the branch banks who had this question: "I've got smoke coming from the back of my terminal. Do you guys have a fire downtown?"  Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy machine. The message "He's lying" was placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasn't telling the truth. Believing the "lie detector" was working, the suspect confessed.

       Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers...  Well as Dougal said we made it back in one piece. I'm surprised we actually got the flight over as we were being told several times to "calm down" and "settle" by a school-teacher like member of the Auringy ground crew. Even though they made us 45 mins late. Fuckers! So we eventually arrived and got in all the gear, the actual 60's party itself was Ok but the PA sucked ass and the Elvis impersonator didn't know any of the lyrics to "A little less conversation.." which I found criminal. But I also found a pair of slinky white panties on the stage so it wasn't all bad.  We Steve McQueen'd it about an hour later and headed down to Guernsey's Follies. It's split into two levels and is pretty cool, it wasn't sardines like ours either. We had stupid amounts of shots, tequila and apple sours, blahhh.. the bar staff in that club are supermodels. I'm getting my camera done which will hopefully have some great pics of those gorgeous ladies on it. I found love in the shape of a 30 something business-suited tattooed lady, I must have been emitting some kind of mystical birthday pheromone as she had her tongue down my throat (or was it the other way around) in about five seconds of meeting her. Awesome.  We eventually high-tailed it outta there at about 12, and went over to  urlLink Club 54 . 54 was pretty busy, and it's a wierd shaped club. I felt a little like Alice in wonderland with all the different levels of flooring, but hey, I was pretty pissed.  We quickly sniffed out a "VIP" section at the top, and tried every trick in the book to secure entry but it wasn't going to happen, a cold hearted and very business like lady bouncer wasn't having any of it:  Me: "It's my birthday" Her: "That's nice" Me: "Can I go in, as it's my birthday?" Her: "No." Me: "Can I have a hug?" Her: "Go away."  Loverat and the Scandal got champange for all of us and then things start to get a bit hazy...  I remember being handed a burger by Gristo at some greasy spoon (then disappearing with some girl.. he's got the moves!!!) , and Iots of singing, doing a few laps of the town centre and that's about it...  So mission successful, Guernsey has some good clubs and great girlies.  Here's  urlLink Scott's pictures of the night , mine will be up soon.  Then next day (despite serious hangovers) we went to an awesome little shop called  urlLink Gaia's Web .  They have some sweet clothes and lots of wierd bits, go check it out.

I have to apologise for some of the pictures, some drunken fool (Me?) knocked the focus out of place later in the night. I also wanna say a big thank the guys at Guernsey Nights  urlLink  http://groups.msn.com/GuernseyNights   if you want to look at their site you will need to register with them, but its worth it to see the pictures of their nights out. I  would also like to apologise to Custard for talking rubbish at him over the phone at some unseemly hour. I don't have a clue what I said to you!

       I have a good feeling about tonight. For those of you that don't know "The Toaster Crew" and some friends are all going over to Guernsey for a 60's Disco to celebrate Toasters Birthday we have The Afro's, The Flare's, The John Lennon style glasses and the bright colour shirts.  At this very moment Toaster is blasting 60's funk music throughout the office practising he's dance move's. I have charged the batteries on my "get your mind out the gutter" camera and will have the pictures posted as soon as we get back.  As long as we are not all locked up, in case you fail to hear from us by Monday we are relying on you or dedicated readers to come and break us out in true Steve McQueen style!

       Tanya sent this in..   Mr Cadbury and Ms Rowntree went off for the weekend. It was After Eight. She was from Quality Street He was a Fishermans Friend. On the way they stopped at a Yorkie Bar. He had a Rum and Butter. She had a Wine Gum.    He asked her name. She said Polo, I'm the one with the hole. (But I'm the one with the Nuts he thought) Then he touched her Milky Way. They checked in and went straight to the bedroom. Mr Cadbury turned out the  light for a bit of Black Magic. It wasn't long before he slipped his hand into her Snickers and felt the contrast of her Double Decker. Then he Showed her his Curly Wurly. But Ms Rowntree wasn't keen as she already had a few Jelly Babies, So she let him take a trip down Bourneville Boulevard. He was pleased as he always fancied a bit of Fudge nudging. It was a Magic Moment as she let out of scream of Turkish Delight.    When he Came out his Fun Sized Mars Bar felt a bit Crunchie. She wanted more but he Decided to take a Time Out. However, he noticed her Pink Wafers looked very appetising. So he did a Twirl and had a Picnic in her Sherbert. At the same time he gave her a Gob Stopper!      Unfortunately Mr Cadbury had to go home to his wife Caramel. Sadly, he was soon to discover he had caught V.D. It turns out Ms Rowntree had a Box of Assorted Creams. She really had been with All Sorts.

       Humm.. The joy of Mead. What a wonderful drink. I blame Baity for not introducing me to such splendours before? I am still not back into my normal sleeping habits yet. Thanks to Simon for looking after me in my state of inebriation. At least I wasn’t alone in that sentiment Friday night!!!  This Friday is rapidly approaching and I have THE BEST ever present for Toaster… I also have a brand new pair of trousers. Due to most of mine splitting in the crotch recently. I think I have upset someone recently who, instead of cutting my trousers, has gone through my wardrobe and unpicked the stitches around the one eyed python storage space.  They are due to be seen on the Great T’s Trip To Guernsey.

       Howdy Kids!  I'm back from four days of new age mind-expansion in London and it was schweet. Thanks for not breaking everything while I was away. This Friday night it's all going to be blasting off, ten lads (some of the TF crew and most of my buddies from work) are heading over to a 60's party in Guernsey for the night. We are on a misson to find good looking Guernsey girls, i've been told they are as rare as hen's teeth so the challenge has been set and photos will be posted!!  Then this Saturday we'll be back over here in full TF battle mode so lock up your daughters or Grist will fertilize them. I'll post time/place for Saturday night on here when I get my shit together. All TF readers are welcome to show up and ply us with Jose Cuervo in celebration of my 23rd year and the official start of the Christmas party season.   urlLink Here's the pictures from last saturday at the Splash.  Thanks Andy.  Competition time!! We want to see 'I love the Toaster Files' written on girl's breasts or booty, preferable while wearing a g-string. We will buy the winning lady a bottle of bubbly at Follies. Send your entries to  urlLink jcx1g3102@sneakemail.com .

       Got an E-mail from  urlLink Liane , yesterday. I only have a modem, unlike my broadband bothers on the Toaster Files so the pictures included were a bit slow to load.  The subject of the E-mail was something like “How people change” so when the first picture of a naked baby on a bed of rose petals appeared, I thought to my self, “Aww, its one of those soppy E-mails.” A few ponderous moments later and the second picture appeared of a woman on a bed of rose petals, who was quite evidently a natural blond…Unless she was very thorough with the peroxide. My thoughts at this where a mixture of “Better loosen my belt” “Thank god that my computer is in my bedroom” and “What a cool girl this is to have sent me pictures of naked women”. A few minutes had passed whilst I studied the artistic form of the prone subject when I realized that there was a third picture below it. I dually scrolled down, Tissues at the ready (I have a slight cold!!!) and the thoughts that went through my mind upon viewing the tertiary jpeg was a mixture of horror, revulsion and disgust. When I get that old I promise not to feature in any pornographic photo shoots!!!!  Anyway, Real world now. Went to the cinema in the first time in a while, Do not go to see “They”. Apart from some very clever tributes to old, proper, Suspense/horror movies (House, Psycho, American Werewolf in London) the film was ultimately crap, combining a modern day “Pitch Black” theme with a pointless excuse for modern day nightmares.  “Mr Deeds” on the other hand is worth some mindless humor in the same vein as “The Water boy” and “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo”  Not an all time best film, such as “Starship Troopers”, “Fifth Element” or “Surf Nazis Must Die”, but still worth a look.  I realize why Brett loves working in the Sports Bar, I was in there Wednesday, Sober. (I know – Sober!) And I admire Brett’s ability to rub himself up against every woman in the place on a quest to find the elusive empty glass.  Feeling peckish,  urlLink Try ordering snacks over the Internet   Bored of that, Try your skills at  urlLink the great Welsh game  (game, as in game animal… gettit?)  Bored of that,  urlLink Jazz up your Jizz  with this.  Tastes so good I bought the company!!! Ok, if you didn’t like any of those, urlLink  I will kick your arse

       Tis christmass soon, so here is a festive joke.  I will post something interesting soon....Honest.  A Russian couple was walking down the street in Moscow one night, when the man felt a drop hit his nose. "I think it's raining", he said to his wife. "No, that felt more like snow to me", she replied. "No, I'm sure it was just rain, he said".  Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major argument about whether it was raining or snowing. Just then they saw a minor communist party official walking toward them.  "Let's not fight about it", the man said, "Let's ask Comrade Rudolph whether it's officially raining or snowing". As the official approached, the man said, "Tell us, Comrade Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?". "It's raining, of course", he replied, and walked on. But the woman insisted, "I know that it felt like snow!"  The man quietly replied, "Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear"!

       Wow I did it at last.  Finished work and I didn't go for a drink afterwards.  OK I'm stealing some of Dougal’s Vodka and Coke now but I'm sure he won't mind.  I can't believe this has happened to me.  I hate the things and never wanted one in the first place but I left mine at home today and I feel a bit lost without it.  Just in case you haven't worked out what I'm talking about it's Mobile Phones.  I could never understand how people could text each other so much.  Surly you can make a quick 2 min phone call and let the other person know what you want to say rather then typing into your phone for 30 secs.  But now I find myself doing it.  I even had an argument with a girl last night over my phone.  It was pathetic and all sorts of misunderstandings were made.  Then I ran out of credit so I assume the girl just thinks I have stopped talking to her.  How are you supposed to change someone’s mind about you by typing into a phone?  I wish people were that easy to explain but we are quiet complicated creatures. I really don't understand some women.  They want to be treated like Princesses but want to treat you like a Castle servant.  I had a great weekend with Andy over.  I even gave her a lift to the Harbour on Sunday Morning so I could see more of her.  Although I think she was only present in body and not mind.  I have spent the last couple of days tidying my flat up as it looked like a clothes sorting house for Oxfam.  I won’t be embarrassed to take anyone back there now.

       I had a blast on Saturday and I was as sober as a judge, which is really scary. Custard mentioned to me at one point that he had never, ever, been on a night out with me that I wasn't drinking/drunk before. Which is REALLY scary. Over the years I must be the largest sole consumer of Jose Cuervo in Jersey, I hope the little mexican bastard appriecates my efforts.  Grist gets big love from all of us for his amazing "MJ Thriller" style make-up, which distressed the tarts no end.  Driving home, a police car pulled out behind me alone the five mile and followed me all the way up to St Peter's Bars (me doing about 20mph, hahaha..) then they flick the lights on and pull me over. It's 1:20 AM.  "Good evening sir" "Good morning, officer" "Yes.. morning. We are doing a random spot check." (I look into my mirror and examine my face. He seems to miss the subtle humor involved in this one..) "Where have you.. " "The Watersplash" "Have you -" "No, no drinks at all" "Are you the-" "The registered owner of this vehicle, yes, I am" "What would that be?" "What, the registration of my vehicle or my name?" "Name" "Adam Currie" "Thank you sir. Good night." "Thank you."  I can understand spot checks and they are a good idea, just rather bored of being pulled over now.

       My work colleague, Sabrina, was at the Splash Saturday, unfortunately she couldn’t remember any of it, wow never been *that* drunk. Anyway, Her Boyfriend of a month isn’t talking to her, and all because her brother, who was also there,  mentioned to him that she had snogged another bloke down there. Unfortunately, I saw her snogging two different men, but I didn’t want to say anything at the time… Now I am “Concerned Councilor Gristy” WTF?  Aha, If only I had my camera, I could show Sabs Photos to jog her memory :-)

       Uurg.  Head Hurt. I remember why I don’t go out that often. I drink far too much. Gristy’s handy hints # 17   Do not sleep with one white contact lens in. He, he. Im not an exebitionist, but last night was funny, all the double takes. I just wish that I had my camera. Why do I have this curse of all my camera’s getting stolen from me. The latest was taken from me by  urlLink Princess Kate and the wonderful Andy.  Please can I have it back? I will give you copies? On the same note, Andy is great as well, continuing on the Canadian girls theme. Not only does she drink proper drinks, sorry PK but wine is something you drink over dinner ;) Add to that a hand bag which could (and probably does) contain the entire population of a medium sized African state. Hope you enjoyed your stay in Jersey, We did.  Brett, I didn’t mention you in my last post because, as I said at the time, I was drunk. I also didn’t mention the big T’s stalker and the fact that she bit a pound of flesh out of custards neck in a vain (get it… Vein, Neck...) attempt to make toaster jealous. Oh, and Im a better zombie that you. Now I have to shave the rest of my head to match the bald side. And finally  urlLink something to keep Psycho amused .

       Hello all, what a shitty bloody day!!! It's the kind of day that you wish you hadn't woken up to!!! Anyway, on with the show.......went out last night with Toaster and Custard to see Princess Kate and the reknowned Andy. I was a bit worried as always to go meet a girl that I've never met before but she was totally cool! As I have said before, I only know a few people from Canada but they are all cool hehe. We all watched a film at Kate's (Save The Last Dance, for fuck sake lol, only joking) and had a general chat. Then Kate, Andy, Toaster and I headed into town to All Sports for a few drinks. Once again to my horror I saw Danger working behind the bar and this time he was dressed as a god damned zombie!!(I dunno, the things you do to get noticed mate!!!) Oh well, it was Halloween. After All Sports Kate, Andy and Big T headed to Follies, I however needed to go get some sleep for work (sorry everyone). I appreciate what PK said, I am 'Hard Core' hahahaha! I aim to please. Well hopefully all of us are going to the Splash tomorrow night (jumps up and down with a large grin) so it should be a cool night. Thats it, times up, got to go out now...

       Bearing Witness  "I Brett Danger Wickenden being of sound mind and body....  Well Sound body...  That is if you excuse the Lack of one Kidney, Broken Liver and my Lungs are probably not too healthy either. Promise to tell the Truth...  Etc. Etc.  Well I threw together a costume for last night with the help of my Brother "Dougal" and his lovely girlfriend Kate.  I grabbed an old white shirt (Why is it the undead always wear white?) and dark trousers and shredded them for a typical Zombie effect, threw some Leather armour over the top and let Kate paint my face up.  The effect turn out to be pretty good and I have photos, which I will post when they are developed.

       Phew, another hard night out on the tiles. Went to PK's first to meet Slapper McSlapperson and watch a vid, then we decided to head into town, Sports Bar and then Follies. Andy is completely mental and a total riot to be with. Mama Likey!  Got the day off today, doing my Reiki bits at the healing arts and then no doubt out again tonight.

       Ok, I have a few things to say.....  Firstly, what the hell is your nipple doing on the Shut It site Toaster??!! Secondly, it is my strong belief that Gristy has not been taken hostage! Instead it has come into my mind that he may indead have found a new girl!!! Lets look at the facts shall we...  a) He hasn't been seen for a long while, b) He hasn't spoken to anyone via phone for a while, c) He hasn't answered any of his answerphone messages, d) He hasn't riddled us with twisted sexual inuendo for a long while, e) He hasn't posted a thing for that matter in a while!!!  I think it is obvious that Gristy may have been sedused by some Mongbat of some description! And therefore it may be a good idea to change our MSN names from 'Save Custard from EverQuest campaign' to 'Where the hell is Gristy campaign'....just a thought, so let me know what you guys think.  Going back to my first point of motion, why is Adam's erect nipple on the girls site??!! I found it extremely disturbing that during one of my many daily trips to their site that I was confronted by this horrific display of our gracious leaders nipple flesh (grimaces at the thought). If only I knew how to post pics on our main page I would put something up that would put Toaster's pic to shame hehe!!!  Well thats all folks...Baity signing off.....

       I made this today for b3ta:     I had a rather quiet Christmas, watching The Office and Back to the Future on DVD, nursing a small bottle of whisky and stuffing my face with Terry's chocolate orange. Might as well make the most of it before new years resolutions and all that horrible treadmill business. I hate this void between Christmas and new year. It's like when you wake up with morning amnesia, but for a whole five days.   Grist, are you still alive? We are getting slightly worried that you have been sold to Albanian sheep herders as a sex slave.

I say don't get off with 15 gold digging slappers... get off with 15 young rich office managers!!!! I say more photos of our nights out.... I say more scantily dressed women.... I say more trips to Guernsey…. I say Toaster; you couldn't stop being a slapper if I tied you down on a raft in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!!!!!!  If 2002 taught me anything it was that I have not been having enough fun....You made me Danger this year and that is how it's going to stay.

       I am suffering from a major case of party burn-out. I feel tired and permanently hung-over, I need a trip to a health farm.. a few weeks of oil massages by young Swedish ladies and some quiet swimming in mountain lakes would go down really well right now.  It's the same old crap that everyone says coming around to New Year, but I intend to do it come 2003.  I am actually going to use that gym membership I got in November and have only been once. I am going to learn the art of moderation and alcohol. I am going to take my Cisco exam and pass it. I will stop being a slapper.  Ok, maybe not the last one.. but you get my drift.  That's why; last year was the summer of love.. and 2003 will be even better. But I propose that 2003 be about quality over quantity. Simple pleasures. Sacrificing ten pints of lager for one bottle of Laurent Perrier. Aborting four nights of mediocrity in Follies for an all night beach party on midsummer’s day. Not getting off with fifteen assorted gold digger slappers from Zebra, in exchange for some top quality lady time...  Can I get a witness ?

       Yo yo yo all,        Well, Xmas is over and done with now! The time for relentless social drinking is nearly come to a close (although I am sure that it may continue regardless!), all the presents have been unwrapped and placed at the back of deep cupboards, people are removing those metal bungs from their chimneys, Santa's (he's not real you know) one night of exercise is complete and he can continue to do fuck all and eat pies!!, the children are talking about next Xmas, parents are looking to next Xmas is disdain!..............  Yup it's going to be a new year before we know it, and we will all be reflecting back on this year and thinking of how it all passed so quickly! Remembering all those cool, funny, good, bad moments that have taken place over the last 365 days. Funny thing is that it only seems like yesterday that we were thinking the same thing about 2001!!! Is the time really flying away that fast?!  Anyway, how does one gauge how good a year has been?   a) On how many holidays you have had, b) On how much money you have made, c) On how much cool music has been released, d) On how many new friends you have made, e) On relationships that have taken place (or not), f) On how good/bad the Splash has been, g)............the list could continue!!!  Well I'm going to be judging my year by all those things and a whole lot more! Whilst it is hard to remember everything that has happened this year there are many things that come to mind.... I have been in and finished a long term relationship, and that has taught me many things which have made a difference in my life, such as how to be a better person, and also how to deal with situations that may once have been hard to deal with. Once again my year of saving money to go travelling away from this bloody island has proved fruitless due to buying new cars and drinking too much! I have had some great holidays this year, such as going away and aquiring my skydiving qualifications, and when I went away with a load of mates to England to a big roleplaying event, when the Toaster Files crew went to Guernsey for Toaster's 23rd, going on holiday with my best mate was good too! During the year I have met some really great people (especially the girls at 'Shut It' and their mates)  and also been reunited with friends of old.  Another Lord Of The Rings film has come out. The Splash has been ok, although it continues to play less and less old music, rather adopting alot of new poppy shit that has hit the music industry! I have completed my apprenticeship and am now fully qualified, hence my wage has dramatically improved.  Well I could go on but I don't want to give all my life details away! Suffice to say that taking all the good and bad things into account, my year has proved to be pretty damn cool!! A big thanks goes out to all my mates that have been there for me when I broke up with Dannii, helped me out when my car blew up lol, that shared all those great holidays with me, Custard for coming and experiencing the out of this world feeling of jumping out of planes!!!, Princess Kate and her flat mate Franki for some cool nights out, Liane and Andy for being so cool, everybody that made it to my 21st bash and made it the best birthday I have ever had!  I hope that all our readers out there have enjoyed the crap that we here at the Toaster Files have posted over the past year and that you all continue to read it! Also guys, try and post stuff on our message board as thats what it is there for, especially all our friends that have gone away or live in Canada (says with a giggle and a wink). The one thing that I try and remember is that this year hasn't just been about how good it has been for me, but I also try and think about all the things that have occured in the world over the past year. In Jersey it is all too easy to forget that there is a world out there!   Anyway, I have made my head hurt with all this thinking lark (hehehe) it's time for me to sign off....  Just remember....

       Yo yo yo all you readers out there......MERRY CHRISTMAS!  I haven't posted for a while because us Toaster Files boys have been busy playing games on the net, instead of posting!!  However, Toaster, Custard and myself went out last night to say goodbye to a good friend who is leaving Jersey today (please don't go). Thats right, my friend Franki, who I have only known for two days but am already great friends with, is leaving us here in Jersey to go back home to England, however we didn't let her go away without a good piss up first!     We were also accompanied by Danger and Princess Kate and we all went out to Chicago Rock Cafe for a boozer. Suffice to say that we went through most of the cocktail and shots lists that they had to offer! And we proceeded to get merrily drunk and then we all headed for Follies, and then Zebra Square, which happened to be closed!  So off we headed to ....... The Havana Club! Never before have I seen such cheesey dancing in town, however it ain't that bad, in some ways. After this everyone split for their separate destinations. All in all, a very cool night and a good way to say bye to a good mate. Pictures to follow once the camera gets developed.......  Baity signing off.....

       I had my work xmas party (the big one) at Hotel De France last night. It was ok but it's always the same deal, the same band playing the same tunes, the same decor, year in, year out.. the only really surprising thing is this year I not only got up on the stage to dance, I made a Evil Knevil style jump from the stage onto a speaker stack. I lasted a good three or four minutes before the security guys came over and told me to get off.   We strapped on our jet powered rocket pants and junior birdman'd the hell out of there at 11, heading down to Liquid. It seems like the prices had dropped - I bought a Tequila & Lemonade and a Bacardi and coke, and I got change from a fiver!  The VIP lounge isn't really a big deal - nice little bar but no pole dancers or anything.   I medically need a pint of water and a bacon roll.

       I have found a candidate for Jersey's scumiest bar. I have DJ'ed in Q Bar a few times and had a great night, but always on the top floor. I went in there tonight for a few games of pool with Dougal and Lady Kate, and the place is MINGING.  I asked for a coke and took it upstairs, after I took a swig I noticed that the glass had been used, there were bits of something all over the rim. It looked like somebody had given birth into it. I gagged and took it back to the bar. I asked for a clean glass and the barmaid looked at me like a pubic hair in a bowl of soup. She went to pour the coke from the scum bucket glass into a new one, and I said i'll have a new coke as well thanks..  Also the furniture has stains and fag holes all over it.  And it smells of wee.  Eugh.

       Alex, I seriously think you have WAY too much time on your hands.  So, we went to go and see the Two Towers last night.. and.. it ROCKS!  If you're a bit of a LOTR geeky type (like Baity) then you may find some things that are unlike the book. But being an ignorant and lazy  puppy, I never bothered to read that impenetrable tomb-like trilogy thus I really enjoyed it. I will not ruin the plot for you (good vs. evil, good wins, everyone is happy.. oh fuck!) but the best moments are the dwarf asking to be tossed off by Aragon and a flaming treant extinguishing it's head in river. Awesome.    Arwen's dress fell off, and low all of middle earth did rejoice.. yay!    I've been watching you for some time now, little Hobbit..     If one more person calls me Dawson Leary, i'm gonna bust some chops!

       Well we finally got into Liquid last night. We had to crawl through an air vent and then abseil into the dance floor but we did it.   Begrudgingly I admit it's actually pretty cool. As you have probably heard it's not huge inside, maybe slightly bigger than Follies, with the centre as a white oval shaped dance floor. The music is ok, commercial dancy stuff with a bit R&B thrown in.  The only issues I have with the place is:  Denim is not the work of the devil. If you think that a £20 pair of cargo pants look better than £100 jeans then you have issues, as long as you look smart and clean then you should be able to get in. I understand that all branches of Liquid are like this though, so I doubt this will change.  Why seal off the dance floor till eleven? If you're only open till two then that's just bollocks. You should be able to go dance when you first get into the club, not herded like sheep through a gate when they decide it's party time.

        Liquid nothing but a wash out   Not impressed, at all. We stand in the queue for about forty minutes, which (pictures coming) is the size of a 747. On the plus side the bouncers are handing out umbrellas which is nice. However, my beef is simple and is as follows:     Now, correct me if I am wrong, but that says designer denim welcome. I am wearing a pair of £90 Urban Stone jeans and I get refused entry because they are "too light" or some shit. If they are too busy they should just say that, instead of refusing people entry for lame reasons.  For the next week, all posts to TF will start with the line "Liquid is shit" until they impress us with free champange or something better.  In case you’re wondering, I didn't try the "webmaster of Jersey nightclubbing site.. I will post this shit on the net" line.. because, frankly I’d rather not go to a club that is so superficial it only lets you in if you're wearing designer clothes.

       Fuck. I wish I hadn't started reading that while I was eating my dinner. Thanks John.  Myself, Dougal and Lady Kate (Dougal's missus) are off to BANFF Canada baby, January 4th. They are skiing and I’m snowboarding. I have been a few times before, French Alps, New Zealand and Bulgaria. Bulgaria rocks - loads of really cheap beer (a pitcher for the equivalent of about 30 pence.. get pissed on a fiver, yes please!) and miles of bootleg CD's and knock-off clothes.  New Zealand was fun as well, until I fell off a chair lift. I had just lifted the safety barrier and I was perching one butt-cheek off the side, when I lost my balance and fell about 15 feet onto the deck, landing with a nasty "oomph!" sound. A sympathetic ski instructor helped me up.  Also on the same trip we got all three emergency services out during a drinking binge. Myself and the guys I was travelling with bought a shed load of booze and started drinking with some Japanese in the hostel. That's the great thing about drinking games, it breaks down cultural barriers.  So several bottles of spirits later, we hit the streets and try and walk up about 100 yards to a club. However most of us our now completely steaming, and one guy (from Kent, I think his name was Paul) has passed out on the pavement. Not good. So this passing police car pulls over and they an ambulance. Eventually the paramedics arrive and take Paul down the hospital. The cops are thinking about arresting us but I persuade them not to and say I’ll take everyone back to the hostel. I look around and one of the Japanese has slid into the front seat of the ambulance and is about the turn the sirens on. Sweet Jesus.  I go to bed and in the morning I found out somebody pulled the fire alarm for a laugh and got the fire service out as well. Hat trick! :P

       I got sent this from someone and though there was great truth in it....enjoy!!!  Right then.  Do not read this if you're of a  sensitive nature. Do not read  it if you find taking a dump to be just part of every day life and something  that should never be mentioned or discussed.  Do not blame me.  You have been warned.  Thank you for your attention.    The Perfect Dump Every once in a while, each of us experiences a perfect dump, it's rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects.  You sit down expecting the worst, but what  you get is a smooth sliding, fartless  masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that's not the end of it. You  use some toilet tissue only to find that it  was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel  that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it.  The Caesarian Dump Pain! That's what this dump and childbirth have in common. Its simply a case of too much dump trying to go through too small  a hole, and there's no obstetrician to  help.  The Beer Dump Talk  about nasty dumps. Depending on the dumper's tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of too many beers. it could have  been 2 or 22, it doesn't matter. What you get  is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump  accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.  The Chili Dump Hot  when it goes in, and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chili dump stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a  heat shield.  The Cable Dump Long, curly and perfectly formed like 2 feet of E13 telephone CO- axial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a  friendly serpent. You notice it has three  rest rings encircling it. You wonder  admiringly, "DID I DO THAT? Where did it come from?" You leave the bathoom pleased with yourself.  The Latrine Dump In case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, boy scouts and flies  go to dump. Tip: Don't ever, ever look in the  hole.  The Mona Lisa Dump This is the masterpiece of dumps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that  would make da Vinci weep. And just think, you  made it yourself. You may even want to break  out the Polaroid, but maybe that's going a bit too far.  The Empty Roll Dump You're done...you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins  coldly in your throat. You could use the  curtains...no, someone would say "Where are  the curtains?" Then what would you say? The rug?...too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that  every "empty roll dumper" must face...Pull up  your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle  yourself to the nearest full roll.  The Splash  Back Dump You send the dump on its way, it  drops like a depth charge into the bowl  creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet  and embarrassed. Tip: Blot instead of  wiping.  The Aborted Dump You are in mid-dump when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off, go for the phone, and save the rest  for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta  do what you gotta do.  The Alfresco Dump Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the  nature, and a good bush all contribute to the  peaceful ambiance that our primitive  forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of brownies or a patch of  poison ivy.  The Childbirth Dump This is a dump that is simply too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for the purpose. You sit there,  thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts,  and it isn't going to get any better. You  wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming "Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf". You realise you'll have to  resolve the crisis before you can leave the  bathroom. Basically there are only three  things you can do: 1. Scream 2. Call an Obstetrician 3. Hope like hell you have enough Vaseline to get you through it.  The Tijuana Trot Dump The phrase "Shit Happens" really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with  your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins.  For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if  you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a foetal position. Now you realise  why Mexico never had a navy.  The Machine Gun Dump You're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of the sudden you emit a group o noisy gassy bursts  that break the silence like machine gun fire.  The guy in the next stall hits the floor like  a combat veteran cradling his umbrella like an M16...damn commies.  The Sound Effect Dump You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever  techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you  are about to emit. Timing is obviously very  important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: 1. Flush the toilet 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem 3. Drop a  handful of quarters on the floor  The Security Dump You have enough on your mind when you're in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting  in to find you in mid-dump mode. So how can  you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from  taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this...hum loudly.  Th Cling-On Dump For the most part you've completed your dump, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're  getting impatient. Someone else wants to use  your stall. So, you grip the seat with both  hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like canned peach between you and the bowl  water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently  on the door has scissors.  The Houdini Dump You go, then you stand up to flush, and the darn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the  pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it  lurking out of sight? Should you wipe...maybe  you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes  in.  The Flu Dump You  feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave  of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so  you stand up and cramps squeeze your  intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down up down. Don't you wish Mum were close by?  The Porta-Pottie Dump Construction workers and outdoor concert goers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best  description would be, "Its like taking a shit  in an upright coffin". It's claustrophobic  and it smells bad...best advice...go in a paper cup.  The Proctologist Dump In the beginning, the lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump,  because there is nothing biblical about it,  you run out of gas. That's right, you run out  of propulsion. The dump is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a  lump of lead. You've only got two choices  here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back  up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself.  Not a pretty picture is it??  The Whole Roll Dump No matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times  too. The whole episode is consumer  waste.  The Graffiti Dump You flush the dump and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the porcelain sides,  scraping a creative squiggle on its way down.  You flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love it or leave it. Its your choice.  The Encore Dump Ahhhh, you're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the bathroom when you  feel another dump coming. You have to return  for a curtain call. The world's record is  seven encores.  The Born Again Dump This is a dump that's going so badly, you say "Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion" you always get  through it, but seldom keep the promise you  made in desperation, because a born again dump  is like childbirth...you forget the pain quickly.

       Went to the new cinema again yesterday. Afterwards we were waiting outside for a friend to get picked up, Bored as I was, I cast my eyes above the new KFC and saw some bright lights… Curious, I wondered round the corner to see where it was coming from, everyone saying that I couldn’t go that way. Course I could! In fact I wondered round and found the Chicago Rock Café place, complete with blaring music and full of the new staff training in dance moves!!! (it don’t open for a another couple of days) Anyway. Considering that someone I know was in there, dancing, badly, we waited, watched and laughed. All in Jerseys Fabulous sub zero temperatures. When Linda finally came out from dance practice (sorry hon, you’ll never get on Popstars), we were ushered round the corner again and in through a door, up some stairs and into the brand new nightclub Liquid, that opens tomorrow. See, its not what you know, its who. And I am doubly blessed knowing the TF crew (creep) Preliminary report…  First of, we entered. No trainers. Even though all the adverts state that you can “Be Smart, Be casual, be yourself”.  Bloody hypocrites. The cloakroom bit was weird, they asked us to write our initials on the half of the ticked that they keep, why? I can only assume that if you loose the ticket you can still get your jacket back with a drunken scrawl that bears no resemblance to your initials. The Polish bird behind the desk wasn’t exactly a wonder bra advert material either. Upon entering the club proper, it seemed more like the breeze bar or any other “trendy” bar that likes to keep bottles of brightly coloured alcoholic liquids stacked in a pyramid lit from behind with a 600 watt bulb. Oh and everything was white… One wall was made of four convex panels with windows. Through the windows was the dance floor but it was closed for the first half an hour (cramming as many people into the first bar). Then the four panels rotated in on themselves to form four lens shaped pillars opening up the rest of the club I was… disappointed. I dunno, I was expecting something better, not just Follies in white! No kidding, Its about the same size but without the raised bits. The dance floor itself looks more like an ice skating rink. The chill out bit was at the far end of the club, right next to the floor, not very chillouty. It even had a slot machine right next to the floor! Seats are furnished in white leather? Remember how long the walls in Zebra remained mank free? The VIP lounge hadn’t been completed. All in all, not impressive apart from the fact that its white (as apposed to black for every other club – hides the dirt) and that there are more lights than Santa’s airport runway. The DJ box had the most impressive bit. A touch screen for projecting a spacey computer generated video onto the walls above the dance floor, but was sparkly used by the computer illiterate DJ  who spent the night trying to play some 8-track dance music… In conclusion. White, bright but otherwise like every other town night club.

       Ok, now thats just toooo wierd for me. Second day back at work after nearly two weeks off when I didnt get chance to do anything and what happens??? This wierd white stuff is falling from the sky! and Baity is not spaffing off Sand street carpark! I dunno, It just aint right you know, It should only snow in January when we have all just gone back to school for a couple of weeks. The Radio and Tv would be telling us that there is 0.000000000001 mm of snow fall and therefore its two dangerous for those people in the sticks (St. Marys/St Ouens..) to travel and therefore Schools are closed!  But no.  Work still goes on.  but here is a simulation of  urlLink THE STUPID PEOPLE ON THE ROADS . but this time you get to drive!!! (see no mention of women driving...)

       So I decided to give my liver a night off last night. I've had two Christmas parties on Thursday and Friday, and I was SO tired.   On Thursday night we were at a little swanky bar/restaurant and had been waiting AGES for our main course, like 3/4 of an hour or something. So eventually our steaks arrive and we wolf them down like crazed cannibals. Some of the other peeps still didn't have their chicken or whatever they had ordered, but Andy calls over the little Polish waitress and asks her if she has any jelly for dessert. She smiles unknowingly and says she'll ask the chef. So she scoots into the kitchen, and the next minute we hear shouting and pots and pans being banged around. I thought there was always room for jello :P

       Adam mate I couldn't agree with you more! I have the upmost respect for all the women out there, and I try my upmost not to piss them off with my posts (not that I post nasty things about them anyway). Basically your point is very true.....'If you don't like what you read, especially if you have had an encounter with one of the lads, then don't read the site!'  Now to show that we at the Toaster Files aren't nasty bitter people towards our critics I have attached a picture of Custards assailant to prove that we jest not!!!

       So I have this irate phone call from the girl Custard got off with on Wednesday. She's pissed off that I posted about it on the site.  I feel at this juncture I should reiterate the function of the Toaster Files to all our readers.  We are a group of friends first and foremost. We tell each other everything. Girls, don't even start moaning about this because we KNOW for sure, that generally, the minute you have slept/snogged/groped/whatever with a guy you've already txt'd it to about 40 of your mates with location, time, girth, etc.. and any other details that you think may be of interest.  This is not a bad thing.  Women do this, and women are (generally) good. A world without women would be a very sorry place indeed.  So you have to accept that (while we don't mention names, to respect people's identity) we have every right to post our thoughts and experiences on this site. That includes the places we go, the drinks we have, even if we get lucky or not. We may even illustrate our point with diagrams and line graphs if required.  If you don't like this, don't read our site and do not stick your tongues down our throats. :)  I have more pictures to post of last Friday night, but I haven't used up my disposable completely so i'm going to hang on till Thursday. Being the social butterflies we are, we have managed to secure some tickets to the launch of Liquid and Chicago Rock cafe, woo-hoo!

       Fuckers Fuckers Fuckers!  I just thought I would post a message to let everyone know that I am still alive. I was away in Guernsey last weekend and I managed to get caught over there for an extra two days due to extremely bad fog!  Luckily my work did not ask me to use my holidays to cover the extra time off because it counts as 'Extenuating Circumstances' haha! Well I tried to meet some of the dudes from Gaia's Web shop in Guernsey for a drink whilst I was there but unfortunately I ended up being in the wrong pub, which sucked! Ho-hum nevermind, I got a stack of stuff to do but I shall post more soon. Off to the SPLASH for the first time this year, this weekend!  Baity signing off......

       For thousands of years, men have tried to understand the rules "When dealing with women". Finally, this merit/demerit guide will help you to understand just how it works. Remember, in the world of romance, one single rule applies:  “Make the woman happy”.   Do something she likes, and you get points. Do something she dislikes and points are subtracted. You don't get any points for doing something she expects. Sorry, that's the way the game is played.  Here is a guide to the points system:   SIMPLE DUTIES  You make the bed..............................................+1 You make the bed, but forget to add the decorative pillows.... 0 You throw the bedspread over rumpled sheets...................-1 You leave the toilet seat up..................................-5 You replace the toilet paper roll when it is empty............ 0 When the toilet paper roll is barren, you resort to Kleenex...-1 When the Kleenex runs out you use the next bathroom...........-2 You go out to buy her extra-light panty liners with wings.....+5 in the snow...................................................+8 but return with beer..........................................-5 and no liners.................................................-25 You check out a suspicious noise at night..................... 0 You check out a suspicious noise and it is nothing............ 0 You check out a suspicious noise and it is something..........+5 You pummel it with a six iron.................................+10 It's her cat..................................................-40   AT THE PARTY  You stay by her side the entire party......................... 0 You stay by her side for a while, then leave to chat with a work colleague................................................-2 Named Tiffany.................................................-4 Tiffany is a dancer...........................................-10 With breast implants..........................................-18   HER BIRTHDAY  You remember her birthday..................................... 0 You buy a card and flowers.................................... 0 You take her out to dinner.................................... 0 You take her out to dinner and it's not a pub.................+1 Okay, it is a pub.............................................-2 And it's all-you-can-eat night................................-3 It's a pub, and it's all-you-can-eat night....................-10   A NIGHT OUT WITH THE BOYS  Go with a mate................................................ 0 The mate is happily married...................................+1 The mate is single............................................-7 Not for long - it's his buck's night..........................-10 He has a liking for Kings Cross establishments................-50   A NIGHT OUT WITH HER  You take her to a movie.......................................+2 You take her to a movie she likes.............................+4 You take her to a movie you hate..............................+6 You take her to a movie you like..............................-2 It's called Death Cop III.....................................-3 Which features Cyborgs that eat humans........................-9 You lied and said it was a foreign film about orphans.........-15   YOUR PHYSIQUE  You develop a noticeable beer gut..............................-15 You develop a noticeable beer gut & exercise to get rid of it..+10 You develop a noticeable beer gut and resort to loose jeans and baggy Hawaiian shirts......................................-30 You say, "It doesn't matter, you have one too."................-800   THE BIG QUESTION  She asks, "Does this dress make me look fat?"

       Christ I’m bored.  Custard is off snowboarding in Italy, Baity is in Guernsey for the weekend killing orcs, Dougal is busy doing something I don't know if I’m allowed to talk about, Danger is busy moving into his new gaff, Grist is.. well, nowhere to be seen.. I decided to try and watch a "proper" movie for a change. No explosions, big breasted girls in tight tops etc.. Gosford Park, a period murder mystery drama thing. A friend had seen it and said it was awesome, so I thought I’d give it a go.. and it sucks ass. A third of the way in, people are still busy talking about Lady Vage's new model A Ford or some shit, an old guy gets stabbed and Stephen fucking Fry turns up as the police inspector. That's the straw that broke that camel's back, that is.   I think I’m going to head into town and buy a playstation 2 and Vice City. I heard you can KO prostitutes and nick their money in it. Now that's my definition of high-brow entertainment.

       Firstly, I would like to say that the details below on peoples names are only half correct. I don’t kill small animals and  urlLink Andy  has not got small breasts. On the other hand, I don’t have any friends or life and any girl that drinks pints and isn’t a psycho butch lesbian has to be cool.  Secondly, Someone post details on how the hell our resident Alex got some girl to snog him last Friday?  Thirdly, Why is it I get pins and needles in my feet after 20 minutes on the cross trainer down the gym? Apart from the running machine, it’s the only thing I don’t need to strap my size 14s into (or try – the bikes just cant handle my trainers)  Fourthly, What is a turkey nibbler?  Fifthly, why do car mechanics try to rip you off when you know that they are lying through their teeth?  Sixthly, Monkey Magic was on TV last night. Why was it not advertised. It was on so late that I fell asleep during.  Seventhly, Why wont any women help we with my experiments into tantric sex.  Eighthly Why is the duckbilled platypus such a screwed up animal?  Ninthly, Why am I considered just a number?  I am a Free Man!!!

       Ah balls to censorship man!!! Message to the Wickenden's....Brett is a dark horse, a reaper of corruption, a madhouse of chaos....and a fairy! (see I am nice to my followers). (ONLY JOKING)  Ok lets sum up the period which I have been quiet. Um..what have I been doing??? Right well Toaster is back so I am now just Baity again..well maybe 2nd in command Baity, yeah that's cool!  It's good to have Adam back though, we did miss him, and now he is back we can all go out and behave badly again. It seems to have been ages since I have gone out and done anything, probably due to the fact that I have banished myself to my house in an effort to save money! Anyway, we did all go out last week. We all went to Chicago Rock Cafe with some of our mates that came across the waters from Guernsey (Nick and Mark yo). The night kicked off with a grand Chinese meal, then once we got to CRC we just partied the night away! Yes the Vodka got flowing, well it did for me anyway, and well...maybe a bit of tequila too. Now as usual Toaster started eyeing up the girls present, ok we all did, and he smoothly made his way into the throng to attempt pull, followed closely by Custard (now theres a surprise!!!), I really don't know how they do it! Maybe I should stop being the shy twat and get in there!!! The rest of the night was great.  Ok so I am attempting to grow my hair longer now, after having a shaved head for the last 6 years! I am kinda in that phase where I usually say "Fuck it!" and get it shaved again doh! However, I am actually ok with it at the moment, although a few people are protesting that I should shave it again. Thing is I just wouldn't mind being able to go to the SPLASH and headbang properly for a change! Plus I feel like I just want a change for once, does that make sense???  Now I heard that the SPLASH re-opened last week and it was ok, although they are still playing the same old stuff (which is getting a bit dull). That's right, I didn't attend the re-opening, the reason why? Simple, I couldn't be arsed! Yep that's right, I couldn't be arsed to go to the SPLASH. (what's wrong with me? I dunno).  Finally to wrap things up, I am heading over to Guernsey this weekend to go see all my mates over there. To be honest I would like to go to Guernsey for more than just a weekend sometime this year, it's kinda growing on me. Just when I go over there I have met some really cool people like all the LARP guys, and all the guys at GAIA'S WEB, cheers to Lyndz for replying to my E-mails, (if your ever in Guernsey then go check it out!).   I will hopefully start a new photo album soon, need some new material!  Although I have plans hehehehe! Ok I am probably ranting now so catch you all soon,  Baity signing off.........

       Might just be me, but what is a “t***er”?  Is it a Tadger, Todger, Tinker Tonker Taylor (oops, don’t end in “er”) Twanker (Too many letters) Twater (Bit like a smelly, wet jumper…) Twoter (Clutching at straws here)  I just don’t get it. Calling someone and shouting “You’re a twat” at them, I understand. But to shout “You’re a Turner!” ???? What you want a prize? What is a T***er? What are those other three letters. Even if it isn’t three letters but more or, heaven forbid! Less letters, what derogative insult starts with “T” and ends on “ER”? I know one that starts with W and ends with ER but none with a T at the start. Either I’m missing the obvious or someone just doesn’t speak English!

       Not sure if you have seen this already but this always makes me laugh.  CUNNING REVENGE  For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day and you just need to take it out on someone!!!  Don't take that bad day out on someone you know, take it out on someone you DON'T know!!!  I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered nicely saying, "Hello?" I politely said, "This is Patrick Hanifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?"  Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly.  After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again. When the same person once more answered, I yelled "You're a t***er!" and hung up.  Next to his phone number I wrote the word "t***er," and put it in my desk drawer.  Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer, and I'd yell, "You're a t***er!" It would always cheer me up.  Later in the year the phone company introduced caller ID. This was a real disappointment for me, I would have to stop calling the t***er. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number, then heard his voice, "Hello."  I made up a name. "Hi. This is the sales office of the telephone company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?"  He went, "No!" and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're a t***er!"  The reason I took the time to tell you this story, is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it.  Just dial 0171 823-4863.  Keep reading, it gets better.!   CHAPTER 2   An old lady at the shopping centre really took her time pulling out of the parking pace. I didn't think she was ever going to leave. Finally, her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. Great, I thought, she's finally leaving.  All of a sudden this black BMW came flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulled into her space. I hit the horn and started yelling, "You can't do that. I was here first!"  The guy climbed out of his BMW completely ignoring me. He walked toward the shopping centre as if he didn't even hear me. I thought to myself, this guy's a t***er, there sure are a lot of t***ers in this world.  I noticed he had a "For Sale" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number.  Then I hunted for another place to park.  A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just got off the phone after calling 823-4863 and yelling, "You're a t***er!" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.)  I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black BMW lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy too. After a couple of rings someone answered the phone and said, "Hello." I said, "Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?"  "Yes, it is."  "Can you tell me where I can see it?"  "Yes, I live at 182 West street, London. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front."  I said, "What's your name?"  "My name is Don Hansen."  "When's a good time to catch you, Don?"  "I'm home in the evenings."  "Listen Don, can I tell you something?"  "Yes,"  "Don, you're a t***er!" And I slammed the phone down.  After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer. For a  While things seemed to be going better for me. Now when I had a problem I had two t***ers to call. Then, after several months of calling the t***ers and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution:  First, I had my phone dial t***er #1. A man answered nicely saying, "Hello." I yelled "You're a t***er!", but I didn't hang up. The t***er said, "Are you still there?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Stop calling me."  I said, "No."  He said, "What's your name, Pal?"  I said, "Don Hansen."  He said "Where do you live?"  "182 West Street, London. It's a yellow house and my black BMW's parked out front."  "I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your prayers."  "Yeah, like I'm really scared, t***er!" and I hung up.  Then I called t***er #2. He answered, "Hello."  I said, "Hello, t***er!"  He said, "If I ever find out who you are..."  "You'll what?"  "I'll kick your arse."  "Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, t***er!" And I hung up.  Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was at 182 West Street, London and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as I got home. I climbed into my car and headed over to West Street to watch the whole thing.  Glorious!  Watching the two t***ers kicking the crap out of each other before being arrested was one of the greatest experiences of my life!

       Very strange night.. had a great time in Chicago Rock and Liquid, then went down to the Weighbridge for a taxi. Too very drunk young Scottish girls approached me...   "Wherz are youz goin', wez should share a taxi!" they were pretty cute, so I thought.. yeah, fuck it.. so the first one got dropped off around the corner and they spent about ten minutes saying a very emotional goodbye. ("I fucken lovez yooooou! uzz a babe alroght?" "I lovez you more yoooou!")  So then it's just me and this little Scottish brunette, heading around to hers. We start talking about chill-out music and I say I like Morcheeba a lot, and she says she has the CD and would Iike to come in for a drink and listen to it.... so i say yes.. we arrive at her place. She is lodger with an older guy. The place is a bomb site, wallpaper peeling off the walls and a serious damp problem. It's like Laurence Llewyn-Bowen's worst nightmare. Except the guy is obviously in IT as he has a computer rig worth about 3k, and about 10k worth of home cinema gear. Weird.  So I get a cup of tea and sit down, while the girly sticks on the Morcheeba CD. She is tweaking various buttons on the amp to get the sound on, then she passes straight out, hitting the deck with a thud.  I sit there for a few seconds, not completely sure what to do. I utter a rather pathetic.. "Umm... hello?" and she doesn't move. I go over and check her pulse, breathing etc.. then put her in the recovery position and walk back home. I sure do pick 'em.  Please check out my new poll, I am giving you, our beloved readers, a chance to influence my love life.

       Ok, I am back.. what a great holiday. We had a blast, We were a little slack with the snowboarding/skiing somedays, we went to the Barbary Coast (the best bar in the world) and had an all day bender, flirting with the waitresses (me) and thrashing the locals at pool (Dougal).  But we have all improved lots, I can now handle all green, blue and a few black runs.. and some basic jumps etc.. Dougal is lighting fast on his skis and Lady Kate has mastered her turns and did great.  However the trip back was a fucking nightmare. I have flown back from New Zealand direct to Jersey and this was worst. Monarch airlines suck ass. We were waiting at the check in desk for ages with nobody there for about twenty minutes. Eventually somebody showed up and checked us in. We knew that the Airbus A330 we were supposed to be flying back on had gone tech (engine faliure) so we had to some back on a A300 instead, which doesn't have the same fuel capacity as the A330 (see what happens when your whole family is in aviation, you get geeky like this) so we needed to refuel in Goose Bay.  So we were eventually left about four hours late, and had to stop in Goose Bay for fuel about two hours. Goose Bay really is the middle of nowhere. There's a air force base and that's it.  The flight from Goose ay to Gatwick was pure hell. The seats in the A300 were packed in so tight and close I felt like a battery hen. Dougal and Kate fell asleep easily enough but I couldn't. I checked my watch. They had a program on Burger King on the TV. I checked my watch.  The toilet was occupied. I checked my watch. Empires rose and fell. I checked my watch. Stars were born and died, going super nova somewhere far away outside our steel tube. I checked my watch. Ice ages frooze and thawed over. I checked my watch.  Just when I was about to try and hang myself with the little pair of crappy headphones I was given, we landed in Gatwick. Thank fuck for that. Dougal and I rushed to the bar for a emergency blood/alcohol level improvement, and found the taste of a Gatwick pint of Heinkein rather like a pint of cat urine compared to Canadian Kokanee. Eesh.  I am now waiting for my jet lag to wear off, and trying to find somewhere that'll ship me a crate of Kokannee and some Canadian babes to serve it.

       Baity, what the fuck have you been smoking? If anyone mentions nipple donkeys or arse chickens again they will be sucked out of the TF airlock, into the vacuum of cyberspace.  The snowboarding and skiing has been giving a rest today due to a dangerous drinking session last night. Myself and Dougal ended up in a club called "Aurora".  The music was, frankly, rather awful to start off with. A mix of drum and bass and Luther Vandross. However they started playing a bit of hip-hop later on. Boosted by a few double T&L's I took my place upon the stage and began to stoke the fires of the soul train. I made friends with some homeboys (called Chad, Brad and er.. something) and showed them a few of my dangerous b-boy moves. Later I indulged in some of the gyrating that homeboys do. Which basically involves finding a willing (or very drunk) young lady and rubbing your crutch in a circular motion around her botty. It was fun.  Dougal and I have distressed many people, not least the waitresses that told us our 'plates were very hot so be careful' then we instantly tried to press each others hands on them and burn each other.  I think we have drunk Banff dry of most of it's Kokanee (the local brew) and gave the locals a damn good thrashing at pool, even with their silly rules.  Anyway.. i'm offski for another beer as i'm starting to sober up.

       Geeze, Baity! Toaster leaves for a couple of days and you get delusions of grandeur. Add the fact that you got your chemistry set out the other day and threw some copper cobalt and other chemicals together to boil up a concoction that seems to have wiped  the memory of Danger and PK, leaving them dribbling idiots that follow you like lost sheep.  Please don't tell me you have involved them in some bizarre sexual experiment? The Cult of Lord Baity is, by its very nature, dangerous. I plead that you come to your senses and wake up. You do not want this, really. It may seem nice to brainwash followers, but they have friends and families that care for them. Friends and Families that may come looking for them. Upset people with guns! You know its happened in Texas before, Don't let it happen in Jersey.  Alternatively, you have been taken over by a megalomaniac symbiotic snake alien that controls your body and makes your eyes glow and gives you a strange desire to travel to Egypt.  I know which one is the truth and there is only two alternatives.  Danger and PK will try to defend you but only because they are not in there right minds.

           Looks like our international relations with Canada are in doubt at the moment due to an opinion about their accents (What do you expect people from a 3rd world country to sound like?). I will of course make it my duty to try and sort this out on Thursday when PK comes back. I have already started with this, as PK was lucky enough to receive a phone call off me at 1:30am this morning.

       HIGH DECREE FROM ACTIVE COMMANDER BAITY, HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL!  Hail oh good little man servant Danger, I would like to thank you for your obvious concern as to the identity of this so-called Adam Currie, I also was very dubious to hear from this strange character! What I found out was this....  'Many many many years ago (about 23 years) there once lived a 'Nipple Donkey', somewhere in the craggy peaks of the Himilayen mountains. Now this Nipple Donkey was named Chuck, Chuck the Nipple Donkey, and he was a very lonely Nipple Donkey for he knew of no other Nipple Donkey's in the immediate vacinity of the mountainside! He was very very sad :o(   Chuck the Nipple Donkey spent many a day walking around the rocky peaks on his own, humming lament tunes to himself about the days when he was a mere Nipplet (aaahhhhh bless), sometimes he would even jot down some harmonic melodies in his notebook, but not just any ordinary notebook, no it was a 'Notebook Especially Designed For Use By Nipple Donkey's'. Occasionally he would go and bathe in the calm rapids on the mountainside, and sometimes even take a dump in said rapids, if the need took him. But still he longed for a companion, a friend, a fuck! (well he was male).  The years passed, and Chuck began to get old, and began to lose hope of finding a soulmate. For many years he had tried to make relationships with alot of creatures he had met over the years, Badgers, Antilopes, Geese, Anchovies, Hedgehogs, Ants, Wasps (a notable failure resulting in a very swollen falas), he had even tried to befriend a swordfish he had met in a large lake!! But after many failures he realised that there just was no other life sustaining organism, that he could really identify with (aaahhh bless).  Now as Chuck the Nipple Donkey became old and yellow (for when Nipple Donkey's become old, they go yellow, not grey!), he despaired at not finding a soulmate, and not being able to spread his seed so that he would be remembered. So he travelled to the highest peak of the mountains, where he planned to jump from and sore like an eagle to his own paradise in the sky. However (drums rolling) as he perched himself on the edge the the rocky peak he heard a sort of squeeking sound coming from a cave not so far away, and it was a strange squeeking sound!  Chuck decided to put off the 'Big Leap Of Faith' as it later became known, and went to investigate the source of these noises. Lo and Behold, when he searched the cave he came across the most beautiful creature he had ever set eyes upon, an 'Arse Chicken'!!! But not just any Arse Chicken, no! For this was 'Muffy the Arse Chicken', and queen of all Arse Chickens (there aren't many), and she too was all so lonely!  So as it came to chance, Chuck the Nipple Donkey and Muffy the Arse Chicken accompanied each other in treking the mountainsides and they were gleeful for many years.  After many many many more years they decided that they had spent so much time together without getting totally bored of each others sight, that they made the decision to start trying for a little Nipple Chicken/ Arse Donkey (noone would ever know the difference between the two!).  They boinked and shagged, and rubbed together, and sat in each others cabbage patch, and sucked each other dry, and even drank out of the same stream! And AT LAST! Muffy declared that she was expecting Chuck's little Nipplet Arsey Thingy! YAY!!! YAY!!! YAY!!!  However (more rolling drums), before any more of this story got told, the writer decided that he was very very fucking bored of his latest creation and .......................................................................................................................................................................................'   Now to get back to your question Danger, I made many enquiries and much investigation as to whom Adam Currie actually is, and it was discovered that he may in actual fact be the offspring of the two strange beings told of in the above story!!! Although I cannot say for sure, hope this helped to resolve your question. Now as for our man Toaster complaining about how cold the SNOW!! is, I cannot comment other than to say 'You Plonker Toaster!' of course it's fucking cold, your surrounded by SNOW. We can all bitch at him when he gets back, on the subject of the 'Great Canadian Accent Scandal' as I have here-by named it.

       King Baity who is this Strange person "Adam Currie" Posting to YOUR site?  Iv'e Just been on the phone to PK and she is very offended by his slating of Canadian Accents and Ice Hockey.  Also... He has gone Skiing in Canada and is complaining because it's cold?  Maybe he did not read the small print about Snow in the holiday Magazine.  I'm sure you have a perfectly good explination Your Highness.

       Ah ha.. I see that our cutting edge political debate hasn't frozen over with my absence. Unfortunatly my face has, because today Canada is FUCKING COLD.  I mean, icle face stabbing, blood freezingly fucking cold. However I have had a few days of great snowboarding. I can now handle all greens and most blue runs with ease. Yesterday I did a spectacular bail. I was at the top of a really steep run, and our instructor, Forrest (yes, his real name - much piss ripping by me.. AND he looks the spit of Fred Durst) said we could handle it. Like a lamb to the slaughter, I went down first.. I carved once, twice, three times.. then fell on my ass and slid about 60 foot down the mountain side in a ball of snow and limbs. I eventually came to rest besides sniggering group of skiing children. Oh, the humanity.  In Canada, there is a law that states all bars must have at least 5 maple leaf flags, 4 pairs of antique skis and a minimum 400 photographs of ice hockey players.   The Canadian accent is simple and mildly irritating, and involves changing any "o" to an "ooou" and ending every sentance with "eh?", eh?  The TV is four channels of ice hockey, three channels of figure skating, a couple of annoying teeny-bopper music channels and, bizarrely, strong man competitions.  However in spite of this small cultural differences I am having a blast. The beer is cold, the women (especially waitresses) are really hot. I haven't fallen off any chair lifts yet either.  I am still in need of a couple of decent nights out on the sauce. Most nights I have been so knackered from snowboarding I have barely had the strength to eat my dinner, let alone perform some of my more complex dance moves.  Here's my 2 cents on the cat v dog thing..  Dogs are good for unconditional, completely stupid and utterly adoring love. Good for girls that are on the rag, for example. Cats however, provide hours of enterainment by falling off furniture, killing small animals and ignoring you.  But most importantly, cats make better eating.  Toaster signing off, peace and love to all, man.

       GREETINGS ALL, FROM ACTING COMMANDER BAITY:  With regards to 'Cats or Dogs'......  Why Dogs are shit......  a) Because they bark, b) Because they smell,  c) Because they leave bigger shits than cats, d) Because half of their breeds are no more than sloppy, drewling, yappy gobshites, e) Because sniffing your arse and licking your bollocks is fucking annoying (only acceptable if its a young woman, not a bloody dog), f) Because they suck buffallo cock, g) Because they eat children for breakfast g) Because they only carry alcahol around their necks in cold mountainous regions, and not near my home    oh and... h) Because I was once bitten by a St.Bernards!!!  Why cats are far supreme....  a) Because they are, b) Because they are cute when young, c) Because they mostly MMMEEEOOOWWW relitively quietly as opposed to most dogs annoyingly loud Barks, d) Because they are far more hard than dogs, for example lions, cheetahs etc etc, e) Because they also wish to take over the world, f) Because they don't smell, g) Because they will rip out any intruders throat with a mere stare, h) Because their evil stares (although often aimed at me by Simon Shrek's cat Spook) are bloody cool and I wish I could achieve an evil stare as good, i) Because mummies are frightened by them, j) Because they don't need to be told what to do, like dogs do, j) Because Custard's cat, Smokey, is the best creature in the world, k) Because I said so!  Please note that all cat comments above do NOT apply to Custard's other cat MOZART aka MOJO, because it is a stupid, whinney, smelly little shit!!!  Oh and Gristy, when are you going to come back out of your closet, and get over this strop you have been in for a while now??? We are all concerned for you, and here for you as friends. Love.

       Ok, This should really go on the message board but.. 1) They look at you in an Evil way because… Humm YOU KICK THEM!!! 2) No one would do what you tell them, unless guaranteed of getting something out of it. Unless you’re a sadist or your in the army. 3) The reason why the intelligent (as you said) cat leaves you presents on your drive is because you kick them. Its not the other way round, you kick so they cack!  4) Kick a cat and they will get their own back. Some day. Some time. 5) Dogs do not protect a house, They protect their dinner ticket. Cats know that their owners will still feed them even if they get burgled. 6) Cats only stare evilly at a few people, Our very own Baity is one of them as Shreks cats give him the evil eyes between them.   7) Women prefer cats? And that’s a reason to hate them? Weird person, who doesn’t like to stroke pussy some time or another? 8)Dogs are like 5’4” Liverpudlians. They think they have to prove themselves. Cats will give you the finger even when your looking straight at them. Cats have intelligence and attitude, Dogs are stupid and rely on brute force. Although this is a generalisation of the species, I accept there are the odd individual that bucks these trends.

       Just wanted to share this with everyone...  I got this e-mail off a friend in response to my question about which pet you prefer? Cat's or Dog's.  Hello Brett  How are you? I hope that Santa brought you a nice load of presents and that you can remember at least the beginning of the night on new years eve.     I was looking at the Toaster Files today and noted the question that you had posed regarding Cats or Dogs.  I am somewhat surprised that you asked this question as it surely is obvious that Cats = cack whilst Dogs are by far a superior form of animal let alone pet.   Why? I hear you ask. Well aside from it's just because I say it is please let me enlighten you with the following:     1) Cats are evil  2) Cats do not do what they are told  3) Cats soil my drive with cack and I am forced to stay up late at night and boot them when I find them at it.  (Interesting story here involving neighbours cat, my foot and a call almost made to the police and RSPCA)  4) You would quite happily boot a cat across the street.  You would think twice about doing this to a dog. Especially a large unpleasant one.    5) A dog will guard your house.  A cat would probably leave the door on the latch to let burglars in because they are evil.    6) Cats stare at you with unnerving evil intelligence  7) Women tend to prefer Cats.  A perfect reason to hate them and cats.    8) And finally Dogs on the whole are harder than Cats.   Speak to you soon mate.

       "Hail King Baity, Acting Commander of the Toaster Files”  PK made me Fajita’s last night for myself, King Baity and Louise.  She didn’t even read my last post but was making me Chicken and Beef last night for dinner.  I’m not sure how to explain this except to say PK is great.  She must be able to read my mind sometimes because she comes up with the same ideas as me all the time and I won’t have said a word about it.  I think if she ever comes to her senses and decides to leave me I will defiantly have to go into Stalker mode till she gives in and takes me back.     To any off the crew interested we will be going to Pizza Hut on Wednesday so let Acting Commander Baity, or me know if you are interested in joining us.  Rossborough’s re-quoted my insurance on my car last month in 2002 my insurance was £199.00 with no no-claims bonus and no driving experience and being 24 years old…. This year they quoted me £320.00 and I’m now 25 when insurance is supposed to be cheaper and one years no claims….  The guy on the phone could not explain to me why my insurance was now going to cost me another £120.00.  Anyway I managed to get cheaper insurance through Reeds and phoned up Rossborough’s to let them know I didn’t want my insurance renewed through them.  However when I looked at my bank statement it seems they were not taking no for an answer and have taken money out of my account to pay for the new insurance…  I really can’t believe it.  An insurance company has stolen money off me!!!!  To make matters worse I find out another Company I had a private pension through but cancelled have been taking money off me too!!!  Because of this my bank has closed my bank account as the direct debits that were supposed to be coming out of my bank bounced as the money wasn’t there.    Well I’m going to go now and scream down the phone at some people and see about getting my money back.  Jedi Master Danger signing out…..

       OFFICIAL MESSAGE TO  'DANGER'  OF THE TOASTER FILES, FROM ACTING COMMANDER BAITY:  Hey Danger,   "Congratulations to you I must give hmmm? For Jedi Master you have become! The path from here forth be full of trial and tribulation it will, tread carefully and keep your eyes to the light side you must!!"  I had heard that you were spending alot of time trying to accomplish this goal, and I am happy to hear that you have at last acheived conquest, very much as I have! As far as 'The Two Towers' are concerned, I happen to be a total Tolkein nerd as I am sure you all know, and I have to say that although I agree with you that they are all part of one big epic, I believe that the first film was better than the second. I was a little vexed by the second film as I believed that it portrayed a few characters incorrectly, and if you would like to discuss tis then by all means do so (as long as you don't mind me telling you your wrong hehe, only joking m8).  As for the consumption of vegetables......I FUCKING HATE THEM...DIE DIE DIE GREENS!!!!! AAAARRRRGGGG!!!!! They suck, their evil, their green!!!!! And thats all I have to say about that.  The discussions are a cool idea and I may very well participate ok.  I got to go now but keep up the posting guys (actually Brett, being as you are the only person on this site who can bother to post!) As for the rest of you...YOUR ALL FUCKING LAZY!!! VIVA LA REVOLUTION...Baity signing off.....

       "Hail Baity, Acting Commander of the Toaster Files”  I made it to Jedi Master last night on my computer and saved the world from the Evil Desann and his army of fake Jedi Soldiers.  Then celebrated my achievements by going to watch the Two Towers at the new cinema.  PK asked me which one I liked the best the first or second? I told her it’s all one story and I liked the first 2/3 of it so far.  I’m not thinking of it as three separate films.  (I honestly think she would be disappointed if I gave her a straight answer).  For those of you who don’t know I’m really fussy when it comes to food.  I don’t really eat any Vegetables and my diet consists mainly of Meat dishes or Cheese and Marmite toasties.  PK however is a vegetarian and hates Marmite (Weirdo)… this has made cooking for her really interesting (They do say opposites attract).  I’m trying to find dishes without meat or vegetables in it so if you have any ideas please e-mail me.  If I find stuff that is really nice I’ll even post it here for everyone to see.  I’m going to start a topic for discussion each week on our message board that anyone can join in on.  This week is going to be about Cat’s or Dog’s, which pet you prefer and why.

       THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND MAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT:  Attention all readers!!!  Following the departure of our esteemed leader, Toaster, as next in line (by vote of our readers and our sister site) I proclaim that I shall now lead the troops for the following period of his absence. Thats right, this is my site now, muhahahahahahaha!!!  This is my first step of Global Domination, America, Russia, even Afganistan will follow in my conquest as I bring forth my powers at the worlds nations!  As my first point of action as 'Dominah Baity' I hereby declare that all members of the public should wear a T-shirt/ polo-shirt bearing a picture of me on the front, also all members of the public must cry 'Hail Baity' when ever they see me. If possible I will also expect people to do general chores for me, such as cleaning my boots, cooking my food etc etc.  Ok ok, seriously now...if I do take charge of the site whilst Adam is away then I must ask the rest of the crew to post a little more then usual, as we want to impress Toaster with what we can accomplish without his presence. More pictures, more posts, more more more..!!  Right, I'm done now, time to go and tend to the Nipple-Donkeys, and Arse Chickens.....Baity signing off.......

       Well, i'm off with Dougal and Lady Kate to Banff for a nice bit of snowboarding and beer related Candian hi-jinx. I have never been to Canada before and I can't wait to check it out. The people are apparently the friendliest in the world (according to a guy at work.. dirty bugger) and they have had fresh snow in the last 24 hours.. hoorah!      I will look somewhat like this, except completely out of control and with the finesse of a parachuting rhino.

       Aloe Vera can help relieve stubble rash on the inner thighs after an intriguing experiment with shaved scrotums.  Happy Baity?  Geeze, cant have a few days reprieve without hassle? And, no. I havent met a new swamptroll.  I haven’t posted in a while as I haven’t had sufficient interesting information to relate to the world. Like using an elastic band pre-coitaly, When I do, it will be with sufficient gusto that it will leave me short of breath.  Anyway, Once I can get Photoshop working, I will have something that would have made even the great J.C. cry “Lordy, No! I’m no son of God? All I wanted to do is look at Gristy’s post!”  But that is… If I can get it working…  On a separate note, Adam? Is that our very own Psycho in the picture below? to the left of Mr Weasel? Just next to the hands about to clap?  He is such a party animal.

       A brunette, a redhead, and a blonde escape a burning building by climbing  to the roof. The firemen are on the street below, holding a blanket for them to jump into. The firemen yell to the brunette: "Jump! Jump! It's your only chance to survive!" The brunette jumps and SWISH! - the firemen yank the blanket away, with predictable consequences. "C'mon! Jump! You gotta jump!" shout the firemen to the redhead. "Oh no! You're gonna pull the blanket away!" replies the redhead. "No! It's brunettes we can't handle. We're OK with redheads!" So she jumps, and SWISH! - the firemen yank the blanket away, and the lady is flattened on the pavement. Finally, the blonde steps to the edge of the roof. Again, the firemen  yell "Jump! You have to jump!" "No way!  you're just gonna pull the blanket away!" yelled the blonde. "No really," call the firemen, "You have to jump! We won't pull the blanket away again." "Look," the Blonde says, "I'm no fool. I don't trust you.  So what I want you to do is put the blanket down, and back away from it..."

Anyway, i've been busy being ill over the weekend, a nasty dose of the flu has rendered me incapable of fun/booze/strippers. I am proud to be a typical male, which means whenever I am even remotely ill I get the right to spend all my time under a duvet, drinking lemsip, watching  24  and moaning for attention. Anyway, I feel much better now, thank you.  Holly is now complete, bathing my desktop in her lava lamp blue hue and making me feel all warm inside. I do have a pic but it's really crap, so as soon as i steal a diggy camera i'll post a better one.     This is why we haven't invaded Iraq yet.

       Jersey’s Advice in the event of a Radiological Accident!!!!  Do   Do keep tuned into Local Radio and Channel Television. Do Keep Calm and Stay Indoors. Do Keep Animals Undercover.  Do Not  DO NOT go outside until you are told it is safe to do so.  Everything will look quiet normal  - you will not see, smell or feel anything different.  But don’t be fooled STAY INDOORS. DO NOT fetch your children if they are at School unless you are instructed to do so.  They will be safer where they are under cover. DO NOT use any vegetables or fruit from your garden.  Use only food already in your home. DO NOT use rainwater, the mains supply should be quiet safe, if its not you will be told by radio or television.  Obviously the rumours are not true: -   People don’t glow green like you would have thought. Jersey water is not supplied from rainwater but from some unknown source or is treated for radioactive polution daily just in case.   All Jersey buildings are built to repel radioactive rays.  There is not a bunker in the island you have access too.  The consultancy bill for this information probably cost the Island Several million Pounds too.    Do they really think Islanders are really that stupid?

       I want to tell you about me and Dougal. We have a history of being really nasty to each other, beating each other up and playing pranks. We are in Banff a month ago on holiday, and a waitress brings over our breakfast. She says "Okay, be careful guys.. these plates are really hot" Scott looks up and says.. "Give me your hand a second?" so, like a fool, i do.. and he presses it down hard on my smouldering hot plate. I'm crying in pain and laughter, the waitress shoots us a look like we just beamed down from a mothership.  Anyway we were winding each other up coming back from lunch today, pushing each other into walls, tripping each other up, etc. generally acting like eight year olds. One of our security cameras captured a special moment of male bonding between us.  urlLink Click here to see it.

       Greetings everybody, welcome to another Monday!  Yep another new week has started, leaving the remnants of the fun you had over the weekend to fall into memory. As usual you wake up on Monday morning and it feels so cold, you find yourself wishing you could just lay in bed and go back to sleep (god that would be nice, I'm bloody tired!). Next thing you know the alarm clock goes off at 06:20am! Yep thats right, you thought you you had turned it off, only to find out that you had hit the snooze button by mistake!! With that first sigh of the many that will follow during the rest of the day, you do your best to roll onto your side and fall out of bed.  Well thank god I had a good weekend, or else this would all be too much. Yep it was a good weekend!  On Friday, Sandy, Al, and Michael (PK's Mom, sister and cousin) arrived in Jersey after much anticipation. I have got on swell with all of them and it's really cool to have made a few more good friends! So anyway, once they had settled we all ordered pizza and chilled out and everyone got acquainted, and then after food the majority of us went out on the piss. Started off at Chicago Rock and moved to Liquid later on (I cannot believe that I got in again without any hassle!). We all went back to Chateaux PKB and crashed out on the floor hehe! What was to ensue between Danger, Milkybar Kid, and myself will hence forth be known as 'The Great Blanket Robbery!', suffice to say that I ended up waking up and going to get my ski jacket, then curling up like a fetus on the little couch!  Got up on Saturday and soon left the Chateaux in order to do lots of things that kept me rushed off my feet for the morning. In the afternoon Toaster and I went and watched Dare Devil, which I though was a good film. Later on everybody met up again and we all went out for dinner to Pizza Express down in St.Brelade' Bay. We all ended up back at the Chateaux watching DVD's and talking, in fact it was nice to have a reasonably quiet Saturday night for a change.  Toaster and I were busy on Sunday until the evening. I ended up at Chateaux PKB again and I chilled out there until about 1:45am!  So that was a good weekend and it was with great regret that I then had to then wake up to the usual Monday saga! Ah well, probably going up again tonight, Danger has offered a good curry, which should be fun.  Well that is it for now, Baity signing off......

       Right motherfuckers, lock up your daughters, wives, sisters and maybe even your gran, because it's TOASTER FILES NIGHT!! Yeee-hah.. look out for us, possible insertion points (oo-er) are Chicago and Sports, probably followed by Liquid. If a photo is taken that includes Baity's or Grist's newly shaven heads, that girl gets a free drink! Hoo-rah!  I have to say, i am feeling DAMN GOOD today. Had a great lunch with Loverat at Chicago Rock, loads of little eastern european waitresses pampering us.. nice.  Project Jackson.. (face lift for my PC, geddit) is going well.. Holly now has her stone fleck paint on, just the window to do.. the glass has been cut to the right size and a internal lamp has been chosen, it looks kind of like those plasma things you put your hands on.. it's going to RAAAWK!  By the way, I had a artist's impression done of Grist's mystery valentine card...

       He, he, he. I got a card. Its currently sitting at home on my sideboard, I have yet to actually get home to see it, but I think my sister is a bit jealous, as she wanted to open my card. Problem is, who would send me a valentines card? Who even cares that much about me? The last time I had anything for valentines was a tube of KY from my (now) Ex and a note she left me. He, he. I had fun that night. (I also got some leather handcuffs that year as well. Brilliant! Don’t chaff like the metal ones do…) Or is it someone winding me up? Hell, who cares, Gristy‘s got an admirer, Gristy‘s got an admirer, Baity hasn’t! , Baity hasn’t!

       Hello everybody, and to all the lovely ladies out there.....HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!  That’s right people, today is the momentous day when the opposite sexes of the world, both woman and the repressed male, spend copious amounts of money on chocolates, flowers (£135 for a bunch of roses in England!), picture frames and other tokens of love, ahhhhhh! The typical symptoms of Valentines Day are here, the JT network is blocked up, traffic is mad with everyone trying to get home for some nookie (great Limp Bizkit song) before the kids get home from school, even the 11th years are sneaking out of the classroom for a quickie in the school loo (unless things have changed since I was at school which I doubt).  So in reflection, is it all worth the effort??? Today I have spoken to quite a few people on this matter and got the following comments:  a)	‘Yes it’s worth every effort, this is because when two people love each other, there is nothing better then being able to make your partner smile with a meaningful gift.’ b)	‘Yes, and if all goes well there will be a bunk-up for me at the end of the day.’ c)	‘No, it’s all a waste of time and money, I see no point in it, it’s just stupid!’ (I sense a bitter heart there Stu –ED) d)	‘It’s ok if you get a card’  Obviously everyone has a different opinion on this day and whether you enjoy it or not depends very much on if you receive anything or not, this in turn depends on many factors, such as:  a)	If you have the most sexy/handsome features in the office, b)	If you flirt your breasts in front of all the males in the workplace, c)	If all the girls know that you have a ‘King Cock’. Or alternatively, d)	If you have the best personality to be found, e)	If you make another person smile at the mere thought of you, f)	If someone knows you will be there for him or her no matter what. (Ok I’m getting deep now!)  I would have to say that in my opinion, Valentines Day is worth it because I would like to think that ‘LOVE’, and I use this term in the most sincere way, is worth your heart and soul. I cannot think of anything I would rather want then to be able to say, “I love you” to someone. Ok the fact that I’m single and have no one to say it to right now is besides the point, in fact I didn’t actually even get a card (but I am not going to sulk), the fact is that love is worth waiting for!! Last year I was fortunate enough to be in a relationship with someone who I loved, and for Valentines Day I had a patchwork quilt made for her, simply because I knew that’s what she loved. The smile I got back was enough to say it was a result!  Anyway, I am beginning to well up (ok not really), but I believe that the whole effort thing is great and well worth it.  On a quick separate note, a BIG thank you to Toaster, who phoned me up whilst at work just to let me listen to the Valentines Day CD that was being played today at his workplace…cheers mate BAAMMMMM!!  Now I need to put TOTALROCK.COM on and flush that crappy CD from my mind!  Baity signing off……

       I have had enough of my biege super tower case, and have decided to embark on a journey into "computer modification city".  If you're not a geek, then you maybe surprised to hear that there is a huge sub-culture of geekiness, dedicated to the art of computer modification. Most of which involves running your computer faster than it's supposed to go, (overclocking) then you add lots of fans because the faster it goes the hotter it gets. Kind of like Jenna Jameson.  Anyway, "Holly" my main PC, is going to be resprayed in stone fleck paint, kind of like a 21st century stone henge. I had just covered her in some black primer, and I have a window kit and a blue lava lamp light to go inside on the way.. photos will be posted when complete.

       I plead GUILTY!!! as charged, and I apologise. Yep I was the one that couldn't go out due to the fact that I was off work ill. I had a real bastard cold at the end of last week and it is only alleviating now! I had a fairly dull weekend really, with only a couple of interesting things happening, such as making a 4ft paper mache egg! and pondering over satellite photos of the sand dunes!! So what new in the life of Baity?........  a) My work are now paying (HA) for me to acquire my HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) licence, which means look out because I now have over seven tons of pure horsepower to drive around in, Minden place beware!!! (Baity's coming to get you!)   b) I have decided that my plan for growing my hair has come to an end after spending a day ill in bed and having all the time in the world to think about the situation. I realised that I was growing it for the following reason:   "I was introduced to HEAVY METAL (that’s right pop bitches) HEAVY METAL.....and again....HEAVY METAL! at the tender age of 12 or there abouts when I played my first WH40K battle at my cousins shop, it was 'The Hell Of Steel' album by Man O War. Since then I have praised the 'KINGS OF METAL' and been a brother of metal as best as I can. Now after this initial introduction I continues to listen to various types of metal, and the first CD I owned was 'Use Your Illusions pt2' by Guns N Roses (Ok this counts as glam metal, what with old Mr.Rose wiggling his hips like a fairy in 'Sweet Child Of Mine'!). Anyway to cut a long story short, I have always thought up until now that I haven't truly fitted in with the headbangers due to the fact that I didn't have the hair to throw about etc etc.  However, I now realise that headbanging IS exactly what I have been doing for the last five years and in actual fact, it isn't the long thrashing hair that makes you a true HEAVY METAL fan, but the spirit, soul and energy (or blood, sweat and booze) that you exude whilst moshing to your favourite thrash or fantasy riffs! I wouldn't expect or ask anyone to understand what I am trying in lame words to explain.   So my hair is now shaved again!  Ok I appear to have drained myself with that last saga and I now cannot remember what the rest of my post was about (shakes his head in dismay)! Um....ok....looks like the coming weekend is going to be a good one. Princess Kate's family is coming over and theres going to be meals and drink fests taking place, SWEET! New people to meet, more cool TF photo shenanigans to be had! We have to think of a task that everyone has to perform whilst out, and I am currently working on this with Toaster. I must say that I agree with the main man, that us lot haven't been as active in recent times as we have been previous, but that’s mainly due to us all being quite busy and in others cases, not bothered or just plain shit! However, we have all got great times ahead and the beauty of our little circle is that we have a knack for having a crack (hehe ED!).  Ok my brain is truly blitzed now, I am off the tend the testi turnips, feed the nipple donkeys and choke the arse chickens!  Baity signing off........

       Grist, that has the be the most depressed post ever, considering it involved some kind of sexual activity in a hotel room. Actually I did try and invite you - several times - but couldn't connect. That's the honest truth, i'm not sure if it was your mobile or mine.  Friday night was a good one, myself and Custard met up with Kirk "Captain" Truscott, and hit the Sports Bar. Actually the next few hours are a bit of a blur, but I remember about four bottles of Laurent Perrier pink being drunk, several fraggle girls being insulted, having a drunk conversation about hair with a girl from Turkey, (oh, those eastern european chicks... *dribble*) and eventually being in Liquid (the giant disco aspirin.. hi [)amien and Elly!). I later split and met up with somebody else, but code honor dictates that no details are revealed. :)  Anyway, I have noticed a somewhat lacking of our team spirit recently. People being off ill, tired, not invited (only joking) or just generally slacking. I have been guilty of this too, at times.   So to welcome in the longer days and warmer nights heading into springtime, it's time for the next TOASTER FILES SHIRT WEARING, NORMAL PEOPLE SCARING NIGHT OUT. It's this Friday, starting at Chateau Toaster Files, then heading into town. Time to be confirmed by Brettmiester general. Meal at theirs to meet PK's outlaws, then lock up your daughters as we head into town.  Be there, or be.. er.. somewhere else, that's not as much fun.

       Thursday night is when it all started. After watching Monkey on channel 4 at god knows o’clock in the morning, I reached to turn my computer off, proceeding to knock my pint glass full of water forward. Off the computer table, the glass tumbler lived up to its name and tumbled to the ground. Luckily my bare foot broke the fall of the lump of purified sand and it rolled casually off my bruised appendage to rest on the now soggy carpet. I thought to myself, Sod it. If I chuck a towel over it and go to bed, it’ll dry over night. I’m tired and I have a meeting early tomorrow…or later today. Cant think straight. Zzzzzz. The next morning, after rushing into work for the meeting went fine for a Friday, except that I spent the day chasing some payments for only 30 million quid, that were going wrong. By the end of the day, I was knackered. I went home to prepare for the meeting I had in the evening only to find that my keyboard had not survived the downpour the previous knight, and in fact, the ergonomically designed features actually retained sufficient water to re-hydrate the Aral sea! Needles to say that electronic equipment do not normally survive an encounter with that much water (my mobile being the only exception – I’m sure it has nine lives) this left me with the inability to type as only a quarter of my keys worked correctly. Some of them seem to be constantly on and most of them typed two letters for each key press. Exciting. Then came the fact that the Toaster lads were going out on the lash. Without inviting me. Bastards. Saturday was my works New Year Ball (I know its late.) So it had me in a Tux doing a James Bond. Drinks were free, well, Normal drinks. Beer, wine and spirits (in moderation – considering last time had people ordering pints of vodka on the work account) We managed to get four bottles of pink champagne thanks to one person getting a work Vice president to sign for the bill, whilst he was drunk. The rest of the evening was great but not for conversation here :-) Sunday went easy, Woke up in the hotel room to room service, nice. Today Im back in work and I don’t feel like I had a weekend. But not getting invited out was definitely the highlight. Nice that my mates think of me.

       Here's  a Joke my sister sent me which I have edited slightly for Toaster to lighten his mood.  A States Member is visiting a Primary school today and he visits one of the classes.  They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.  The teacher asks the States Member if he would like to lead the class in the discussion of the word, “tragedy." So the States Member asks the class for an example of a "tragedy." One little boy stands up and offers, "If a project which cost the people of Jersey lots of money was finished like a hole to keep Storm water in, only to find it didn’t work, that would be a tragedy."  "No," says The States Member, "that would be an ACCIDENT." A little girl raises her hand: "If a promise to reduce the cost of housing, making property purchases more available to young people. Maybe by building first time buyers flats on the waterfront was taken back once they discovered the flats were worth too much money and had to be sold on the private market for hundreds of thousands of pounds, that would be a tragedy."  "I'm afraid not," explains The States Member.  "That's what we would call a GREAT LOSS." The room goes silent.  No other children volunteer.  The States Member searches the room.  "Isn't there somebody here who can give me an example of a tragedy?" Finally, way in the back of the room, a small boy raises his hand.  In a quiet voice he says, "If Chamber of Commerce building seating all the states members, were struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, by a terrorist like Osama bin Laden, that would be a tragedy." "Fantastic!" exclaims The States Member, "That's right.  And now can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy?" "Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss."

       Right, stand back a bit because i'm getting on my soap box. A bit further. Ok.  Jersey. Housing. FUCKITY FUCK!  I am, admittedly, earning pretty good money for a 23 year old. So, inspired by the glory of Chateau Toaster Files (Brett's palace) I decide to look into buying a place of my own. Nothing huge. Just somewhere that is fairly modern, clean. Somewhere to call my own that is not likely to fall to bits in five months, after a infestation of space weevils or something.   There are some quality places out there, but they are all priced for thirty-something rich divorcees! I don't know shit about parish rates, foncier rates, lawyers fees, insurance, stamp duty.. the list goes on, and on..   So while there are thousands of young people like me, looking for a start on the property ladder, we can't even get our collective feet onto the bottom rung without slipping off. Meanwhile the states are busy building stupid modern art bridges across the waterfront, big holes for water in the side of a hill and a FUCKING STEAM CLOCK!!! A STEAM CLOCK FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! While the hospital falls into disrepair and waiting lists grow longer and longer, thousands of young people leave Jersey because all they can afford is a cardboard box on top of Patriotic Street car park, and even that fucker costs them £80,000. Argh!!!!!!!!!!! *smashes keyboard on desk, throws mouse across the room and stomps out"  Sorry about that. If you tune in just for the soft core porn I sometimes post, here's a picture of a shaved pussy to make you feel better.

       Okay this one might cause a stir but....ah hell with it!.......  I got this at work, but I neither agree or disagree with it....  I come to England poor and broke, Go to dole see labour bloke. Fill in forms and stand around, Kind man gives me eighty pound. Thank him much then he say, "Come back next week get more pay"  You come here make you wealthy, Doctor here to make you healthy. Send for friends from Afghanistan, Tell them "come as quick as you can". Plenty of us on the dole, With motor car and big payroll. Come with me we live together, Only bad thing 'the bloody weather!'.  All get nicely settled down, Find big house in busy town. Fifteen families living up, Twice as many living down. All are paying nice big rent, More in garden living in tent. Soon we send for wife and kids, Kind man give us loads more quids.  Twelve months later buy a rolls,  Still go to labour draw more doles. Wife gets glasses teeth and pills, All are free get no bills. As white man pays out all year, To keep the national assistance here.  Bless all the men big and small, For paying tax to keep us all. We think England damn good place, Too good for white man race. If they do not like the Afghan man, Theres plenty room in Afghanistan!

       Brett's place is our castle! It's even got a fricking round table for our knightly meetings! Yay!  Had a good night Friday, out with Baity and Danger for the house warming. A nice bottle of pink in Liquid went down a treat. It's going to be a MAD party palace in the summer. Just don't tell PK, haha.. !  50 Fun Things In The Elevator  1.Make race car noises when people get on and off.   2.Blow your nose and offer to show the contents of your kleenex to other passengers.   3.Grimace painfully while slapping your forehead and muttering, "Shut up dammit, all of you just SHUT UP!"   4.Whistle the first 7 notes of "It's a Small World" incessantly.   5.Sell Girl Scout Cookies.   6.On a long ride, sway side to side at the natural frequency of the elevator.   7.Shave.   8.Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside ask, "Got enough air in there?"   9.Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator.

       So am I the only one posting?? Oh well, what's been going on lately you ask? Right, well Danger and PK have moved into their new house, which I must say is outstanding! Four floors of luxury and plenty of space. I have already claimed a certain corner of the lounge as 'Baity's Corner'. This shall be my base of operations for the up and coming future. Kate was showing me a few photographs of her family as her mum and sister are coming over in February I believe, big HELLO to you all. Danger, Toaster and I have decided to take to the golf courses of the island and we went to the driving range on Saturday and had a crack (bloody annoying game though!). Ah yes! I went to the Splash for the first time this year last night. I went on my own because I was driving about and decided to go see who was there. It was a great night out and I met a lot of the 'Ye Olde' Splash people, plus all the usual raging hormone teenagers that congregate there!!! I am now a self proclaimed furniture builder thanks to Danger's huge amount that had to be constructed at the new house. I did something today that I haven't done in a long time....I slept in until like 1:25pm!! Well that just about sums up the recent events, hopefully someone else will put up a post and fill us all in......  Baity signing off.....

       I don't know if anyone read the few lines that I posted earlier? You see I doubt you did, due to the fact that some fucker decided to delete my post, most likely due to the fact that my post voiced my opinions to the Toaster Crew, and someone didn't like that opinion!!!  I believe in the right to free speech and the act of deleting my post goes against the whole point of the site, which as I thought, is meant to be used to voice opinions, events and happenings, good or bad, that go on. I doubt many people will read this post before it gets deleted, but if you do then understand that you are one of an unspoken minority that will have experienced my words, and therefore they will have beared at least a little weight, before being wiped from existance by the powers that be on the Toaster Files............FREE SPEECH!

       I know exactly where you are coming from mate! After reading your comments I realised that not one, and this is no lie, not one girl I have been out with, has had a simple life. Whilst I am not going to go into descriptions of the troubles they had, basically because I have the upmost respect for them (well most of them). However, I will reveal that all the girlfriends that I have had, all have parents that are divorced! What the hell is that all about???????  Whilst I don't have a problem with this fact, it does seem like a rather big coincidence doesn't it?  I really wish I would just meet some nice girl that i can identify with, that just seems to click with me! Whilst I don't feel lonely being single, I do miss having someone there to share stuff with. Anyway, just saying that I feel that Toaster has a point.  Baity signing off.....

       Right, soapbox time again. Stand back a bit.   What is it with Jersey and emotionally screwed up people?   If there's one thing Jersey has plenty of, it's fruitloops. Every person I meet has a tale of a bunny-boiling ex that they had to get a restraining order on. Why is this? Is there something in the milk that causes people to go around the twist? It's apparently nowhere near as bad off the rock. I know that Jersey has high rates of alcoholics and people with real mental health problems, but I postulate that there's thousands more, just ebbing beneath the surface of insanity, waiting to go batty.  Increasing seems to be younger people too, certainly I've met some girls under 25 that have scared me silly. Women complain that it's the guys that are nuts, either out for a one-night shag, stalkers, sexual deviants or subscribes to  Pigeon Fanciers Monthly . There must be some kind of ripple effect going on. Bob goes out with Mary, but Mary doesn't know that Bob secretly has a sexual leaning towards covering himself in Vaseline. They break up. Months later, Mary strip searches her new date, Colin, for Vaseline before they leave her flat. Colin think's she's a raving nutcase and this vows to carry pepper spray with him on all future dates. You see where I'm going with this?  There must be a pocket of normal guys and girls somewhere, that just want to go out together, have dinner, have a few laughs, see if the chemistry is right and then have some (safe) sex. Facts of life - people get together, have a relationship, sometimes it doesn't work and they break up. Sometimes hearts are broken and that's sad. But get over it people, don't a few bad dates turn you into a emotional cripple that's jilted for life. Dust yourself down, leave the pepper spray at home and go have some fun.  I thank you.

       Your right mate it was a hell of a day so much drink and man great to be at the beach. It all started with speedy and I having lunch at 12 then who do I see walking down the street but the one and only Dougal on he’s week off so the boy crabs him self a sit and it all starts there with the first drink of J.D.  Then off we go to get my lovely new phone mmmmm, then from there we think about where to go on such a sunny day as this, then it hits us off to tams bar in st brelade so we find the closest taxi and take a ride. So we get there and first things first bar so then all day we do this and have loads of games of pool then we get the girls to come down for the day Kate and elly to drink it large.  So coming to about 7ish now and we start to think about some food to go with all this drink so pizza time it is. Goes down well so then off we go with 6 in a car with Baity in the driving seat to Chicago in town for even more drink and what do we find there but 3 lovely girls on the stage doing a kylie tribute, man its not the same but she had a great arse.  Then to liquid we go to find the place empty but who cares the drink was still good. Didn’t stay there for long we decided to try out follies to see how that was but we get to the door and something happened which I thought was funny we all got asked for I.D so of course none of us had it so that was the end of the night but man it was a great day and cant wait for it to happen again.

       Crap week. I heard the lads had a fantastic day out in St Aubins yesterday, drinking it up on the beach and playing pool. Meanwhile I was stuck in an office slaving over a hot server. Joy.  I can't believe the amount of 'friendly fire' deaths in Iraq. The first few days, the coalition lost one Sikorsky, two Sea Kings, a Tornado and some nutcase throws a grenade into the command tent. Talk about fuck-up. Given long enough, I think the allies would probably blow themselves up and Saddam won't have to do a thing.     Here's some Friday morning chuckles for other disgruntled office workers...   Reasons why it's great to be a bloke.   1. Your last name stays put.  2. The garage is all yours.  3. Wedding plans take care of themselves.  4. Chocolate is just another snack.  5. You can be president.  6. You can wear a white T-shirt to a water park.  7. Car mechanics tell you the truth.  8. You don't give a rats hindquarters whether or not someone notices your new haircut.  9. The world is your urinal.  10. You never have to drive to another gas station because "this one is just too icky."  11. Same work, more pay.  12. Wrinkles add character.  13. Wedding Dress, $5,000; Tux Rental, $100.  14.

You can leave the motel bed unmade.  22. You can kill your own food.  23. You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness.  24. If someone forgets to invite you to something, he or she can still be your friend.  25. Your underwear is $8.95 for a three-pack.  26. You can quietly enjoy a car ride from the passenger seat.  27. Three pairs of shoes are more than enough.  28. You can quietly watch a game with your buddy for hours without ever thinking: "He must be mad at me."  29. You can drop by to see a friend without having to bring a little gift.  30. If another guy shows up at the party in the same outfit, you just might become lifelong friends.  31.

You can sit with your knees apart no matter what you are wearing.  49. Gray hair adds character.  50. With 400 million sperm per go, you could double the earth's population in 15 tries, in theory.  51. If you retain water, it's in a canteen.  52. You think the idea of punting a small dog is funny.  53. Your pals can be trusted never to trap you with: "So, notice anything different?"  54. Bathroom lines are 80% shorter.  55. You don't care if the toilet seat is left up.  56. One acronym that doesn't pertain - PMS.  57. You don't have to wear makeup.  58. You can think about girls all the time and it's alright.  59.

You get praise for doing things around the house once in a while.  74. A hair cut costs less than $20  75. Three shirts and two pairs of pants are enough clothes for a month.

       Ok, a summary of the weekend then......  Woke up Saturday morning and spent an hour or so being very bored! Decided to give Toaster and Dougal a call to see what they were up to. We all agreed to meet Custard for his lunch hour, plan being to get a bite to eat. The plans soon changed and we ended up sitting down at the Blue Fish, eating fine food, drinking fine beer, and chatting to the fine Australian waitress (oh she was fine!). At the end of this we lost Custard to his work commitments, he is the only unfortunate one of us who has to work on a Saturday!  So after a few more beers at the Blue Fish, Toaster, Dougal and I headed off to Chicago Rock Cafe with thoughts of further alcahol consumption! We spent the following three hours drinking Margarettas, vodka, and eating a foot high tower of doughnuts!!  Next we headed off to Dougals flat and shot up some zombies on his Dreamcast. Dougals wife to be cooked us a roast dinner, which was nice.  Custard met us up at this point.  At about 9:30pm we all headed into town and proceeded to drink in most of towns drinking holes before heading up to the rave at Fort Regent. The rave turned out to be quite a laugh, sporting alot of totty (most of which was stuck up it's own ass!), a well stocked bar, and a quality chill out room to boot. We all grooved away in the main hall, however the best room in the place was the chill out room, which played indian pipe music and other calming stuff.  The highlight of the night turned out to be when Toaster, Custard and I had been in the chill out room for about half an hour playing mini air hockey (which they were giving away free with all vodka!). I was sitting down quite relaxed talking to the guys when a rather large bird sat on the guy next to me. This would have been fine except that she was half sitting her ass on me too, which got annoying!! Anyway we decided to head back off to the main hall. After carefull planning I decided that for maximum effect I had to act quickly, and I did. In one graceful movement I shot out of the chair I was in, which in turn meant that the large bird no longer had any support, which in turn meant that she fell flat on her face hehe!!! (am I evil...yeas I fucking am!!!!). The rest of the night was quite buzzing and we headed for home at about 3:30am.  Sunday has been relatively quite and relaxing, spending most of the time chilling and keeping track on the war! So in summary, a good weekend, in fact, the best I have had in a long time! Anyway, going to bed so post again soon.  Baity signing off.....

       Hello all, well what'ya know, a new layout!!!!  The reason for my surprise is that it has been talked about for so long now that I didn't really think it would happen.   So, what's new???  Well I have recently passed my theory test for my 'Heavy/Large Goods' Driving License, YAY! I passed with a respectable score of 33/35, which still has to be toasted with rounds of alcohol.  Now last Saturday I took a friend who was over from Guernsey out on the lash, well I was driving but that don't matter, anyway I took Nick up to the Splash to show him exactly why I say it's the best of what we got in Jersey. He seemed to enjoy it and fun was had by all....... except ME!!! Yep that's right, once again I managed to sustain yet another injury in the name of metal (shrugs it off modestly). This event adds to the ongoing list.....  1) Split knuckle- due to a stray thrown bottle, 2) Near KO- due to head butting some unfortunate girl who was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time (once again I'm awfully sorry, we agreed it was 50/50), 3) Badly sprained ankle- due to a failed mosh jump in the middle of a 'Rage Against The Machine' track, 4) Hairline cracked rib- due to getting in the middle of the mosh pit, 5) A big ego- due to being pulled into a toilet and shagging a really fantastic girl (ok this isn't an injury but had to get it in somewhere), 6) Cracked tooth- due to an over zealous townie, who subsequently got an elbow in the face! FUCK YOU TOWNIES (apart from my mates who can't help it), 7) Dislocated jaw- due to landing on one of my mates as she jumped up, you get the picture, in fact it still ain't right!, 8) A blood clot heamatoma in my neck- also sustained this at the same time as the dislocated jaw, took three months of drugs to break the clot up!, 9) Numerous cigarette burns- due to careless fucks being...careless!, 10) Spasmed spinal disk- due to an over zealous mosh jump I performed last week!!  Anyway after spending most of the week off work due to my back I have been thinking about what the future holds for the Toaster Files. It seems of late that our site has been dying slowly as people haven't posted for ages, myself included. However, all is not as bad as thought, the new look is quite cool, and I intend to post more again. I believe that as usual we are all eagerly awaiting the summer sun to activate us all again. Beach parties, babes and booze will once again reign!!!  Oh and my opinion on the current war situation....Now the war machine is underway, there is no stopping it. Now is the time for the populous to get behind it's respective military force and back them all the way. What do all the 'Anti-war Supporters' really think they are going to achieve now?? It's already happening people, so chaining yourself to trees and screaming outside the Houses Of P, is going to have as much affect on the war crisis as a fly getting into a head-on with a juggernaut truck!!!   So......well I guess I have said most of what I wanted to get off my chest.....yep, right I'm fucking off now.....  'ROCK HARD' 'ROCK HEAVY' 'ROCK ANIMAL'  Baity signing off......

       Lookie lookie! a new layout! extra bling bling stylee. Hope you like.  I have added a "Shout Out" feature to this site.. so all our favourite people like Dangerous Frank, Nelson, the Shut It ladies and all those girls that read to make sure we arn't writing about them.. you can add comments onto our site now after the posts. Enjoy!  So.. Iraq. That's a funny old game, isn't it? The way I see it.. they missed the boat on the whole thing anyway (apparently Clinton was watching golf when they could have popped Saddam, but he didn't give the order in time.. dumbass)  As terrible as it is, why would anyone join the army if they didn't want to get in a bit of a ruck? I mean think about it.. these guys have training year in, year our.. running around assault courses, stabbing giant hessian dummies with their bayonets, etc.. etc.. it would be a shame for them not to have a bit of a scrap wouldn't it?  I was in the Air Cadets for a while when I was a lad. It was crap. We would spend ages running up and down the sand dunes, carrying logs, and polishing our boots. What on earth for? I am not joking. It was like being in the Hitler youth. I only left when I heard a rumor that I didn't actually HAVE to be there. That I was supposed to be there for fun. I just don't see myself as military material. I have a problem with authority. If a chrome-domed drill instructor was screaming orders in my face I think i'd crack up laughing.  Apparently the french are allergic to sand so they couldn't go.  Donald Rumsfeld came out with a great quote.. "Going to war without France is like going duck-hunting without an accordion"  Thoughts on the upcoming war lads?

       I had the mother of all hangovers today. I heard about "speed dating" at Liquid. The idea is you're given a number and a bit of card, you talk to ten random girlies for two minutes each. At the end, if you like them you write a yes (or a no) next to their number. If there's two yes's between a guy and a girl then you go on a date.  Myself, Custard, Dougal, Baity and Captain Kirk all went along. What a laugh. Only me and Kirk did the dating thing, and there were some lovely girls there and it was good fun. One of them was a cow though - I sat down opposite her and she had this look on like.. "you're scum and you haven't got a hope with me"... so i said "Hey love.. shave the 'tache and drop the attitude and you might have a shot at the title!" :)  Then, as it always seems to do with us lot, things got a bit crazy.. shots and burning the credit card on champagne, silly... silly.. the latter part of the night is mostly a blur of schoolgirls and the floor of a taxi.  If you're wondering if I got a date, well.. that'd be telling wouldn't it ? :P

Wear a hands free phone headset throughout.  Once in a while drift off into an unrelated conversation such as, "I don't care if there are no dwarfs, just get the show done!" 6.

A £7.00 bottle of wine is no longer "pretty good stuff."  21. You actually eat breakfast food at breakfast time.  22.

You no longer drink at home to save money before going to a bar.  25. You read this entire list looking desperately for one sign that this doesn't apply to you.

       I have spent a considerable amount of time recently looking at myself and doing some soul searching. What I finally found astounded me. Not with the results but with its simplicity and the fact that it was literally under my nose. It wasn’t hard to re-trace my footsteps until I realised that the answer was with me all along. My soles were in my shoes. Bugger, didn’t I feel a bit silly?  I also feel a need to reply to custards post. Custard, You don’t post for ages and then when you do, you insult us by not bothering to type four letters! I mean what the hell is “1st” and “u” How much harder would the extra two letters for two words be for you? FIRst and YOu.  I understand the laziness lexicon when using mobile text messages simply due to the length allowed and requirement to use ten number keys for a twenty-four letter alphabet. But for someone to type a message using a standard keyboard for the internet, especially someone who has broadband I fail to see why this is an issue. Its just me but it’s a pet hate.  -Jackass any good? -You think computer game, I think toss one off. Who is worse here? -Whats a relationship? -Custard is single. Has time to devote to computers. -You’re a geek with a nice car -I haven’t been out properly either for ages. -Sunbeds are not the work of the devil, One piece bathing suits are though… -Will Saturday be any cop? Is the gang all going out? -Will Andy talk to me considering I *still* haven’t gotten round to replying to my E-mail.

       Holy shit.. i'm still alive and posting a message. Eek. I know I have been crap, but i've not had much to say. This is the contents of my head at the moment:   - Going to see Jackass in a bit  - Maybe I can get in another quick Splinter Cell session before I go  - Arn't relationships just one big cliche?   - My god, Custard has posted stuff.. !  - I am a geek, but a nice, happy geek.  - I haven't been out for ages, Saturday night is going to be a bender  - Sun beds are not the work of the devil  - Will Grist come out Saturday  - Has Andy arrived yet, and is she actually talking to me?

       Just think guys what Kate is thinking when she sees that face 1st thing in the morning now she must jump out of her skin. Anyway here something that I think is true on about how they reacted to what u act like.   FINE This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use "fine" to describe how  a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.  FIVE MINUTES This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the "five minutes" that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.  NOTHING This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn  you inside out, upside down and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an  argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine."  GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows) This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over "Nothing," and will end with the word "Fine."  GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows) This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don't care." You will get a Raised Eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes,  followed by "Nothing" and "Fine," and she will talk to you in about "Five  Minutes" when she cools off.  LOUD SIGH This is not actually a word but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing."  SOFT SIGH Again, not a word but a non-verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will  stay content.  THAT'S OKAY This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard  before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. "That's Okay" is to be in some mighty big trouble.  PLEASE DO This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth,  so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."  THANKS A woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.  THANKS A LOT This is much different than "Thanks." A woman will say "Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."  Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the Loud Sigh," as she will  only tell you "Nothing."

       Greetings everyone, yes it is I, Baity! Where the hell have I, or lets be honest, the whole lot of the Toaster Crew been lately??? Well it is quite simple.....  We have all been on a vacation to Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta. That's right y'all, the Toaster Files has hit the intergalactic ether-net big time!!!   It all started a long time ago, in an ether-net receiving station in a galaxy far far away. It appears that this 'Ether-net' thingy can not only travel over mind boggling intergalactic distances in the time it takes for a juggernaut truck to grind a small infant deer into the tarmac, but it can also traverse quantum time physics too! Who would have believed it?!  So as I was saying, it seems that whilst us lot have been writing and posting about our very meagre, manic little lives and other pornographic, funny, pictorial stuff; the whole thing has also been posting far, far out to space. Inadvertently whilst our posts have been cruising through space, they have also travelled through time, hence being how they were intercepted by the peaceful beings on the planet Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Now, these apparently  'Peaceful' beings, were utterly oblivious to any knowledge of anything outside their own atmosphere! The fact that they had created an ether-net is purely coincidental! And the fact that it too broadcasted outside their own world without them even knowing about it (due to the fact that they did not know anything about anything outside their own being) and subsequently was received by another peaceful race on a planet called Uranusoryourfaceicanttell, which then sparked an immediate call for total war with the senders of the broadcast which they received from Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta.  Once these, lets call them IVMBs because I cannot be arsed to write 'Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta' every time I want to mention Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta! Anyway, once these IVMBs discovered that they had received our posts from somewhere outside of their planet, they promptly and miraculously created spaceships purely by accident out of washing down bottles and unsticky duct tape!! Hah, what are the chances??!!!!  So, totally by curiosity the IVMBs travelled out into space to see what it was like, navigating their way by rolling things which looked amazingly like, but weren't, smarties on an uneven surface! In fact these things which looked amazingly like, but weren't, smarties, were in actual fact small killer bugs that completely wiped out the inhabitants of three star systems that the IVMBs didn't even realize they had passed!!!!!   And so it came to pass that by some act of some sadistic god the IVMBs encountered their hunters, the inhabitants of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell and a fierce and bloody battle commenced. Oh did I mention that whilst the IVMBs accidently built their spaceships, they also accidently created weapons of mass galactic destruction too by crossbreeding biorganic materials with really sharp forks!!  And so the battles raged between these two forces for millennia, exhausting all natural resources in whatever area they pitched their wars. This unfortunately led to a universally galactic greenhouse effect, that coincidental the small minded and obstinate beings on a crappy little planet called 'Earth' believed to be due to their inept ability to create a world friendly civilization!  Now, after much conflict, the IVMBs decided to actually find out why the people from Uranusoryourfaceicanttell had waged war with them. Once they found out that it was due to a bunch of pornographic, funny, pictorial posts that had been broadcast from their planet purely by mistake (due to the fact that they had known nothing about the ether-net they had been unfortunate enough to create purely coincidentally on their planet) they were obviously curious as to where these broadcasts had come from, as they knew that the broadcasts had not knowingly come from them!  And so they eventually travelled through space and time to our present day and came in search of this so called 'Toaster Files'. When they eventually tracked us down a few months ago, they decided to present themselves to us. Now they didn't know exactly what we looked like so they decided to come to us in a variation of forms, which for some inexplicable reason meant that they looked exactly like an old human looking hermetic in brown robes, accompanied by a whiney little human looking teenager, a egotistical tightly dressed rouge trader, his hair ridden sidekick, oh and a couple of gay robots.  They gather the entire TF Crew at Toasters house and immediately beamed us their spaceships, replacing us with automaton droids that would take our place till our return! Once on their ships they explained their history and about their big predicament with the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell to us and we were obviously moved by the story. We vowed to help the IVMBs with their problems and travelled through time and space.  When we arrived back in their time we fought in the name of 'The Mighty Bean', and many bloody, sweaty, boozy engagements incurred. It is a pure coincidence that the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell looked like some sort of space elf!! And that their symbol for war was to hold up their hands and perform some sort of 2:1:2 formation with their fingers.  Anyway I don't want to write more than a few little paragraphs about this so lets just say that the TF Crew kicked the Uracunt (that's what we called the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell for short) peoples asses well and proper!!! I mean sure we had a few close shaves and sure we didn't all make it out in one piece, for instance Custard is still in hospital recovering!!! He need a whole new set lower spinal cords and a new middle toe on each foot, other than that he has never been better, and I am sure he will post all about it when he gets out.  Now, unfortunately Toaster, Dougal, Kirk and Custard all lost or broke their little Nokia photo phones or else we might have some outrageous photographs for you all to see but never mind, I am sure you all believe us.....DON'T YOU!!!!..???

       I have to say something about  urlLink Dirty Sanchez . I saw this show for the first time a few nights ago, and it's left me mentally scared ever since. Jackass was funny in a king of "oh you guys.. you're just CRAZY!" type of way. But Dirty Sanchez has crossed some kind of threshold. I hate to sound like Mary Whitehouse, but I am worried when a guy nailing his cock to a piece of wood is considered easy viewing. It left me rather perplexed and my female companion with a nasty bout of insomnia. And it's on MTV for god's sake! What does a guy shaving his arse cheeks off with grip paper have to do with music?   What will be next, Cilla Black presents "Seal Clubbing Challenge?" Davina McCall chopping up OAPs with a chainsaw? Trevor McDonald drowning kittens in a cheese fondue?

       You should all know by now the love myself and Toaster have for toys and clever gadgets "Especially round the office at work"  Well last time I was looking for a new toy at  urlLink http://www.iwantoneofthose.com  there was a promotional game where you had to find 5 easter eggs around the website to have a chance at winning a £100 voucher. In between all my work I managed to find the 5 eggs and submitted my email address not expecting to hear any more about it...  To my surprise this morning I got an email:  To: Scott Wickenden From: iwantoneofthose.com Subject: You're a Winner!  Congratulations Scott, you're a winner! You're one of the 5 lucky winners of our Easter Egg Hunt and we have a £100.00 waiting to be emailed to you.    How lucky can one man be, really I mean it. If you are reading this and sometimes feel like you have very little luck in this world I think I could be to blame  This year already I have got an amazing deal on a car. Have had my wages increased more that anyone in the island so far. bought a house for half the price it should have been. had my marrage proposal accepted by the lovely Kate. The list goes on and on, Time to get that lottery ticket one thinks!!  I'll stop bragging now and will say a big thank you to Maria Constantinou at  urlLink http://www.iwantoneofthose.com  for organising the competition. Keep up the good work!!! I have ordered a plot of land on the moon and a whole lot more. I will let you know all about it when I get it down.

       We all have a serious thing for gadgets and toys. Maybe it's because we grew up with quality items, such as He-Man and Thundercats, rather than the shameful crap that seems to haunt toy stores these days. Dougal recently placed an order for some AIRZOOKAS.  What's an AIRZOOKA you ask?    urlLink www.iwantoneofthose.com  says:  "This monster is a highly effective close-quarter wind weapon that had the office in stitches for far longer than adults should laugh without sitting down for a little rest. Basically a large bucket and a bag, this wonderful thing is the ultimate air defence weapon that fires an incredibly focused ball of air up to twenty feet. It's hard to imagine how much fun this is until you've tried it - it's a blast, quite literally."   Is it ever! We had such a laugh with these. You pull the plunger back and release it, it fires a ball of air. No batteries needed. You obviously can't see it, but you can hear it ripping past your ears and sending your buddies screaming for cover like a bunch of jessies.  Unfortunately Scott got a little over-excited and there was a small windmilling incident with one of the office contractors, but they are great fun and well worth £13.    Loverat demonstrates the Iraqi "duck and cover" technique with an Airzooka.

       I'm a social menace, according to that. What a surpise :)  Oh yes, and i'd formally like to welcome our newest TF member - Captain Kirk. Kirk has been running the gauntlet of Toasterfileism for some time now, and proved his worth with several complex and eye catching dance moves. He has also won a drinking game on a pirate ship, and took one for the team in Cancun. High praise indeed. So please be upstanding for Captain Kirk, official baptism to follow shortly in Libby Square fountain. *w00t*hoorah*etc*  Bring on the bank holiday!

       Phew, what a night.. so we head down to Chicago for Captain Kirk and PK's birthday bash. It was a EXCELLENT turn out, so I feel obliged to mention everyone that came down - Custard, Baity, Alain Le M, Captain Kirk, Dougal, Lady Kate, Grist, Simon (aka Shrek), Tim (aka Conan), PK.. sorry for anyone i've missed but the Singapore Slings, The Long Island Iced Teas and the Sex on the Beach had me me very merry, very fast. We really have to STOP laying that cigerette pack game. It's a one way ticket to Pissedville, USA.  We ran up to Liquid and did some star jumps on the dancefloor, distressing lots of girls... and that's about all I remember at the moment. :D  I've created a  urlLink new photo album  so we can upload all our crazy pictures from our spiffy Nokia camera phones. Hoorah! Go check it out for pictures of last night. If your a loyal TF reader you'll probably find your face on there!    Michael says: Get me another scotch and coke. Is it here yet?  Lastly, find out which Simpsons Character you are, with this quick  urlLink personality test.  I am Lisa apparently.. but i'd have prefered Sideshow Bob.

       Lo everyone sorry I havent posted in a while but have been a bit "pick one" (Rubbish, Busy, Lazy) all in all I have had a bit of a bad start (On TF) I have been out on some mad missions getting drunk but have forgotten to:- a) take the camera b) post any details about it (if I could remember them) c) remember that I can't afford to spend 2k a month drinking if i'm buying a house? (though fun it has been)  So what has Dougle been up to??? Well I have been busy sorting out buying my new property and it's not an easy task It should have all gone through and have been sorted by last Friday unfortunatly the Lawyers (excuse my Language) decided not to look at my case file until 4 days before court only to find out that all the boundries where not catalogued at the town hall properly as it happens the property has been owned by the same family ever since it was built in the victorian ages and 50 years ago the states of jersey compulsary purchased all its land to build some crappy states flats without sorting all the boundry rights so the sale couldent go ahead. ***Yawn*** sorry I think I'm boring myself Anyhow hopefully it will all go ahead in the next week or so and the summer chato Toaster Files will be created. The back yard on the new property is big enough to fit 2 coaches with room to spare. I have been out an bought the largest Garden table a chairs I can find plus some big out door Gas heaters so It will be a summer of BBQ's, Drinking, Bekini's and parties the summer through  Watch this space for updates.

       This is an acutal review posted by someone on Aint it Cool New of the new Matrix movie, Reloaded ------- errr dont read if you havent seen the film :-)  MATRIX: KINGDOM OF ASS-KICKING Jim-Jammity Jesus Krispy Kreme Christ on a twat-rocket, this movie blew me apart and put me back together only after I’d got put back I felt like I had thirteen dicks and they’d all gotten blown by a surfer chick with 26 heads (2 mouths on each cock). I will see it ten times and if I see Star Wars George or that gay Batman director butt-hole any time during the ten screenings here comes Mr. Punch.  This is the sequel to the MATRIX Movie that came out four years ago and after seeing it I can say I could have waited another four years it is that fucking good. This movie is a pillowcase with soda cans inside that beats the living mule-fuck out of you but you’re all like, “Bring it on honky  tonk” because the beating feels like summer and Halloween and Cheetos at the same time. This movie is Mad Max’s shotgun-gun from ROAD WARRIOR, only it shoots ass-kicking only at jocks. This movie is tits!  WARNING: THIS PARAGRAPH IS ABOUT THE PLOT AND IT’S BORING AND THERE’S NO ASS-KICKING IN IT BUT I USE THE WORD “FUCK” THREE TIMES TO HELP GET THROUGH IT I still don’t get the plot of the first one, and this one’s all talking about “choices” (over and over again to where you think you’re watching that fucking Chicktime network) and “prophecies” and especially words like “anomaly” and “exile” (and who the fuck even knows what those words mean?) and there’s this long speech at the end that I also didn’t get. Also, you find out all this deep stuff, like about The Cookie Lady from the first movie and they introduce all these other characters like a Key Guy and a Frenchie Dude and another Frenchie but guess what it’s okay ‘cuz the other Frenchie’s a chick and she’s got cleavage you could hide a rump roast in and also this ex-girlfriend of Murphus and there’s this new guy on the ship flying it around, I think he’s from OZ (don’t worry, no butt rape). And Neo and Memento Babe are all PDA every second, and they also “do it” and one time I thought I saw Memento Babe’s nip but it was one of those metal ring things that everyone’s got on ‘em so no jacking off when the DVD comes out.  NOW ALL ASS-KICKING UNTIL THE END So that’s the plot but here’s the thing: you could wear headphones and listen to Dio during this whole movie and you wouldn’t miss anything, there’ s so much ass-kicking going on. That Smith Dude is back, only now he can make more Smith Dudes and do they each know how to kick ass? Like a Heroclix collector knows how to not get pussy. Plus he’s got this other ability that’ s really fucking scary and I think it might have something to do with the next movie.  ASS-KICKING #1: Neo fights those Blues Brothers-looking dudes and it’s pretty fucking cool. But it’s just a teaser, like when they have pictures of the food at Jack in the Box, and the tacos look all good in the picture, but then you get some and they look like they got pooped out of a pig. But you eat ‘em because there’s fries coming. In this movie there’s ALWAYS fries coming. 6.  HEADS UP: There’s a lot of boring stuff between Ass-Kicking 1 and 2. There’s a sermon by the dude who was in OMEGA MAN, and this underground dance thing that looks like if Pottery Barn had a rave on the Planet of the Gay Apes – but the rave thing is where Neo and Memento Babe “do it”. I am bringing my headphones when I see this again on the 15th.  ASS-KICKING #2: Neo and a Kung Fu Phooey go at it in a picnic restaurant. They kick over a big thing of chopsticks, which is kind of cool, and Kung Fu Phooey wears these cool little sunglasses, but that’s it. 5. And then Neo and Cookie Lady talk. Then chiggity-check your rectum ‘cuz here comes:  ASS-KICKING #2: This fight on a playground where like a hundred Smith Dudes are whomping on Neo like a fat girl eating Fiddle Faddle – it’s that intense. Holy shit. The thing goes on for like five minutes and just when you’re thinking, “Fuck you Star Wars George” it goes on for another five minutes and then Neo flies away like that Greatest American Hero dude. 10.  ASS-KICKING #3: Neo, Murphus and Memento Babe go to a French restaurant in the Matrix and there’s this French dick and you’re thinking, “Fuck you for not supporting us against Egypt”, and then Neo goes whomp-ass happy on the dude’s cohorts while Murphus and Trinity free this Key Dude and fight these Edgar Winter guys with dreadlocks who can turn into ghosts. 8.  HERE’S WHERE I WISH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ONLY HAD THE WORDS “HOLY” “FUCKING” AND “SHIT” ASS-KICKING #4 – 28: That’s right, this next scene feels like 24 ass-kickings. Seriously, the rest of the summer is going to suck busboy cock for ketchup packets compared to this scene.  HOLY Murphus and Memento Babe have to escape on a huge freeway (which is a no-no in the Matrix; “It’s suicide!” says Memento Babe, or something like that I can’t remember for sure) while the Ghost Guys chase them, plus the Smiths, who keep taking over the drivers on the freeway and they’re shooting and everything’s blowing up for miles and  FUCKING Memento Babe has to go against the traffic on a fucking motorcycle and they keep trying to smash her and Murphus takes out the Ghost Guys in this totally cool way and the fucking samurai sword and the head-on crash and  !!!SHIT!!! the fucking Blues Brothers guys and razors and swordfight on top of a truck and Memento Babe flying through the air and out of nowhere Neo and I am out!!of!!cum!! 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  And there’s a whole other ass-kicking after this, which I can barely remember because, seriously, that fucking chase scene. It’s now #2 on my list of all-time chases, ahead of ARK RAIDERS, where Blade Runner gets dragged behind the Nazi truck (#5), and then DYING IN LOS ANGELES, where CSI is driving the car against the traffic (#4) and then TAXI RONIN, where Taxi Driver guy goes the wrong way down that French tunnel, and also because they keep running over French people (#3), and now MATRIX, right behind BANDIT AND THE FAT GAY GUY 2, where all the police cars and all the trucks play chicken out in the desert (#1).  Neo needs to fight Blade and that fat bald guy from STIR CRAZY.  Then Murphus and Neo and Memento Babe try to raid some sort of central something, like the CPU in TRON, something like that. Smith Dude re-appears, Neo has a talk with a new character, someone dies and someone’s reborn. Then something gets destroyed (good), something else gets destroyed (bad), and Neo discovers a new power. Then something BIG gets destroyed (really really bad), and someone lives who shouldn’t.  MY HINT: Stay through the credits and you get to see a trailer for MATRIX: YOU WILL SHIT, the third movie.  That’s it. Best movie of the year. I still want to see HULK-MAN and the werewolf thing and I think there’s something where you get to see a hot Asian’s boobs, but they’re not going to get close to this one. Here’s my blurb if they’re putting blurbs in ads:  “MATRIX: KINGDOM OF ASS-KICKING is like if all of Anthrax’s albums formed into a hot chick who had to fuck you ten times a day or she gets  pee-cancer.”

       Hello folks, long time- no post!  Yesterday I finally got round to checking out the 'Happy Tree People' link that Toaster posted last week. Now if you were to ask any person who has met me briefly, or even some friends that I don't see often, then you would be told that I am a fairly nice sort of guy who is peaceful and easy going........but.......ask one of the Toaster Files crew then they will tell you different hehe!!!  That right, underneath the quiet and peaceful shell that is 'John' lies an evil and dark soul! So when I sat down to watch the 'Happy Tree People' I was a bit taken aback when the introduction clip appeared to be that of a kiddies cartoon!! (I was displeased to say the least). However, showing a great deal of self control I continued to watch the video......  The main introduction clip before any episode starts with one of the cartoons characters watching a huge TV and humming to her cute little self.....suddenly a loud crashing noise becomes apparent and suddenly......the TV crashes screen first onto our helpless and cute little character, squashing her flat and sending brain matter and gore everywhere! "This is going to be excellent, I think to myself".  And sure enough, I watched every episode on the the website in the space of half an hour hehehehehe! Lots of gore, lots of laughs. After I was finished, I went to check out their websites store and was happily surprised to find some T-shirts which I promptly bought.  Anyway, times up, got to go, post soon.  Baity signing off.....

       Yeah the soundtrack was pretty poor compared the first one..... That Rage track is class tho :-)  I liked the scrap between Neo and Seraph... hopefully get to see some more action from him in Revolutions.  Out of the whole film id have to say the one part i didnt really enjoy and found it boring was the Zion thing... went on way too long, who really cares about seeing them dance..... god damn it i want fighting.  All that said im looking forward to November.  But then there are still some big movies to come that i cant wait to see...... The Hulk, LOTR - The return of the King, The Last Samurai and T3 to name a few.

       My only problem with Matrix: Reloaded was the soundtrack. The first one was ROCKING, with really kick-ass tracks in the fights and stuff. This one blew. The only track I remember was a Rage Against The Machine track right at the credits. Daft. Also what the fuck is Persphone doing, i mean I know she's Monica Belchionia or whatever, but she's just T & A and there's a time and a place for that but not in the glorious cinematic geek-fest that is the Matrix. Trinity should have popped a cap in her skinny butt for mashing tonsils with Neo. What a harlot!  Anyway.. Kerrie sent me this..  TWO TOUGH QUESTIONS     Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already,three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?   Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.     Question 2: It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.       Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day. Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening. Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.     Which of these candidates would be your choice?   Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.       Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt. Candidate B is Winston Churchill. Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.     And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.

       Well went and saw Matrix Reloaded last night..... wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be but still really enjoyed it.   I think the first movie had a better story line and good action scenes... this one had a weaker story line but kick ass action scenes and from the trailer Revolutions looks like its gonna rock too.  Aint played the enter the matrix game yet, does look well cool tho. Im still currently playing X2 Wolverine's Revenge or Midnight Club 2, keep flicking between them.

       I've begun my new contract and things are going schweet, despite the threat of physical violence from Frank. I've been silly busy, and only had a small amount of time to go kill-crazy on  urlLink Enter The Matrix . If you've been living under a rock, this is the PC/Console game released in time with the Matrix Reloaded. (Which is on TOMORROW... HOLY CRAP! I'VE SOILED MYSELF!) *ahem* anyway.. yeah, so it's pretty good.. except a few things about the PC version that really piss me off.   Like the large crappy white font that displays your health and focus meters. The console version looks much schweeter. Also if you minimize the bastard, it won't restore which is really annoying. Some git is having a better Matrix experience on a PS2 or XBox which cost the same as my freaking graphics card. Gits. I hope they patch the niggly problems. However the combat kicks ass! You can chop-socky SWAT teams left, right and center, run around in bullet-time and jump off walls, etc. I've still waiting for Trinity's pixelated bottom to dance the lambada across my screen though.  It's a stop-gap anyway because PlanetSide should be down soon so we'll all be blasting each other on that. Lock and load soliders!  If you're a sick puppy like me, you'll love  urlLink Happy Tree Friends!

       Curry Taster.  Notes taken from an Inexperienced Curry Taster Named Paul Reynolds, who was visiting Bombay, India from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK.  "Recently I was honoured to be selected as a judge at a curry cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (a couple of local Indians) that the curry wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.  Here are the scorecards from the event: ______________________________________  Curry # 1: Manoj's Maniac Mobster Monster Curry  JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.  JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.  Paul: Holy shit!! What the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Indian fellows are crazy if they even begin to think this tastes like food. #  _________________________________  Curry # 2: Applesamy's Afterburner Curry  JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.  JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.  Paul: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. I had an expression like a cow sucking piss off a thistle.  ____________________________________________  Curry # 3: Farouk's Famous Burn Down the Barn Curry  JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse curry! Great kick. Needs more beans.  JUDGE TWO: A beanless curry, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.  Paul: Call Sellafield, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Domestos. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. The barmaid pounded me on the back; now my back bone is in the front part of my chest. I'm now getting shit-faced from all the beer.  _________________________  Curry # 4: Barbu's Black Magic Bean Blaster  JUDGE ONE: Black bean curry with almost no spice. Disappointing.  JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a curry.  Paul: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Jaswinder, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 320 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is curry an aphrodisiac?  __________________________________  Curry # 5: Laveshnee's Legal Lip Remover  JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong curry. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.  JUDGE TWO: Curry using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.  Paul: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed hospital treatment from 3rd degree burns. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her curry had given me brain damage. Jaswinder saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on to it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Phone the White House and tell them you've discovered a stockpile of napalm.   _________________________________  Curry # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety  JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety curry. Good balance of spice and peppers.  JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb!  Paul: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous and dangerously explosive methane building up. I have sulphuric flames leaping from my airhole. My rusty sheriffs badge feels like it's been rogered with a red hot poker and I've just shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Jaswinder; she must be kinkier than I thought. I Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! I think if I sit on the toilet now, my airhole will go down for a drink of water.  ______________________________________  Curry # 7: Sugash's Screaming Sensation Curry  JUDGE ONE: A mediocre curry with too much reliance on canned peppers.  JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of curry peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably, frothing at the mouth and nostrils and his trousers appear soiled with what appears to be a smoking gravy.  Paul: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with curry which slid unnoticed from my mouth. I'm dribbling acid that has eaten my beard away and now feels like it's eating my skin away with it. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 2 inch hole this stuff has eaten in my stomach.  _______________________________  Curry # 8: Hansraj's Mount Saint Curry  JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend curry, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.  JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced curry, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the curry pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot curry?  Paul: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report.

       I see your lego idiot, and I raise you:     Oh and by the way.... in honor of Custard's little operation and the fact that we somehow missed his birthday, I propose a second invasion of Guernsey for a weekend. I think they have had ample time to recover from the last Toaster File onslaught, by now they will be regrouping and possibly forming some kind of plan to stop our military coup on the stage at Club 54. They need to be told, and more importantly than that, Baity needs some hot love action. All those in favour?

       Ok here is an update of the goings on over here...  Um Custard came out of hospital on his birthday which I am sure was much to his relief, although it is going to be a while until he can come out and play! Toaster seems to be absorbed by his new girly who seems to be illuding the rest of us (maybe we are too young for conversation or something). Danger doesn't have a great deal of contact with us so I can't really say much about his doings other than to say hope your feeling better mate. Grist continues to play with his little toy soldier in his underground bunker. Dougal seems to be settled into his new home, throwing bbq's that none of us know about asides Toaster. Kirk is settling nicely into the disfunctionate family and continues to be an inspiration to all hot blooded males who go out on the pull. Psycho has spent the last few months working as a pimp in Green St. I have been renewing friendships with old friend, making new mates and been pissed off at my computer because it only work two times out of every ten that I try to use it!!!  Other related business includes....  Lyndsey from Gaia's Web over in Guernsey is over on holiday and we might get to say hello if she gets time.  Decided to grow my hair again! Lets see how far I get this time!! I managed to pile the work truck into a Jurats car last week, DOH!!! Splash reamins the best nightclub in the island...town still SUCKS!!!! I am thinking of starting a new column named 'Baity's something or other', this being a section where I tell of my favourite likes and dislikes of the week etc. I was also thinking that we should run an 'Eye Wars' contest, but more to come on that as it develops.  A big hello to Liane, who appears to be all alone on the Shut It site, I'll have a big chat with ya next time I see you online. Right its 23:06ish and time for beddybyes! Got to get up for work at 5 these days!! Baity signing off......

       Bank holiday weekends rock! Yay! ...so it was supposed to be a big night last night, but I think like a damp firework it kind of fizzled out and left people with a slapped-arse expression on their faces. Sometimes the vibe just isn't there, and you can't push it - even more alcohol will not light the party blue touch paper in these situations. The best thing to do is Cinderella/pumpkin it before midnight and go out the next day instead. This is exactly what I am doing today. It's Francis Rocha's birthday bash, and also the end of an era for me as I am handing in my notice at my current employer, whom I have been with for seven years.  So I’ll be out in town causing mayhem all day - if anyone fancies joining me for a banana daiquiri then give me a holler. Peace out !

       Morning All, here is a piss poor attempt of humor on the 1st day of May 2003. This didn't make me laugh as im a sick old git who only laughs at someone elses fuck ups like falling down a flight of stairs and breaking their neck. Anyway, another bank holiday is almost upon us which means time to get those beer drinking caps out and start drinking lots of beer followed by taking the piss out of all the stuck up bitches who live in our great Island of Jersey, 'Sorry sweatpea, you could handle this much fun while you have you're own head stuck up your arse. Make sure you wash your mouth out with soap as i don't like the taste of shit in my mouth'. Anyway: Why did the chicken cross the road?   GEORGE W. BUSH  We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know  if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either  with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.   COLIN POWELL  Now at the left of the screen, you clearly see the satellite image of the  chicken crossing the road.   HANS BLIX  We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been  allowed access to the other side of the road.   MOHAMMED ALDOURI (Iraq ambassador)  The chicken did not cross the road. This is a complete fabrication. We  don't  even have a chicken.   SADDAM HUSSEIN  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in  dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.   DR. SEUSS  Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes, The chicken crossed the road,  But why it crossed, I've not been told.   ERNEST HEMINGWAY  To die. In the rain. Alone.    MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without  having their motives called into question.   GRANDPA  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us  that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.   BARBARA WALTERS  Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the  chicken  tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it experienced a  serious case of moulting and went on to accomplish its life-long dream of  crossing the road.   JOHN LENNON  Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace.   RONALD REAGAN  What chicken?   CAPTAIN KIRK  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.   FOX MULDER  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many more chickens have  to  cross before you believe it?   SIGMUND FREUD  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road  reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.   BILL GATES  I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not only cross roads, but  will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your cheque book  -  and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.   ALBERT EINSTEIN  Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the  chicken?   BILL CLINTON  I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken?  Could you define chicken, please?   COLONEL SANDERS  I missed one?   CAPTAIN KIRK signing off :o)

       My girlfriend and I had been dating for three years, and we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my fiancée? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, and that was my mother-in-law to be. She was a smart, confident career woman, but most of all she was unbelievably sexy. She often openly flirted with me, which piqued my curiosity and made me quite uncomfortable at the same time. One day she called me and asked me to come over to review the wedding invitations. When I got there, I realized she was alone. As we looked at the invitations, she whispered in my ear: "Soon you will be married, but you must know that I have feelings for you that I can no longer ignore. Before you commit your life to my daughter, please make love to me just once". I was in total shock.... what could I say?  As I sat there dumbfounded she said: "I'll go to the bedroom, and if you share my yearnings, just come up and take me." Still dazed, I watched her magnificent form as she whisped up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, unsure of what to do, and then turned around and went to the front door. Slowly, I opened it, and stepped out of the house. Amazingly, her husband was standing outside. With tears in his eyes, he hugged me and said: "We are so happy. You have passed our little test. We couldn't have asked for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."  I will never forget the day I earned the trust of my in-laws, nor the valuable life lesson I learned on the front steps of my wife's childhood home  - always, always, always, keep your condoms in your car.

       Right, while it's been a bit quiet I'm going to take this opportunity to have a bit of a moan. Again.  Customer service in Jersey needs a foot in its ass. Recently I ordered the daddy of mattresses. I've not been sleeping that well and.. well, nevermind. I decided I needed a new mattress, and the shifty slippery salesman twisted my arm (it didn't take much) into buying the BOMB of mattresses. It's got all the widgets and I almost fell asleep in the shop when I lay on it. I was hooked. Anyway, so I handed over the plastic and was told it would take a minimum of five weeks to ship. FIVE BLOODY WEEKS! Wars are fought and won in five weeks! We can launch a man into space, put a flag on the moon and be back in time for a cup of tea in the time it takes to get a six foot four lump of material and springs from the Midlands to Jersey. Anyway, I really wanted it so I agreed.  Eventually I get a call saying its in. I call up the slippery salesman to arrange delivery, and they can't do it for another friggin' week. A week to get a mattress from St Peters to my gaff. Bastards!  So I say yeah, and tell him when somebody will be here to let them in. He says that the delivery guys 'don't like to be tied down to a time'. WHAT THE FUCK? They aren't rocket scientists are they? They aren't rock stars! What am I supposed to do? Take a day off on holiday just so I can let the  urlLink Chuckle Brothers  into my gaff and deliver a mattress! What's the matter with these people? Whatever happened to.. "Ok Sir. When would it be convienient for us to deliver it to you?"  Another thing.. I hate walking to work when it's wet. It's depressing and a twenty minute stroll through the North Sea is no way to begin a days work. So I decide, what with our new Connex buses driving all over the place, maybe I should take the bus. It wouldn't be so bad. I could pay my twenty pence or whatever and sit next to a old granny and talk about the time she tied a German soldiers shoelaces together when he was asleep. So I dig out the  urlLink timetable off the internet.  You know what time the buses leave from the bus stop at the bottom of my road? Between 10am and 4pm. What fucking use is that? Is it to cater for the hordes of invisible tourists clammering to get to the Zoo and take pictures of a monkey masturbating? No. Why arn't the buses running at sensible times.. times that you could use them to get to work, and more importantly get to Chicago bloody Rock. Argh! Jersey has a LONG way to go yet folks.  Anyway, thank you for letting me get that off my chest. I'll reward you with some  urlLink Dogs in Snoods !

       An elderly couple is enjoying an anniversary dinner together in a small tavern.  The husband leans over and asks his wife, "Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind this tavern where you leaned against the fence and I made love to you."    "Yes," she says, "I remember it well."  "OK," he says, "How about taking a stroll 'round there again and we can do it for old time's sake."  "Oooooooh Henry, you devil, that sounds like a good idea," she answers. There's a police officer sitting in the next booth listening to all this, and having a chuckle to himself. He thinks, "I've got to see this...two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble." So he follows them. They walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for support, aided by walking sticks. Finally they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence.  The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down and the old man drops his trousers. She turns around and as she hangs on to the fence, the old man moves in. Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the watching policeman has ever seen. They are bucking and jumping like eighteen-year-olds. This goes on for about forty minutes! She's yelling, "Ohhhh, God!" He's hanging on to her hips for dear life. This is the most athletic sex imaginable. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground. The policeman is amazed. He thinks he` has learned something about life that he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their    clothes back on. The policeman, still watching thinks, 'That was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I've got to ask him what his secret is.  As the couple pass, he says to them, "That was something else, you must have been having sex for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? You must have had a fantastic life together. Is there some sort of secret?"  "No, there's no secret," the old man says, "fifty years ago that damn fence wasn't electric."

       GIRL'S DIARY  --------------  FRIDAY 21st June 2002.  Saw John in the evening and he was acting really strangely.    I went shopping in the afternoon with the girls and I did turn up a bit late so I thought it might be that.    The bar was really crowded and loud so I suggested we go somewhere quieter to talk.    He was still very subdued and distracted so I suggested we go somewhere nice to eat.    All through dinner he just didn't seem himself; he hardly laughed, and didn't seem to be paying any attention to me or to what I was saying. I just knew that something was wrong.    He dropped me back home and I wondered if he was going to come in; he hesitated, but followed.     I asked him again if there was something the matter but he just half shook his head and turned the television on.    After about 10 minutes of silence, I said I was going upstairs to bed. I put my arms around him and told him that I loved him deeply.    He just gave a sigh, and a sad sort of smile.    He didn't follow me up, but later he did, and I was surprised when we made  love.    He still seemed distant and a bit cold, and started to think that he was going to leave me, and that he had found someone else.    I cried myself to sleep.

       That Star Wars kid rocks.  That agent Smith scrap in the Playground would have improved drastically if they had got a pro like that in instead of Keanu.  12 Weeks to go until i give up full time employment and go and be one of those student type people. Gonna be weird as ive been working full time since i was 17 (arrrggghhh 9 years) to go back to doing shit like falling asleep during lectures, failing assingments and the like... but i was good at both of them back then and i bet ill be even better now.

       Yay! Cheap fights! Hoorah! Maybe we'll end up being able to go to London for the weekend without having to sell a kidney! Yippee!  Here are some random thoughts I have had today:  How annoying is it that everyone stands and gawps at Rivoli's musical clock? Every fucking hour, on the hour, there's fifty people, jaws on the floor, gazing in wonder as "OId MacDonald" echos down King Street. Custard has a lot to answer for.  Liquid School disco nights: Hundreds of pissed-up 18 year olds singing "C'mon Eileen", Bacardi Breezers in hand. How on earth do they know the lyrics? How can they be so scary and intriguing at the same time?  If Chicago Rock's music is all selected and play-listed in the UK, what does Nevill actually do?  Where the fuck is Grist?  Who the hell were those two women in Liquid who were shouting "There's that Toaster guy! Do the running man Toaster-boy!!"  Isn't the Sports Bar due for redecorating? It's been that way since.. well.. as long as I can remember now.    Tiddles was the butt of all the other cats' jokes.   urlLink Star Wars Kid: Reloaded  - Windows Media Player file

       Hello all! Yes I am back from Drag Racing at Santa Pod, and what an event it was. We (Noel and Richard- my cousins, Andy and James and Helen) got into poole on thursday night and drove to Bournemoth where we got pissed and stayed in a guest house, however I think it was a bit of a strange guest house as they provided piss sheets in the adults beds as well as the childrens!!! Thanks to these piss sheets we got a fairly unrestful night as we were bathing in our own sweat! (not very nice).  So on Friday we drove to the event at Santa Pod, a raceway built on an old American airbase from WW2. That evening we headed out on the Muscle Car Tour, where all the American Muscle Cars drive 'en mass' through Poddington, a very cool sight. The only downer of the day was that it had rained from 6am the previous day until about 5pm now!  Saturday saw the event kick off the drag racing, and believe me...standing next the the cars as they roar down a quarter mile straight, engines kicking out 1500bhp and more!!  I knew pretty much nothing about cars when I went, but I have learnt a great deal and it has awoken a new appreciation for muscle cars that I never thought possible.  Saturday night we all chilled out in the beer tent and watched the live band, the lead singer of which has a car that would make the 'Minden Place Massive' shit their pants!!  Sunday saw a dryer day and the burnout competition...YAY!  Also on Sunday we saw the third run of 'Fireforce'- the jet car. This beast can do a quarter of a mile in around 7 seconds, thats moving man!!! However, on it's third run, as they were priming the system on the starter grid, their fuel lines burst, sending fuel all over the place which was a bit unnerving hehe!  The event ended on Sunday night and Richard, Andy, James and I drove back to Bournemoth, the rest had headed home the day before due to work. When we got there we headed out on the piss and had an indian dinner, which I have to admit, broke me!!!  On Monday we had to catch the boat home at 4pm, so we did the I-max theatre (a 3d glasses cinema) which was cool. We also went on the 'Bournemoth Eye', this being a 450ft high helium balloon which permanently soars in the air, only it get winched down to let people on. This seemed like a total waste of time as we waited an hour and a half just to get on.....but it was SOOOOO worht it!  This thing is meant to operate safely in wind speeds up to 30 knots...however, when we got to the top (just the four of us) the balloon guy said to hold on as the wind speed was up to 34 knots!! At this point the balloon was bobbing around nicely hahaha! We spent ten hair raising minute up there (video to come hopefully) and then we came down and raced to our boat ahlf an hour later in Poole.  All in all a great trip, that I will be going on again next year! Oh and I have started a new photo album in the photo room...containing some of the pictures I took when I was there... more to come thought!  Baity signing off........  P.S. I would just like to say Lyndz su...........no wait rules lol!

       Argh.. another Sunday, another hangover. Last night was awesome, myself, Custard and Captain Kirk went to the nurses's summer ball at the Hotel De France. There was about 120 people there, not huge but enough for a good time. Some lovely young nurses as well, I think the lads were in hugs heaven. :D  I was going to tell you about the weekend before was well in Liverpool. It was mental, we had VIP passes and arranged for a limo to pick us up from the hotel. We had a tour of Liverpool drinking bubbly in the back  and doing the "stand out of the sunroof and wave to the crowds" thing. The concert itself was awesome, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, with Eric Clapton.  The only annoying thing was we were the only people dancing in the entire stadium (second row from the front, too... nice) but the cameras loved us making an arse of ourselves, so hopefully it'll be on the DVD.. yay!  The night progress with a trip to the lovely "Angels" lapdancing bar and then finishing up at the only place open at 3am, a gay bar that didn't serve alcohol. (Not that it really mattered by this point)  So, in conclusion... Liverpool is actually a TOP place. Loads to do, really pretty city, clean and nice chicks all over the place (if you like that sort of thing)  Oh yeah... the new pool is finally open down on the front! Sure it's a bit small but it's only a fiver a swim! How will they make any money?

       Right so here's what i've been up to. I've been blasting down French motorways all weekend with my lady friend, roof down and stereo up.. hoorah! Nice weekend off the rock, and I didn't meet any French people that made me want to stab them, which was very nice. I do have to say however that French people are generally bastards behind the wheel of a car. They don't slow down for anything, and they drive so far up your arse they might as well be sitting on your bonnet like one of those little Rolls Royce flying angel things. It's a shame I was driving as some good old fashioned bum-out-of-the-window-Winston-Churchill action was required.  It took me about twenty minutes to suss out that the speed limits only apply to you if you're a tourist as they cane it everywhere.  My dad's moving over there and has bought a HUGE block of farmland with a big jock-off house and SEVEN barns for about the price of a cheaper Porsche. He even got the farmers old tractor thrown in and everything, and I got to drive it around and scare the neighbours dog. Yay!  Next weekend I am off to see Eric Clapton play in Liver-fucking-fool with Loverat.  He got a great deal on some VIP tickets, champange on arrival, four course dinner and open bar all night. I promise that I will post a picture of me putting Clapton in a chicken-wing if at all possible.  Go and play some of the rude games at  urlLink Viz Magazine  now, because i'm going to watch  24 .

       Ok lads here is the deal...... WE NEED TO START POSTING STUFF AGAIN!  Yup we have all sunk into the depths of some deep, dark and foreboding abyss of silence!!!  So I for one am going to start posting on a regular basis again (I'll do my best) and it would be great if the rest of you joined in. I know, I know you all think that you are too busy or some of you jump straight onto Ever Quest, or I for one do other stuff, but that is really shite.  So a general catch up on the life of Baity, hhmmm.........................  Ok so where to start? Well I hit the grand age of 22 last Wednesday (July 2nd, so you don't have to waste time looking for the calendar). The Toaster Crew all went out on a big piss up at Chicago Rock and Liquid. It was quite a night for all and I for one was wasted! Dougal and myself did a dodgy run into the former VIP lounge in Liquid, which is now an over 25's lounge on Wednesday night (I mean for fuck sake!!!). The bouncer asked us for ID and we simply stared at him with one of the looks that say 'You must be bloody joking!' As it happens we both had big glasses of champagne in our hands plus other drinks and he decided to let us in haha! Most of the others came and found us and we all chilled out there for the rest of the night- all that is with exception to Toaster, whom unfortunately didn't pass for a 25 year old (more laughing and nudges Adam with a wink!). Anyway the rest of the night is history apart from saying that it was pretty good.  Thursday I took a trip over to Guernsey to meet some friends over there. Yep I have at last gone out for that big piss up with the Gaias Web Crew, and it was awesome!!! Now just a quick thing I want to say to anyone over here that has that Jersey animosity towards Guernsey- 'Quit being a sad bunch of fucks!' The fact is that Guernsey may be a little behind us in things like waterfront projects and multi-story carparks but they are so much more up for the crack! By that I mean that they are much more up for a social and entertaining night out, plus they don't hold a sacred obsession with the fucking fashion industry! I could at least head out around the town feeling myself in a pair of casual trousers and a punk top! Not like over here in Jersey where if you don't suck Hugo Boss' cock then you don't fit!!! So basically give them a break and go over, you may actually realize that it's a good old place (Preach over).  So anyway, I went out with the Gaias Web crew and they showed me a real good time (cheers guys). We basically drank at a cool pub called 'Nix' I believe and then went out for a superb meal at a place called 'Bistro Valentinos', who serve a great steak by the way!. Then we finished the night in a bar called Bahloos (don't know if I spelt that correctly). Now in Bahloos the sell what is called 'The Big One Hundred', this being if I remember correctly- 2 gallons of cocktail, 3 Bottles of champagne and a load of shots! SWEET!!!!!!!!! Also they sell the best 'Rocket Fuel'- 8 shots topped with orange juice. So the night ended with me staggering out of a taxi at Lyndz's house and doing what I do best- Projectile Vomiting! Then Lyndz and I crashed on the sofa watching Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves lol!  Got home on Friday and milled about hung over. Then in the evening I headed out to my cousin Richard's birthday piss up! (so many piss ups!!). We ended up at the Q Bar as they were running another 'pandemonium' night- loads of heavy metal yeah!!  Saturday night saw the annual return of Baity's Coach Party Bonanza! Plus a visit from Lyndz! Yup me and 30 odd other people headed out on a mission to get me cuntoxed, dropped in the sea and generally have a good time. The pub list was as follows:  Post Horn, The Foresters, Mont Fellard Pub, The Trafalgar,  Tam's Bar, and then the SPLASH YAY!  Lots of interesting things happened that night. In fact I can't remember them all as I was totally wankered for most of it! The top 5 things were:  1- Getting Speedy to eat his own chunks of sick after we broke him with two shots at the second pub! 2- Jenny giving all the drivers behind the coach some naked cheeseburger action!! 3- The ritual kariokee singing of bohemian rhapsody at the Trafalgar!!! 4- Me getting thrown rather mildly into the sea at Tam's, then me going for a swim in the dark, and throwing      Psycho in too!!!! 5- Me almost knocking myself out at the Splash due to falling on my own momentum and landing on a fire    extinguisher square in the back!!!!!  So that was the night and I really cannot remember anything from the Splash other than my fall! I am just about done now, but I shall post more soon, and photographs will appear on the site as I get them.  Post you bastards! Baity signing off............

        A blonde walks into the Pharmacy and asks a clerk for some bottom deodorant.  Oscar, the friendly pharmacist overhears and is a little bemused. "We don't sell bottom deodorant. I've never even heard of it."  Unfazed, the blonde assures the pharmacist that she has been buying the stuff from this store on a regular basis, and would like some more.  "I'm sorry, we don't have any. We just have underarm deodorants."  "But I always get it here," says the blonde.  "Do you have the container it comes in?"  "Yes!" said the blonde, "I will go and get it."  About an hour later, she returns with the container and hands it to the pharmacist.  "Lady, this is just a normal stick of underarm deodorant!"  Annoyed, the blonde snatches the deodorant back and reads out loud from the package, "To apply, push up bottom... well?"

       It's T minus seven hours until the biggest coach party of the year.  Woohoo!  What have I been up to lately? Well, been to a fair few comedy shows.. including a large party booking to Jasper Carrot and Phil Cool. Phil Cool was great but Jasper seems to be churning out the same old material. I have been watching re-runs of his shows on Bravo and he used some of the same gags at the Opera House. Has he not written any new material in the last ten years? Anyway it was still a good night.. I also really enjoyed Postiv+'s comedy night at the Royal Hotel, which was actually funnier than Carrot and Cool.   If you're bored, go and Google for "weapons of mass destruction" and then hit "I'm feeling lucky" insead of the normal search submit button.

       Went to France today for some shopping, eating, drinking etc. It was good fun but I think French food is over-rated. For a start I eat very little seafood so that's out, and the steaks never seem to be particularly tasty, cheap or interesting. If you don't want seafood or a steak, you're pretty much fucked.   Also, what's the fascination with fucking poodles? I don't think you're allowed to live in St Malo unless you have a mangy poodle on a lead and drag it around with you everywhere. While I'm at it, how many places do you need to buy a fucking ice-cream or a crepe from? And a cheese course between your main and your dessert. There's just no need, is there?  Look at me, I'm a right little potty mouth tonight. Anyway:   A man fell asleep on the beach one day and the wind came up and blew sand all over him until he was covered with only his big toe sticking out.     A nympho was walking down the beach, saw the toe sticking up, pulled down her bikini bottom and squatted over the toe. She humped away till she was satisfied, pulled up her drawers and left.    The guy woke up, brushed the sand away and left, not knowing what had happened.  The next day his foot itched like hell, and had a sore on it. He went to the Doctor and after an exam the doc told him he had syphilis of the big toe.     "Syphilis of the big toe?", he inquired, "isn't that rare."     The doc said "Yes, but if you think that's rare, I had a woman in here this morning with Athlete's Twat."

       Now to share some love to everyone!  I was on me way to work this morning thinking that I should leave a little early as people are off sick and on holiday. To aid, I borrowed my sisters boyfriends bicycle (actually he was borrowing it from my brother...) to cut my journey in half.  So I start down my hill. As anyone who has seen it, its quite steep and I regularly used to reach 40 mph on my old bike. Good for a lazy git like me! Any way, The road has been closed for the entire of this month as they are replacing the drains and expanding them to make it a little bigger. Now the drains are on the left going downhill and the right is pretty much untouched apart from the odd patch where the offshoots of the drains cross the road. Although the road is closed to cars, this side remains open for the cement lorries, JCB's, pedestrians and of course, cyclists.  So this morning... Me... Peddling down... I see this bit of dug up road in front of me, The road-diggers had placed a large sheet of metal over it to cover it (and allow the Cement lorries and stuff past). I slow down knowing full well what flat metal roads do to rubber tires, especially vehicles with only two... So I slip. I hit the floor, Hands first, legs still about 2 foot off the ground, still attached to the bike. The bike does a rolly poly down my back as my head hits the floor, Eyebrow first!. Less than a second later, Im getting back up fully aware that the builders saw me go arse over tit. As I stand, I notice that its raining, No Pouring down. Only in one place, and in red? My Left eye! (The one that survived the bouncy castle). Was bleeding. More precise, My eyebrow was less of bleeding, more than  dripping, Not squirting, but umm... I suppose I can only say Pissing with blood. The workmen, Bless their grubby manual worker hearts, leapt into action. Got the first aid kit on my face. The then opened it and put a sterile swab on the wound (after I had said "Murfle Murfle Mumble Murfing mell", or at least tried.) They then raced me down to the hospital where I spent an hour in A&E just to get a couple of stickers on my brow. My bleeding  I feel such a stupid arse (no change to normal I suppose)  Anyway, To cheer me up (after making you all say "Ha ha, what a stupid plonker") I will be down the splash Saturday in fancy dress. I have yet to decide on the costume.  And Happy Birthday Helen. I doubt you read this but enjoy the chicken.

       Howdy folks..  back from a nice weekend with ladyfriend in London, had some kick-ass Thai food, saw Bombay Dreams (Shakalaka Baby!) and generally relaxed which was great.  We went to the awesome Darwin Centre at the  urlLink Natural History Museum . The Darwin Centre is a huge collection of creatures and plants from all around the world, all dead and bobbing around in jars of formaldehyde.  It rocks, cheaper than a Zoo and the animals can't hid away in the corner of the cage so you can't see them. They just kind of bob around in the ether, looking all dead and stuff. They had a giant barracuda that washed up in Cornwall, loads of other fish, even a dolphin and some primates and stuff. It was very weird, kind of like in  Independence Day  when they show off the dead alien bodies in the jars.  Here are a few random thoughts on London:  London is big and busy. Obviously, as it is a city. But I just thought I'd mention it. Homeless people crash in doorways. Sometimes I wondered, if one of them had died how long it would take before anyone noticed. Sushi rules! I always miss the stars at night when I'm in London. Light pollution sucks. I'm sure the tube is bad for you. I always want to take a shower when I get off it. Like Agent Smith, I feel saturated by it's grimey grimness.  While I'm at it, here's my answers to this quiz that's doing the rounds..  1) How would you finish this phrase "I have never been so embarrassed as the time when......."?  I got stripped naked in the O bar on my 21st birthday. It was full. I was on stage. 'nuff said.  2) If you could have any job in the world what would it be?  International Playboy and Jetsetter, getting paid loads for doing pretty much nothing. Can I have a big yatch and a lear jet too. Are they here yet?  3) What do you like best about each guy on toaster files?  Grist - Sense of humor. Reduces me to giggles. Sexual deviant. Custard - Geezer. A bit ohh, a bit wa-hey. Baity - Fun trying to set him up all the time. I will keep embarrassing him till he does it himself. Alex - He's like... Omnipotent or something. He's just there. Brett - Mad as a fish. Scott - Just as bad. No, worse in fact.  Kirk - How can anyone be such a player yet so down to earth? Kirk rocks :D  4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be?  The girl I have right now. 8)  5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time?  Hmm.. Something like garlic chilli chicken, or a uber strength Thai green curry with a pitcher of Kokanne beer. Yay!

'NOTHING...I fucking hate them all!!!'  4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be?  'If I could find a girl that actually made me feel comfortable and loved, it wouldn't matter who she was...I am looking!'   5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time?

       Ahhh... Beer, Bed and TV what more could a Jersey Bloke want. Strippers and pole dancers!!!!  Right! To keep the girls happy on  urlLink Shut_it , Heres my answers to your questions. Can I add that these have to be the worse five questions I have ever been asked! They are even worse than the age old problem causing question "Elephant impression? I'd like to see that?"  1) How would you finish this phrase "I have never been so embarassed as the time when......."? Umm, Like, Urgh? How often have I been embarrassed? Possibly when my stepdad walked in on me when my girlfriend was sitting on my lap… us both butt naked, doing the dirty, bouncing up and down, sitting on the end of my brothers bed, facing the door!  2) If you could have any job in the world what would it be? Porn star interviewer. I would test female porn stars on there... Acting Abilities?   3) What do you like best about each guy on toaster files? They are all my good friends, which mean a lot. But a single point for each person is noted Toaster – wicked sense of humour, really appeals to me in its apparent complexity. Baity – so easily wound up. Custard – Oh how I don’t know anyone else who could be more of a tart when they put their mind to it. Psycho Alex – He is not one but many. He doesn’t have so much as mood swings but like Worzle Gummage, he has a different body for different attitudes. Danger and Dougal. Well… They know me and I know them. Longer than anyone else in the TF. Besides we used to shower together. Captain Kirk – I don’t really know Kirk that well… but he can drink and everyone else likes him, so he’s cool by me.   4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be? A female version of me. Only I would be as dirty, kinky and adventurous as myself. I would be able to chat to myself afterwards and I would know instinctively how to please me. Oh and I would have perfect breasts!  5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time? To refrain from sex and keep to food (as if I could draw a distinction). Something cooked by someone else. Risotto, Gristy stile. Anything by Nanny Ogg. (bananna surprise!) I would like to try Spoo but I don’t think many people would understand.

       Hello all! And what a lovely day it is, well at least it would be if I didn't have a shit load to do!!!!  Yup so, it's time to reflect on last nights events......  Ok here we go...... I get a message from Toaster at about 4pm informing me that there is a general piss up happening at 'THE tm Bar', so I give him a call, so far so good. Anyway, I turn up at about 6pm to find Toaster, Kirk, Dougal and some others who I know from elsewhere, already fairly drunk. Now at this point I am intending to drink water (yes yes I know!) as I am intending to drive home because I have a busy Saturday ahead of me! This plan works very well until we moved over to 'Chicago Rock' at about 8pm. Yup we got there and before I knew it, I had forgotten that I wanted to drive and I was participating in tequila rounds!!! Then we carry on working our way into the cocktail list like there is no tomorrow!!!  Now! I guess this is going to sound rather stupid, but then again, most things I do concerning girls are!  I think I have fallen for one of the bar staff at Chicago! Yup there we are drinking away, I'm not drunk yet and I notice someone behind the bar that just .... blows me away! I mean there are loads of great looking babes out in Jersey but there are just some people that when you lay eyes upon them you turn to mush, and this was one such person. I don't know if it was her Irish accent that got me or what but I was fallen! Anyway, so being the shy twat that I am, I didn't say a bloody word to her for most of the night (bangs his head against the wall!). I really wish I could get over this whole shy thing, it drives me mad that when I like someone I can't react to it. So time is getting on and I am still trying to think of something to say, when she walks over and asks me what drinks I am having!....so I gave my order and she gets them for me.....then Toaster decides to take action and introduce me to her (cheers man). At this point there is no turning back as it's probably my only chance lol! So I said hello and found out that it's her birthday in a couple of weeks time and that she will be at Chicago for it...YAY! So I tell her that I'll come down and buy her a drink and she gives me a smile that makes me mush again! Then unfortunately, she has to go serve someone else, but at least the initial deed is done and I wasn't totally shit!  Thing is, I really want to go to Chicago and see her again (call me sad, call me what you will, I don't care). I guess I am just deluding myself that I'd even have a chance but we must all dream!  So another point that I must make at this juncture.....a big SORRY to Donna, one of our very first Toasterfilettes. It appears that she contacted us a while ago on the message board and we totally blanked the messages!!! I would formally like to apologize to you Donna, and confess that it was me that deleted the photos you mentioned last night (see Donna works in Chicago Rock too). I believe that we took another photo last night and hopefully Toaster will have it on the site soon. Please chat us again, as you are and always will be a Toasterfilette to us! Now I am not going to grovel too much as I know that really in her heart she forgives us and wouldn't want us to go that far anyway hehe!  Anyway, I have shit loads to get on with, and it's beginning to piss me off! So I am going to have to say bye for now, back soon.   Baity signing off......

       My poor head. I am really, really hungover. My brain needs shaving and my insides need to be washed out with er.. soapy stuff.  I spammed everyone on my phone with a open invite to come down to THE bar after work and get bladdered, but due to crapness on behalf of JT I don't think everyone got the messages. Anyway, a fair few people turned up. We ran over to Chicago and saw Donna (Toasterfillette) is now working behind the bar, complete with blonde hair and glasses. Hello Donna. Anyway, so cut to a few hours later, Baity, Scott, Captain Kirk and myself had worked our way through most of the cocktail list and our now severely pissed. I remember having several drunk one-sided conversations and generally acting the goat. I remember kind of being in Liquid, kind of almost getting into a fight because I was chatting to some girl I know from work and her bloke was taking exception to it, I remember my nice Seiko watch dropping to the floor after I wacked my wrist on the metal bar (Custard, can you fix it please? The little pin bit.. er.. broke. Thanks)  Anyway,  if we carry on drinking at this pace I think we'll need to start going out about eleven to ever see 2am closing time.  Oh yeah, that dream I had about Grist... er.. all the Toaster Files crew were on a bus heading along Viccy Avenue, and there was all these modified Japanese cars like out of Fast and Furious racing along behind us. So we are all looking to see who's winning,  and it's Grist - but he's on a rickity old bicycle. He's in front of the pack, weaving between the cars and we give him a big cheer when he passes the coach and wins the race. Is that not the most bizarre dream ever? Nurse!

       Arrgh!!! Brain Ache! I’m not happy. Its payday and I am a poor, poor boy. Dentist again on Monday to fleece me of my hard earned cash. Is there any ladies out there that need a good seeing to for a small sum? I only charge by the inch, you get what you pay for. Seriously, Congratulations Ali and Emma, you probably wont ever read this but your wedding was great. Even if you did get me into top hat and tails when Jersey had the highest recorded temperature in history! The weekend was good apart from my car steering wheel melting on me. 38.5 Degrees centigrade on the M25 north of London! So many people have asked me has my car got air conditioning since this has happened, I just say YES!!! THEY ARE CALLED WINDOWS!!! What do you think I am? American? Oh and Toaster!!! Tell them all about the Dream you had of me!!! Umm… do I realize how that sounds? Life is crap. I need head.

       Just got back from seeing the Oddsocks production of Romeo and Juliett at the Zoo. It was very funny and creative, although a little long for me and I have eaten to death by bloody mosquito's! Bastards!  Random thoughts I had today:  Why do people with less talent than a bar of soap insist on auditioning for Pop Idol and having Simon Cowell rip them a new a-hole? Why don't there friends have a quiet word and tell them not to commit social suicide?  Could I survive solely on carbonated water and those little Twister ice-creams?  Why does the heat make people stupid? Walking around town today, I saw people walking into lamp posts, tripping over little yapper dogs and being generally dumb. Then I forgot my swipe card and felt dumb too, having to call a co-worker to come and let me into work. Bollocks. :7  Why do people wear no sun block, STILL spend all day on the beach despite feeling like a boiled lobster and then wonder why they look like a sultana the next day?  Why do HMV do a "buy one get one free" DVD offer, then charge double the normal price for one DVD anyway?  Will Brett actually make it up the "Miss Battle of Flowers" float this year before security guards windmill him?  Anyway, turn your speakers up and watch this  urlLink flash animation.  God bless the internet.

       Ok so, I am sitting at home, sweating my arse off because it's so damn hot! I am also bored out of my brain!  So what's new???  Well, I have once again had an upgrade at work...I have now gone from regular heavy good trucks to the 14 tonne water tankers haha! These beasts are a real nightmare to drive as they never want to stop when you brake and I have nearly tipped it already lol! Um...the week has been rather busy, this is because I am going away in about a weeks time and I have way too much to get ready for it. Hopefully all the preparation will be worth it though, usually is. I was hoping to have another trip to Guernsey to say farewell to Jo and Sam before they go to live in the UK, unfortunately it looks like I am not going to be able to go as there really is just too much going on here that I can't get out of, which really sucks!!  So today I woke up, stripped to the bone and lying on top of my bed with the pillows and the sheets all over the floor! Now I wish I could confess that this was because I had found a lovely girlfriend and we had rampant sex...but no! No, it was merely because it was just fucking hot last night!!!! Althought I slept sound. Anyway, I phoned the Toaster and he, his girlfriend and I went to the cinema (lovely and air conditioned haha) to watch Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines. It was a reasonably good film, lots of shooting, and you even get to see the machines as they first began, but I shall not go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it! Oh and Pirates Of The Carribean is a cracking film too!! I recommend it to anybody!  Thats about it for now really.....hopefully Toaster will be sorting out a bbq for all of us soon, now that his patio is finished hehe, anyway I'll have more to talk about soon.

       Sweet jesus is it hot! It's so stupid that us guys still have to wear shirts and ties in weather like this. I feel like i am trapped inside a packet of pork scratchings which have been left in a microwave for a year.   I went out for a lad's lunch at the weekend, started at the Tenby and then food at the Salty Dog (nice eye-candy), down to the Old Courthouse for a few jugs of PIMMs then back into town at THE bar. I was rather pissed and feeling like I had too much sun so I did a Captain Oates at about 8pm. I am thinking about having a bit of a BBQ while it's still summer.. let me know if you're interested peeps!   My girlfriend found this little fella while doing some shopping online... thought i'd share it with you.     Ahh!! The ph34r! run away from corset gimp man! run!

       So I'm almost over my dose of pharyngitis, fuck me did it suck. I felt knackered and lethargic all the time (no change there then) but my throat was on fire for the best part of a week. Not recommended.  So we got through the nurses ball unscathed, me with my napalm throat, Custard with his gammy ankle from attempting to exit Le Follies via the roof, and Captain Kirk with his ever present cybershot camera of doom.   I know I am getting old when I start reading through the JEP and getting angry. Like the front cover last night, I think it was Frank Walker and Terry somebody.. giving it "Bright Future for Jersey".. er.. hello? Is this island still called Jersey? This would be the island that is going through a major employment drop and companies are throwing staff out like Michael Jackson with babies off hotel balconies.  States of Jersey, wake the hell up! Almost NOBODY I know my age wants to stay on this craggy island wannabe for the rest of their lives.  They can't afford a house, they can't find a decent job and they are tired of the government wasting money on bullshit projects that do nothing but rip-off the local people.  *cough* sorry about that, you know I go a bit political every now and then.  I think I am due for another one of my pills.  G'night kids.

       So I've just finished the exam and got back home. I'm fairly confident it went pretty well. The only annoying thing was towards the end I still had something to configure, and one of the guys in the class had finished. So he starts chatting away, to himself, stuff like.. "That wasn't too bad." and other random crap. Obviously you're not supposed to talk.  I felt like saying.. "Excuse me tutor. Please could you ask the student at to my left the PIPE THE FUCK DOWN before he gets a KEYBOARD ENEMA??"  Hopefully I should get my magical e-mail from the Linux gods in the next 48 hours or so.. yay!  An example of Australian humor...  In the trains that run around Sydney, there's a sign that reads "At night, travel near the guards compartment marked with a blue light." Well, today I noticed that somebody had scratched out parts of the sign, so it read "At night, rave near the guards compartment naked with a blue light." Marvelous.

       I try :-) or should I say ( - )( - )   Something strange and slighly erotic looking at Debbie McGee dressed as a little devil...  Anyway. Blogger is a bit crap. I posted for the first time at home in a while and discovered that the new layout that dosent allow me to see the post button unless I move half the page frames about isnt the standard format and only relates to my works access to Blogger. If you change it, Can I still post? Can we still keep the archives? Anyway. Drink! Booze! Baitys Birds! We Miss you Mr T!  Anyway, A little something one of the dealers at work sent me (no not a drug dealer!) A photo of Hurricane Isabella     Why are hurricanes called after women? is it because they are warm and wet when they arrive and take your car and house with them when they leave?  And one that had me in stitches recently: René Descartes once walked into a bar. The barman said 'Like a drink?'. Ren replied 'I think not'. And promptly disappeared in a puff of logic.

       Nice one John :)  Blogger appears to be crap recently, several times I haven't been able to get to TF and I imagine everyone else is having the same problems. When I get back I'm going to ditch Blogger and set-up my own server to do the job with my new found Linux skills. Hoorah!  Only a few days left of my little antipodean excursion and I'm looking forward to coming home. Sydney (or Tokyo, as the locals now call it) is just warming up for summer in the last few days - typical weather. Tonight I'm going for dinner at the  urlLink AMP Centre Point Tower , which should be nice. I've taken a few pictures with my Nokia so i'll get those uploaded when i'm back.  Last winter (or was it the one before.. I forget) in the very early days of TF, we had a habit of all meeting up in Chambers by the fireplace for drinks on Friday night, right after work. This memory gives me a warm little glow in the cockles of my heart, imagining all of us lot crowded around a fireplace with a few drinkies and nobody getting stabbed. I'd like to organise this again a few times this winter...  are you down with it?  We can even set Baity up with random Irish slappers, it'll be grand :D

       Greetings from Sydney..  The first half of the flight when easily enough, however from Singapore to Sydney I had a small French child pelting me over the head with his toy fire engine. Bastard. Then, when I thought he'd finally given in and gone to sleep, he got a kind of confused and frowning expression on his face, followed by what can only be described as a unholy stench filtering out of his nappy, filling the cabin. Eugh.  So I'm completely knackered and making my way towards customs. I have sprinted down the arrivals corridor to get there quickly as I know from experience that you do NOT want to be the last person queuing behind the contents of a 747 at Australian Immigration control. I get through really easily, the guy even cracks a joke with me and I head towards the baggage reclaim. When what appears to be a 12 year old customs official steps out and wants to ask me a few questions.   Actually, my entire life's history and my inside leg measurement would be more accurate.  "So.. You're an I.T. contractor. Do you need and qualifications for that?" "Well, there's lots of lights and stuff.."  That went down like a lead balloon. After twenty hours in a steel tube with a screaming French baby and some really dire movies, I wasn't in the mood to fuck around.  After checking I wasn't smuggling in anything more illicit than a couple of jars of marmite, I was free to go. Michael was kind enough to feed me scotch and coke for a few hours, which ensured that when I did go to bed at a sensible hour I was well and truly out of the game.  Quiet day today to get over the jet lag, then some shopping tomorrow in Chatswood's "fucking huge" shopping centres.  I'll keep you posted.

       Toaster…  Friend’s don't run in front of friend's cars when friend’s are driving said car along the pavement in an attempt to reduce pedestrian death on the road. friend’s would avoid such a friend’s car when friend is driving. Friend certainly wouldn’t throw themselves at friend’s car bonnet, leaving a large arse shaped dent in the hood.  I suppose.  Anyway, Some Blond Jokes.  ONE  A married couple were asleep when the phone rang at 2 in the morning. The wife picked up the phone, listened a moment and said, "How should I know, that's 200 miles from here!" and hung up. The husband said, "Who was that?" The wife said, "I don't know ... some woman wanting to know 'if the coast is clear.'"  TWO  Two blondes are walking down the street. One notices a compact on the sidewalk and leans down to pick it up. She opens it, looks in the mirror and says, "Hmm, this person looks familiar." The second blonde says, "Here, let me see!" So the first blonde hands her the compact. The second one looks in the mirror and says, "You dummy, it's me!"  THREE  A blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so she goes out and buys a gun. She goes to his apartment unexpectedly and when she opens the door she finds him in the arms of a redhead. Well, the blonde is really angry. She opens her purse to take out the gun, and as she does so, she is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head. The boyfriend yells, "No, honey, don't do it. "The blonde replies, "Shut up, you're next!"   FOUR  A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals. She proudly says, "Go ahead, ask me, I know all of them." A friend says, "OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin?" The blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy: W."  FIVE  Q: What did the blonde ask her doctor when he told her she was pregnant?  A: "Is it mine?"   SIX  A blonde had just totaled her car in a horrific accident. Miraculously, she managed to pry herself from the wreckage without a scratch and was applying fresh lipstick when the state trooper arrived. "My Goodness!" the trooper gasped. "Your car looks like an accordion that was stomped on by an elephant. Are you OK, ma'am?" "Yes, officer, I'm just fine," the blonde chirped. "Well, how in the world did this happen?" the officer asked as he surveyed the wrecked car. "Officer, it was the strangest thing!" the blonde began. "I was driving along this road when from out of nowhere this tree pops up in front of me. So I swerved to the right, and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was ANOTHER tree! I swerved to the right and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was ...."  "Uh, ma'am," the officer said, cutting her off, "There isn't a tree on this road for 30 miles. That was your air freshener swinging back and forth."  SEVEN  Returning home from work, a blonde was shocked to find her house ransacked and burglarized. She telephoned the police at once and reported the crime. The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the channels, and a Dog Handler patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the officer approached the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch, shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps. Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, "I come home to find all my possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? They send me a BLIND policeman.”  EIGHT  A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive blond female neighbor came out of the house and went straight to the mailbox. She opened it then slammed it shut & stormed back in the house. A little later she came out of her house again went to the mail box and again, opened it, slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went. As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever. Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, "Is something wrong?" To which she replied, "There certainly is! My stupid computer keeps saying, YOU'VE GOT MAIL”

       Ohh, you lucky, lucky buggers you!  I've been in top level executive meetings (ok.. in a bar) discussing e-mail arrangements for TF. That's right smeggers! You can now have your own somebody@toasterfiles.com e-mail address.   You access it online like you do Hotmail, but you'll not get any  enlarge you penis now  type spam shite in it.  At the moment i'm only opening this offer to members of TF, or our very close friends. If you think you're one of these, get in touch and i'll set you up.  It's free at the moment, but in the future a small fee will be charged (less than a fiver a month) to keep the server up and running. Electricity ain't free, y'know :D  Much love.

       Good evening all..  God this week has dragged. I think it's some kind of conspiracy with it getting darker earlier, somewhere old father time is laughing his ass off as he increments every second by just a little bit when we are at work.  Has anyone else been besieged by those little fuckers running around town, whining "Penny for the guy?" I wouldn't mind normally but they started this weeks ago. There was about twenty of the little bastards in New Street the other day as I was walking home. Twenty. They all chanted their chorus as I walked past, and motioned to their "guy" which was rather pathetic to say the least - basically a cushion with a smiley face drawn on it. I mean really, where are the young entrepreneurs of tomorrow going to come from? If they had any sense they'd spend a day making a guy each, and position themselves around key areas of St Helier in a pincer movement. But no, twenty of them and a damp cushion. A friend of mine got busted for selling porn videos at school. He was 11. THAT'S enterprising.  So what's the script this weekend then? Well.. tomorrow night I am out with my work mates for a triple birthday bypass, and Saturday night it's another mate's birthday bash at a golf club. (I mean a actually place that hosts golf, I don't think we'd all fit in a nine iron). It's going to have live music, canapes, sumo wrestling in big suits and I can't wait.   The Blogger gods sent me my free Blogger hoody as they have hosted Toaster Files for so long and Google just bought them. Yay.

       I take no credit for this one!!   The Pride of Jersey!      Betty (21) is a lovely lady.  She is incredibly intelligent and has a City and Guilds in Laundry studies from Highlands College.  Home is in St Ouen  with her Mum and Dad (who also happens to be her Grandad, what a close family!). She says her best feature is her slightly damp, hairy top lip which “drives men wild!”. Maria’s favourite position is 69 “I like a man who takes his time down there” she says.     Christine (23 from St Martins) is a fox and she knows it. She loved to dance dirty with men on the dance floor at “The Hotel de France” and whip them into a frenzy of sexual desire. “I know I am a bit of a tease but look like me, you know I have the pick of the best!” She says that what drives her wild is men kissing her armpits and playing with her lovely hair.     Beth (25) is always popular with both the guys and girls of Jersey, she is a resident of St Brelade living in a 2-bed maisonette with both her parents and her Mum’s parents.  With her natural good looks Beth pulls every time.  “I have never been left until the end of the evening” she says. Beth is an accomplished typist, having six fingers on each hand.  She says it helps her in bed “ I love to fondle a mans bits while I kiss him deep and long and slow.”     Pamela (19) is a classic Jersey Beauty from St Helier and always has men chasing after her. Pamela is always on the dance floor surrounded by men after her affection. “I love to show off my ass” says Pamela tossing her gorgeous brunette locks, “I think it is my best feature so I always wear a G string and tight lycra leggings.  Sometimes if I am feeling really cheeky I like to let a little bit of my underwear show when I bend over!”     Kate (18) always likes to look her best as a modelling job means that she has to be ready for that big break and the chance move away from her home in Grouville.  “I do like to pamper myself and think nothing of spending £70 on my hair.  Men notice too and they love to run their fingers through it when I snog them” “I was offered a part in Bay Watch but turned it down as I did not just want to be known for my good looks.”     Sara (24) loves to sing loves songs at karaoke.  “I will pick the best looking guy in the room and sing to him.  I don’t care if he has a girlfriend, he will be leaving with me!”  Sara is a sexual predator from Trinity and will eat you up.  “I can satisfy any man in bed but prefer it up against a car or somewhere with a hint of danger” “My best feature is my face cos when you look like me you know I don’t need makeup to be beautiful”.     Kylie (20) is a St John beauty and always gets confused with the Australian soap star. “Men always ask me for my autograph.” she says, “It is not just my face but my body too” “People can’t believe I come from St John – “I thought they were all ugly in-breeds over there but you are gorgeous.” They say to me.  It makes me laugh knowing they all want to get into my pants!”     Donna (21) lives in St Saviour and feels it holds her back “ I don’t like to tell a guy where I live in case it ruins my chances so I normally say I live in St Mary.”  With only 7 kids Donna is a real catch and she knows it. “I love to get all my kids involved when I bring a man back home (which is most weekends).

       Hello, Baity McClure here, you may remember me from such films as- 'The C.U.N.T.S Strikes Back', 'Guernsey Fever' and the unforgettable 'Return Of The Baity- Kill 'Em All!'.  Today I am here to talk to you about what I have been up to over the past few quiet months, well actually it's quite simple- I have been locked in a suspended box for the past 92 days! (David Blaine, eat your heart out- oh hang on, you probably would have done if you could!)  Ok ok seriously then, I have been a busy little boy! Lets see....  I have been reviving old hobbies like painting, modeling and my music collection, which by the way is beginning to take over my room!  I have seen in my Dad's 50th year of existence,  My parents silver wedding,   And I have been away several times.  Now in more detail, my parents 25th anniversary was totally cool as I got to set up and fire a fireworks display. I even met up with my old work mate who I have know all my life, which was good.  I have been slaving away in my cousins workshop, helping him create a large medieval city for a wargame, this being a bloody big project!  Custard and I went to London to visit our friend Ying Ying for her birthday. This was a pretty good trip which involved partying, getting pissed and watching England's rugby team crush Georgia hehe. We also got to see Mr.Blaine hanging about next to Tower Bridge, although that was pretty boring as he was mostly sleeping at the time, although he did get up for about fifteen minutes or so. In fact the most exciting thing was viewing him taking a piss down his piss tube (see how boring it was!). Mark and I also went to see the Lord Of The Rings exhibition at the national science museum which was good fun. Oh, three things to note about London:  1) Why does everybody you pass in the street or subway look like they are ready to kill themselves? 2) If you do go the  national science museum, take a GPS in with you as you WILL get lost!! 3) If your on the piss, go to a bar called Extra Time, as you can purchase fresh pizza right until closing time..YAY!  So now we are back home and I am once again stressed up to the eyeballs with having to sort out our roleplay clubs Halloween special! A lot of people are coming over for it from our sister club in Guernsey which is cool, it's just that there is so much to sort out tat it is beginning to grate on me! But there you go, with responsibility comes lots of shit!.  Bonfire night however is hopefully going to be a blast- LITERALLY! I have rounded up my cousins and a load of friends and we have somewhere around the region of £800 of fireworks to fire off haha! I cannot wait, in fact I had to let off a rocket last night just to fuel the habit!  Anyway, I may post some of my photos from various events of the past months and hopefully I may even post a bit more hehe! Right, got to go now, much to do and not enough time to do it in.  Baity signing off.....  P.S. If you have never watched Twin Peaks, WATCH IT!!!

       When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bike.  Then I realised that The Lord doesn't work that way, so I stole one and asked him to forgive me.  My mum was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice. For ten years I thought the dog was telling me to kill my father.  I've often wanted to drown my troubles, but I can't get my wife to go swimming.  I was doing some decorating, so I got out my step-ladder. I don't get on with my real ladder.  A cement mixer collided with a prison van on the Kingston Pass. Motorists are asked to be on the lookout for 16 hardened criminals.  Well I was bullied at school, called all kinds of different names. But one day I turned to my bullies and said - 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me', and it worked! From there on it was sticks and stones all the way.  My Dad used to say 'always fight fire with fire', which is probably why he got thrown out of the the fire brigade.  Sex is like a game of bridge: If you don't have a good partner, you better have a good hand.  I saw six men kicking and punching my mother-in-law. My neighbour said 'Are you going to help?' I said 'No, six should be enough."  If we aren't supposed to eat animals, then why are they made out of meat?  Politicians are wonderful people as long as they stay away from things they don't understand, such as working for a living.

       Uhhh.. I have such a hangover. I ended up going out last night with Kirk and, his cousin and his cousin's mate. We had a round of very disgusting shooters in the Sports Bar then ran around to B Bar. I didn't notice before but B Bar has a number you can text and your messages appear on a big plasma screen behind the bar. You can imagine the fun we had with this.. accusations of leather chaps wearing and the words like 'blow job' were flashing up all over the place. Dirty buggers.  So after that we went around to Chicago (damn that place depresses me SO much.. WHY do I always end up there??) and scooted around to Liquid at about 11. It's about this time that things are a little hazy, but I remember dancing on a stage that has appeared on the dancefloor (been a while since I did that..), Custard turning up with Hannah and Fyona serving me Tequila. That's about it..  Alex: Please tell me that cruel Chinese lady isn't going to wack that furry marmot thing with the mallet?

       My good old school friend, Dr Whelan, sent me the following. Number 4 had me in stitches!  1. Two vultures board an airplane, each carrying two dead vultures. The stewardess looks at them and says, "I'm sorry, gentlemen, only one carrion allowed per passenger."  2. Two fish swim into a concrete wall. The one turns to the other and says "Dam!"  3. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, so lit a fire in the craft. Unsurprisingly it sank,  proving once again that you can't have your kayak and heat it too.  4. Two hydrogen atoms meet. One says, "I've lost my electron." The other says "Are you sure?"  The first replies "Yes, I'm positive."  5. Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused Novocain during a root canal?  He wanted to transcend dental medication.  6. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. "But why?" they asked, as they moved off.  "Because", he said, "I can't stand chess-nuts boasting in an open foyer."  7. A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named "Ahmal." The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him "Juan." Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his birth mother. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she also had a picture of Ahmal.  Her husband responds, "They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal."  8. These friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened up a small florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God, a rival florist across town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade" them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop.  Terrified, they did so, thereby proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.  9. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He also ate very little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. This made him ......... A super callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.  10. And finally, there was the person who sent ten different puns to his friends, with the hope that at least one of the puns would make them laugh. No pun in ten did!

       Just spent the past hour in HSBC trying to arrange an overdraft facility. With my teeth, my car needing a service and my mums divorce, I haven’t been rolling in the money recently and I went 20 quid overdrawn. So. I don’t realise this until I try to take a tenner out to get some lunch. The cash machine rejects me, so I try another, and the same again. I go into the bank and chat with them. They froze my card because I was overdrawn. Fair enough I think. “Can I have an overdraft then?” “No” they say.  “Why?” I question?  “The system says you have a bad debit history” they say. “Its because of your credit cards” they say.  “I haven’t had a credit card since I was at Uni, I had a bit of trouble but it got cleared. Besides, I thought you kept that only for six year?” “We do”, they say. “We shall check with card services”, they say.  After a phone call, they tell me that card services have indeed cleared the bad debit record at the beginning of this year. They only hold the information for six years. “That’s nice” I say. Can I have an overdraft? “No” they say, “You have a bad debit history.” “But you just told me that it was cleared?” I cry. “Yes, on Card services, We hold the information permanently.” They tell me. “But if I cant have an overdraft, that means I could never get a loan or mortgage?” “That’s correct.” “But that means a simple student mistake that makes a student go 600.00 quid in debt (on a five hundred limit) stiks for the rest of that students life?” “That’s correct.”  HSBC???  THEY ARE RIGHT BASTARDS !!!

       A few random bits I've been meaning to post for a while... Who's up for beers on Friday?  When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.   When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with a zest for life.   In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability.   When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.   When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.   When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned. I am now older and wiser, and am looking for a girl with big tits.   urlLink How to make kick-ass paper aeroplanes   urlLink Do not take this parenting guide seriously   urlLink Name that beard   urlLink Tits and ass quota for your desktop

       You're right, I have been DAMN busy. I'm moving into a new flat at the moment, my evenings have involved large boxes, parcel tape and dust. I never realised I had so much shit. Several times i've come across things that i've been before... "better hold onto this. Might be worth something". Don't kid yourself like I did. Launch it. It's so liberating. I've put two big plastic bags of old clothes into the Sally Army's bin at Rue Des Pres tonight. If you see any poor people running around with a t-shirt saying "SPRING BREAK MEXICO 2003, WHAT GOES ON IN CANCUN STAYS IN CANCUN" then you know where they got it.  In search of cheap equipment for the new gaff, I found myself at a car boot sale on Sunday. It was an interesting experience. I can't remember the last time i've bought something (not including the Daily Star) for under a pound. There was a very scary woman that was directing the traffic around outside. It was rather surreal as she was holding a plate of brownies at the same time. Every now and then she would storm into the hall where people were quietly pondering the purchase of a scalextric set or something, and bellow "GREEN VAUXHALL NOVA. REGISTRATION J55142. IF YOU DON'T MOVE IT NOW IT'S GOING TO GET TTTTTTTTTTOWED AWAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!" she was bright signal red when she screamed. I thought her head was going to explode, like in that movie  Scanners .   Make sure you take  urlLink The Geek Test , a measure of your computing, roleplaying, and cult movie status. I scored total geek, which is less that I thought.

       Firstly, what the hell is going on? Toaster, your birthday was on Saturday and you still haven't bothered to tell everyone how it went! Obviously too busy!!!  Anyway, another weekend has passed us by, leaving sore heads and empty pockets in it's wake. This particular weekend however, has been action packed which makes a change from the proverbial norm!  So what exactly did happen this weekend??? Here's how it went.....  Friday 14th...  Our good friend Bobby H got married at the Hotel L'horizon, which was very very nice. I got to experience some of the best deserts known to mankind (hhmmmmmmmm dark chocolate). It all went superbly, without any hitches, which is always a result, and we even got to observe that strange dancing style known as 'Wedding Jive'. This particular style involves all the participants to dance in a totally disoriented fashion to each other and mock strip, in fact if I had of know all the people there, I may well have performed the special 'Baity Strip' that only some of my old friends from JCG will have seen before!!! Anyway, it was a great wedding and the fun didn't stop there.....  Custard and myself left the Hotel L'horizon and went into town around 00.15ish and went to Chambers to see a friend. I wasn't very happy to have to go into chambers as it is no secret that I dislike going out in town- too many townies!!! (Big up the Splash!) However, I was totally stunned when we got into Chambers and heard the familiar bass line to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman'! At first I believed that my mind was imagining the heavy guitar riffs as some result of exhilaration from the deserts I had consumed earlier but I was greatly heartened when I found out that a friends band, known as 'Take This' was playing that night! We stayed in Chambers until it closed and a good fun was had by all in the small hours.  Hmmm...that concludes Friday then........  Saturday 15th...  Saturday started off in quite a strange way! I woke up around 08.30am and in my semi half pissed from the night before phase, I walked from Custard's place in town to my cousins house up by Vic college to watch rugby, only realizing that I was meant to go watch rugby the next day, not Saturday!!!  So I then walked back into town and went back to sleep! Later that day I went shooting and shot some new guns- an A14 rifle and a Garrand. It was the really good session and I actually hit most of my marks. I think I may have to invest in my own gun soon as I always use my cousins at the club.  After shooting I went home to prepare for the nights festivities...  So Saturday night arrived and the Toaster crew celebrated Toaster's 24th birthday! We all went for a meal at the 'Blue Fish' restaurant and proceeded to drink the night away! I even fell in love with one of the waitresses hehe.  After the meal, Gristy drove us all up to the pub in St.Peter's where we continued our merriment, although there was a band playing that was covering a few 'Coldplay' songs that made us a bit depressed until they finished.   Lastly we all went down to the Splash and finished the night to some reasonable music, although Toaster buggered off home early, I guess there is no law against being a party pooper at your own party!  Yup, that's Saturday done.....  Sunday 16th...  Got up and went to my cousins to watch the rugby- England v France. It was a bit of a struggle in the first half but England prevailed as I thought they would and now I can't wait until next Saturday- England v Australia!!! I am confident that we will win but I am not placing any bets.  After the rugby, Richard (one of my cousins) and I went for lunch with our friend Andy (one of the guys we went to Santa Pod with) at St.Mary Country Inn, which put on some very nice food! The aim of doing lunch was to prepare for a short film that Andy was making, Richard being one of the important roles and myself being in charge of the pyrotechnics haha!  So once all the scrummy food was devoured, we headed off to shoot some scenes for the short film named 'Dreamtime' or it's alternative name 'Midnight Pussy' (the latter name being a somewhat misleading joke name). I will hopefully be putting some promotional clips up on the site soon, along with photo stills and possibly a little piece form Andy as director, producer, etc etc all in one!  Then in the evening I went to Simon 'Shrek' Surcouf's to chill, and so ended the weekend.....  So now it's Monday and I have to say that it has been a weird day too. It is one of those days that goes quickly yet when you reflect on the day it seems to have been utterly soul knackering! Yup..that's an average Monday for you!!! Oh well I guess I will now go and sort out something to do this evening......  OOOOHHHHH!!!! Lord Of The Rings- The Two Towers extended version is released for sale tomorrow, much spaffage!!!

       Well I would talk about Bobbie's stag party, but there are strict rules about this kind of thing if you're a guy. Suffice it to say that I have never seen anyone handcuffed to a pillar in a restaurant with his trousers around his ankles before. My birthday celebrations have now been moved to my actual birthday, this Saturday. So make sure you keep it free as it's Splash time baby.  Oh yeah.. if Alex gets to go all geeky and post a picture of his PC then I do too :P      RULES OF MANHOOD   Any man who brings a camera to a stag night may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow party goers.  Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.  It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances: a. When a heroic dog dies to save it's master b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse c. After wrecking your boss' car. d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into "The Crying Game". e. When your date is using her teeth  Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.  If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits forever, unless you actually marry her.  The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 7 minutes. For a girl, you have to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.  Bitching about the brand of free beer in a mate's fridge is forbidden. Bitch at will if the temperature is unsuitable.  No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man (in fact, even remembering your mate's birthday is strictly optional).  On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the weakest.  While your girlfriend must bond with your mates' girlfriends within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a double standard and we drew the short straw on that one).  When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.  You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.  It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach....and it's delivered by a topless supermodel...and it's free.  Only in situations of moral and/or ass peril are you allowed to kick another guy in the nuts.  Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.  Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.  If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem - you didn't see a thing.  Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to drink as much beer as the other sports watchers.  You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw it into a ceiling fan.  A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight.  Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.  If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking about his choice of beer.  Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a mate of yours, except if she's withholding sex pending your response.  Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting weights: a. Yeah, Baby, Push it! b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder! c. Another set and we can hit the showers! d. Nice arse, are you a Sagittarius?  Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.  Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone; Hang up if necessary.  You cannot rat out a co-worker who shows up at work with a massive hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven minutes.  The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend" have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that your feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big mistake it was.

       Well it's the end of another working week, hoorah..  Last night we had the best bonfire party i've ever been to. Baity John and an elite band of pyromanics organised the purchase of a GRANDS worth of fireworks, the highest grade ones possible without a display license and a pair of rubber underpants. We went to a mates to let them off. We had a massive field to play with and people had organised a huge BBQ and some pumping tunes. We let off all sorts of rockets and .. er.. the other ground based ones, all very "ohh" and "ahhh". Also we didn't blow each other up, apart from a near miss with a quad rocket it all went swimmingly.  Tomorrow night is the Bobbie's official stag bash and it's going to rock, be great getting all the crew together.   Why don't you read the blog of a London call girl if you're  urlLink feeling a bit pervy .

OMFG!!) and I think a meal at Hotrocks (get to cook your own food and play with fire) followed by beers and breakdancing in town would be ideal. I'm trying to arrange this for Friday the 14th, so if you're down with it email me (or use the shout out thing below) so I can get an idea of numbers...  If you're into astrology or spiritual stuff you may be interested in  urlLink the alignment of the planets this Sunday..  If you're are kind and generous, you may want to buy me something from my  urlLink ThinkGeek Wishlist  for my birthday.. Or perhaps you'd rather be a  urlLink fish

       Hello. This is Toaster. I am posting a message under John's user ID as I can't be arsed to sign out and back in gain. So we are all here at City resturant for the new years eves celebrations. It is a timne to reflect and think about the year that has gone, and lok forward to the year ahead. So far we have been talking about sking and snowboarding incidents, the time I fell off a chair lift and the time that Kirk wrestled a crocdile to death.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off now. Wherever you are i wish you a happy new year and all the best for 2004, when Toaster Files will be back  - bigger, better and drunker than ever.

        Merry Christmas Everyone!!   I want to welcome my old mate Damo to TF  Yes I'm still alive was just looking back and realised that I havent posted anything since last June Oops so I will do a quick recap of what I have been up to!!  Toaster Left me to work on my own (Bastard!) at RBSI I started playing alot of golf and it rules!!! I was rushed in to Hospital with a Grumbling Appendix "was the most painful experiance ever" Myself and Kate bought a new car "Peugeot 206cc" I bought a new Motorbike "Honda Varedero 125" I have given up smoking for 11 weeks now and have never felt better!!! I tried to gouge my own eye out in my sleep last night Owwww!!! (What page is that on!!)  and to add to Baity's post about the social night round Toasters new flat I give the flat a 10 out of 10 good work mate   Trivial Pursuit  The Girls team consisted of :- Kate (Literary Genius) Joe + Debbie (Science Nerds) Kirk "Honarary Girl" (Sports Nut)  The Boys team consisted of :- Toaster (Leet speech, Computer security, Drinking, Classical Education????) Dougle (Drinking) Baity (Plants, Lord of the Rings, HGV Driving, Drinking, Projectile Vomiting) Damian (Sport, Drinking, other general Trivia)  Some of the Questions were :- In Shakespare what line preceeds the phrase, "And all the men and women merely players"? In WW2, who was referred to as a 'Rear-End Charlie'?  Luckily for the Guys we where ok on the first question thanks to Toaster when he answered Quote Life is just a Play - "and that is what a classical education does for you" in case you don't know the answer was "All the world's a stage" (Hahaha from Kate)   Pictionary  The Highlight of this game was when we looked at some of the pads round Joe and Toaster's flat to see that they had been practising this the night before??? (how quickly you have fallen down the Ladder of Fun and Drinking Toaster)  Was a great night though and thank you for the invite!!  I promise I will try and post more in the New Year!!

       So we went out last night to see Return of the King, and my god did it rock! I was worried that after the Matrix has so badly tarnished the whole trilogy thing, it was going to suck ass. But the highlights of it were:  Aragorn opening a can of whup-ass (TM) at the Orcs, running into battle with all these dead dudes giving it Casper the not-so-friendly-ghost action. Smeagol getting his head staved in by fat Sam with a rock.  Kirk's bladder making a strange hissing noise as he crying with pain but not going for a piss. Gandalf fighting with a staff and a sword, he make look like some hippy reject from the 60's but he's as tough as vindalooed mutton. Liv Tyler. Custard going out for a piss, coming back and taking the shortcut by stepping over two rows of chairs to avoid the entire row standing up. A noble gesture except he lost his balance and went arse over tit with a loud thump and a whimper, and the entire cinema laughed at him. HOW FUCKING FUNNY WAS THAT!!! ROTFL!!     We went out afterwards for some booze, but town was full of puss-faced 16 year olds trying to get into Liquid, so we decided to call it a night.

       Hello butt monkeys!  I feel we (TF boys, and girls) must say a big thanks to Toaster, who threw his new flats doors open the hungry mob for a little get together. It was really cool for us lot to have a chill out night for a change instead of the usual antic of alcohol abuse! First impressions of the flat were very impressive, and after an inspection of every alcove and corner I have decided to give it rating of 4.5 out of 5 (only lacking .5 due to Toaster not having a bar...yet!). So after consuming wine and beer we all decided to play Trivial Pursuit, yes that game where you need a diploma in almost everything to qualify as a contestant, and it didn't help that we used the genius edition!!!  Anyway, so we then decided that this game should be boys V girls (big mistake!). And so we started...... Suffice to say that by the time us boys had picked up our first piece of blue pie, the girls had got all their pieces, finished the game and generally laughed at us! (But our time was to come.....oh yes...)  Following THAT game everyone continued to consume wine at a fair pace and we then decided to play Pictionary- A great game, and one which I excel at! So we all paired up with each other, pulling names out of a hat to do so and we were ready to commence the battle!...  Now I'm not going to go into too much detail of each teams tactics but.....what the fuck, here they are:  Baity & Dougle- Our tactic was simple..we were going to win!  Damo & Jo- To get off to a good start...and then leaden and sag like a grannies tits!  Kate & Debs - To employ all their cunning and ability to CHEAT as much as possible!!! (Not that it did them any good)  And lastly Toaster & Kirk- Their plan was simple, that they wouldn't even leave the starting square until the last turn hehe!  Now the outcome of this game wasn't really a surprise...Myself and Doulge reigned supreme YAY!!! Also I must point out that in a desperate attempt to get off the starting space, Toaster, who was drawing at the time, actually wrote the answer instead of drawing a picture, only for him and Kirk to still lose the round as Dougle's expert speed drawing allowed us to fuck them over! See, cheats never prosper.  The last installment of fun for the night, other than drinking, was me giving Toaster some advice on some shrubs to go on his patio, but I shall spare everyone the details. All in all a great night and one that we will hopefully do again, nice one Big T.  Baity signing off.....

       Slightly premature posting seeing as I've not been baptised in the town fountain yet... Anyway, was wondering round town last night doing some late night shopping and found myself looking at a hand-written sign entitled  "The Alphabet - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P ..."  No, I wasn't in a nursey toy shop but in line at the CD counter at Woolworths! I guess some of their staff are having trouble recalling what they learnt when they were 6.  Surely if they imagine texting they'll be okay. Wish the photo had come out clearer but my covert picture taking skills need honing.  See you all out tonight!   [)amo

       Right you are.. in that case I propose the following:  1) A calendar of Toaster Files key dates and objectives. Once a month, planned in advance, we are all out in town in our Sunday best. 2) New shirts. No, really.  3) People stop being slack and commit to a least a small post once a week, maybe with a picture of a breast or something thrown in so we get hits. 4) We recruit. I propose Damien as he wasn't a big wussy had his tequila shot like a good boy. 5) Er.. still thinking about 5.  So Return of the King has officially opened. I just hope it's better than the steaming pile of dog-poo that was the Matrix Revolutions.  I don't want to ruin anything but I heard that Gandalf is caught giving head to Samwise Jamjar and that the evil firey eye thing is actually Frodo's own vindaloo ring-piece because he's asleep in his hobbit hole after eating too many curried eggs. Also Agent Smith disowns Liv Tyler because she hooked up with Arawhore, who secretly fancies Legoman. But Legoman is already in love with Gimley because he's really good at plating hair. (That whole paragraph was bollocks, purely to wind up Baity who is probably going to end up with a tattoo of Tolkien across his forehead.)   Did you ever stop and wonder...... (sent to me from Grist) Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these pink dangly things here, and drink whatever comes out?" Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken there... I'm going to eat the next thing that comes out of it's bum." Why do toasters always have a setting so high that burns the toast to a horrible crisp, which no decent human being would eat? Why is there a light in the fridge and not in the freezer? Why do people point to their wrist when asking for the time, but don't point to their bum when they ask where the bathroom is? Why does  the  Gynae leave the room when you get undressed if they are going to look RIGHT up there anyway? If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from? Why does  the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune? Stop singing and read on . . . . . .. . . . . Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets pissed off with you, but when you take him on a car ride, he sticks his head out the window?

       *wakes up* What? You're still here? Uh.. umm... yeah, well the site seems to be dying a death at the moment. Which really sucks. I haven't posted for a while so i'm guilty as everyone else. We had a bit night out drinking last weekend and interviewed Damien to see if he's the right kind of stuff we are after. Then we made him drink lots of tequila. hehe.  yeah so.. is it worth me re-launching the site in 2004, or is that the end for the all mighty Toaster Files...  Shout out below with flames/encouragement/suggestions/good curry receipes...

       Greetings from Andorra!  Snow here has been fantastic - managed a twisted ankle on day one and a major stackage involving flipping over today in front of lots of people today (got cheers from the people around me).  My younger sister also gave birth while I was away!  Little Holly was 8lbs 15oz and my sis refused all drugs and gas to later quip that women make a big deal about childbirth.   Have come to the conclusion that Pas De La Casa consists entirely of bars, clubs, ski shops, restuaurants and shops that sell giant car stereo's.  I'm no economist but that hardly seems sustainable.  Have drunk far too much although still not much compared to some of my brothers in arms here.  One of them managed to get kicked out of a club last night after an incident involving a bottle of water and an attractive local girl :-D  Right thats about as much as I can type on this damned French keyboard with half the letters in the wrong place.

       50 things to do in the Computer Lab                               1. Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face and      scream, "Oh my! They've found me!" and bolt.    2. Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes and then suddenly stop and      look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you.    3. When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on duty that      you can't get the darned thing to work. After he/she's turned it on,      wait 5 minutes, turn it off again, and repeat the process for a good      half hour.    4. Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to you      evilly.    5. Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to a different      screen than the one it's set up with.    6. Write a program that plays the "Smurfs" theme song at the highest      volume possible over and over again.    7. Work normally for awhile. Suddenly look amazingly startled by      something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk.    8. Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into top-secret      Pentagon files.    9. Use Interactive Send to make passes at people you don't know.   10. Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn it on.   11. Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it. If anyone asks why you have it,      say "Just in case..." mysteriously.   12. Type for awhile. Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes about everything      bad about your life. Then stop and continue typing.   13. Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as if      they're crazy while typing.   14. Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before starting.   15. Stand on your chair and yell, "Help! There's a mouse." as you point to      the computer's mouse.   16. Every time you press return and there is processing time required,      pray "Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease," and scream "YES!"      when it finishes.   17. "DISK FIGHT!"   18. Turn the brightness on the monitor way down. Pull out a flash light      and shine it on the screen. Act as if it helps you see the text on the      screen.   19. Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your pockets. Type by      hitting the keys with the straw.   20. If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing "The Lion      Sleeps Tonight" whenever there is processing time required.   21. Draw a picture of a (wo)man on a piece of paper and tape it to your      monitor. Try to seduce it. Act like it hates you and then complain      loudly that (wo)men are worthless.   22. Try to stick a Nintendo cartridge in the 3.5 disk drive. When it      doesn't work, get the supervisor.   23. When you are on an IBM and when you turn it on, ask loudly where the      smiling Apple face is when you turn on one of those.   24. Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when it's all done      (two days later) say that all you wanted was one line.   25. Sit and stare at the screen, biting your nails noisily. After doing      this for awhile, spit them out at the feet of the person next to you.   26. Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the person next      to you. Repeat procedure, making sure you never provoke the person      enough to let them blow up, as this releases tension, and it is far      more effective to let them linger.   27. If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, cut      them, and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you leave.   28. Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British royal family on your      desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires you.   29. Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks. Remove shoes and      place them on top of the monitor. Remove socks layer by layer and  drape them around the monitor. Exclaim sudden haiku about the      aesthetic beauty of cotton on plastic.   30. Take the keyboard and sit under the computer. Type up your paper like      this. Then go to the lab supervisor and complain about the bad working      conditions.   31. Laugh hysterically, shout "You will all perish in flames!!!" and      continue working.   32. Bring some dry ice and make it look like the computer is smoking.   33. Assign a musical note to every key (ex. the delete key is A flat).      Whenever you hit a key, hum its note loudly. Write an entire paper      this way.   34. Attempt to eat your computer's mouse.   35. Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying "Excuse me,      mind if I borrow this for a sec?", unplugging the keyboard, and taking      it.   36. Bring in a bunch of magnets and have fun.   37. When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that sometimes the      old ways are best.   38. Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab.   39. Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again until      you see that your neighbor is noticing (You can hit the space bar so      your fill isn't affected). Then look at your neighbor's keyboard. Hit      his/her delete key several times, erasing an entire word. While you do      this, ask: "Does your delete key work?" Shake your head, and resume      hitting the space bar on your keyboard. Keep doing this until you've      deleted about a page of your neighbor's document. Then, suddenly      exclaim: "Well, whaddya know? I've been hitting the space bar this      whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!" Print out your document      and leave.   40. Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab monitor and      complain that your computer ate your disk. (For special effects, put      some Elmer's glue on or around the disk drive. Claim that the computer      is drooling.)   41. Stare at your neighbor's screen, look really puzzled, burst out      laughing and say "You did that?" loudly. Keep laughing, grab your      stuff and leave, howling as you go.   42. Point at the screen. Chant in a made-up language while making      elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two. Press return or the      mouse, then leap back and yell "COVEEEEERRRRR!" Peek up from under the      table, walk back to the computer and say "Oh, good. It worked this      time," and calmly start to type again.   43. Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them.   44. See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request. Talk to them      like you've known each other all your lives. Hang up before they get a      chance to figure out you're a total stranger.   45. Bring a small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound effects.      Pretend it's the computer and look really lost.   46. Pull out a pencil. Start writing on the screen. Complain that the lead      doesn't work.   47. Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered species of      flowers in your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then laugh      happily, exclaim "You're such a marvel!!", and kiss the screen. Repeat      this after every sentence. As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the      keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, then the computer assistant, and      walk out.   48. Run into the computer lab, shout "Armageddon is here!!!!!", then      calmly sit down and begin to type.   49. Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker chainsaw,      rev that baby up, and then walk up to the nearest person and say,      "Give me that computer or you'll be feeding my pet crocodile for the      next week."   50. Bring a sleeping bag and pillow. Login to all the machines in one row.      Lay down and go to sleep.

       The other day, I was getting a lift with my darling sister in her fiesta whilst I was running between business meetings at work, when she had to run into the shop.  Noticing that her tracking looked slightly out, I got out of the car (In the sodding rain, why do I do these things for my sister, especially when I have my brand new 400 quid suite on from Massimos!) Anyway, I noticed that one of her tiers was a bit flat, so I decide to get the foot pump out the back and put some air in, so she doesn’t damage the rims or something. Anyway, whilst Im doing this, some lower class pauper bastard in a truck drives past me and soaks me. Not only that, but my work in my briefcase got ruined, thats lost me my pay rise this year! If I ever find out who did that, Im going to have a go at them with an ice pick in the dark!!!  Anyway, Sent to me this morning. (actually, the original had the word “Vodka” replacing the occurrences of “Porridge”, but after a short conversation, this was returned. I have had some good laughs with the Find and replace function recently)   Porridge.. Who would have thought it??  Guess I'll have to go buy a bottle, lol !!                              1. To remove a bandage painlessly, saturate the bandage with Porridge.  The  solvent dissolves the adhesive.  2. To clean the caulking around bathtubs and showers, fill a trigger-spray bottle with Porridge, spray the caulking, let set five minutes and wash clean.  The alcohol in the Porridge kills mold and mildew.  3. To clean your eyeglasses, simply wipe the lenses with a soft, clean cloth dampened with Porridge. The alcohol in the Porridge cleans the glass and kills germs.  4. Prolong the life of razors by filling a cup with Porridge and letting your safety razor blade soak in the alcohol after shaving. The Porridge  disinfects the blade and prevents rusting.  5. Spray Porridge on vomit stains, scrub with a brush, then blot dry.  6. Using a cotton ball, apply Porridge to your face as an astringent to cleanse  the skin and tighten pores.  7. Add a jigger of Porridge to a 12-ounce bottle of shampoo. The alcohol cleanses the scalp, removes toxins from hair, and stimulates the growth of healthy hair.  8. Fill a sixteen-ounce trigger-spray bottle and spray bees or wasps to kill them.  9. Pour one-half cup Porridge and one-half cup water in a Ziplock freezer bag, and freeze for a slushy, refreshable ice pack for aches, pain, or black eyes..  10. Fill a clean, used mayonnaise jar with freshly packed lavender flowers, fill the jar with Porridge, seal the lid tightly and set in the sun for three  days. Strain liquid through a coffee filter, then apply the tincture  to aches and pains.  11. Make your own mouthwash by mixing nine tablespoons powered cinnamon with  one cup Porridge. Seal in an airtight container for two weeks. Strain  through a coffee filter. Mix with warm water and rinse your mouth. Don't swallow.  12. Using a q-tip, apply Porridge to a cold sore to help it dry out.  13. If a blister opens, pour Porridge over the raw skin as a local anesthetic that also disinfects the exposed dermis.  14. To treat dandruff, mix one cup Porridge with two teaspoons crushed rosemary, let sit for two days, strain through a coffee filter and massage into your scalp and let dry.  15. To treat an earache put a few drops of Porridge in your ear. Let set for a few minutes. Then drain. The Porridge will kill the bacteria that is causing pain in your ear.  16. To relieve a fever, use a washcloth to rub Porridge on your chest and back as a liniment.  17. To cure foot odor, wash your feet with Porridge.  18. Porridge will disinfect and alleviate a jellyfish sting.  19. Pour Porridge over an area affected with poison ivy to remove the urushiol oil from your skin.  20. Swish a shot of Porridge over an aching tooth. Allow your gums to absorb  some of the alcohol to numb the pain.  Ok my personal favorite:   21. If all else fails, just turn the bottle up and drink it, nothing will matter anymore anyway!

       One day Baity, you'll have broken down in the middle of nowhere. Your mobile will be flat, you engine seized, your patience waning and your hope fading. Then you'll see the headlights of an approaching car, you'll get out and signal for help, so happy to have human contract. Then you'll wake up in a ditch by the side of the road with the BMW logo imprinted on your forehead because that some smug bank man ran you over.   That, my friend, is karma. :)

       Hello everybody, ah what a lovely Thursday afternoon!! Yup the rain is hammering down, the temperature has dropped to 3 degrees and every woman's nipples have frozen in town!  Firstly, is it me or not??? Take a close look at Captain Kirk in the picture below........look closer.....now, is it me or does it look like the Captain has been sucking at a Heinz tomato ketchup bottle?!?!?! Secondly, I think we should track down that guy in the background, find out where he lives and then give him anti depressants! Thirdly, actually I can't say it, so nevermind!  So I was driving the worktruck through town the other day, going past the post office, and I saw something that made me smile. What did I see???  'It was a cold January afternoon, the kind of typical new years chill that warns of the cold freeze about to begin was hanging in the air as fine droplets of rain spattered on the road, forming small puddles that rippled with every disturbance.  The inside of the cab was clouded up as the breath of its inhabitants condensed against its cold dewed surface, at the same time the trucks heating system battled to defeat the damp air.'  Anyway, what made me laugh...... well there I am driving past the post office and I see this big banking dude wearing a £400 suit, a silverplate edged briefcase sitting beside him on the kerb as......wait for it..... he stands there using a footpump to pump up his clapped out old 1989 Ford Fiesta, and getting all wet in theprocesss!!!  So I think to myself, I have a spare few minutes so I'll just go and offer my assistance to this poor fellow man so that he can take a break. Then, just as I was approaching level with him in my nice big truck I had this little thought that said 'Baity, look at that rich fuck, standing all defenseless on the road, don't help him.....fuck him over and teach him a lesson from the working class!!!!'  So obviously I obeyed my inner voice and within a split second I formulated a masterful plan of vengeancee against my (now) ENEMY- the rich man! I cranked the trucks gears up a notch and proceeded to aim for the reasonable sized puddle that lay just six inches from the frantically pumping banker!  Two seconds later, my plan came to fruition and as I sped away, with a satisfied grin of accomplishment on my face, I checked my large side view mirror just in time to see my target brushing himself down, quite obviously displeased with the fact that not only did he have a flat tyre but a totally fucked suit and a now soaked briefcase that now lay side down in a pool of dirty water!!! The moral of the story is that no matter how much higher people may seem to you, you can still be a winner!  Baity signing off.....

       The majority of my new year's resolutions are still going well. Capoeira with Custard and Baity is a great laugh, plus it's having the desired affect and i'm getting slimmer and more flexible.* If you're in the dark about Capoeira, it's a Brazilian/African martial art that a cross between fighting and dancing. To watch it, there's a group of people in a circle singing and clapping, which two people are in the middle fighting. It looks a lot like break dancing, you're upside down a lot and it's more of a game than a full-on fight. I played with our Mestre, Corrine, last night.. damn she's fast. Kicks coming from strange angles and lots of flips and stuff to confuse and impress onlookers.  I almost had to get my Neo on and open up a can of whup-ass, but i'll need a couple more lessons first.  I also resolved to try one of those detox kits from Boots, which I bought in December. You knock back a pill and a vial of "pleasant tasting liquid" with water, which is supposed to help rid your body of nasty toxins. I got a 5 day kit, and by good does it suck. I started it Monday and by the evening i've had a monster headache which just hasn't gone away. You're not supposed to have alcohol or caffeine, which I remember halfway through a 'special' coffee this evening, so I've thrown in the towel and returned to my lovely toxin-fuelled self. The orange goop you put in the water, is.. fucking gross. The taste can best be described as a two-year-old orange that's been marinated in bleach for a fortnight. I have decided that maybe I need caffeine to survive, without that it's like putting water in your fuel tank and trying to rag the tits of it. So the detox kit is in the bin and a cool can of Carling has emerged from the fridge.  Phew.   * Which reminds me of a classic Tommy Cooper line. Guy goes to a gym and says he wants to be able to do the splits. The instructor says.. "Hmm. How flexible are you? The guy says.. "I can't make Tuesdays."

       Just come back from a great night in town.  My flatmate Zach and I met up with 'Captain' Kirk for a few rounds in Sports before speeding through Be bar, then back to Sports again to pick up Custard, Hannah and Gail.  Then on to Liquid for a few more drinks followed by immesurable casualties caused by my slightly odd, unrefined and somewhat uncontrolled dancing technique.  There was much rejoicing when I headed to the bar and this time I managed to avoid knocking over a bottle of Sol and sending lime in the direction of bar staff.  It's a friends birthday tomorrow so we're out for a special celebratory evening and then next week my sisters baby is due, the following week I've got friends over on the saturday and off to Andorra skiing with some Guernsey mates on the sunday for a week.  If you don't see me I'm not dead I'm just away*  [)amo (Still awaiting an official Toaster-assigned nick and appropriately offensive Toasterfiles t-shirt).  * = unless I die horribly on my skiis in which case, yep, I'm actually dead.

       Well I had an interesting night last night..  Jo had never been to a pantomine before and felt she was missing out on an essential part of British culture. So we went along to the JADC production of "Beauty and the Beast" it was a good laugh but I always feel these things go on a bit too long. I didn't expect to be molested by a pantomine horse and be forced to sign "i'm a little tea-pot" complete with the actions.  Plus I didn't catch a single one of the fricking sweets.

       Greetings everybody.......URG!  I have spent the last few nights VERY intoxicated and I have only just got home in order to post a few things!  Firstly, Toaster, great night at yours on Thursday dude. Much fun was had by all. I feel that I should perhaps tell everyone of the nights events, so here I go in brief....  Got to Toasters to discover that Custard, Hannah and myself were the first to arrive, so we drank beer to pass the time until others arrived. Once everyone was there, we cracked open the red wine (YAY!!!) and got out the Trivial pursuits. Now at first I was a little apprehensive that Damo, his lady and Jo were all on the same team! I was however, not bothered at all that Damien (TIT!), Toaster (WIMP) and Dougle (Pussy with nails) were in team two! And so the game commenced and to my surprise, my team (Custard, Hannah and myself) were the first to pick up a piece of pie, although I must say that Hannah was the smartest of the three of us, commanding a veritable hotpot of knowledge that stunned and amazed!!! Although we got all of our pieces of pie, leaving everyone else with only three pieces behind, we stumbled on the final center circle because the other teams gave us history (usually my strongest subject, when I'm not drunk!) questions! In the end, 'Team Brain' as I now call them won, much to my horror.  And so the night carried on and we, or maybe just I, drank lots more wine...... Later we got out the Pictionary and changed the teams around, leaving me on Toaster and Damien's team (I was doomed!). As it turned out, we all gave the game up after a while as people were either tired of too drunk!  The only other incident was Toaster taking his shirt off and going out on his balcony, and for some reason I ended up getting into a fist fight with him and Dougle, who by the way, used his nails to scratch when he fights, and I have the little marks to prove it!! I cannot say who came off the best, but I can say that the two of them were no match for my Splash hardened psyche!!!  Now last night I went out with some good friends and got drunk, enough said!  One last thing...... Damien, I normally draw like a god when I'm playing drawing games, and if you did indeed tell me that I was shit at drawing then fair enough as I was obviously too drunk to remember, however, I am not drunk now and I'd just like to say that you are a fucking tit!! Also if you would like to take it any further then just let me know as I think you would be quite impressed with what I can draw, using my fist, on your face.  Anyway I'm done, all is said......

       As I've Matured ...  I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.   I've learned that one good turn gets most of the blankets.  I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just jack asses.  I've learned that whatever hits the fan will not be evenly distributed.  I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  I've learned that depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.  I've learned that it is not what you wear, it is how you take it off.  I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished.  I've learned to not sweat the petty things, and not pet the sweaty things.  I've learned that ex's are like fungus, and keep coming back.  I've learned age is a very high price to pay for maturity.  I've learned that I don't suffer from insanity, I enjoy it.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.  I've learned that artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.  I've learned that there is a fine line between genius and insanity.  I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. And the real pains in the ass are permanent.   This speaks for itself...

       Evening all.  Thanks to Toaster & Jo for hosting a fun games night, alas Trivial Pursuits Genus II appears to consist mostly of American based questions referring to events that happened before my birth.  Oh well, I managed to sneak in a piece of brown pie into our counter while nobody was paying much attention.  We still came last.  Oops, is that the time, better head out.

       Hello all, I hope the new year has started well for you, I know it has for some people.   Ok so..... new years resolutions.... I think that three should do it:  1) Stop biting nails- they hurts your teeth! 2) Save money!! 3) Find a good girlfriend!!!  Yup I really would like to save a bit of cash this year, so that I can go away and enjoy experiences across the world, and I reckon it's about time I found a girlfriend, as I've been single for like over a year and I'm tired of one nighters!  So, what's been going on since the new year? Well I have started to paint again, which is cool because I needed to chill and painting is a good way to do it. I am thinking of perhaps starting what is called 'Hand Of The Wind' Kung Fu, as I really need to be more active this year, it's been a few years since Custard and I went to the gym three times a week!!!  Asides from that, not much has changed, although Toaster has started doing games nights at his pad, which are usually good fun, in fact we are having another one tonight.  Proposed holidays for me this year....  Crusade roleplaying event in May, Mopar drag racing in June, Renewal roleplaying event in August, and perhaps another somewhere else that I haven't decided yet.  All in all I hope this year will be more exciting than last year, which it looks like being if everything goes well. So for now I'll leave you all to contemplate your own thoughts or whatever you were doing before you got bored and decided to read what I had to say, until next time.....tata.

       First post of the new year. Raawwww!  Well, Christmas was good and so was new years, although both have been rather chilled.  As well as Damien we should now welcome Hannah aboard, she's been a TF groupie for ages and is one of the lads as far as possible, without actually having a penis of course. Random thoughts I have had over xmas/new year:  Marks and Spencers sell individual christmas puddings. I can't help but envisage a poor arthritic war veteran having dinner by himself, like in those 80's ad's for looking after old people at xmas because they get cold and die. I almost hung around to see who bought one and if they needed a hug. Is this strange?  New years meals are rip-off's. 25 a head for a tiny little started and tiny desert, and a luke warm main course. Turkish Kebab for 3 quid, anyone?  New years is better than Christmas. New years is what it is and you know what to expect. Christmas is like some tarted up Essex girl putting on her posh accent.  There's something strange about 4 episodes of Friends back to back, on every channel. But I still watch it.  There's enough of my inane babble for now.

       New Day, New Month, New Year,  New Pants, Same old shit! Happy De Ho! for all you out there!  Aint got anything interesting realy, but welcome to the new age. This is the time when half the people in the world are depressed as its a new year, Most of them have promised someone something they will never intend to keep and the rest have spent a fortune on a gym membership that they will only attend to eight times in the next four months. 2004 has some nice things for us. For starters, its a leap year. That means that there is an extra day for all of us to work. but does anyone get an extra days holiday? No? Its just one way for our employers to shaft us! Also, That festive excuse for comercial commitment called christmas is on a Saturday this year. That means that Boxing day is on Sunday. yet another day we should have as holiday is taken from us like a grubby six year old with a nice bogey hanging on his fingertip, ready to taste when aunty has a napkin on rapid approach with said finger on an intercept course! Bitter? Me? naa, just bored at work...  On, and Scott..... Boobies!!!!!

       Right, time to stop being crap and post something. What have I been upto?  Well, still doing Capoeira with Custard and Baity. We ordered a load of gear from  urlLink http://www.capoeira-shop.com  and it rocks. We look like little Luke Skywalkers now, running around in all white. John also ordered a pair in rasta colours. That combined with his ever-increasing afro will mean he'll be spending the summer looking like huggy bear.  The only part that's not so great about Capoeira is pulling giant chunks of skin off your feet when you have blisters. Good job I ordered some foot balm stuff too. We are all coming on well though, it's going to be a great summer on the beach.  I'm off to New Zealand again shortly, meeting up with the chick, chilling out, loading up on cheap clothes and blowing away possums on a hunting tour. I don't really like hunting as a rule, but I think it's OK with possums for the following reasons:  1) Possums are a scourge in New Zealand. They destroy forests and crops and bankrupt farmers. 2) People make stuff out of Possums. The last time I went, the Maori guy sold the fur for gloves and scarves and made granulated pet food out of the Possum. 3) They are fucking ugly. They look like some kind of aborted rat-beaver cross breed.  So it's not much different from fishing really, except using a high-powered sniper rifle instead of a thermos and a rod.    A Possum, yesterday.  Last weekend myself and Baity went to the premiere of a short film that his friend, Andy Evans had made. It's called "Dream Time" and was about a boy that is stuck in a dream and has to make it back to his bed before he can wake up. It was shown at the Aero Club to appreciative crowd. I was really impressed with it, I'll see if we can get rights to host it here for all to see.   I will shortly be moving Toaster Files off Blogger and onto a alternate site, in preparation for another summer of drunken-hijinx.

       As you lot have been posting more, it's given me a kick in the ass to get some maintenance done on the site. I've fixed that annoying font problem and also found a new comments system - so readers, feel free to backlash against the Toaster boys as we post our inane, bandwidth wasting drivel out into the reaches of cyberspace.  Here is the  urlLink funniest news headline  I have ever seen.  Also here's a little something Mr Grist sent me earlier today which brightened my day up:  In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft error messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction rules - each poem has only 17 syllables; 5 syllables in the first, 7 in the second, 5 in the third.  They are used to communicate a timeless message, often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight throughout extreme brevity. Here are 16 actual error messages from Japan.     The Web site you seek Cannot be located, but Countless more exist    Chaos reigns within. Reflect, repent, and reboot. Order shall return.    Program aborting: Close all that you have worked on You ask far too much.    Windows NT crashed. I am the Blue Screen of Death. No one hears your screams.    Yesterday it worked. Today it is not working. Windows is like that.     Your file was so big. It might be very useful. But now it is gone.    Stay the patient course. Of little worth is your ire. The network is down.    A crash reduces Your expensive computer To a simple stone.    Three things are certain: Death, taxes and lost data. Guess which has occurred.    You step in a stream, But the water has moved on. This page is not here.     Out of memory. We wish to hold the whole sky, But we never will.     Having been erased, The document you're seeking Must now be retyped.     Serious error. All shortcuts have disappeared. Screen. Mind. Both are blank.   Isn't that better than "Your computer has performed an illegal operation."

       Well did I pick the wrong date to be in london with "Terror attack iminent" plastered all over the news I guess I am not gonna be going on the mad drinking binges I had planned incase some fool decides to drive a van full of explosives in to the pub/club im in! Not that I ever go out in london when I'm here as I always always get lost and end up asking some nice old lady directions just to find she has sent me in completely the wrong direction! I can almost see the blue rinse bi@tch laughing as I turn the corner.  I am currently sat in a trainning room learning about Supporting windows XP Not the hardest thing in the world its more like a holiday to me!!  But I have been put up in an amazing hotel "Thistle Hotel Tower" from my window I can see the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the Thames its awsome!! and its all payed for by the bank.  Well better carry on the course Hope to be back by Friday night

       So now i'm back.. from outer space.. well, ok.. New Zealand. I had a blast, everything is so laid back there people are in comas. I bought a load of new clothes for about a third of the price,  I did my "call of the wild" hunting thing, went over sand dunes on quad bikes, got sun burnt and ate loads of awesome food. Unfortunately, going back to Capoeira I am now more like a stoned elephant than Neo. Hope to sort this out soon because there's a special teacher coming over soon and doing a three day course on the 26th, 27th and 28th for three hours each day. Beginners are welcome, if you're interested in a fun and extremely cool martial art then drop me a email.  I've had one night out with the lads since I got back, went to Paul Derrian's (hope that's the right spelling) birthday meal at Pesos, where he span some tunes and we ended up at Liquid. Photos are up in the album!

       Well slap my thigh and give me avian flu. The site is so empty! No one wants to post! So I shall get of my fat lazy work ablated arse and say something.  Well, you may all be aware that I have new teeth, I am practicing taking them out, turning them round and putting them back in place only using my tongue. My uncle passed away last month and I had hassle from work getting two days off to travel to England for the funeral.  Weird one that was, I don’t think I have ever heard of a crematorium where everyone was laughing.  (Long story and you relly had to know my uncle Bill) At least it’s the way he wanted to go.  i have been entered in the swimarathon for 3PM on Sunday the 14th, so Come along and support me you vegetables! Its at Les Quennevais and if your not going to sponsor me (by finding me in the budda bar at eight, Saturday  night) you could at least come down and cheer my podgy belly along through the water like a fat boy through lard.  Oh yes, you read that right, I am out on the lash Saturday, Its me mate Steve’s birthday and he is joining me on the old fart lists. You can all smell my poo! For I shall be drinking beer with dentures!  Anyway, Something that has kept me occupied recently.   urlLink Red balls, Blue Balls!    Finally, Post something or you all shall be my bitches!

       Hope you like the new porno 70's logo.  So Baity John was twisting my arm to tell you a bit more about the night at  Cosmopolitan. Well, I was pretty scared the first time I went in there. I really, really didn't want to go. I have no problem with gay men, but drag queens terrified me. It just didn't seem right, being able to fold and tuck things away that shouldn't be folded or tucked. But I got over that.  Anyway, the night was good - the food excellent and service very quick (unlike BIGA..). Although there were a little too many brussell sprouts, it's not Christmas y'know.  The show consists of various show songs, (Chicago etc) which were pretty funny. The main guy is completely rubberfaced and it's like watching an episode of  Spitting Image . I got harassed, as always seems to be the case. Jo stuck us right at the front so I was prime picking for being serenaded by little orphan Annie. Except they had thoughtfully changed the words to "Your son will come out tomorrow.. bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow, he'll be GAY!" So I turn around and the entire club are looking at me wondering if me and the drag queen are having a moment because I'm being sung at. Fuckers.  Later on we went upstairs to the club which was both different and a good laugh. There was even that dude that you see around town with the blonde woman's wig on, bopping away and having a whale of a time. Fair play to you, Sir.  I did what I usually do when I've had half a bottle of Jose Cuervo and there's a empty podium in front of me. That's right, I danced like I was on fire and scared people. (although Capt. Kirk told me he'd had several enquiries into my sexual orientation and availability.. I feel both flattered and ill at the same time)  To anyone who had to witness me doing the flames with my arms to 'Disco Inferno', I'm very sorry and I hope you can forgive me.

       How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home?' As hard as you try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to your house.     The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer Scooter. The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman God of Wine. Bacchus has acquired a large batch of these magical devices.     The Beer Scooter works in the following fashion:-     The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the "slurring gland" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits them in their bedroom via a Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket cash is taken as payment.     This answers the second questions after a night out, 'How did I spend so much money?'     Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified Drinking Injuries), such as skinned knees and a sore spot on the top of your head.     An undocumented feature of the Beer Scooter is the destruction of  time segments during the trip. The nature of Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly unaccounted for.     This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell happened?' With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT  (Removal of Embarrassing Moments In Time) add-on, that automatically removes, in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another's and quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of time.     Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often cause the Scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending passengers to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.     For the family man, Beer Scooters come equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs, you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised shins.     The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some Scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how one person can apparently get through 260 Marlbro Lights in a single night.     P.S. Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a T-shirt

         The following are the details you have submitted to Heinz.  Firstname: Adam Surname: Currie Email: toaster@toasterfiles.com  Subject: Heinz : Contact Heinz ( Email Ref Number : 27782) Comments: On a visit to my local Safeway I was rather surpised to see that Haunted House tinned spaghetti was no longer sold. I haven't really noticed before, but all I could find was the Tweenies and Barbie spaghetti. I grew on Haunted House spaghetti, it was my favourite, even more so than alphabetti spaghetti. Do you still make it? I know they all taste the same but somehow Haunted House was king. I will feel like a small piece of my childhood has died if this product is no longer produced. *sniff*  Warm Regards,  Adam www.toasterfiles.com     And the reply...   Dear Mr Currie  Further to your recent communication regarding Haunted House Spaghetti, our records show this product is manufactured by HP.  Their contact number is 0800 072 4090.  Thank you for taking the trouble to write to us regarding this matter I hope the above clarifies the situation.

       Shamelessly stolen from a post on CICarScene.com posted by BlueSaxo;  Signs you've been in Jersey too long  1. You say "Eh" at the end of every sentence, eh!  2. You are married to your mother's sister's neice.  3. You have one eyebrow stretching across both eyes and have to shave a gap in between.  4. You hate people from the 'other island' irrationally and passionately.  5. You think nothing of shelling out half a million for a 3 bedroom semi.  6. You are grateful when Chris de Burgh comes over to play to a packed Fort Regent of 40 somethings and find yourself swaying along to A Spaceman came Travelling.  7. You think that £965 for 2 adults and a car to France for a day return isn't too bad really.  8. You pull in £55k for a filing job in the Finance Industry and complain about the money.  9. You quite enjoy the spectacle of all the Scousers, Paddys and Jocks who fight in St. Helier on a Saturday night.  10. You start saying "Red sky at night, Guernsey's alight" and then laugh.  11. You say things like - "I'm not going all the way to St. Martins" (2 miles)  12. You have to get a taxi from Victoria Station to Oxford Circus because the funny map with the coloured lines makes you feel dizzy and you cant be arsed to wait for a train.   On an unrelated note it was a nice start of summer evening tonight, and a few of us here at TF were out for drinks after work.....  Where the hell was the rest of the island?  [)

       The ballad of little Ben      "So let me tell you about little Ben. Ben is a British Shorthair. He was attacked by a dog not so long ago, and almost died. He also has kidney problems so he's on a special diet. Oh, and he has FIV - the cat equivalent of HIV. So he can't go outside or be around other cats." Purrfect. I am at the animal shelter looking at a foster cat that's come in and needs a home. After this description I am expected to see something half-dead with a leg sellotaped on and a coat hanger instead of a tail. Jo has been twisting my arm since we first moved in that she wants a cat.  Perferably one that's old so it can't run away when she wants to hug it.   In fact Ben is just a very quiet, very sad looking little moggy that looks like he's wondering what's going to happen next, after being brought in half dead and having various tests ran on him.  I've always thought of myself as more of a dog person but I've been persuaded into bringing a moggy into our home.  So a few weeks later and little Ben is welcomed home.  We read up on how to bring a cat into a new house, so we do it properly and leave him to explore a single room by himself. He spends the first few hours sitting in a corner, then watching the world go by on window sill. Eventually he starts to explore the rest of the flat, things are going well.  By about 8:30, I realize it's been a while since I saw him. So I look around the whole flat. Three times. Then I have a beer and look again.  Everywhere. The doors and windows are all shut. I am convinced that he's turned ethereal and ascended to heaven, like a zen master. Then I happen to glance at the base of the kitchen units, to a small gap about the size of an coconut between the cupboards and the floor. I wonder... So I get a maglite and a mirror, and sure enough, two winking cats eyes are smiling back at me from the farthest reaches of our flat. Little bastard. He could teach David Blaine a thing or two. I decide to leave him overnight, after all, if he got in there he can get himself out.   Next morning, he's still not budged. I call the animal shelter, saying my cat has turned into a protesting hippy and handcuffed himself to the underside of my oven. They say he's got to come out. They say they are sending the boys around. So one panel of broken chipboard later, little Ben is pulled from his hidey-hole and emerges into the sunlight.   Since that little episode he's fitting in really well, and is keeping me amused during the commercials when  Scrubs  is on. Perhaps I am a cat person after all.

       A few assorted points I have been wishing to make:  1. Posh/Becks/Loo girl.. WHO FUCKING CARES! SHUT THE FUCK UP! Are people's lives so utterly dull that they have to buy into this shit. I don't understand it. Our concept of news is totally fucked. It's like... "Welcome to News at Ten. Posh and Becks, ... *blah blah* text message *blah blah* sex.. *blah blah* and in other news, a million people died in a war somewhere. But back to Becks and his text messages.. ARGH!  2.  Never, ever, ever do the "Smile!" thing. This has bugged me for ages. I was walking down the road a few weeks back, minding my own business. Some sour-faced old craggy woman was walking past me and said, really sarcastically, "Ohhh... don't YOU look happy?". What the fuck! I was in a perfectly good mood till she opened her trap, besides, what the fuck has it got to do with her? That really pissed me off. Never, ever do that... "Smile!" thing to somebody. People have a right to be miserable if they want to be. You know nothing about that person, their entire family could have just died in some hideous car wreck, and you're telling them to SMILE.   3. If you're dumb enough to double-click every piece of crap that arrives in your inbox, you're going to get a computer virus.  Try exercising some self-restraint and using a decent  urlLink e-mail client .  Thank you for letting me vent my spleen. I feel much better.

       OK. sometimes it gets to a point where you have to take certain radical steps: After years of campaigning to post, I have decided to show you all how large my balls really are by stealing Custard's log in (he never posts anyway!)  I'd also like to wonder where everybody disappeared to on friday night(?) suddenly it was 1.30am and everybody had vanished - again: Custard, Baity and myself were the last um guys standing: not like certain other people who have confessed being vomitous on friday night or saturday morning!  So have I proved myself 'male' enough to be accepted?! I have blatantly proved that I can drink as much as the rest of you, and don't suffer from the 'cinderella' syndrome which afflicts some of you...  I await the replies with eagerness..

       Well after almost 27 years of life I finally gave in and went with my brother, Dougal and signed up for a membership at the Fitness First Gym.  I have always prided myself on the ability to look slim while doing absolutely nothing to contribute to it.  In fact before today I had never even been inside a Gym before.  My Brother and I have always been skinny runts, as Grist will tell you.  I loved the fact that through all of our lives people have said to us “Wait till you hit 18!!! It’s all down hill from there” implying that one day we would both wake up to find we were both Fat Bas*£%ds.  When that didn’t happen the 20th was the dreaded age when the belly was gonna get us.  But our 20th came and went and the Belly was still unable to find us.  The same thing was said year in and year out but it never came true.  Now I’m going to the Gym it feels like I’m actively doing something to hide from my long predicted belly.  Well all that is left to do now is see how long it lasts.  Danger out.

       Ever get a really good idea for a website, wonder if it already exists, then think if it didn't would you actually have the time and inclination to put it together? Well I wondered about a bluffer's guide to menus, a kind of food glossary. So if you're out with a lady friend and she asks you what a bundnerfleisch is, you can cunningly reply that it is a Swiss salt-cured, air-dried beef similar to (but considered superior to) Africa's biltong.   The good part is,  urlLink it does already exist . Genius.

       Bit worse for wear but I wanted to post about last night so please take the bad spelling and grammar with a pinch of salt, tequila and lemon.    Oh what a night (late September back in....) I suppose I better stop that now.  We better cross The New Rajah off our list of nights out until they start up a Karaoke night.  Strangely enough my friend was in the Viceroy last night for a Curry and they had a stag party in there who never once raised there voice.    Big thank you to Damien for last night as he treated the crew to dinner.  (If his accountant is watching then our board meeting was very productive and worth the tax write off)    As you know I have not been on a toaster night out in quiet a while and I'm glad to have been there last night, although you guys have softened up and not one of you were in liquid until closing which is a bit poor. I think the two moments of the evening were Toaster and Speedy dancing 06's styley with the girls in Chicago.  Well thats enought from me for now..  Danger out.

       Ok, I need to set a few things straight.  I can't and won't speak for the other members of TF, but I certainly wasn't aware you were planning to organise something for this weekend. I spoke to Custard recently and he mentioned that he was going to set something up at some point because  of birthdays while you were on holiday - but he didn't tell me a specific weekend. You're great fun and we wouldn't burn off your birthday had we known about it.  You have been in our circle of friends for a long time, and you are the only female that has consistently expressed an interest in posting on TF. Originally I didn't want this to happen. Toaster Files has a long history of being about us lads and I wanted it to stay purely as something for us guys. Eventually I relented and invited you to join. As we know for some reason this didn't work (you may believe I engineered this - I didn't, I have no idea why you couldn't join up) but I believe that was a mistake - nothing at all to do with you, but to do with my I set up this site in the first place. I feel I have messed you around by changing my mind and I apologise for this.  With this in mind, I think I need to put clarify some things and compromise on others.  Once a month, we have a night out with the shirts on. I will organise a calendar so we know when it is and what we are doing. These nights are for the guys only. We will take into account other people's birthdays, weddings, holidays, funerals etc and plan around them. If desired, I will add these other things to the calendar so people are aware of what's happening and when.  Everything else that we decide to do, be it going to see a film, have a meal or going out on the knacker is fair game for girlfriends, wives, female mates, pets, imaginary friends, etc.. etc. But I think the lads deserve a night just to themselves to go out and get mad with it.  The main site is for us guys only. I don't want people posting stuff under somebody else's user ID. In future these posts will be deleted. Anyone can leave comments or post on the forum, use these instead please.  I am not doing this to inflame the situation - I feel that if everyone knows where they stand we can avoid people being upset and pissed off in future.

       For my part I would like to apologise for any upset caused by our plans for a curry night. I know that you think it is unfair that we decided to have just the blokes going out, but this not an uncommon thing for a load of guys to have a lads night out.  If we had a lads night out but invited one of the girls, Toasterette/girlfriend or both, then we would of course invite all the guys respective ladies and yourself to come and play. The thing is that this isn't a Toaster Files night out but simply a load of us guys doing something that we haven't done for too long a time. I would like to say that I consider us to be good friends and if you do something on Saturday then I will happily come out with you guys. Once again I am sorry for upsetting you for my part in the organization.  P.S. I hope this has not damaged our friendship and I hope we are cool.  Baity signing off.....

       I see that I have finally crossed the line between being your  friend  and one of the gang and being Marks girlfriend and therefore  baggage . So I learn that there is a toaster night out Friday, yet I'm not invited? Great I was really looking forward to celebrating our birthdays with our friends, and then I find out that the time has come and you've actually realised that I don't have a c*ck.  Well, I thought I'd proved myself by constantly drinking you guys under the table, well if you really want to know guys, it has been proven that a womans internal erection is bigger yes  BIGGER  than yours!    Do't give me the blag that you are coming out to really celebrate our birthdays on the Saturday night, I've known you all long enough to realise that the majority of you last the distance until death on a  normal  night out, so I'd hardly expect you all to have a great night out on the  saturday  night.  Yes I am seething that I cannot go out and celebrate our birthdays with OUR friends. would any of you like to learn that your friends are going out yet  you're  not invited? I would also like to point out the times that I have celebrated your birthdays with you, yet now I am not allowed to celebrate my own..?  Don't give me the lads night out line, its never been an issue before and I will question the welcome to the toasterfiles speech etc and the fact that I am still unable to post in my own right.  Ok so I literally have the decorators in right now so please beg my pardon for being irrational and hurt by being shunted by my  'friends'    With lots of love and friendship..

       You Probably have seen this before but here is the Rainbow Script that got two of it's writers fired.  I have also Attached the link to the show below.   The sketch opens with Zippy peeling a banana ...   Zippy: "One skin, two skin, three skin, four"   George: "Zippy, where is Bungle?"   Zippy: "I think Geoffrey is trying to get him up"   We see a view of the door and hear Bungle moaning from behind it.   Bungle: "Geoffrey, I can't get it in"   Geoffrey: "You managed it last night"   Bungle: "I know, let's try it round the other way. Ooooooh, I've got it in"   Bungle and Geoffrey enter the studio with Bungle carrying a hammer and Peg kit.   Bungle: "Would you stick this on the shelf, George"   George: "I can't reach, you'll have to stick it up yourself,   Bungle." Geoffrey (to camera) "Hello everyone, today we are talking about playing"   Bungle: "Playing with each other, Geoffrey?"   Geoffrey: "Yes Bungle, do you have a special friend that you like to play with?"   George: "Yesterday we played with each other's balls. Are we going to play with our friend's balls today?   Bungle: "Yes, and we can play with our twangers as well."   Geoffrey (to camera) Have you seen Bungles twanger?   Zippy: "Oh I have, I showed him how to pluck with it."   Bungle: "It's my plucking instrument."   Geoffrey asks the audience if they can pluck like Bungle   Zippy: "I can, I'm the best plucker here."   George: "And I'm good at banging. My peg's hard isn't it Zippy?"   Zippy: "Well of course it is, your peg wouldn't go in if it was soft."   Geoffrey: "Let's get back to Bungle's twanger."   Bungle: (excited) "Oooooh Geoffrey, we could all play with our twangers couldn't we? Let's play the plucking song. Rod and Freddy can get their instruments out and Jane has got two lovely Maracas."   Singers Rod, Freddy and Jane enter.   Freddy: "We could hear you all banging away"   Rod: "Banging can be fun."   Jane: "Ooooh yes and I was banging away all last night with Rod and Freddy."   Freddy: (looking sad ) "Yes, but it broke my plucking instrument."   Rod: (to Jane) "Do you want to blow on my pipe while I'm twanging away?"   Jane: "Oh no, I was banging away with Freddy last night. But would you like to play with my maracas?   Zippy; "No, let's just pluck away with our twangers."   George: "Yes, it doesn't matter what size our twanger is."   Zippy: "I've got a big red one."   George: "I've only got a tiny twanger. But it works well and I like to play with it."   Geoffrey: (to viewers) "Well, have you got your twangers out? And remember, you can bang your balls at the same time. If you haven't got any, ask a friend if you can play with his. Now, let's all play the plucking song."   Everyone in studio: "Pluck, pluck, pluck along, we're going to Pluck all day."    urlLink Plucking Sketch

         Little Cat Diaries - Volume One   Ben is fitting in well in his new home. Almost too damn well. The little bugger has scratched the fuck out of my shiny new, sweet smelling lemon coloured sofa. He's been here nearly a month and now it looks like the crap  urlLink Mr Men  character, Mr Messy. We decided to give him a try on the balcony, to see how he got on. Supervised, he made his first little steps out into the fresh summer afternoon. Later on, he'd try it again and (as I have found cats do for no reason) cacked his feline panties and bolted, head first, into the glass door. It made a impressive sound considering his size, I thought he might have brained himself but luckily he seems just as nuts as normal. We have been giving him steroids for his dodgy eye and it's started to clean up well.  My only complaint today is the utterly vile, completely evil stench that exuded from his dirt box when I got home. He eats the exact same food every day, normally his poop is fine. Today it made my eyes melt and my lungs shrivel up and beg for mercy.   Friday night is curry night boys. Call me for details if you're down with it.

       Just got back from watching  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , another film from the somewhat awry mind of one  urlLink Charlie Kaufman  - author of the amazing  urlLink Adaptation  and the bizzare  urlLink Being John Malkovich .  The film stars  urlLink Jim Carrey  and  urlLink Kate Winslet  as a couple who individually both end up visiting Laguna Inc, a company that specialises in memory erasure to wipe each other from their mind (something I'm sure we've all wished possible at least once).  The plot unravels in it's own special Kaufman/Tarantino style while managing to keep a blanket of romance wrapped around our two main stars.  Supporting cast includes  urlLink Kirsten Dunst  looking damned tasty in a little shirt and knickers and a whining  urlLink Elija 'Frodo' Wood  as part of Laguna's tech crew.  Overall I really enjoyed this film, the acting and cinematography were superb and the story was well told with a strong visual style... be aware that it is at times a little confusing however pay attention and you'll be suitably rewarded by the end.  It certainly isn't for everyone, a lacklustre 7 people made it in to the start of our screening and four of those got up and left before it finished leaving just the two of us and an odd looking guy to stare at the credit wondering how much we missed first time round.  Highly recommended,  [)

       Ok so it's nearly the end of another week, yup as far as I can remember from my work time sheet it's like week 18 already!!! Where has this year gone??? Actually I don't really care, couldn't give a shit as it's been fairly mundane so far!  Anyway as I was saying, it's nearly the weekend- so what we all going to do? I am a bit disappointed at the lack of response form you guys about going out at the weekend, I though we were all outgoing, but it appears that you have all become quite boring in your little relationship driven lives!!! (I detect a hint of want a GF in there hehe!) So come on guys, think of those who don't have a nice warm lady to snug up to over the weekend (winks) and come out to play.   So now we get to Baity's though of the day.... 'If I shout out "Lets all go and kill the States members!" I wonder what the general consensus would be?'  Baity signing off.....

       In the attempt to test out our spanking new message board I wanted to ask your opinion on this.  A while ago now I came up with a plan of getting the whole crew together for some photo shots around the island.  What we would do is get hold of a van for transport and an old Sofa.  We would then proceed to drive round the Island and at Random areas stop, get the sofa out, all sit on it and have a photo taken.  We could do this almost anywhere.  Gory Castle, St Brelades Beach, St Ouens Beach, Middle of Town, Jersey Airport, Faldoet Dolman and so on.   So go to the message board and put down your views.   urlLink Message Link   Danger

Actually I have been really busy of late, going away on holidays, going away on more holidays and lots and lots of roleplay organizing!!! Life is too short.  So anyway all is good with me at the moment asides from having the back problem from hell! But hopefully it is on the mend and I may even get out this weekend to do some moshing. Speaking of moshing, anyone want to go to the Splash on Saturday??? I think Kirk said he was up for it when I last saw him.  I went to see Van Helsing the other day and I thought it was alright, good use of classic Whampyre traits, good action, and tits tits tits! The plot is a little like 'Um ok' but generally an entertainer.  Right I can't say too much after such an absence so I'll be off now. Oh, one last thing... Great new layout Toaster!

       Despite a rather killer hangover this morning (work's night out.. bladdered) I dragged my carcass down to Belle Croute to go fishing with Kirk & his dad. It was freezing cold to start with but the wind died down eventually. Kirk's dad scored a rather small but perfectly formed bass (which went back to be caught again another day) and I landed my first ever fish! It's called a Garfish (or known locally as a Snipe), and it's a evil looking little bastard. They have green bones to help you eat them easier, which is rather thoughtful.     Happy birthday Ruth!

        News Flash from the DVLA  In order to assist other motorists in identifying potentially dangerous drivers, it's now compulsory for anyone with a lower than average IQ and driving ability to display a warning flag.  The flag ( comprising of a red cross on a white background ) will be attached to the top of at least one door of their vehicle.  For drivers of exceptionally low ability, additional flags are required.

       Interesting news today is that the world's first  urlLink mobile phone based virus has been created , however it only affects Symbian OS and transmits by bluetooth.   Here's news on the  urlLink Red Dwarf Movie (yay!)  It's James Joyce day today! Perhaps I really should make the effort and read Ulysses after all. But why bother, when  urlLink the BBC have condensed it all for you  and it's far more interesting:   CHAPTER 6 Bloom attends a funeral at Glasnevin Cemetery, his symbolic encounter with death mirroring Odysseus's descent into Hades. It's a real barrel of laughs.    On another note, I've decided to create a Toaster's 'eating-out' guide for Jersey, as recently I've had a couple of great meals out and a few really bad ones. Restaurants will be rated up to five slices of toast, for quality of food, service, atmosphere and waitress attractiveness. (OK, maybe not the last one). Stay tuned.

       Normally when I watch a DvD or Movie I never bother to review the Credits after the film.  The other night however I wanted to find out the artist for one of the songs from the soundtrack.  On reviewing the names one of the job names really caught my eye, I even had to rewind to make sure I saw it right… GAFFER!!!  What the hell is that, I can’t even guess the job description for it.  Finding this intriguing I started looking to see if this was some sort of Cult in the Film industry and not one page down there was another one… KEY GRIP and another BEST BOY!!!  You would look a twat going to the pub, chatting up a girl and then all of a sudden she asks the question “So what do you do for a living?” I can see the reply now “Ahh… I’m a Second Assistant Key Grip!!!”   So with my brains baffled I went to the portal of all knowledge, no not PK, the internet and the second search it found was  “What is a Gaffer?”   Only in the world of thespians could they find such stupid names for ordinary jobs.  Well that’s my rant for the day.  Danger

       This guy gets a job as a bus conductor. A month into the job, he runs over this old woman as she's crossing the street and kills her. He gets sentenced with the Death Penalty and goes to the electric chair. For his last request, he requests ten pounds of bananas. He eats the bananas, and they electrocute him, but he doesn't die from it. Confused, the prison ward considers it an Act of God and lets him go.  The guy gets his job back as a bus conductor. A week later, he runs over a line of children crossing the street to get to school. He goes back to jail and once again gets sentenced with the death penalty. He requests his ten pounds of bananas and eats them, and once again the electric chair does not kill him. It's considered an Act of God, and he is released.  This guy gets his job back as a bus conductor. The DAY AFTER, he drives the bus up on a sidewalk and massacres over 30 people. He gets thrown back in jail, gets the death penalty, and requests the ten pounds of bananas. And again, the electric chair fails to kill him.  As he is being released, the executioner walks up to him and says "Listen, I've been doing this job for seven years, and I've never seen anybody survive three blasts from the chair. What's your secret? Is it the bananas?"  And the guy says "No, I'm just a bad conductor."

       I've been meaning to post about my weekend away in Naples. Well, it's a great place. The food is great, people dress well (apart from a odd fetish for lime green, I'm not sure why). The thing that really deserves a mention however is the driving.  I'd heard about Italian drivers beforehand. Apparently they drive really close to you and pretty fast. This is not correct. The correct thing to say would be that Italians are fucking insane behind the wheel of a car. Almost every car I saw in Naples had a big scratch, a dent or a panel missing. Sometimes all three. They drive literally inches from each other.  After leaving the airport and getting a taxi to our hotel, I found myself being driven down a hill. In the wet. Very fast. On a cobbled street. At night. On the wrong side of the road. Around a blind corner. He then got to the bottom and went the wrong way around the roundabout, nonchalantly flicking his cigarette ash into the oncoming traffic.     At one point in the piazza in Sorrento, there were buses, scooters, pedestrians, baby buggies, motorcycles and even stray dogs performing a strange ballet and missing each other by the width of a mosquito's pube. It was pretty amazing to watch.

        Starbucks Guide to the Perfect Coffee    Proportion   Use the right proportion of coffee to water – this is the most important step in making great coffee. For the most flavourful cup, we recommend 10 grams of coffee for every 180 millilitres of water. If coffee brewed this way is too strong for your taste, you can add a little hot water to your cup of brewed coffee.    (10 grams coffee : 180 millilitres of water)     Grind   Different brewing methods have different grind requirements, but in general – the shorter the brew time, the finer the grind. For example, coffee ground for an espresso machine should be very fine, because the brew cycle is only 18-23 seconds long. But for a coffee press (cafetiere), the coffee should be ground coarsely, because the water and coffee are left to sleep for four minutes before the plunger is slowly pressed down.    Espresso machines: Fine grind  Drip coffee makers: Medium grind  Coffee press: Coarse grind     Water   A cup of coffee is 98 percent water. So the water you use to make coffee should taste clean, fresh, and free of impurities. Water heated to just off the boil (90° to 96° C) is perfect for extracting the coffee’s full range of flavours. Any cooler and the water can't adequately do the job.    Clean water = Better coffee     Freshness   Coffee is fresh produce, and its enemies are oxygen, light, heat, and moisture. To keep coffee fresh, store it in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature in the dark. You can store it that way for up to a week. For the best results, coffee should be ground just before brewing.    Fresh coffee = Less than one week old

It is always a sincere pleasure to hear from our valued, caffeine addicted, customers! Sadly, we have no immediate plans for the Channel Islands, though it remains under consideration. I have shared your comments with the Store Development Team who welcome customer input in their considerations.  I hope you will continue to enjoy our coffee for many years to come.

         From:      toaster@toasterfiles.com To:        ukinfo@starbucks.com Subject:   Help  Dear Starbucks,  I'm from Jersey in the Channel Islands. When it comes to coffee here, our choices are severely limited. Most of the populace wonder the streets in the morning, making a strange zombie-like noise, searching for precious caffeine to kick-start there cerebrum into action.  The local coffee houses keep a tight lid on the goods. They only serve us luke-warm, watered down mochas and keep the good stuff for themselves.   Only when you escape to the UK mainland can you find yourself in coffee heaven. I order a Venti Mocha and retreat to the corner of Starbucks, clutching my precious liquid and giggling deliriously. Clearly, like many others, I have a caffeine addiction and I need help.  Please come over to Jersey and set up a Starbucks here. Bring your fantastic mochas, your small but perfectly formed espresso's, and your tasty muffins and brownies.  The good people of Jersey will see the smiling, illuminated face of the Starbucks logo they will know it is good.  Regards,  Adam

       5! 4! 3!  2!  1!  Thunderbirds blow   I'd like to do a proper review however I needed time to full reflect on the sheer stupidity that lead to this production. It's been 24 hours and I gave up some 23 hours ago. It can be broken down into two problem areas:    1. Script/audience    Dire. Hollywood formulaic #3 kids-rescue-parents-in-peril (despite all original Thunderbirds fans being near or over 30) with a helping of #7 learn-valuable-lessons and #4 two-dimensional-villain (who has money, power and brains but somehow just wants illogical revenge).    It has kids being chased around by adults, goop, nobody getting too badly injured and a rather low joke count - all of which fall flat. I knew I was in trouble when Jonathan Frakes showed up as director in the opening credits.    2. Casting    Errrr. Well.. I like Bill Paxton, he made me laugh in True Lies and somehow managed to pull off Twister - but he is so wrong as top Tracey in charge of International Rescue. I didn't recognise any of the rest of the cast - which is normally a good thing but few made any sort of impression or seemed suited for the role. Brains was equally short changed. The villian seemed vaguely familiar as a crap baddie from somewhere else.    Penelope and Parker were passable although I think thats only because the actress playing Penelope is damned hot - male judgement tends to be skewed somewhat by such things.      The CG, ships, sets and locations looked great alas they needed to be  attached  to a somewhat better script and cast.

Watching TV with my Master! My favourite!     8:30 pm Oh Boy! Sleeping in Master's Bed! My Favourite!       From a Cat's Daily Diary:      Day 183 of my captivity.  My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild scolding I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture.   Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant.  Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded; must try this at the top of the stairs.  In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favourite chair; must try this on their bed.  Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body in an attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was.  Hmmmm, not working according to plan. There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary confinement throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell of food. More importantly, I overheard that my confinement was due to my power of "allergies". I must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.  I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The Dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The bird, on the other hand, has got to be an informant. He speaks with them regularly, and I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room, his safety is assured.  But I can wait, it is only a matter of time...

           Toaster goes Firewalking!     Last night I joined about forty other people at Ransoms Garden Centre to participate in a Firewalk to raise money for  urlLink Breakthrough Breast Cancer . I had been getting people to sponsor me over the last fortnight and come up with just under £100.    The evening started as we laid logs together in pyres and our team leader lit them. We then went back to the restaurant area and had a two hour speech on motivation, mind over matter, etc etc. A lot of it I had already covered, having read books by Tony Robbins etc.    It was hard keeping a straight face when 'Matthew' played Tina Turner's 'Simply the Best' in an effort to get us pumped up. Visions of Ricky Gervais danced in my head. So we all started walking towards the hot coals, being encouraged to clap and cheer to pump ourselves up. I preferred to keep quiet, as did most of my team.    The path of hot embers looked pretty daunting. It reminded me of Terminator 2, when Arnie is being lowered into the vat of molten lead to destroy himself. Matthew went first and strode across, making it look as easy as pie. Slowly we all followed, some people faster than others, but all crossing in about four strides and looking glad to have their feet hosed down at the end.    Then it was my turn. I stood in front of this sea of fire and took a deep breath. Everything seemed to slow down. Then I walked, one foot over the other. I can't really remember much except getting to the end and realising that my feet fucking hurt. I'd just walked across burning hot coals, and I’d burnt my feet. What the fuck did I do that for? I didn't really feel any euphoria or empowered, I felt like I’d done something stupid and now both science and common sense were pissing themselves at my expense.    Eventually we all filtered back for a (rather pathetic) BBQ. Most people had their feet in buckets of ice-cold water and were looking pretty pissed off. A few people in particular had feet covered in blisters and were looking rather ill.    I drove home, countered my blisters, put my feet in a bowl of cold water, knocked back some painkillers and had a beer.    Next morning, I feel rather short changed by the whole event. Especially after finding out seven of us ended up in A&amp;E. (Bet the nurses were pissed off, and quiet rightly so.)    I didn't once see a paramedic or St John's Ambulance person there, in case of emergencies, which was pretty poor.     Granted I have very minor burns compared to some, and I’m not really sure why that is. There is plenty of hubbub on the net about ash layers, feet being poor thermal conductors, etc. I don't really know if this makes a difference.     If you walk on hot coals, the chances are you're going to get burnt feet - so sponsor somebody else to do it.

       Um..... that looks a bit like... no... wait it can't be... hang on... it IS!!! Thats me, that is!!! I feel so ashamed!!! But really people, it isn't my fault, two years ago I was walking down a dark St.Ouen road during a full moon and this great slavernous Weremare jumped out over a fence and bit me on the arm, I haven't been the same since that day!   So remember, if your walking down a dark road during a full moon, be very cautious, because you never know if I am there....     waiting....    watching...     getting ready to pounce!!!   You have been warned.....   Baity signing off.....

       The cat litter man responds!   Dear Adam  I am the owner of FreshMagic. I am distressed to hear of your experience.  This is only the second letter of this kind in five years. If you send your name and address and where you bought the product I will send you a full refund.  I presume you bought the purple bag, the chunk style litter. Originally, all litter was round, then the new chunk style was developed because it does not roll when displaced from the box.  We found that it does not last as long but a customer should still get 3+ weeks from it, especially for a cat who urinates less.  I would love to know the source of the problem because your experience is atypical.  I do apologize for the results that you have had.   Sincerely Leo Lane   Result!

        Little Cat Diaries Volume 3       From: toaster@toasterfiles.com To: leolane@freshmagic.com Subject: My experience with freshmagic cat litter  Hello.  I am a fairly new cat owner and was browsing through my local pet store when I noticed your product.  I read the back and noticed that it promised to 'completely eliminate odor', be 'dry to the touch' and last for a month without being changed. At the time I was using conventional wood-chip cat litter and a litter tray bag, which I would change every few days. I didn't like the way that my cat would walk the cat litter through the house and having to change it so often, so I decided to buy a couple of bags of Freshmagic and give it a try.  The first week or so went well, there was no real odor (I remove his solid waste daily) but it still seemed to be walked through the carpet, but I didn't mind the little crystals as much as the wood-based litter.  At the start of the second week I noticed I noticed a vague smell of cat urine and that the little crystals were slightly yellow which I assumed was to be expected.  By the end of the second week the smell of cat urine was very strong and making me feel rather ill. So I decided that I would swap out the entire tray after just two weeks. Upon opening his litter box (it's a closed box - I respect his privacy), I discovered what can only be described as a river of cat urine running through his tray. The smell was indescribable, I felt like my face was melting. I ran to the toilet and threw up.  After three pairs of rubber gloves, about five rinses with the shower and the best part of a bottle of bleach, I dried his tray out and replaced the cat litter with a new bag of freshmagic as it was all I had. Two weeks later and I had to repeat the procedure.  My cat has renal problems so doesn't urinate as much as a normal cat, so I can't imagine how anyone could survive a month using freshmagic.  I'll be buying a large bag of wooden cat litter chips tomorrow and a pack of bags. It costs half as much as your product, lasts twice as long, and I won't be suffering from post traumatic stress afterwards.  I won't be purchasing your product again, nor recommending it to any of my cat-owning friends.  Regards,  Adam Currie

       Right, time to give you the latest..  Here's a short, sharp list of what I've been up to recently:  Watched the worst movie I have ever seen - (and I've seen some real stinkers)  urlLink Cabin Fever  is pitched as a tense, psychological horror but is in fact complete drivel. For instance, one of them is infected with this flesh-eating disease and drives to a petrol station to get help. There's a small blonde lad sitting on a chair, who screams 'PANCAKES!' and then performs some slow-motion Kung Fu before biting the diseased man on the hand. No explanation, nothing.  Went to a concert at St James' church, watched the rather groovy kiwi band  urlLink Wai  do their thing. A interesting mix of raggae, drum & bass and Maori vocals. Shame the CD is completely different and makes me want to rip my ears off.  Got the  urlLink car serviced . It needs a new clutch and a set of cogs to make the roof work again. Total cost, around Â£500. Bastards.  Decided to go on a road trip with the Mallets to  urlLink Santa Pod  at the end of August for some V8 muscle car action.  Went to the JEP's West Show today up at St Peters. Patted a cow, prodded a huge rabbit, watched dancing diggers, ate chicken satay and watched the GF find out how disgusted lavender (yes, lavender) flavoured jelly is.

       Ok, so no one else is posting at the moment! Well I am suprised Toaster has been so quiet, along with a few others, and then it's no suprise that others haven't!!! Some are just in for the good stuff and can't be bothered, you know who you are!!!  Anyway, I am still acumilating all the evidence from the TF/General Hospital Summer Ball, but here are a few of the photos I have found so far...              So there you all go, there are hopefully a load to come, but for now tata.  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'  P.S. If anyone is interested, there are more pictures from the night in the photo section of the site.

       Mate I know this doctor, who I think can help you, or should I say Kate!!! It strikes me that placing a top security pass in a box of morning cereal is NOT common behaviour and I do not think I will be able to speak to her anymore for fear of being cut up and placed in a bag of Findus frozen peas or something!!!  Anyway, for anyone who is interested in a new hobby I call 'S.H.I.T. - Special Hats In Trucks' here is a photo of my lastest hat invention...     Baity signing off.....

       Just thought I would share my interesting morning with you all.  I don’t know if many of you know but every now and then Katharine and I look after a friends dogs when he goes on holiday.  This weekend he came back from his trip away and while I went to pick him up at the airport Katharine packed our things away.  So this morning while I was getting ready to go to work I asked Katharine where she had placed my Security Pass for work.  After spending 10 mins tearing the flat to pieces we still could not find it.  Then Katharine all of a sudden remembers where she had put it and opens up the fridge and retrieves my Security pass form a box of Alpen chewy bars inside.    Obviously I kicked myself while walking to work for having disturbed Katharine and not having looked there in the first place.

       Hello everyone, long time, no post!!! I spose I should apologise for my lack of baityism over the past few months. If truth be told, there is a fairly good reason for my prolonged silence... I have just been very busy lately!  I had to prepare alot of kit for the Jersey Revels, in which I took part and thereafter my tim was spent recovering from it all.  Another reason is that I haven't done anything worth mentioning lately as I have had to take it easy due to my back injury (says glumly). However, it is getting better so hopefully before the end of the year is out I shall be able to have fun again!!!  So apart from my story of medieval antics and the usual show of me harming myself in different ways, there isn't much to report unfortunatly!  Oh yeah... ITS MY BIRTHDAY!!! Yup today I hit my 23rd year of excistence... and to be honest it's no different to any other day, apart form tonight I am out with as many people as I can muster. Plus tomorrow it is my cousins birthday and he is coming out tonight too, so there should be a large number of people out. Anyway I must get ready now so if there is anyone who knows me and has not recieved a text msg from me then I do apologise as it isn't intentional, so come out and have a drink, ta ta for now.  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'  P.S. To all of my friends abroad at uni, wish you could have been here (especially one of you :o)

       Last weekend Baity and myself joined eight others in a V8 muscle car odyssey, driving up from Bournemouth to Santa Pod raceway near Milton Keynes. We were heading to the MOPAR euro-nationals. MOPAR combined name for all cars produced by Plymouth, Chrysler, Dodge and another company I have forgot the name of.  We camped next to the drag strip, saw some stupidly over-powered cars and generally had a damn good time.  I would write about it in more detail, but I’ve had a killer migraine all day and I’m heading back to bed..  urlLink so here's the pictures.
