       holiday weight gain.  of course! who doesn't? everybody gains weight after the holidays. i don't know...i just can't control myself from eating the leftovers of our noche buena even if i'm already full! what makes it worse is that i'm too lazy to burn out the calories that i got! i just hit the treadmill for 6 minutes and that's it, i already felt so tired to continue working out. i just watched 4 videos with my brother, which are  HP & the sorcerer's stone, serendipity, the ring  and  kailangan kita  (movie of claudine baretto and aga muhlach). and guess what...i was munching on cloud 9   chocolate bars while watching those movies! waaahh! grabe! ang taba ko na! i really feel guilty.   but, anyways, i can always use the holidays as an excuse! holiday is about being worry-free and...uhmm...indulging, right? hehehe...now i feel better. err..nope...i still feel guilty. =`( waaah!

      at last the blogger works quite better now. ok, i really have to do some upating, ok... we had a christmas party here last night,it's my parents' party but as usual, ive invited friends over, and like the past 4 christmas parties, my ex was here (he's always being asked to sing for the christmas program --- watch out for his bands's album, soon to be released). it was a good day for all of us, i think, my ex, erick went here with her siblings and imee(our friend). on the other hand, im happy coz bebi is so understanding that he didnt get jealous of the situation...coz it was my parents who wanted erick to be at the party. and im also happy coz i myself didnt feel awkward with that setting. bebi was able to spend time with my siblings harrold and miko, andrea even noticed that marlowe really looks like the big "kuya" for my brothers. *sweet* too bad bebi had to leave early coz he got work. when we got to talk later that night, i asked him if he still feels threatened with the fact that my ex and i still communicate. he said yes coz he doesnt wanna lose me. awww...i'm really so lucky with you bebi, coz you're not possessive and yet i can feel that you really love me. i love you too be.ü

       failure.  i failed on two things:  first, waking up for the simbang gabi. so i decided to just attend it on christmas break. lolz =P ang lamig kasi pag morning eh!  second, i failed on inspiring my friend, andeng to be a strong woman...grabe. it upset me so much. i think this is the first time i cried so much because of a friend. *sigh* well, that's how life goes...so i guess i should just accept that i can't influence everybody, even if my intentions are good. one more lesson, i should avoid being too attached and concerned to a friend because her decisions would affect me so much.  simple rule of life: too much of something is bad enough   plugging!  + aira...thanks for informing me about a good webcam deal in GH. =P sana makumpleto mo simbang gabi!ü + P.jae and grace...kakatuwa kayo! idol nyo kame. lolz are you guys sure gusto nyo kme i-idolize? hehehe...d rin nman kme perfect noh. ey! just feel free to chat on the tag-board. para sa inyo talaga yan. i'm pleased to know that im helping you get in touch with each other through our tagboard.ü  + lou...next time you check the site, sign ka sa gbook ha, or kahit tag lang...la lang..gusto ko lang makibalita. mishu! ü

       simbang gabi.  i really intended to complete my attendance to the simbang gabi this year. Unfortunately, i had a very good night sleep that i can't get myself off the bed when my cell phone alarmed at 3:30 am, so i just continued my sound sleep. i woke up at 9am. hehehe.ü but i would still attend simbang gabi even if i couldn't complete the 9 days anymore, maybe atleast twice this season. i love the experience! and the fulfilment that i get after struggling to wake up that early to hear the mass...feel the morning breeze...see the neighborhood at dawn buying puto bumbong and bibingka outside the church...hayyy...i promise im gonna get up tomorrow!ü

      it makes me happy when someone signs our guestbook...especially if the message comes from people we don't even know, or not close to us. but it also makes me feel terribly sad when people close to us (whom i expect to be the first people who would view our site) don't even bother to surf it. i dont know why other people can't understand that....

       i've been a bad girlfriend lately... inaabuso ko kabaitan ni bebi, tini-take for granted ko sha since i know that he won't leave me, sinusungitan ko sha pag pagod ako at pressured sa school works, dinadamay ko sha pag nag-aaway kame ng brother ko at pati na rin pag nag-aaway kame ng Papa ko, sometimes ini-ignore ko sha, sinusungitan ko sha for no reasons at all. maangas ako at sobrang ma-pride.   that's why he broke up with me last night.  at first i thought kaya ko, nag-matigas ako, maangas pa rin ako. but then i realized that libing without him is the least thing that i want to happen in my life. i realized na sobrang swerte ako kay marlowe, he's perfect for me, he seems to have everything an ideal boyfriend should have, di na ko makakakita ng gaya nya. kaya kahit gusto ko man magmatigas at i-prove na i'm strong, i can't deny na kelangan ko si marlowe and i won't survive a day knowing that he doesn't want me in his life anymore. and also, kaya naman ako naging matapang ay dahil din sa kanya, he's the source of my strength. i wanted to say that i respect his decision but it always end up with me begging him to come back. kahit na hindi ako yung tipong magmamakaawa sa guy, i realized that he's something worth all i have, even my pride. and besides, ako ang may kasalanan. he didn't do anything bad to me, in short, i deserve the break up.   but we got back together this morning. ü i cried myself to sleep, i texted him at 5am and asked him again to come back. he replied at 6am with this message: "labyu.bakit di ka natulog?" i cried again, but that time, those were tears of joy. i grabbed the phone and called him, i thanked him for giving me another chance. i couldn't talk clearly because i didn't know what to say, i just cried.  what happened made me realize a lot of things. i just can't put them here, sakin na lang yon. basta now i promise to take away all the bad habits that i have. bebi, i really love you very much. salamat talaga.

      i'm suddenly craving for  banana ...weird.  i just surfed two personal sites linked from  urlLink aira's . and should i say, they're really gooood. i dont know how they made all those graphics and everything, then i discovered they're only 14 and 15 (!?!). gosh...i dunno what to say...i feel OLD! =( i feel old and so slow...so late! where did they learn to do all that? is it being taught on high schools today? oh god...i feel bad. when i was a teenager, i couldn't wait to be 20, coz i wanted  the feeling of independence and maturity. but now that i'm going 21...and i see skillful highschoolers who are more deserving to land a job on a dotcom company..arrgh, i feel awful. i suddenly dont want to graduate! i still want to study. i want to learn more. there are still a lot of things i dont know! god...i hate this feeling. i'm weird, eh? =/

      just want to share you this forwarded email...so nice!ü  STRONGER NOW   Everybody thought we were the perfect couple. That was what I thought too.  This experience probably is the most painful, as far as my whole life is concerned. I have loved him so much that it’s going to be very painful if I ever let him go. At first, I thought that nothing would break us apart because we were both mature on handling our relationship and that we’re serious about each other. But I suppose that only happens in dreams, really. I never thought such a tragedy would happen to me.  One night – a very ordinary one – we were talking on the phone, discussing his future plans when he graduates from college, his dreams and what job he wanted to pursue. Suddenly, something made him tell me that he is bored with his life that very minute. He tells me that he’s tired of doing the same old stuffs over and over again. In other words, he felt very discouraged that night, and I, as his girlfriend, need lots of comforting and cheering up to do. He just went on sharing his heart out, and I too, just went on comforting him when abruptly he became drop-dead silent, as if he’d suddenly seen a ghost out of nowhere – freezing his lungs dry. I asked why he stopped – he didn’t answer me – so I took advantage of his silence and started sharing with him my most spirit-lifting words of love and encouragement. But as I was talking, he suddenly started making hush sounds, which I suppose were quiet sobs. For about ten whole minutes of me, continuously asking why he’s crying, he finally gave in and said quietly, “I miss Julia…” was what came out of his whispering sobs. I couldn’t believe my ears! I even wasn’t sure if I heard him right! So I asked again… “WHAT?” quietly…though I already felt the pain. He answered “I miss Julia…” again…this time more quietly. I asked again… “what…” He replied with a tiny whisper “I miss Julia…”  Because of so much pain, plenty of tears started rolling down my cheeks uncontrollably…and I knew, I have been hurt again…by the same person…who did it again…  At first of course, I was so crushed and was full of rage – I mean, who wouldn’t be? After three fruitful years of being together, suddenly your boyfriend tells you he misses someone else? Someone who has once been the conflict in your relationship sometime in the last three months…too bad for me huh?  Oh well, it could have caused me emotional breakdown or something of that kind, but thankfully, I chose not to. I’ve realized that there’s more to crying and being crushed. Life teaches us great lessons by breaking our hearts. Life has taught me how to love when my boyfriend broke my heart…again. And that’s what makes us more able and much stronger to go through this journey we call Life.  Then I know…I’m stronger now…   I loved you so much before I had my first chance with you. Then you gave me that chance of my lifetime. It was only for a short time, such a short time. Then as my life became filled with happiness and joy, you left me, without explanation. For days I questioned why. For many nights I cried. I promised myself I wouldn't hate you or regret meeting you. But how could I anyway? You made me want to be a better person, you made me smile when I thought I couldn't, you turned my life around... and for this reason I know I'll love you forever.

       Nearly blue.  The night was almost ruined, but I didn’t let it happen, of course.ü we went to blue onion and bopped there ecstatically with the rather unfamiliar beat. I really enjoyed everybody’s company (jen, wendy, jomer, jane, cel and bebi, plus bev), they were able to have fun though some of them just met for the first time. I had a bottle of raspberry vodka, and jen who doesn’t drink gave me her bottle, bebi helped me finish it. I don’t really know how to drink, so naturally, I knew I was a little tipsy. When there were girls already dancing on top of the side ledge, I felt kinda envious and curious of how it feels like being there, getting everybody’s attention. Hehe!ü I felt that way because I saw how they made bebi energized when they started dancing.ü haha! Anyways, never mind, it was just a fantasy! Hehe…ü   Ok…about the night being almost ruined, hmmm…bigla na lang kami iniwan ni andeng ng walang pasabi. Ni- ha ni-ho, wala. When jen texted her, all she said was, nagkakanya-kanya daw kami. She was left out…or something like that. Jane, and especially, Rocelle were new in the group, they were the ones who are supposed to feel left out. But why didn’t they feel that way? Because they didn’t isolate themselves. ‘nuff said. Another reason why last night wasn’t that totally enjoyable for me was because my brother and I had a miscommunication. Nagkita kme sa eastwood and I asked him if he’s already going home and he answered no. I told him I’ll go ahead, I said bye and he replied, “sige”. Then when I’m already at commonwealth ave., he called my celphone and asked me why I left him, he ordered me to go back. Labo noh? I don’t know who’s to blame for the misunderstanding. I guess, preho lang kame…tipsy? Hahaha!ü

       long time no blog, eh?  i've been busy after i got back from our exposure-immersion. well..it was ok, kinda depressing coz i was able to see and experience the pain that the refugees feel. the family that was assigned to our group was Pastor Dino's family. if you were able to watch i-witness on GMA, the episode about militarization in Mindoro, Pastor Dino was the one interviewed there by reporter Maki Pulido. we had problems about the food that we're gonna eat, where to sleep, and where to change our clothes (you can expect the worst) but i dont wanna talk abt that. there are more important issues to obssess about. before we left, we bid goodbye to Pastor Dino's family, naiiyak nga ako eh, kasi nakikita ko sa mata nila na umaasa sila sa amin na tutulungan namin sila. he said to us, "malulungkot kami" (coz we're leaving). i know i have to do something, i gotta do something! im always praying for them and everytime i remember their faces and their condition, nalulungkot ako. =( im hoping that i would be able to see them again.   paging all single guys!  my good friend andeng  [check her pics on the   urlLink  visuals    page 4 & 5]  is out on the market again! just leave me a note if you're diggin her.ü   SATC threesome.  HBO is showing sex and the city season 4 again every tuesday (it already started last night) at 10pm. they're showing it three episodes in a row....just like last season. weeeh! i'm so happy!ü di talaga ako nagsasawa kahit ilang beses ko na napanood!ü and im also so excited to see Carrie's new hair-do on season 5!ü

       spur of the moment KTV.  bebi and i were supposed to watch a movie last wednesday, but because we didn't find any movie worthy to watch, we decided to go to Encore KTV center! hahaha! trip lang! we got the P600 (consumable) room with computerized karaoke. but we exceeded the price coz their iced tea is not refillable. lolz we were there from 11am - 2pm! haha!ü kung ano ano kinanta namin! only shows that we're jologs at heart. lolz   exposure-immersion.  we have to go to a refuge community of indigenous people in Cavite for our theology class. we'll stay there overnight (sat-sun). i'm a bit excited coz this would be a new experience for me. but at the same time, i also feel a little bit scared because i know the place where we're gonna stay is not comfortable, i heard that their water is not that clean and safe to drink, i don't know what to expect, but i guess it would be better for me to just expect the worst. we're gonna leave tomorrow at 6am, and i'll be back sunday afternoon.our transpo would just be a jeepney...imagine...4 hrs travel on a jeepney.  my friend wendy advised me to just take a bath before i leave tom, and then take my sunday bath when i get back home....coz the water supply there is also not that good. these are the things that im gonna bring with me: - toothbrush and toothpaste - alcohol - wipes/tissue rolls - insect repellant - food to donate - my own food (instant oatmeal, nesvita, skyflakes, and nova) - two mini-bottles of ready-to-drink milk - 4 bottles of mineral water

       if i really wanted to be a great friend.  appallingly, four of my closest friends are presently encountering a love problem. as a friend i naturally felt sad for them and i'm trying my best to be a great friend. i dunno if it's just a coincidence that they all asked for my advice at almost the same time (or maybe it's just a season for broken hearts)...i was thinking that this may mean something, maybe God wanted to challenge my being a true friend as well as my sensitivity (or sometimes, lack of) to other people's feelings. I opened my little book,  If I Really Wanted to be a Great Friend, I would...   randomly  and to my amazement the page says:   if i really wanted to be a great friend i would....validate and elevate. pain, unfortunatley, is an inescapable part of being human. sooner or later, each of your friends will walk through a tough time. if you want to be a great friend, you will be quick to offer support. remember, no matter how well you know a person, you can't really understand what he or she is feeling unless you've gone through the same experience. The important thing is to acknowledge and validate their feelings.   woah...sakto! coz i admit that sometimes i have the tendency to assume that i know my friend very much so when she becomes vulnerable, i know exactly how to fix her problem and how to make her happy. when the truth is that all she needs is someone who would give her an encouraging pat on the shoulder.

      bebi visited me today.ü as usual, we just fooled around with my lil bro, miko. bebi had brought pancit and siopao from chinatown (ongpin), so we ate them even if i just had my lunch! (ouch! just realized that i violated my 1st resolution...hehe ü). we went to the village's clubhouse to buy jellytongue, cornetto and choco mallows, and we ate those foods while on the big swing at the park beside our house!ü   when bebi left, my father suddenly noticed my clothes, he said "nakapangtulog kang humarap sa bisita mo?" eh hindi nman pang-tulog yung suot ko...well, pang-bahay...pero nde pantulog. nde nman yun manipis eh. tpos miko told me that papa asked him, or should i say interrogated him with questions like what did marlowe do here? did we ever had a chance to be out of miko's sight? etc. hindi ito yung first time na nangyari yan, just the same...i feel a little bit flattered coz i can see that my father is just being protective of his only girl.ü at the same time, i also feel threatened and irritated coz it seems that they don't trust me that much and it makes me feel cautious of how to act, what to do, what to say, and even what to wear, when marlowe and my parents are around...arrg...i just hate that feeling.  makes me think...at my age and with my present relationship, should i still be guarded? or am i not that deserving of my parents' trust? hmmm...got to figure that out and well...do something of course!

       resolutions? plans? or merely wishes?  i actually don't know how to call them, but these are the changes that i want to happen in my life this year.  resolutions are promises which means they should be kept; plans are goals which should be achieved; and wishes are simply the ones that I want to do but I'm not sure I can(due to some reasons of course).so far, all in all, i've listed 22 things that i would want to happen this year,  urlLink here's just 10 of them.

      my ninang (who recently lost her husband), together with my 3 kinakapatid visited us yesterday. we ate our new year handa for lunch and dinner, the kids (that woudl be us---we're not kids anymore but that's how our parents refer to us) just watched Lilo & Stitch which has the weirdest sub-titles since it's pirated...wrong grammar and spelling, non-sense sentences and everything!haha! after that, we just watched TV, switching channels 2 and 7 (etc. & extra), then the simpsons on starworld and batman (studio 23)...basically that was just what we did yesterday.  oh..and one more thing, before i slept on new year's eve, i promised myself to pig out on the leftovers, without worrying and being conscious about my figure and all, and i actually did! until now... hehehe...i love eating! but i know i shouldn't...i know i would eventually feel guilty again. *sigh* i wish i could just eat anything i want and not gain weight! speaking of that, i remembered i still have to make my new year's resolutions which of course include dieting. Grrr...

       later, im gonna have a job interview with a call center company... this interview was actually scheduled 3 weeks ago pa, i just kept on rescheduling it again and again, coz i really dont want to work on a call center. last night i was deciding again, i asked some people their advice, jun (adriel's bf) said that call centers pay high (and i know someone - a fresh grad -who's being paid 13-14thou per month...thats high na), however, working on a call center makes no room for growth...so he advised me that if ever im gonna work there, i have to make sure that i wont stay there for more than a year...just like what our professor said that call centers are good stepping stone, it gives you the working experience, but it have to be just that... "an experience"...coz as we get older, competition's more tough...and our market value decreases if we just stay on a work like that. so i decided to give it a shot...takot din kasi ako ma-karma eh, baka wala nang lumapit na trabaho...hehehe ü ill go there with sherry, and then hopefully, i can meet up with bebi later since it's in makati also.ü

      ok...so...i dont know how to start...here...ahem...   feb. 14 - my family checked in at edsa shangrila, wendy and jomer dropped by and wendy suggested that we go swimming the next day since it'll be libre naman daw. inaya ko din of course si bebi...and we all got excited...lalo na si miko.  feb. 15 - i met up with wendy, jomer and bebi. mejo nagtampo pa nga sakin si bebi because i didnt inform my parents that he's coming. anyways, when we got to the pool area, we got the attention of the attendant there, kasi si wendy ay medyo nag utos utos kaya yun...napansin kame, and he asked for our room number then told us that only 2 persons are allowed to swim for free, the rest should be charged 650 bucks...hayy...so ending, we didnt get to swim, bebi and i were so like bad trip but we just get it over with by strolling at the shangrila mall with miko. he treated us at kenny rogers. hehehe..my parents were also at the mall so we met up with them...i felt kilig seeing marlowe hanging around with the whole carreon family in the mall! hehe..ü it felt awkward but at the same time it felt funny too...hehe ü  another thing happened this day that made me feel a little bit disappointed. in the morning, i was reading a newspaper article about this girl that allegedly caused kristine hermosa and jericho's breakup, kasi nagselos daw si kristine...i shared the chika with my parents, and they reacted like this:  mama : "ikaw ba, samira, kapag nakita mo si marlowe na may kasamang ibang babae, magseselos ka ba?"  papa: (speaking in general)  "malalaman mong mahal mo ang isang tao kapag nagselos ka, kapag di ka nagselos ibig sabihin di mo sha mahal"  mama:  "oh eh ikaw nga samira, di ka yata magseselos eh, di mo yata mahal si marlowe eh" i was not talking the whole time, i acted deaf...they irritated me so much. made me think, do my parents think i'm not that serious with my relationship with bebi?? arrghh..if they only know...that marlowe's gonna be the father of their first apo! haha! hihihihi!ü   feb. 16 - lately, ive been feeling really pissed off at my brother, harrold. you see, he was not with us at edsa shang...so obviously, he lived like a prince here in the house...na-solo nya buong bahay, ang PC, and of course the Internet. and imagine this, when we got home sunday afternoon, bungad nya sakin "ate, gagamitin ko pa computer ha...marami pa kong gagawin." arrghhh...what did he do on fridaynight, saturday night and sunday morning??? sinong niloko nya na research daw yung ginagawa nya...research na nasa mIRC? hayyy naku...i told bebi na ayoko na sya maging kapatid...and i know myself, when ive finally verbalized that i hate someone (especially those who used to be close to me), that means i really hate him/her and i want him/her our of my life! like when i said to jen that i dont want ----e- to be my friend anymore...totoo yun at pinanindigan ko, kasi di na nabalik sa dati yun friendship namin since i said that. ngayon, yang harrold na yan, ayoko na sa kanya....bahala na sha, basta si miko na lang kapatid ko. ilang beses na kaya kame muntik magbreak dahil ayaw ako pagamitin ng telepono nung baboy na yun! hmp! at ngayon, eto na naman sha, asking me kung wat time daw ako matatapos gumamet ng PC...ah bahala sha sa buhay nya....maghintay sha dyan hanggang kaya nya! hmp! kainis talaga!

       overprotectetd.  i was feeling rebellious these past days, i felt that im overprotected by my parents. i realized that the reason why im not yet ready to step the professional life is that in my age, i still haven't experienced the joy and twists of being a teenager anymore, even if im pass teenage stage - which makes me feel worse. while my 17 yr old bro is having fun going to gimmicks until 5am, take note - with our car, there i was having a hard time asking permission from my parents if bebi and i can see each other and have a date! and apparently, there's a gender discrimination in our home...the reason my father always gives me, "babae ka kasi" ohhh f**k! naiirita talaga ako pag ganyan yung reason na naririnig ko! anyways, i just released what i felt by crying, and imso thankful marlowe's always there to comfort me, he encouraged me to find a job because in time, if im already earning my own money, there's actually no more need toask for my parenst' permission, i'll be free to do anything i want, to buy anything, to go anywhere with anybody i want.ü so next week i'll start applying for companies.    am i willing to work OT?  i have a feeling malapit na ko ma-hire, kaya lang this job's working hours is from 9am-10pm, 6 days a week! do you think i can handle that? err...i dont think i can, especially if i'm gonna be assigned far from our house (mall-based). i'll just check if the compensation is worth the over time.   bonded.  bebi!ü feeling ko sobrang bonded na talaga tayong dalawa! hihihi...ü labyu talaga!ü

       officially bum.  starting today...im offcially a professional bum! hehehe....ü congratulations batch 2003! bebi surprised me with a bouquet of white roses on my graduation last night, tapos we had dinner with mama and papa, kasama na rin sina jen, jomer and wendy sa TGIF. kakatuwa lang...si bebi nahihiya sa parents ko. hehehe ü as of now, i still dont wanna work yet, just want to enjoy my vacation, pero kung may dumating na job na gusto ko talaga, i'll take it na rin.    The 4 C's.  yesterday while im having a hair spa at the salon, i was reading FHM and i saw an article about finding a job, it says that 4 C's should be considered:  1. company 2. culture 3. career path 4. compensation.  the article says that u dont have to take the first company that hired you. think first if you like and know the company well, its industry and of course, if it is legal or fly-by-night. then see if the culture in that company jives with you personality, if the people there are outgoing or they live on a really fast track, tapos you're someone who is introvert and soft-spoken, maybe that job is not for you. decide also if that job/ carrer path is something that you can imagine yourself in 5-10 years from now. lastly but definitely not the least, take into consideration the salary and other benefits. that article really helped me think through of what job i should be into and how to react to the companies which are now calling me for exams and interviews. i really want a job wherein i could enjoy being the real me while using the skills and knowledge that i have.   DNA - So Real.  last friday, erik's (my ex: rhoderick) band had their album launching. it was fun coz i was also able to see my old friends imee and ave. and also erik's family, ate dhang, ron-ron, their mom and tito. tapos shempre, happy tlga ako kasi kasama ko si bebi!ü kasama namin si mama, miko and tito jose. hehehe ü kakatuwa.ü DNA's songs are good, since it's their first album, the type of music is mixed, there are ballads, upbeat and also, a revival "Tears In Heaven" ang gagaling nila kumanta! so please  buy their CD: DNA - So Real ...help ko na yun sa friend ko, hehehe.ü the CD i think, only costs P250, dun sa launching they sold it for just P200 special offer with free autographed poster.ü o diba bongga!? hehehe ü they have a website  urlLink www.dna.net.ph  but i visited it earlier, hinde pa yata up, pero try nyo na rin i-check.ü

       vulnerability part 2.  yes, the more you love a person, the more you are open to pain. but it doesn't mean that you have to lessen your love to that person just to make you less vulnerable to that pain....if you do that, it's not love anymore. love is all about taking risks, you love not because you want to be hurt, you love because you want to spill out what your heart feels. love shouldn't be controlled, it is freely given and not quantifiable. love is not all about joy and pleasure, love makes you willing to feel hurt as long as it is for the betterment of the relationship.

       vulnerability.  I realized it is true that the more you love a person, the more you are vulnerable to pain. Lately, masnagiging mababaw ang luha ko. Evrytime nagkaka-misunderstanding kame, iyak ako ng iyak.....kasi I can’t take the fact the we’re on a fight, coz I love him so much. Pero lately, napapansin ko din na nagiging mababaw nman ang galit nya….konting mali ko, parang galit na galit na sha agad na parang sobrang sama na ng ginawa ko.  kaya natatakot ako kapag feeling ko sobrang mahal ko na yung tao eh, kasi parang dun nagkakaron ng jinx…na the more na nai-inlove ako, the more na nagiging magulo yung situation. Labo. :(

      i've realized that when it comes to love, i am weak. i love easily but it has to be someone who would reciprocate my feelings. if i don't see that in the person i love, i tend to look for it in some other ways...which makes me susceptible to harm and temptation. this is not what i'm used to be. i've become so dependent with bebi because i know and i'm sure that he's always going to be there for me, so sure that if i see a sign of drawback in him, i become helpless, or should i say, rebellious. sadly, i'm not like shancai (i-relate daw ba sa meteor garden?ü), who endlessly fought for her love and never lose hope even if her partner had become weak. but i know, eventually, and gradually, i will be what i used to be. bebi, just please always assure me that i'm yours and you're mine. as i've said last night...sa'yo lang ako kumukuha ng strength...and i'm sorry for depending on you too much. don't worry, i'll stand on my own feet again, and love you back with my own might. forever.

(forgive me for not uploading the pics, really can't find time to do it). we had our brunch there at Leslie's, nice place...we sipped their superb bulalo overlooking Taal, it was a sunny day, but being by the lake made us feel the breeze. the singin' people there at the resto rendered 2 songs for us---because of you and all my life. corny man, i have to admit, it left me teary-eyed. haha! off we went to casino filipino after the 2-hr. brunch...it was my first time to gamble...hehe...beginner's luck daw oh? well, guess i wasn't lucky enough, we didn't last there for more than 30mins, afraid of going back to Manila with empty pockets, we left the casino and went to Starbucks, of course by the lake again...after having chitchat over mocha and caramel frap, we drove back home. It was really fun and it made our bond stronger indeed.    valentines day.  our valentines started feb. 13, i had Holland Tulips delivered flowers to bebi's office, morning pa lang, di na ko mapakali...i was really excited to see how would bebi react to this surprise...around 2:30 in the afternoon, bebi sent an SMS saying "Awww...ang sweet. labyu!" hehe i could just imagine the smile on his face! Inggit daw mga officemates nya sa kanya...hehehe after office, we dined out with another couple, jill and edu (my ofcmates), at Bubba Gump, nabusog tlga kme at shmpre enjoy din. The following day, actual v-day, my family checked-in at Westin Philippine Plaza, but i told them Marlowe and i were gonna have a date that night (since my parents would be at the james ingram and patti austin concert). we were surprised when they invited us for dinner by the poolside of westin (with the acoustic band and fireworks plus free champagne toast), kasama din un bro ko and his gf, so we were six couples plus my bunsong bro, miko. it was really a romantic night for all of us. shall i say, perfect valentines date!   erik santos @ MMK.  thanks people for watching erik santos' lifestory when it was featured at Maalala Mo Kaya. He told me, kakainis daw kasi daming kulang sa story, but it's ok, kasi mataas naman daw yung ratings. hehe so let's keep on watching shows na nandun si erik, coz i know dun magde-depend career nya sa ratings na yun. thanks again!

       share ko lang tong email na na-receive ko, crazy one liners...LOL   #Do you have trouble making up your mind? Well, yes or no? # There are three sides to every argument: your side,  my side and the right  side.  # An expert is someone who takes a subject you understand and makes it sound confusing.  # Many things can be preserved in alcohol. Dignity is not one of them.  # Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.  # Everyone makes mistakes. The trick is to make them when nobody is looking.  # Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm  # If you can't see the bright side of life, polish the dull side.  # When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.  # If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.  # I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder.  # Skill is successfully walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls. Intelligence is not trying.    ...hehehe patawa lang...galaw galaw para di ma-stroke, mashado tyo serious eh! hehehe ÜÜÜ

       i'm back!  grabe it's been sooooooo long since my last blog, and yep! ang dami na nga nangyari! i dont know if i cud log it all here. hehe anyway, before anything else, ang cool ng new layout ng Blogger ha! hehehe me like it!Ü ok, going back...yup, ngcool off nga kem ni bebi, i dont know what happenede, but i guess it was juts normal. i read from an article  "Life, Actually" Cosmo Phils. May 2004 issue , that it's normal to think "My life is going so well, I'm worried that something bad might happen sooner or later". accdg to the article, the obsession with negative outcomes is self-defeating and  ultimately useless . *hehehe* The trick is to focus on the good things that u have, while u have it.Ü kasi when i realized i am so lucky to have a good life (love, career, family, finances, etc.), I felt that i don't deserve such happiness. i thought of myself as someone selfish...so i let go of bebi thinking i was being selfish with him and that time will come that i'll just hurt him. oh yes...i can hear you say, "sam, you're just creating unnecessary problems for yourself!" hehehehe basta, ganun yung nangyari sakin, something must have triggered that realization, pero yoko na pag usapan kung anuman yun, basta impt ngayon, ok na ako...ok na kme ni bebi.Ü  minsan na lang kasi ako mkapag internet eh, dito lang ako sa ofc ngayon. basta i promise, ill try my best to keep u updated, ok? thanks sa mga nagtext, nagworry at nagpakita ng concern nung nabasa nyo un blog ni marlowe. ok na po kme! mishu frends!!!   jen...naemail ko na sayo pics natin, u can reply to me at smc6706@globetel.com.ph   sauman and herbert...congratulations and best wishes! take care of each other and of course, zoie.Ü

      that was yesterday...july 25...i woke up at 11:30am with no thoughts on my head...as in nothing. i knew it was going to be a long boring day, 2 reasons: 1st, i'm aware that im a bum  officially,  2nd,   my folks aren't home...they went out of town, and would be back by late afternoon.  My ordinary sunday: watch ABS-CBN's shows starting from  At Home Ka Dito , then the  The Truth , and of course,  ASAP . It was  sarah geronimo's  birthday, as usual,  erik santos  sang with her. It was quite a short number...at around 2pm, i received a call from erik asking where i was because he said they were on their way to SM Fairview for the mall show, calltime is 4pm and since it's too early, they wanted to hang out first and kill time in my place.  When they arrived, i told them id like to go to the mall show, so ate dhang asked me to take a bath immediately so we could still make chika before going there. After dressing up, i went downstairs and was surprised to see that  the visitors  have been taken care of very well...hahaha! It was hilarious! I need not tell our maid, Karen, what to do, or what to serve...parang nataranta sha, she even cooked merienda (fried banana w/ sugar) for erik! hehehe  Since it was my first time to join the mall tour, erik and ate dhang were protective and worried, erik said to his sister, "ate, ikaw na bahala k sam ha, sayo ko na sha pasasamahin...baka maipit sha eh." ate dhang, on the other hand, gave me pointers and told me stories abt experiences from their previous mall shows.  well...i could say it was an ultimate experience! the reception of the fans was so overwhelming i couldn't help but smile seeing them being entertained and inspired by my friend. erik was actually having a sore throat yesterday, on our way to SM, wish sha ng wish na wag sana sha pumiyok...that's why he was only able to sing 3 songs, pero sabi nya, kaya daw nakaya nya pa kumanta ng maayos kasi nga ang babait ng audience, nakakatuwa daw. hehe. he said that so far, the album sales yesterday was the highest among the previous mall shows, i think they were able to sell around 200 cd's (go! platinum na itoh!), swerte nga daw un pagsama ko eh hehe kaya nakabenta ng marami! nyahahahaha! yuck feeling! haha!  after the mall show, we went back to my place, andito na parents ko that time kaya nkpag-handa rin ng dinner si mama. dito na sila nagdinner tpos uminom pa kame red wine after. yun lang...chika chika...until around 11:30pm, inantok na nga kme lahat dahil sa red wine eh hehe.  being able to bond with an old friend is really the most worthwhile experience of all. Yan talaga gusto ko mangyari while im a bum...i'd really utilize my time meeting up with long lost friends. harhar. so kung di nman kayo mashadong busy, just text me ayt?Ü

        :::saturday, july 17:::    had breakfast with bebi at starbucks katipunan; went home and watched  Kill Bill Vol.2 , and then watched  Kill Bill Vol.1  again (just for a recap of what happened first)...after watching it, i immediately added it up on my list of favorite movies! cool fighting scenes, awesome story of revenge (i actually cried at the ending of the movie, when uma thurman did the  pai mei 5-point palm technique  on Bill to kill him), the pacing is also good..! i normally don't appreciate flashbacks on a movie..it really pisses me off, but with Kill Bill, i really understood the flow of events! in addition to that...hmm...the movie inspired me to be on a diet and learn some martial arts! wahahaha! i already started doing the  taebo  the other day...im gonna make my bebi proud! harhar.  after watching, i took a 1-hr nap to recharge coz i was gonna meet up with my office friends for dinner at  dampa sa libis . the meeting time was supposedly 7pm, but due to unavoidable circumstances, we arrived late! i had a problem with my folks, coz it seemed that they didnt want to allow me to go out and drive alone since it was raining last saturday night, they made me bring my lil bro, miko with me (chaperone--haha). but then bebi suddenly backed out and didnt wanna come too. well, i cried again. =( but fortunately, i was able to persuade bebi to join the dinner. and though we were late, we still enjoyed big time! hehehe    :::sunday, july 18:::    i watched  Dirty Dancing 2 (havana nights) , very sexy movie! i love the dancing and their costumes!!! splendid...!    :::monday, july 19:::    i cleaned my room...and discovered that there's already a devoloping relationship between the dust and my fallen hair strands! as i was looking on the dustpan, i couldnt keep myself from sneezing...imagine this big pile of cotton like assortment of dust and hair strands! the size was like a mini pillow! hahaha ewwww disgusting! hehehe  i also learned that ive got lots of old stuff which i dont use anymore (shoes, bags, clothes)...for reasons like, it doesnt fit me anymore, it's already out of fashion, or simply because pinagsawaan ko na (but all are in still in good condition). bebi encouraged me to put up a  garage sale ...they have neighbors who buy pre-owned stuff. i already gathered up these things and they're all in one box now, and maybe, by next week, im gonna bring them to bebi's place and sell it! hmmm...$$$$$$ hahahahaha!  the movie that i watched today,  Sleepless in Seattle , ok...it's branded as an all-time favorite date movie. the movie was nice, but i have to say, i didt like it. it's very idealistic, i dont like meg ryan's character, i mean it's so unrealistic, how couldyou leave your fiance for someone you havent even met? and meg's fiance, he just let her go so easily, he didnt even cry, he just said "i'm ok, i dont want to be someone you're just settling for." argh! ok...i believe in soulmates and "signs" since forever. but it doenst mean that everything has to be patterned by destiny or by chance! there are times that you have to make a choice, and this is actually most of the time.  meeting someone you're attracted to is by chance. being caught up in the moment is also a chance. the difference is what happens afterwards, if you decide to love a person inspite of all his faults, that's not a chance, that's a choice. even if you know there are many people out there who are more attractive, smarter, and richer than your mate, and yet, you decide to love your mate just the same, that's choice.   "fate brings you together, but it's still up to you make it happen."  we may meet our soulmates by chance, but loving and staying with our soulmate is still a choice we have to make.  enough of that movie...miko and i visted the dentist, nagpabunot sha, and i had prophylaxis (cleaning) plus pasta on two molars. just so you know, that was just my first time to have pasta...im proud to say that i really have strong teeth! hehehe...well, just like the "just-got-out-of-the-parlor" look...i definitely had a "just-came-from-the-dentist" feeling afterwards! haha! fresh breath!!! hahaha! but...i hate to admit this...i smoked after about 5 hours...grrr...my bad. =[    :::tuesday, july 20:::    erica (my ofcmate) went to EPCIB makati for a job interview, it's just adjacent to ucpb, which is bebi's office! so we decided that we 3 (bebi, erica and i) have lunch together. i arrived there 12noon and met up w/ erica first at UCPB bldg. lobby. bebi went down and we headed to  pacific star bldg. , we ate lunch at  food styles , after that, we had coffee at  Patio  just in front of ucpb's bldg. since bebi's gotta go back to work, and ive nowhere to go, and erica...well, she just wants to kill time, we just went to glorietta to watch  Mean Girls ! hehehe it was just another feel-good movie...the story was light or shall i say, shallow, i just enjoyed it coz i love seeing cute kikay girls! hehehe but i would recommend it though, on dvd, not on the big screen, it's fun to watch it if you're just home, couch potato-ing with your girlfriends...a really fun teen flick! bebi joined us after office then ryan (erica's bf) also went there to have a haircut, we met up with him, hang around for a little while, then we left the mall hmm..maybe around 8:30pm.    :::cosmo bachelor bash:::    that's tonight July 21, 9pm at  Temple bar , greenbelt 2...i really wanna go...i wanted to go eversince! 2 years ago, i was still in college, i was not allowed to stay out late...last year, my friends didnt wanna go. this year, well...i dont know..i could invite some of my girlfriends, but bebi won't let me...he told me he'll just put up a  private show  for me and he'll show me what the guys there do. haha! well..that's sweet, but im curious still---haha! Rarrr...maybe next year. *pooof*    :::shoutouts::::    Happy birthday JAM CRUZ! --- july 17  Congratulations to LENG and ARVIN AISPORNA for their newborn baby boy!!!!

      lately, im being sooo unproductive...well..im now a bum, that's what i supposed to be! haha! yesterday, i just watched the tv and two movies on dvd... the terminal  (tom hanks/catherine zeta-jones) and  the butterfly effect  (ashton kutcher)...i liked  the terminal ...nice movie...but i wondered, why does tom hanks always play roles like he's an alien or someone who has to live on his own and improvise stuff like what he did in  cast away ? well..anyway,it's a goodmovie...recommended! i felt good after watching it.  the butterlfy effect ...well, ashton did justice to the role, but...the story...well...it's bad. or maybe i just didnt appreciate it because of all the flashbacks and stuff. well, it's so unrealistic and hmmm...exaggerated. oh, and one more reason why i didnt like the movie...the copy was pirated haha! it was so friggin dark, could barely see it if the scene is nighttime. rarrr.  TODAY...well...bebi was scolding me earlier thru email saying i never listen to evrything he says..coz he told me to run on the treadmill, i did not. sorry bebi, promise i will...im just not in the mood today..harhar...labyu so much! muah! ok so..goin back, i basically just stayed in front of the pc and exchanged emails with my buddies in the office...i miss them so much..that's why im gonna visit them tomorrow before meeting up with bebi..c yah guys!

        The (Ex) Call Gurl in Me     by loviedo http://www.peyups.com   Being able to listen to somebody shouting at you at the other end of your headset, being able to calm him or her down, and eventually putting a smile on their voices is a talent. Having patience to walk somebody through a piece of equipment just by instructing him/her through the phone is another talent. Being able to change your body clock from waking up at night and sleeping while the sun is brightly shining outside is a talent.  "With so much talents that you have, why did you choose to be in a call center?"  Those words have been asked to me as soon as they got hold of my resume and my test results at a call center I landed myself into. Those were also the same words my interviewer (I was considered for a higher position---additional pay but maybe more work) asked me two days before I finally decided to quit.  I stayed there for about four months.  What was I doing in a call center? Let us say curiosity killed the cat and I could not help myself.  I have not heard any of it until four months ago when I accidentally submitted my resume to them through one of the job sites found in the Internet. It seems everybody is in it so why not try it---seems to be the IN thing right now. I needed the money to pay the bills and I needed something to do for the summer.  I have not started with the job yet but everybody's betting I would not even last a month. Some were telling me it was not the job for me. Hah! At least I lasted for four months.   I do not know how to make of it why people do not really sound so impressed if they hear you were from a call center. All they know is that everybody's in there and that it is spreading out like mushrooms all over the metropolis.  People from the call center telling me I have so much talent that they do not understand why I'm staying there---I do not know how to make of it.  Does that mean people in the call center have no talent whatsoever? I beg to disagree.  Do they have this notion of classifying talent as singing, dancing, acting, being able to paint, draw, and sculpt as the only talents you can find here on earth? Just because it is a call center does not mean people there do not have talents.  Being able to listen to somebody shouting at you at the other end of your headset, being able to calm him or her down, and eventually putting a smile on their voices is a talent. Having patience to walk somebody through a piece of equipment just by instructing him/her through the phone is another talent. Being able to change your body clock from waking up at night and sleeping while the sun is brightly shining outside is a talent. Sacrificing your nightlife just so you could work while everybody's having a good time is an amazing feat of self-discipline.  Working for a multinational company and serving a race that is not even your own, I believe, requires a certain degree of patience. How we love to serve other nations, I do not know how much our degree of nationalism is left in each one of us but when I left there everybody thought I was leaving to work abroad.  I am appalled how people there could stay with their job. Some have been there for over two years! I could not understand that one myself so do not ask me why they stay. Maybe the same reason as I had---maybe it was for the money but then again maybe there are those who really love their job. And to say that they have no talent? Please give them some credit. Some of them have degrees like engineering, physical therapy, computer science, chemistry, and biology.  At least I was able to practice my English while I was there since I graduated with a degree in BA Broadcast Communication then these BS graduates would ask me why I was not in the broadcast industry---how ironic.  Or maybe...you lose your talents after staying long enough in a call center? Was that what they meant by that question?  You do have to time all your calls and hope it would average to the number of seconds they set as a standard, in my case it was 6min: 45sec. You would have to sacrifice not chatting and not being able to surf all the time since you have to answer calls. Going to the little boys' or little girls' room is timed at 10 minutes for the whole night. Imagine yourself taking a crap in less than 10 minutes. In my case, taking the crap usually happens almost immediately after eating my biggest meal for the day. For the entire nine hours you have one hour and thirty minutes worth of break that has a designated time when you should take it.  And after work, I no longer spend my spare time with my friends but stay at home trying to make up for the lost sleep I had for the entire week. I no longer spend some of my spare time doing the things I love to do like dancing, writing, hiking, diving, and even dating. I felt so weak that there is no time to go out anymore.  After four months I decided I want my life back. I quit.  I'm back to being a bum. Work, anyone?  And please... NOT another call center.

       i fully admit that for the past 2 days, my attention was all on  Clover  (my minpin). Last night, I actually let her sleep beside me...on my bed! oh my...i can't help it, every time she feels sleepy she'd always jump on my lap and sleep there! and when i try to put her in her cage, she gives me this "paawa" look i just can't resist! so after watching  the sex and the city marathon  on HBO, i put her to bed and tucked her with her blanket...lamigin sha eh.

      Yesterday, I watched   Catwoman   with my family at GH theater mall. Great movie! As what the title of this blog says: skin, leather and whips --- that's what I came for, the action, the stunts, the effects...and not particularly the story. simply for the reason that we all know the stories of this comic-book heroes, hence, we shouldn't be watching it on the big screen if we're after the plot.  Halle Berry  is so hot! I couldn't think of anyone better for this feline character. Plus bonus of more eye-candies: timeless  Sharon Stone  and uber hot  Benjamin Bratt.  The movie is really entertaining, I was never bored. hmmm...I suddenly want a pet cat, and name her  Midnight . hihihihi.    After the movie, I saw my college friend,  Wendy  outside the cinema with  Jomer,  her bf. It got me excited coz the last time we hung out was almost 4 months ago, I happily told them that I'm now a bum (like them! harhar!), so we promised that we'll make "lamyerda" one of these days. hehehe.  ::: HAPPY BIRTHDAY ERICA!!!! thanks for everything...u're such a sweet friend! :::
