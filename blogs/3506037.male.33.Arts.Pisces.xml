      Long past the time that had done him his finest work, an old friend was offered a most unusual commission. A man - old himself, and bent - had thrown his ropes, tied up, and destroyed all his maps. He was going nowhere.  THis man found a cottage and began to empty his boat bit by bit into his new dwelling. To do it he rented a small van and a local lad to help him pack it and unpack it again later. There was memorabilia from all over the world: elephant's toes and emu feathers and hornback shells and it all tumbled out of the boat in the arms of the lad and into the truck. It took three loads because the truck was a wee bit small for the job, but cheap, and no complaints just an observation, they came down to the last load. In it, was a teak fridge, True story, a wooden fridge. the local lad felt it odd. The old man answered the expression:  During the shrimp boom in the Celebes all those years ago there was a lot of money and a lack of trust in the local finance industry. THe shrimp farmers were worried the local currency would bottom out, in the parlance of the times, and sunk all of their rupiah into kitchen appliances. They didn't trust paper money in the long haul, not even if it were green backed and stupid. SO they bought appliances.  They had hair dryers and toasters and microwave ovens, but the really prized appliance was the refridgerator. The only problem in Celebes that day of the year being that they didn't have enough ready power (they used a small generator) to use their appliances. SO the fridges and everything else was more or less just sitting there. It was nothing but stored wealth.  Anyway, with the fact of the matter being that fridges were so vaunted, but yet useless, it occured to one of the shrimp farmers to order a teak fridge from one of the local artisans. All told, it is only a small stretch to go from a useless but potentially useful fridge to one that is useless altogether as a fridge. That being true, the shrimp farmer in question had a teak fridge made. He was very proud of his teak fridge and invited people over to marvel at it. It was a very beautiful teak fridge in a way that you might imagine a teak fridge could be.   The man in our story, with the boat aground and the cottage to be filled, heard about this teak fridge and thought it sounded amazing. He wanted to see the teak fridge. So he asked about it. But it seemed the farmer was away. They all spent a lot of time in Korea during those days because that was where a shrimp farmers would buy his sacks of powdered oxygen which is a stark necessity if you haven't got enough wind powered aerators to keep the little crustaceans full of lung, so as to speak, and not gasping their hours away. So it turned out the fridge owner was in Korea getting his powdered oxygen supplies.   ANd again. ANd again. Whenever this man in our story called to see the teak fridge one of the other farmers would tell him about Korea and oxygen. This took months for our man. But eventually he managed to corner the returned teak fridge owner and forced him at the barrel of a load of liquid expletives to offload the fridge. It was a major coup for a man suddenly obsessed with the whole idea of this fridge.  The man in our story was so eager to find a place for the fridge he loaded his boat and set sail. It was weeks and months at the whim of his own skill and that of the sea before he landed, found his cottage and had his fridge unloaded in the last round of this little van. The terrifying thing though, was the cottage was at the crest of the hill and like the old van that it was it's clutch gave and it rolled aways and the fridge got beat against the back doors and suffered quite a fright.  They eventually loaded the fridge and amid the scowls and the tears of the newcomer and his well-wisher of a lad, and the brandishing of the fridge, it was all  in need of a little repair. And this is where the commission came in and how I came to know of the man with the boat now at anchor that became sorrier each day in that dirty harbour out there.  The commission was to repair the broken hinge and one panel of the freezer compartment of the teak fridge that had come from the Celebes shrimp farmer. The old friend of mine may not be the artisan he once was himself but age gives you a way with minding people. He took a look at the fridge and the sea-farer and never said a word edgeways but yes and the cost of it all. He never asked the wheres and whyfores, just fixed hinge and panel.  This all wasn't so long ago although I believe the man might have died yet, and I drive past the cottage near daily. So I wonder if the fridge is inside. I presume it is. Certainly his boat is gone. Lost in the wheezer that sent Marty Engels boat down too.   I wish I knew more about that fridge though it's a damn shame about the boat. Curiosity is a terrible curse for some.

      It's a fact to be believed at this time, and not mere, that whole towns were once built on boats.  You can read it if it's true, because it's written: during the rushes to gold, when half a village would empty to go looking for the necessaries that would build their futures in another place, they just upped and left boats. Big ones mind, not mine. Just left them at anchor and didn't think about coming back until all was over and the boats were gone.  Storms would pound them, and the wharves would clatter as the boats struck, clatter over and more, and filling the king tides and the streets with deck planking and ropes.  It all formed a kind of storm grid, a flotsam of sensible design. The men saw this, and the few of them that had arrived early and given sack to the gold at the earlier moment watched as the waters returned their foraging, and seeped into the sands and then brining back out to the open sea. Later, when all the gold was exhausted and the rest of the men too, they returned to see the town planning that nature does of its own and the men left abandoned there saw that it had logic.   They were smart men, and hard. They got to it and finished where nature had left off, and the streets were finished with the landfill of their diggings, and those cold and empty tailings were dumped on the carcasses of their vessels and their eagerness. They had the timbers of hundreds of deserted ships, and the words of their stories too. Some men found lamps and tea pots and shovels in the mess and kept them aside as they beat down their pasts and settled there with the sunken ships and abandoned future.  This is written now, but it's what my grandfather told. They were happy men there, and the storms let them be.

      It was hard days back then, before the weir, or you might call it something more. Damn too, It was said. And I lost a lot of boats. They were small ones and they were testy ones, but I loved them still.   The thing is with a small boat, all the curraghs and coracles and baskets wove and tarred, they're a tippy craft. My grandson says he seen them in Asia. I think it was Vietnam. But I don't know who I'm writing this for. It must be myself. That being true, it needent matter, but I think it was there where they had those terrible wars. Vietnam.  I lost a good few of them and improved my swimming but did nothing for my tackle supplies, some of which cost me a load. Too much money to tip, but yet you can't think about it when you swim. The alternative of course is not too long-term. Still, I loved them boats and the spinning tops which bobbed and the feeling of being like a scoop on the crest of a tremendous depth and I think about them boats near daily when I chance upon the idea and I suspect I'll mention them as I die.   My own father talked about potatoes and seaweed and what kept him alive in the hard days back then.  He was dying and there was nurses and tubes and machines and instuments that measured the rate of his departure and there he was talking about seaweed and potatoes. So, I suspect I'll talk about wicker boats one day.

      Back when they cut out cedar in basins of rivers north and south they'd float them down in log jams to the new ports built quickly from the timbers nudging down stream toward them. Once piered and  poled those ports served new boats and big boats and saw Newfies and Scousers and Taffys and crooks. While upstream the men knew about it but stayed there to rip from the forests the great boughs they saw.  One of them they called King Billy and though no one had seen him for twenty years he was thought to be alive and living in the forests where the light of his fire would sometimes flick and his shadow flitted in front of the bullock teams. Archie Compton and Dennis Eves saw him one time they say, while they were digging out a wagon stalled with logs in a river bank turned to mud. The bullock were low snorting and had given up hope of jagging it loose. Arch had loosed the slack of the chains to give them a start and inspire them forward. They always put the dumb ones in the middle and they just followed and grunted in the directions the more wily leaders deemed fit. Those lead animals deflated would send the whole team into depression and the trick was to inspire them.   Like everything in life, belief is the key.  With the slack eaten up and the lead animals at pace and full of confidence that cart unbogged and Arch and Den looked up and seen old Billy the black who'd been in those forests since his birth and the birth of his father and pre that even.  But almost in the motion of seeing him was the sight of his disappearing too. Just the one moment of being and not being and all the while the wagon climbed the hill and the logs eventually left to float downstream and some of them logs onto a ship are probably there in Plymouth or New York even though I doubt it.  There's another story but it's written in wood.

      ah, another thing, I was discussing with Ashleigh the need for group member biogs.  seeing as I am the only person that has met all of you ... or maybe you have all met but are not quite sure of that right now ... I was suggesting that I would write a biog for everyone, but Ashleigh started to twitch nervously at that idea, he'd prefer to write his own and I'm sure that you all would like to too. so write a biog !

      hi Lee - and everybody else - yes we are on american time, I  still  haven't worked out how to fix that. And yes, I do have the cumulative tome. I will do something about it and send it on. PS: the difference between Post, and Post & Publish is this - post just puts your stuff in the box under the box where you enter your typing, and post & publish puts your stuff right up there on the web. You can post to start with, then click the little orange publish button to the far right and that will put your work out there. bye bye, I have to write now.

      thinking that maybe we should send something to  urlLink eyeshot .  Kathy's had a piece published there.  and the eyeshot man is suggesting working on pieces that have already been published, extending the story, and we've had a bit of a go with that ourselves ... think about it, I'm going to work now, bye bye

      There are a lot of really strange words in the "S" section of the dictionary, for example:  sudarium &nbsp;&nbsp; n. (pl.  ia ). &nbsp;&nbsp;St Veronica's kerchief with imprint of Christ's face. [L  sudo  sweat] Quite odd that there is a plural form ...

      Kathy says - "tell Lee to go for it, I'm bogged down with french-related crap at the  moment." (Kathy studies French at UTS as part of the International Studies degree, I think the above quote indicates quite succinctly how she feels about it at the moment.)

      I'm keen to see what Ashleigh's done, but I reckon it should do a full lap of the team before I get it back.  Of course Yolande, Kathy, if you're not game to enter the ring on what will undoubtedly be a classic (yes I mean Penguin Classic) we'll all understand.   I will check out it's progress now ! let me know if I'm up.

      alright - I give up for the short term - I'm trying to put a link to the ongoing project aka no working title at the top of this page, next to the home and archive links but it's just not working for me ... so, you'll have to click through from here:  urlLink no working title

      yes, very sad, just normal words, I'll put up my ultra unfinished projects soon ... meanwhile Ashleigh has added to the very fantastic ongoing collaborative project with no working title. which brings us to the question - who wants to work on it next?  do you want to have a go Kathy?  or do you want it back Lee?  or Yolande, do you want to stop being the founding token member and become a functioning part of a dysfunctional team? it's up for grabs, who ever puts up an expression of interest first, gets the baby.

      hi, sorry, totally didn't realise how to work this page. Just assumed this big blank white space was for some awol banner ad.  Lynn - visited your updated sites and thought they looked good. Especially "a thousand things". Made a note to go to all your other projects too. Have you heard of www.pitas.com? It seems like a convenient blogging thing too, though I'd have no use for it myself.

      my homehwork is to do a re-write on the funeral story (that I was talking about in my bio), so that Ashleigh and Lynn can read it after next week's get together. Maybe also try to start the story that I talked about with A and L, but which makes much more sense in my head than it did on Tuesday.  Feel like I've got something to prove on that front (i.e. I am not a complete nut/ no I do not want to re-write 'sliding doors') about to spend a LOT of time in a van, so will have time to think about these things.

      Yesterday was one of those landmark Writing Group days when more than two people were in attendance. Fantastic. Lee, Ashleigh & Lynn sitting around the kitchen / dining room table rambling on. We all have tasks for next week: I'm going to rough out a couple of assignment proposals - one to do with Wm Sharp Macleay, the other to do with share accomodation ads on King St, and bird watching at Macdonaldtown station. and, I'd also like to get done a couple of responses to books that I'm reading at the moment. I'll let Lee and Ashleigh fill you in about their tasks. also, I've invited two more people to join the blog ... so they may turn up at anytime.

      right, okay I'm steadying myself, I've been reading Sophie Calle & Jean Baudrillard, and, playing with the net, and, drinking a long neck of Cooper's Stout, so, my point is ... today in writing group we discussed, floated, let loose the idea of using the collaborative writing project aka no working title as a continuously mutable vehicle for entering competitions: we missed, (when I say we, I mean myself and Ashleigh R) the deadline for the NSW Writer's Centre competition, but if you know of anything else coming up we can attempt to fit our great work into the specifications.

      bugger - I went to an old blog to copy instructions for putting in a link and I lost the very long and involved instructions that I'd already written - here are the new instructions ... 1. go to the symbol which is to the left of B symbol 2. it looks like a ball and a lying down 8 (what did the 0 say to the 8?), can you see it? (nice belt !) 3. click on this symbol 4. it'll bring up a box asking you for a URL 5. enter the link address 6. hit enter 7. it'll put something into your white space that looks like this:   &lt;a href="http://www.urbanbeast.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   8. do not despair 9. if the code is not where you want it, just cut and paste to where you do want it, or highlight and delete, put your cursor where you want the insertion/link to be and go through steps 1 to 6 again. 10. okay ! 11. breathe in, breathe out 12. now between the   &lt;a href="http://www.urbanbeast.com"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;   you've got to put a word like "code" 13. or in this situation, urban beast, because that's where you go if you click on this link:   urlLink code

      Hey I think we need to spend a little time in Writing Group working on our tenses.  I thought that Lee had got us back into present tense, see below, but when I re-read the end, it kind've skips from present in the 2nd last paragraph back to past in the last paragraph. At least I think we are all on the same page.  Who wants to write next? Tom are you there? or Matt or John? or will I go again?

These noodles were great... a step above your average instant noodles I reckon.  I just found them in the cupboard, they weren't mine and only a month out of date...  product of Indonesia.

      exactly how out of date? one month?  one year?  a day? and what flavour?  I'm presuming that they were "2-minute" style noodles, which they may not have been, they may've been fresh noodles, just not so fresh anymore ...

      I don't think I've mentioned that I'm doing a subject at uni called Writing & New Media, and, it's been giving me gyp.

In fact, I'll admit, that I just re-read it and yeah, I can see that some of the words (verbs ?) in the last paragraph have 'ed' at the end, but I couldn't work out how to get rid of them.  I'm very confused.  I ain't no grammatician that's fer sure. Someone else fix it !   I am eyeball deep in demolition and kitchen joinery drawings, and this, yes, this, that you're reading right now, is the only writing I've done since I got out of the van. sigh.

Why is it that Japanese pumpkin seems so hard, but cooks so quickly? and, Why is it that in Victoria, Japanese pumpkin is not called Japanese pumpkin?  it's a mystery.

      the blog for no working title has been arranged so that you can just add text, what I mean is this: each days updates or furtherances of the story will be stacked below the first edit for the day.  So that the first update will be at the top of the page when you open it, and later edits will appear underneath. however, when you make your update in the "edit your blog" page the post that you've just made will appear at the top.  are you confused? no. good, very, very good

I just remembered that I joined up and so decided to write something. But hey, how do I get to view previous blog messages? I have begun a photo essay on toilets and was wondering if anyone had a strong experience of a loo in a public or semi-public space (if its a loo in a restaurant, does it make it semi-public since they are intended for sustomers only?).

And of course I'm already back on blog.  but i would've been way before this if silly blogger people hadn't decided to not make blogger readable in Netscape, so now I have to open Explorer, which I hate, just toread blogger !  bloody bloody.  Sorry in a bit of a shitty mood today coz I realised that fart arsing around trying to fix up my house earns me no dollars, so I have to work as well.

      Thanks for your suggestions Lynn. No really. The QVB toilets are a venue that I have yet to experience. You are about the third person who has told me about them. I'm definately geting down there! And while I remember, I am definately interested in girlie stories, so don't hold back. Actually, this reminds me of my friend Crazy Tam, who told me she and a friend once spent 2hours in the QVB toilets on acid. They were hanging out, looking at the reflections of their twisted / drug-crazed minds in the mirrors and talking about all the different things that exploded into their conciousness. Tam told me that the party was brought to a startling paranoid conclusion, when the two of them realised that there were CCTV cameras in the toilet area with them. You know, I should be at class with Noel right now, but fate has decided otherwise. I have locked myself out of my high security apartment and now I am at the mercy of my work-aholic sister. Big bummers all round. Lynn, do you think you could write the most interesting bits of Noel's class on the Blogger? I need another secret place for hiding a spare key to my place. Hmmmm

      today is Tuesday - so as well as being writing group day (see previous post) it's Culture Writing & Textuality day - with Noel Sanders. John - you could use the new levi jeans ad for part of your bathroom epic ... (the link here is that John is working on public toilets for Culture Writing Textuality, and what I'm suggesting here John, in case you'd like a little elabouration, is that the levis jeans ad brings the semi private world of the public toilet into the public public world of the roadside, and there's something interesting in there as well about the girls all being the same girl, narcissism, and the slogan which is something about a pair of jeans to suit you ...)

      Okay - I'm getting really sick of seeing my own post about stupid websites that I must have been so bored to put up on this site, that I just have to type a whole lot of stuff, just words really, right now, to get it out of my sight/site, and move on to something else. and, partly the something else is that I now have Wednesdays off instead of Tuesdays, but I think that writing group has died a sad and lonely death, even I didn't attend last Tuesday - I went to work instead. but, if it wants to resurrect itself it probably could, I saw a $70.00 book in Dymocks about writing groups and it could probably go and buy that to get some hints.

      hey I'm back !  ambivalent ? NO ! ambiguous ? Well, I try.... I visited random chicken.  odd.  haven't heard anything lately from my ghost shark/ the woods themselves dudes.  Dude !!! where are you ? I think he's thinking I'm a drag queen e-stalker.  I like it, but I don't want it to get too certain.  Maybe have to hint at my 5 kids, lonely life coz husband is always on the tractor, but always looking for new friends to share scone recipes with. Dude ? are you out there ? Are you reading this ? anyway, lynn, sorry to hear about death of writing group.  i know I'm one of the murderers (by neglect).  I am having a bit of a dry spell when it comes to writing.  Got about 7 new songs with no lyrics so far.  Not panicking yet, but hmmm, I think something has to be done. Read about a new book of Australian poetry in the SMH, which i might go buy.  Also a cd, by a band called centipede, which I heard on the radio (FBi !!! yeah !).  Today is treats for me day, because I owe more money to various plasterers, plumbers, major banking corporations, friends, landlords, tax department, than I'm EVER likely to have, so might as well go buy myself pressies ! Oh, and maybe on the money-in, rather than money-out side of things, I will send my CV to a archi-temp agency to see if I can get some lucrative but probably dead boring work over the summer.

      two things...... I woke up this morning with 'I'm' written on the inside of my forearm.  I know it was a moment of brilliance, so fleeting that I thought I had only time to find the pen in my bag, not also find my book and the page to write on.  So I started to write it, this moment of genius, on my arm. and then realised it was going to take forever to write it on my arm, due to the kinda stretchy sticky nature of that soft skin on the inside of my arm.  Anyway, the point is, I woke up this morning with 'I'm' written on my arm. Linked to that, so therefore a sub-thing, but not the second thing, because that comes later and relates to ghost shark.  But the sub-thing is that there was a column eight story the other day about some kid learning the christmas bullshit at school and coming home to tell her mum about the Baby Genius who was born in the dog bowl.  The dog bowl is just funny, but the Baby Genius is, well, GENIUS !!!  I could see the sense of worshipping a Baby Genius.  I like it. ok, second thing. I sent an email to a few people (yes you were one of them Lynn) about where to get our cd on the net.  And I cheekily sent it Davey of the ghost shark/ the woods themselves.  As you'll remember dear readers, the fella had not replied to any of my recent emails, which may or may not have been because he thought I was a trannie trying to pick him up.  Anyway, he replied to the 'buy the sea life park cd' spam.  The penny has dropped.  Cool thing about that was that he did it via his mum's email account so i got an email from 'Joan'.  I like that too. So no further mysteries there.  Oh well.  Still, maybe he knows who I am now, but I still wouldn't know him from the Baby Genius. It's friday, and I'm a little fuzzy round the edges, from last nights recreations.  But that is quite comfortable and appropriate.  I'm the only one in the office and I'm slowly building a really nice little model and it's rainy and grey.  It all matches.

And the petrol fumes were really getting to me. but hey I saw Meg Ryan and Paris Hilton and Heath Ledger all hanging out at the maaaaaaall....... The la Haine question has been posed and discussed, and the decision is kinda based on whether or not the ashter and I feel like coming back from tasmania to go. At the moment I think we're saying 'yes, we do want to come back from tasmania to see La haine, even though it is kinda expensive for me being a DIY maniac.'  That's what we're saying. But the ashter is in Noo Zulund.  Are you buying tickets soon ? I am demolishing bits of the bathroom today.  I pulled a panel off the wall about an hour ago and about 30 really big cockroaches went everywhere, including down my arms !  That's when I decided to have a bit of a sit down and a coffee and see what was going on in blog world (deep breaths ....!)  But I'm proud to say that the world now has about 15 less cockroaches !  And the survivors are homeless !  I will conquer !!!!!

      yeah - I reckon we're safe - nobody else is reading this - I don't know why you don't see the ads, do you have selective blindness? at the moment the ads are for 1. a service that lets you know when your favourite blog is updated, (why would we want that, we know when our favourite blog is being updated because we are actually doing it!), and 2. the mysteriously named "Global Database Im-Export".  Hmmm, good to see we're confusing google so much that it's throwing up completely inappropriate and bizarre ads, but, nothing for cucumbers yet.  That salad sounds good.  I'm presuming that Calexico is a band?  I know very little about anything these days.

      you know, I don't get ads with my blog.  Why is that ? Well I do when I go to G.S. (those who can't be named) but not here, so I won't even know if I do succeed on my mission to raise the virtual profile of my favourite salad vegetable. Cucumber recommendation no.1 the cucumber salad at Chinese Noodle Restaurant is very very good.  I suspect it is nothing more than crushed garlic (at almost 1:1 ratio to the cucumber) and fish sauce.  tasty though. Cucumber warning no.1 you are going to burp like a camel afterwards so avoid standing in close crowds, like the one at Calexico that I stood in directly after eating said cucmber salad.  Luckily I was standing with my friends and fellow Chinese Noodle Restaurant diners, but boy there must have been a stinky cloud around us !!! Calexico, by the way, were (as Ash would say) AMAAAAAZING. Do you think anyone else is reading this Lynn, or can I continue to rant on like there's only you and I in the room ?

      Yes I agree that it unlikely that cucumbers would be advertising on the net....but who ever thought sharks would be out there promoting themselves ? I am hungry and I'm going to lunch now.   Nothing blogworthy to write...or too hungry to think.

      Good to see that  urlLink g-s  have just woken up to the fact that the ads change according to the key-words used in their text - I think they're trying to manipulate an ad for do-it-yourself PhD's - but not very successfully.  And, I've just realised that you are trying to get us a cucumber up the top, now Lee, I'm not so sure the cucumbers get advertised over the internet, it's not really the sort of thing that is satisfying in a virtual type of way, but we'll see if we get lucky.  Adam Eldridge has is very own PhD which he actually wrote a thesis for, and was awarded with it whilst doffing a floppy hat with tassell, but I'm not sure if he has any cucumber handy 'cos he's in London where the frost is lying thick and sparkling on the ground. (Unsuitable weather for cucumbers.)

      so thanks for coming to the not-really-a-bbq-but-more-like-dinner-in-the-backyard last night. Pity there was no cucumber.  I woke up this morning with a deep regret about the lack of cucumber in the proceedings, or in the meal.   Lovely to hear about Pookie, and great to hear also that you share the same taste in movies.

      You may have "I'm" written on the inside of your arm, but we've got a new dog called "Pookie" - admittedly he is an imaginary dog - but that's good because it means that he can be much bigger than the sort of dog I'd normally get, and he could come to the cinema with us last night.  We all went to see  Mystic River .  We didn't think much of it, in fact, Pookie left half way through and went to the Townie for a couple of drinks.

      according to my dictionary - the Pocket Oxford (reprinted with corrections in 1955) - crepuscular is (L), and twilight is (E), so I'm presuming this means Latin and English respectively.  I could go an oyster right now.

      huh ?  What did the romans have to do when it was crepuscular ?  What was our better word ? Oysters can definately have something to do with it when we re-write the dictionary.  Or pippies. Crepuscular: pertaining to that little blowy, mouth thing that pippies have so they can breathe under the sand.  n. crepuscule. oh, the christmas festivities are tiring me.  I need a nap under the meeting table today.....but it's not so nice since we seem to have lost that ugly carpet sample.  I haven't seen it in many moves actually, and the only carpet samples we have now are about 2 inches wide by 10 inches long.  Not comfy.

<date>17,December,2003</date>

      Yeah - I would never've thought crepuscular meant that - I was going more for the way old ladies skin looks around their eyes, kind've baggy and soft and infinitely folded, or maybe something to do with oysters ... which now that I look up the Pocket Oxford Dictionary I find that it might be to do with oysters in the zoological sense of the word ie being active and etc at twilight.  Now I'm not totally sure that oysters are active at twilight, but I can imagine them getting together for a few drinks and a quiet chat around the hardwood posts down at Towra Point.  Maybe just active when it's high tide and twilight.  Poor Romans having to do romantic things when it was "crepuscular" , thank goodness that the English came up with a better word.  Good on us.

      Crepuscular: does it mean having all the blood vessels showing in your cheeks, like a drunk, in scandinavia ? does it refer to the existence of varying and violently opposed sects within the satan worshipping community ? does it describe the weird jointedness to be found in some succulent plants ? No. It means twilight, or dawn.  That in between light and dark time.    I'm thinking of making a complaint to the Shorter Oxford.  I'll concede that this is what crepuscular means now, but my objection would be based on the complete awkwardness of the word and it's definition.  Don't you think ?

      Calexico is my international business address ?  very interesting. I don't know where these ads would be if I had them.  It must be a PC thing, or a not-Netscape thing. I'm kinda disappointed.

      Ah ha - Christmas Eve, and it is overcast in Sydney.  I dreamt about a satellite falling out of the sky and splitting into two pieces, one piece fell into the sand, and one piece fell into the sea.  Or maybe it wasn't a satellite, maybe it was a memory of the space ships that brought the astronauts back from the moon, because after seeing this thing crash, Melinda Cozens appeared in my dream and I went through infants and primary school with her.  Inexplicable 70's flashbacks.  (And we've scored an ad for  urlLink oysters , Australian Aquaculture that is.)

      hey Lee!  my friend Deborah, (who you met at your birthday party beer and pizza and rain night), has friends called Marina and Tom, and they own a house on Dangar Island, (probably shack is more correct - Marina says it's like a termite mound), just down from the water tower, and apparently Tom has spent ages talking to Matthew about the dinghy, (hey, did you know that's a Hindi word - wow! the things you find out when I'm checking spelling), and Marina spent ages talking to Matthew's Dad ... so.  good luck with the oysters, I was reading Frank Moorhouse on oysters, and he says fresh is best, they keep very well in a hessian sack, don't take it out of the shell until you're going to eat it, and don't, whatever you do, wash the thing, remove grit with the tip of a knife or similar implement, etc.

      god I wish I could see these ads.  I feel rather ripped off. I had a dream last night that I was trying to dispose of a human corpse and two dead puppies.  It seems in my dream world that there was no moral dilemma in this.  It was merely a pain in the arse and I was trying to do it without Ashley finding out.  hmmm. We are on the trail of a very good oyster farmer contact......eg, someone who'll sell us oysters direct from the river.  That will definately be a good thing.  Though I wonder if it is illegal ?  Surely not.  Without a doubt if I find out it is illegal I will NOT be participating in any dodgy oyster transactions ! I aim to start my south west coast walk monologue this week........

      oh Malfi where did you go, you with your legs so long ? you who is so shy Can I lure you with a song ? oh Malfi we miss you so.  Oh Malfi where did you go ? we think you are so sweet we'll intimidate you no more come back on your teensy feet oh Malfi we'll feed you Dog-go bikkies what are the best and though expensive would never be too much to spend for you dear Malfi !  Oh Malfi where did you go ? Are you under a bush somewhere ? Are you shivering and shaking and scared ? with your quivering tan brindle hair ? oh Malfi be brave-oh !  Oh malfi where did you go ? you who runs so fast run back to lynn and tim now ! I promise they won't be cranky Oh Malfi you won't get it better that at Egan Street, and you bloody well know it so pull yourself together girl and escape from wherever you are and bloody well come home, coz though we're not at all angry at you we think, really you should know where you belong and how much you're upsetting your mother and father and probably yourself also, so just get those skinny legs moving and get home, and if you have to ask directions or for help there's no shame in that, or just get in a cab and come here and we'll pick up the tab at this end, or you can ask a kindly policeman or park ranger or just go into any vet you see and sidle up to the microchip reader machine thingy, and though it's against your nature maybe create a ruckus somewhere so the ranger comes and then she'll come and get you and probably it'll be a bit scary and they'll put you in a cage, but it won't be for long because then tim and Lynn will come and get you and everything will be grand again !  (perhaps sung in an irish pub song lament style.  verses can be added ad infinitum. Maybe it needs a bit more work and I guess you'll need to take a big breath to get through the last line.....)

      wondering about the comments ... will they come up?  and, wondering if Tom will get on line with us all and post his stuff again - I've just invited him. and, the new clickier keyboard does calm down a bit, but yes, I too wonder about the designers at Mac/Apple, what are they thinking about, maybe they are droids, and do not think as such, there is a headline in the latest New York Review of Books which asks "do dogs think?" and I think that the answer is very much "yes!" but what are they thinking about?  other dogs, food, crazy people, living in houses, and living outside of houses, that strange indefinable thing that seems to be somewhere to the back of me, could it be my back legs? or is it an enemy? food, food, food, sleep, other dogs, food, sleep, running.  etc.

Anyway this new computer has much clickier keys.  They require marginally more definitve moves in the typing department. but feel, good, kinda expensive, like the sound of a nice camera taking a photo. blah.  I am setting up all my bookmarks and shite over again.  people tell me it's easy to transfer these things..hmm, right. I have a cold. I have a new computer. I have no idea what I did with the email i sent to Lynn a month ago about websites and stuff. I am studiously avoiding making the changes I need to make to the drawings I need to finish. I have 2 new cds, which I got for free ! I am going to try to get going again with this blogging stuff.

      On the day of my mother's funeral I was very tired and sleepy. The world was heavy beyond my eyelids.  Nobody danced for me on that day. The funeral director's car drove me to the incinerator, I wanted to stretch out along the back seat and rest.  There was nobody else there. Beyond the trees beyond the field strung with low walls dotted with plaques and rose bushes too neatly kept a crake called from the marsh.

      Is it, I ask you dear readers and fellow contributors, Is it better to have read the newspaper and be pissed off, cynical, distraught, humiliated merely by being a member of the human race, not to mentioned lied to, or at least considered too reactionary and stupid to actually be given truthful and full accounts of our atrocities against ourselves, or to have not read the newspaper at all ? That, is my question. My other question is, How many idioms or quotable/famous lines must a man/woman walk down before he/she can call himself/herself a literary fraud? on another note..my friend and fellow tutor hannah, got some (anonymous) feedback from a student that started with 'He/she provides good critical analyses of my work', or something.  Isn't that great ?  He/she !  Do you think that could be the finest example of 'not paying attention in class' or what ?

      In the event of a good line occuring to anyone, but insufficient energy to effect a narrative of however dubious quality, I think it should be prefaced thus:  I was reading a quality Entertainment magazine at the checkout of Stop N Go Mart the other day and I saw this marvellous quote by -  Brian Eno. He said. "I used to eat a lot of Cashews but then I learnt that they eat the hands of the pickers. Poor fellows"  Sample only, do not requote.

      Nothing to be done.  You know what would tickle me? And selfish as I am I'll express it here amongst friends and romans: I'd like a site full of cool-ass quotes. Anything you've read recently with a killer line. I think a blog full of killer lines would be awesome. Perhaps the lines could be used, attributed, and messed with: re-constituted.  I'll have a go.  It was a cool winter day. A freckled breeze in the leaves of the trees, but nothing more. In the carport two members of the body corporate were arguing about waste recycling. One of them said it was a crying shame that glass bottles were thrown like that. How much energy goes into a bottle? One said.  There was a joke to be had there, and it involved Brendan Behan and Dylan Thomas pissing their creative juices up a brick wall. I presume they didn't get above waist height, though both would have tried.  The two body corporate members disdained the joke. It was irrelevant. The joker was not on the committee and they resumed their argument. But what can I do about the glass situation? The previously silent member said.  Something! The other said.  What?  The argument was going nowhere.   Something. If something had been done along time ago we wouldn't be having this argument.  Even if you are right, that's a pathetic argument.  It was getting personal.  Look, a final indisputable argument. What can be done, will be done.  It was William Faulkner. The past is not dead and gone, he said, it isn't even past.  You piss me off. Go fcuk yourself and your pastimes too.  There was nothing to be done. The body corporate wasn't meeting for a week. Their argument had lasted years. It was big enough to be tropical.

      hey, well hasn't his royal curachness upped the ante (whatever that means).  it seems now that after umpteen blogs that could be summed up in one big 'ummmm, what to write' we now have some text.  We have some content. Refridgerators. The other thing is, that there are ads.  Tom you probably haven't noticed this yet, but there are ads and they somehow adjust themselves to the content of the blog.  So with all this talk about fridges, we're bound to get some link ads coming up about fridges..or teak..or sandwiches.  All would be pretty cool. I don't know if I have fridge stories.  But here is a list: All the fridges I've loved before,  The Reef Blue Galmet fridge:  Tom you know this one.  Characterised by it's almost complete shelflessness, causing us to stack things up in the bottom.  This resulted in random leftovers in cold hard breakable porcelain bowls falling on your feet when you opened the door.  Of course everything HAD to go on the bottom because the rest of the space was permanently stacked with unidentifiable condiments.  Hundreds of them.  The galmet was to hem in the rust, and was inpired by my friends Sasah and sara who painted their fridge with blackboard paint.  very useful as a message board.   The Smallest fridge in the world:  is an adventure zone like no other.  I have one word to say for that fridge...burly.  You must watch out for the burly. The Sensible fridge:  Lynn and I have the same fridge.  We are sensible people.  it's not small, or large, or blue. and it has a freezer that works.   Mum's fridge: also an adventure zone.  But always has chocolate and cheese by the tonne and a number of things that may or may not be dog food.  The dogs easily eat as well as the humans in that house....Truly, lamb shanks for an elderly blue heeler and a demented dalmation !   Jeffrey and megans fridge:  cool in all ways.  Glass front, commercial fridge, double doors.  So noisy it has to live on the verandah. enviable nonetheless. I would love a teak fridge.  Sounds like something Jumbo PLane would do..customise his fridge by laminating some esquisite timber veneer onto it.

      Just looking at all of the recent posts which seem to chronicle a mutual ineptitude that I think is encouraging. But anyway, like a child acrobat, here I am. Da-Da!  Being a blogger novice I hadn't realised that blogs have themes, is it a bit like .. umm .. is it like ummmm ... is that 'cos there is a readership? Sorta like if Home Beautiful suddenly started filling its pages with Motorcars. Is it because it might confuse things?  Cos, if so, I suppose I'd better read deeper back across the posts to get a feel for CutWrapCrash .. but it sounds good. Like a sandwich violently expelled from a schoolbag. CUT WRAP CRASH.  School anecdotes? Hard Days From Memory. Strange Episodes that involve sandwiches... Ok.  I remember listening to some shrimp farmers in south Sulawesi that Suddenly got rich and didn't trust banks so they stored their money in Electrical appliances. They had hair dryers and toasters and microwave ovens, but the really prized appliance was the fridge. The only problem being that they didn't have enough ready power (they used a small generator) to use their appliances so they were more or less just sitting there, nothing but stored wealth.  Anyway, cos fridges were so vaunted, but yet useless, one of the farmers ordered a teak fridge to be made from one of the local artisans, It's only a small stretch to go from a useless but potentially useful fridge to one that is useless altogether as a fridge. So he had a teak fridge made. He was very proud of his teak fridge and invited people over to marvel at it. It was a very beautiful teak fridge in a way that you might imagine a teak fridge could be.   I'd heard about this teak fridge and thought it sounded amazing. I wanted to see the teak fridge. So I asked about it. But it seemed the farmer was away. They all spent a lot of time in Korea, because that was where all the shrimp farmers got their supplies. After a few unsuccesful attempts to see the teak fridge I said to one of the farmers that I was disappointed about not being able to see the fridge, given that it was made of teak and he replied that yes, it was a disappointment because inside it - and this was new ground for me as I'd never stopped to wonder about what was inside the teak fridge - he kept many sandwiches.  I remember that. Many sanwiches. Not just one or two, but many,  Wow, what a fridge, The one thing I never wondered at the time was why they never bought a bigger generator.  I hope you've all got many stories about fridges too. You google "fridge" and there is not nearly enough quality literature on the subject.

      I've chosen a new template for this blog. It solves the problem that I was having with the comments and it looks better.  Thankyou Douglas Bowman (Douglas designed this template and very many other beautiful templates.)  Also swapping over to this template answers my question about profiles for different members, they all come up down the side, just click on the name. Nice.  So, where to  now?  What are we going to use this blog for now that its been re-invigorated? Is it going to be a writing and reading blog? A chatting about words blog? A doodling blog?   Will Tom ever work out how to get on to the blog, will all of the other members ever come back? (I should email them ...)  Stay tuned for the next exciting installment ...

      so, i was walking along and i got this call. people were having a birthday party at the gramercy. the women had gotten off of a two 14 hour day video shoot for avril La-whatever teen mall goth-punk it turns out they are responsible for her eye make-up and greasy hair.  should have given them a good talking to, but i was under-dressed and humbled. plenty of vodka did get consumed, and i was not alone. i got fixated on this hipster who looked like he was wearing this god-awful hairpiece. there was some stuff about gay liberties to touch "titties" and staid resentment at their own limitations in that department. spanking and biting and polaroids developed. around 3 or so it became quite a scene with multiples of skinny, greasy haired, poorly washed boys in hats. that's when i heard my Rob companion (me being rob also) proclaim most regally, "Too many sausages at this fest!" with that and my robness, i was swept without harm from the hotel, washing up safely upon the sidewalk 16 floors below.

      Makeme, I read your posts as Rob, cos it was a new name, and I wondered why he was listening to a  midget jewish woman lecturing in shallots about architecture. But still, in a Rob way, it seemed to make sense.  I've just read Easy Riders Raging ..he he he I just worked out i can edit everyone elses Posts and vice cersa I suppose. And this is sneaky fun coz I can shove stuff in here and see if you're re-reading your own posts to see how mentally unstable you were the day before, like I do...Bulls, and amidst all the incredible stuff in it I think I like the story of William Friedkin (director of french Connection and the exorcist) who's film (Sorceror) has also I could fuick up all your speling just gone overbudget by something like $20M (ORIGAMI A $10M film) and the studio execs call him in for a meeting. He arrives with two mates and all three are dressed as motor mechanics ("I wanted to show utter disrespect to these people"), orders a bottle of vodka, drinks his way through it, and falls off his chair as the execs explain the changes they'd like to make.

      hey you clever linkerers, if I was asclever a linkerer as you lynn I'd give you a link to gravestmor.com which is my mate Marcus' blog.  he's an archinerd.  funny fella.  worth a read.  he may, at this very moment be reading this blog.....there's some weird ironic (but ultimately pretty lame)  film script idea in that don't you think ?  Charlie Kaufman might be able to make it interesting, or it could limp its way towards sleepless in seattle.  Whatever. I also saw Beatriz Colomina talk last week (like Marcus).  No doubt she's a clever lady....but shallow me, all I got out of her lecture was that the Eames had once upon a time applied for jobs as clowns and that there are some spectacularly funny words in her vocabulary... like ;multiplithity, attenshe-own-e defithit dithorder and a number of sounds that must have been a word (like i said she's a clever lady) but made no sense to me, just decorated my aural thpace like a novelty hat.

      For some reason I imagine Les with a round of fencing wire, ambling along with his fat calves chubbing out between the cuff of his shorts and his boots.  Maybe he's thinking about the fence and boundaries and the lines the establishment want to draw between themselves and the bumpkins in the country. Those damn elites, he's cussing as he sees the fence and the metaphor and the delapidated possibilities he might  turn it to.  An image, he thinks, is a description shaped by an inner intent. "Living in dailiness, a simple bread"  Ah, Les thinks, Judith Wright was good before she got all pink and green.

      yesterday I dug ditches all day. more like a trench, but i think a trench by definition is straightish. maybe a moat of sorts, or a gully. probably not a drill or a trough. not sure what distinguishes a furrow from a fosse. but whatever it was it was a load of dirt.  To give you an idea, this woman applied for money to rip out her sod (sorry, this is not going to be a romantic posting) and replace it with mulch and native plants of the Midwest. Course the problem comes up of what do you consider native? Prior to Europeans, Prior to the asiatic spread, prior to Moses?  but I digress. The thing looks like a waterpark. The ride you tube. (out here people talk about the sport of tubing. That's when you sit in an inner tube, rope off a six pack and float around a lake or down a river. Never ones to miss a chance to exercise, these Midwesterners might bring along buffalo wings and a nice ranch dressing.)  All of this has been inspired by digging. and doing the digging in a land locked state with only mountain dew to sate my oceanic desires.  perhaps I should reply to the email from nice old Miss Ester Buch of Malayasia. She's looking for a good christian individual to take her 8.6million dollars when she dies, so her husband's non-christian family can't get it, being that she is without child and to use that money to help with christian deeds. Seems legit. I figure the first thing would be to hook myself up with a top of the line tube, a broad brimmed hat, two cases of canned beer and float down the Mississippi proselytizing.  as for my immediate plans, i'll finish icing my back, drink my coffee and head back to the digging spot.

      I just wrote this a moment ago and pressed "Posting" rather than "Publish Post" and it disappeared. It must have been too close to reality in the Schillerian way, say:  "Der Schein soll nie die Wirklichkeit erreichen, und siegt Natur, so muss die Kunst entweichen."  This was translated as: The appearance should never reach reality and if nature wins art must disappear.  Which I don't properly understand, so I'm throwing it to question. I read it as - the created object/ thing should never too closely resemble that in nature, and if it does, then there is no room for art.  That art requires a certain level of abstraction to live and prosper.   Anyway, I think I like it. My post though was about The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, which I saw today. It had a line that I really like. Pete's just been rejected for having a rough head, great for radio, by various casting agents. He's upset but reflecting on having wife-kid-radio gig, and should be satisfied with this. He mentions this to his very ambitious mother. Mum says: "But Peter! I didn't bring you up to be content!"  I'm hoping to post this now, contentedly, with the extra quote to console me.

      well ain't there a lot to learn !  here's what i learnt lately. 1. some people actually edit their posts before they post them.  Some people don't just blah their way through the latest and greatest inane thought and then let the world read it.  Wow. 2.in london, people buy fish sauce in vials, like 30ml bottles like what you would buy food colouring in, and half of everything in the supermarket is labelled 'organic' but all of it it is packaged to the death.   3.there was a rector William de Hillum at the church where Ashley and I are getting married.  Unfortunately he did his stint around 1308 so won't be the vicar in October.  weird huh.  I like TJ.  He reminds me of another funny blog thing that was called Mixerman.  it was on a sound nerd website, and he would write in telling about his day working with fucked up rock stars and their tantrums and coke habits and basic stupidity.  very very amusing.  Today I walked through the village green to the church and back.  Apart from that, eating(English pork pies), reading (Cloudstreet, again) and poking Ashley (ha there's very soon going to be a no-pokin' rule I think) to try to keep hiim awake.

      I'd driven 395 Kilometres of a 408 kilometre journey, then: entrance (stage/car) right! Bang! There was just a moment when I could see it looking in my direction with a kind of "that's very weird" look on its face. Then it was sucked under the car. Kaboomumumumumumum, rolling under the car. I hitched the final thirteen kilometres into town and got a tow truck driver for the car. "Mate", he says to me, "you were goin too slow." "I was doing about ninety" I said "Too slow. My missus has hit a few doin ninety, and I know people doin 120 and 130 hit em. But you go at 100 and you never hit em. Never. Guaranteed. I've told the wife that. If you're goin less than 100 they catch up to you, if you're goin faster you catch up to them". I forgot to ask if that was specific to Eastern Grey's or whether it holds true for Reds as well.

      this morning in Victoria Park we came upon a wondrous piece of paper, A4, spangled with dew. Tim stopped to look, mostly because of the bedewedness, then I started to read what was on the paper. It is a print out from an online discussion, and it is primarily an  anime  soccer club theme song.  I won't quote it all here, but will give you the refrain as it is very stirring:  YOU GO ON CRUNKY The heroes who defend the taste of chocolate When the day of battle comes You cannot fail YOU GO ON CRUNKY With legs like a blue wind Look toward the future For courage and the taste of chocolate, Crunky ... Winning Your Days, Goal Up!  Yes, indeed.

      Ah, Lee. It must be rather interesting to be in a country in mourning over the death of Euro 2004 hopes of glory. Shame Beckham. Empty Vassell. I can already see the headlines.  In case of fire, leave the city.   I've seen that Great Fire of London exhibition at the London Musuem and the one thing it teaches you is that fire is indiscriminate and bad. Fire is an evil in the world that is very happy to envelop the good christians of London. ALthough I did think it was rather unfair that they put the wrap on Mrs Haythornethwaite of InnerThigh Elephant & Castle who they claimed had let her chip lard catch a curtain. Forensic Fire Investigation can't have improved much in these few hundred years.

      I went to visit my Grandad at his old folks home yesterday, to tell him my news and make sure he has enough Extra Strong peppermints and Licorice allsorts. We got talking and one of his girlfriends there (he has two, being in the lucky position as a fella of 98 of having lived beyond all his competition) asked me how in the world I intended to get my next film produced. I said I didn't know and it would - of course - be difficult.   "Well how can we help dear?" she asked with great intent.  I'm not sure, I said, but I'll put my thinking cap on.  "Oooh!" said my grandad, very impressed, "have you got one of those?"  I'm still looking for it, I said, but there is one around.  "Oooh, you're lucky."  Paying no heed, the girlfriend impressed on me her credentials in helping. "Now dear, we have an awful lot to give ... if you can just point us in the direction of helping you.." She drifted off, then came back with: "because it is very important for all of us that we do help. Isn't it dear?"  Okay, I'll think hard about it. I said.  "Yes, you do that."  There was a brief pause into which my grandad inserted: "He's got a thinking cap!" Having a good laugh to himself.  "In the meantime", my grandad's girlfriend contined, "and this might sound a little bit obscure..., but the best thing for it is if we get down on our knees."  Oh, I said. Confused.  "Yes, dear, we all could do with a little bit of help and it seems that all there is for it is to get down on our knees and pray."  Oh.  "Leave it with our lord."  Oh.  "With our lord, dear, we all can do with a little bit of help. Isn't that right dear?" This time addressing my grandad.  Gradad was still grinning. "But he's got a thinking cap!"

      My friends Ben and Amber got married this weekend. Such a cute young couple, but then again people marry pretty young out in these parts. The wedding was a private affair, but friends were brought together at the Orluck residence out Maplegrove way. We arrived late, as is our want, and the event was in full swing. All that standing around inspired me to interact with the few people I sort of recognized. There was this red haired Charlie Brown extra who had asked us to leave an afterbar a few nights earlier. Being that is was his house and that thirty people showed up after the bands finished, I figured he had a right to ask for some peace and quiet at 3am. So I introduced myself and apologized for the flash party in his living room. He was fine, although still quite weird. Moving on in our chat, he asked how I knew Ben. I blah blahed about it and turned the table. How do you know Ben? "Through Foxfire" he replied. Well, I was excited to hear that they were superheros together, but it turned out to be a hip rocking christian fellowship group. Now having nothing against hip rocking christians, I rolled with the news. My friends had let some beliefs drop in the past, but the hipness of the new rocking christians is that they don't preach. Instead they rely on the power of backdraft. Still, there was more beer and the main courses were being served. I arrived at the bar while the bartender was talking with his friend. He had wrap around sunglasses and a late night attitude. Asked what he had been up to, he respoded: "Worshipping....worshipping....just worshipping the Lord."  I ordered a Newcastle.

      Thanks for all the fish.  By "literary landscape" I meant the way writers in Australia have described the country, the landscape. That in Lawson and Paterson I think it was little more than a great set, a stage on which human dramas played. It was "the vision splendid" for the Banjo and for Lawson it was an "agony of scrub and wire fences". There wasn't a great sense of regionalism, just outback. And whatever that meant to the writer.  So, I want to talk about the way the words we use to describe 'Country" have changed over the last hundred years and more. I want to see how we have claimed country, imaginatively, so to speak.  I remember reading about an old fella in the Territory who watched the pioneers:  Whitefellas just came up blind bumping into everything and put the flag, put the flag

      "Dear John,  I wish to thank you immensely for your kind interest to co-operate with my family on this transaction and our willingness and support to assist us in this transaction. Please, find hereunder the details of the transaction for better understanding. This transaction is real, and one hundred percent risk free and does not relate to any breach of law or proceed from drugs. It is a matter of necessity for us to contact you for this transaction. It is therefore necessary that you tell me a little about yourself. I hope you would not betray me."  I've been doing some reading myself these days. so what if it all comes as junk emails. I figure, i want to be a part of the world around me; investigate something; see where it can take me. It's the old trixie beldon/hardy boy syndrome. I doubt Mr Jang is a great Australian author, so I won't suggest he be included on the list, but I doubt that he is the former Korean Minister of Finance that he proposes either. Still, I thought I should contact him about a business proposal that he so generously proffered me. To be fair, he is not the first person I have contacted about said business. I received two similar requests from the Soloman Islands and Liberia, both involving relatives of mine. Since both messages were sent from French accounts, i thought it would help if they knew others were in similar situations. Who knows, maybe they could help each other out. So I emailed wach the other;s request. Haven't heard back from them. But Mr Jang wrote back. He's sweet. maybe a little shaky with his english. Seems as if he had the messages translated by a colonial magistrate, oddly wordy. Still his heart is in the missive. Mr Jang never insinuated that I might keep all the money myself, after it was transferred to my account. And I am glad to know that the money is not drug related. I would hate to get mixed up in something scandalous. Mr Jang and Family. I have so many questions about my new pen pal. What does he look like? Is there a Mrs Jang? How many kids in his "family" and what are their ages. Maybe Mr Jang is my age and we can take in some gof when we meet. Or perhaps Mr Jang is old, but he has a foxy daughter. Where do they live? Do they have a hot tub? Boy, I could sure use a hot tub. Well, I'll just write old Mr Jang back. He requested my phone number so that he can call once his satellite phone is up and working. I'll email him a list of questions so that we do not waste his satellite minutes. Those phones aren't cheap.  It is just like christmas.

      What do you mean 'landscape'.  That these people are actually writing about landscape ? I ask because I think you could include Puberty Blues (kathy lette and someone else) in the 70's. What about Bruce Chatwin..was he an australian, or an expat englishman ? Frank Moorhouse is good.  Tim Winton (finished cloudstreet by the way, and then gave it to my future brother in law to read....he laughed a lot and asked a lot of questions like 'what's chiacking?' ) Germaine Greer ? ah I don't know.

      I'm trying to do a feature for Radio National about the Australian literary landscape and how it has changed since the writing of the 1890s.  It's an interesting task: Who are the most significant writers of an Australian landscape consciousness? If we start with Lawson and Paterson in the 1890s .. who's next?  Miles Franklin in the early 1900s. The new nationalists like Xavier Herbert in the 30s. Poets like Judith Wright, Robert Gray and Les Murray. Populist writers like Ion Idriess. Any ideas people?  I like this poem of Philip Hodgins - Midday Horizon  ... A big mob of sheep is moving to the left breaking up and catching up in slow eddies like a lava flow. Seen through the hot distorting air clear flames seem to be tearing off the mob. A man is walking sheep-slow behind them. From where you are  his shape is continually being modified as if he were walking through different dimensions...  The man stops and a low piece of him draws right away this time. It must be a dog.

      The Guardian is running a  urlLink short story competition  - 400 words - due 23 July 2004.  I reckon Curach's roo story is a goer,  Mr Jang might get a look in, and, perhaps the English penchant for condensed fish in small bottles may be appropriate material.

      After some kind words from Curach, I decided to take my relationship with Mr Jang to the next level. I felt that Mr Jang was not being totally honest with me. In fact, I had a sneaking suspicion creeping around my laptop that his missive was insincere. I wanted our relationship to be stronger, more familial. Considering the work I was going to put into this transaction, I felt he should invest some part of himself in our communications. So, I fibbed. "Mr Jang", I wrote, "Your email came through all jumbled. I am eager to be of assistence (note the 'e' in place of 'a'), but I could not understand your instructions. Please email me again when you are able. john" I worried that Mr Jang might be upset by my computer naivete'. I check my account every hour. Two days later, I gave up. This internet is fast, but it is also vast.  Then it arrived. All in capital letters.   "DEAR JOHN,  I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS TO ASSIST ME. I HAVE TO BREAK DOWN THE DETAILS OF THE TRANSACTION HERE.  I WANT YOU TO LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CAN TRAVEL TO AMSTERDAM IN EUROPE TO HELP ME CLAIM THE MONEY FROM THE SECURITY AND FINANCE COMPANY WHERE THE MONEY IS PRESENTLY LODGED. AS SOON AS YOU LET ME KNOW, I WILL GIVE YOU THE CONTACT OF THE SECURITY COMPANY SO THAT YOU OPEN UP COMMUNICATION WITH THEM.  YOU SHOULD SEND ME YOUR IDENTIFICATION( A SCANNED COPY OF YOUR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT OR DRIVERS LICENCE) SO THAT MY LAWYER CAN PREPARE THE POWER OF ATTORNEY WHICH MAKES YOU THE SOLE BENEFICIARY OF THE FUND.  YOU SHOULD SEND THE IDENTIFICATION BY EMAIL ATTACHMENT.  I WAIT TO HEAR FROM YOU.  BEST REGARDS,  MR JANG."  Amsterdam is so far. But Mr Jang seems closer.

      Last eve I was want to take in some suds. Fermented hops and all that. Trouble is, for all the Midwest has to offer (ie: incredibly cold friggin' winters), it also has a short but humid summer. This being it. So, I hopped on my bike and headed down an empty and heavily patrolled Franklin Street. Straight through the largest urban reservation in the country, under the interstate overpass and down to the Triple Rock Social Club. Just what you might expect from a punk rock/dirty grey tall bike crowd. Tattooes as far as the eyes can see around the wild hair and frog bellies.  Tuesdays being "Two fer", it had a decent turn out. Nothing heady occurred. The wait staff acted pissed off: "Hey no dancing. this is a punk club, asshole." "Hey don't sit on the pint glasses, asshole." "Want a vegan burger, asshole?" The A/C helped and people got drunk. I only had six bucks so I nursed two boddingtons, chatted, avoided eye contact and stunk from my sweaty ride. I have rarely overheard much quotables in this town. Maybe I don't listen well, or maybe the passive agressive space hording keeps people pretty much out of earing. So I take my clues about these foreign people from their writings. No, not the alternative press. The toilet wall. So retreating from a bald guy, tats in a basketball jersey singing along with Easy E and NWA I relieved myself. Ah yes, the future written in marker for the archeologists to decifer. "testicles are gay!!!"

      I was staying with my brother last week, up north. He's living in a van on the land of a fella who was twenty years a councillor of the local shire. He was also a cab driver during that time, so it's a fair bet he knew everything that was going down in the town.  He had a lot of stories to tell, and one of my favourites was to do with the local bill on legal brothels. Certain councillors were arguing as if it was completely abhorrent to consider the possibility of a brothel in the shire, while our taxi driver was professionally acquainted with over twenty of them in their illegal form.   "Course there's brothels in the town already, you silly bugger.." He was in the process of telling us, in the vein of language he'd used in council five years earlier as a town councillor while discussing the bill. "I've been dropping people off at them for years..."  Mid sentence, as we were being led through the passage of the bill in council years earlier, he grabbed the door frame and a huge exhalation of air passed through him. For several more seconds he clutched the frame and struggled to grab his breath.  "Jesus Christ!" He said, his face returning back through the hues of red to his usual ruddy pink, "sorry about that." Breathing deeply.  "One thing's for sure, if you're sitting on your arse driving cabs for twenty years, you're gonna get a panful of haemorroids."

      I made up nine people today.  I had to write a brief for uni, and got all creative......could be a very bad thing, but I had a lot of fun. I've copied it in here.  THE CLIENTS Two families are choosing to build a place to retreat to, together.  So, whatever it is that they are in retreat from, it is not each other.  It may be themselves, or their everyday lives.   It may be traffic and deadlines or it might be drought and loneliness.   Meet your clients, (with apologies to the opening scenes of Amelie.)  Michael, Penny, Christian and Samantha are a Sydney family. They are a family unit of two parents, and two teenage children.  Penny works as an executive at an investment bank.  She is interested in rocks, David Lynch films and folk music. Michael runs his own natural therapies business.  He watches every game of soccer that is broadcastand supports Arsenal, but in general hates television.  He reads biographies, primarily of world leaders (Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi) and artists (Rothko, Donald Judd).  Christian plays soccer and surfs.  He likes William Gibson novels, keeps an online blog, prints his own t-shirt designs and is mortally afraid of spiders.  Samantha hates everything, except PJ Harvey, No Logo by Naomi Klein and the sound, feel and smell of rain.     Dave, Eleanor, Rowan, Megan and Kirrily are from Orange in western NSW.  They  farm a small acreage that has been in severe drought for three years.  This is the third such drought Dave has seen, having been brought up in the area.  Eleanor however is not at all used to such long periods of no rain having grown up in Malaysia.  Eleanor is a lecturer in Nursing at Charles Sturt University.  Dave grows grapes and wheat and runs sheep and Wagyu cattle for export to the Japanese market.  He likes the feeling of heat coming out of brick and stone after a hot day and  leaves all his favourite foods til last, at which point hes often too full to eat them.  Eleanor likes Capability Brown and Japanese gardens.  She likes cooking and gardening and telling jokes, but always stuffs up the punchline.  Rowan is twelve.  He likes eating and tries to do it as much as possible.  He prefers running to walking and worries that the world is going to run out of water.  Megan collects insects and likes painting.  Her favourite colour of the moment is red, especially when combined with yellow and purple.  She is so over Harry Potter and is now reading Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.   Kirrily  likes the Ramones and Bob the Builder.  She is 4.

      Wed gotten sick of the sixties rock in the glove box of Dads car and so for the last hour wed been listening to an audio book of Animal Farm. We listened quietly, every now and then remarking something about Orwell, politics, or the severity of the drought that left the country all yellows and browns.  	Dry as, My cousin said at one point. 	The dusk was coming down and some of the early adopters were beginning to use headlights as Major offered a point to be settled. 	Comrades," he said, " The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits--are they our friends or our enemies? Putting the question to a vote, Are rats comrades? 	I wouldnt have remembered the phrase except that it was exactly at this moment, after 395 kilometres of a 408 kilometre journey, that suddenly: Entrance Right of car (stage left?) 	Bang!

      that is soooo profound, like, coz testicles ARE gay !  How could they not be, living in such close quarters like that, and presumably being the same sex and well, you know loving each other in a narcississtic way.  Like, 'ohhh you're so sexy.  You kinda look like me too, what a coincidence'  Testicles are definately gay.  AND, if you wanna get all intellekshual about it you can take the ye olde schoole definition of gay and say, yes, in this instance testicles are also gay. Fun loving, joyous, full of mirth....unless they've been attached to some dude who's riding the tour de france.  In which case they may well be gay homo, but probably not gay funfilled and joyous.

      Narrow shafts of light were still breaking through the clouds. And then they weren't and it was almost dark. John cast his hand line another time but complained about the bait, which was smelly.  "Smelly squid", he said. The bait landed with a splash and all the curious fish were quick to evacuate the area. Sometimes fishing isn't about catching fish. "Fuck!" John said. "What was that?" Pointing to the horizon. "Where? Where?" I said. "Over there!" "What was it?" "I don't know, it was big." And then it shot a spout of water and splashed again. It was very big. My first whale-spot of the season.
