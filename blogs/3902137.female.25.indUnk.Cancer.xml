      Once again, my intuition comes up trumps!   I received an email today from  MH , apologising for taking "two eternities" to reply to my email (and still not actually replying); telling me that it was just because he was feeling bad when he got back to Sweden (what's your excuse now *sob* ?!); making sure I did not think it was because of the me and  Mni  thing (I did suspect it, as I confessed in an earlier post); assuring me that he does "care" and thinks I am a "GREAT" person (his emphasis); unashamedly teasing me about the possibility of us meeting up in Paris (my ultimate dream and boy-does-he-know-it); and promising to write properly "pretty soon" (with a smile and a wink, like I should be expecting him to take two eternities again).   Things I did not like about his email:  1. Referring to  AB , not by her name, but as&nbsp;"slutty girl", when in fact, he actually slept with her two hours after meeting her (I should never have invited her to that party, why do I always have to be so nice?)  2. The fact that he doesn't mention that he has a g/f (I think he has, he's not a laster and I heard that he had a g/f maybe 3-4 months ago? Unless it's a new one who is NOT a journalist...pls God?!)  3. Not signing off "love, M" like I did when I signed off my email.   Things I loved about his email:  1. Signing off with /Monsieur "le plus grand slacker" (où est-ce que on dit "dans le monde"?)  2. Mentioning once again the "rumour mill" an anglais expression which I taught him and which I hope he will remember me by...  3. He asks that I not be too dissappointed in him for not&nbsp;keeping in touch&nbsp;(how could I be, you gorgeous man?!?!)  4. The fact that I am still on his mind, I sent him the email on July 20, and it's now July 27... yay for being on his mind.   I think&nbsp;I will&nbsp;SMS him now, he deserves it. But I have to think about what to write. Maybe something like:    The rumour mill seems accurate, will be in Europe in 3 weeks. Great to hear all is good with you, we have so much to catch up on, thanks for the email, love&nbsp;v

      I am trying to piece together a wardrobe for my trip overseas. Since I seem to lose all my to do lists written on paper, I thought I might as well post it here ;)  1. Reheel my Diesel heels (they never last more than 3-4 wears but i love them to death) 2. Buy the new Wonderbra ($50) from BNT 3. Buy some Nivea Q10 skin firming lotion (also useful for point 4) 4. Get tan passes (will 3 do?) 5. Pack, pack, pack: so I know what I will need to buy before, during and after. 6. Buy ceramic tongs (this is very very important) 7. Buy shampoo and conditioner replacements to take w/ me 8. Clarins Clear High Shine Gloss. 9. New eyelash curler.  Clothes I will need: a) a pair of shorts, perhaps  small boardies will do? b)... can't think of anything else right now, but will come back to update this post later...   Books I will need for the flight: a) Bergdorf Blondes b) Angels and Demons (Dan Brown) c) The Bride Stripped Bare (Nikki Gemmell) d) The Rule of Four. e)... can't think of any more.

      My gut is never wrong.   I knew he would reply, that's why I posted that puzzling message last week.    Hey V!    R u on u're (sic) way to europe yet?   Looking forward too (sic) c u!    M   Look, he speaks French as well, so of course he is going to have a bit of trouble. Especially since he has only been speaking Swedish since he got back. I think he may have gone to Malta for a stint, I don't knowfor sure because&nbsp;- suprise, surprise - he hasn't been in touch!!   At least he still has my mobile number, which is good. Though he had always has his exs' numbers I think, he had a few when&nbsp;I knew&nbsp;him (the man-ho! Beautiful, beautiful man-ho) I often dream of taking him to Llamaland and see how he woud cope. He'd be stopped on the street and actively worshipped, let me tell you. Ooh, it would be delicious. Or even just taking him back to meet the Parental Units for a proper introduction dinner. Ha! Fat chance. You should have seen the way my mother swooned when he bought her a cup of coffee, and Daddy-oh wanted to have a beer&nbsp;and a chat with him (unheard of behaviour for my father, that's for sure)... he is unsurpassed. A total astro match as well. YAY for Scorpios.&nbsp;

      There is a Beatles song that goes by that title, it used to be one of my favourites. Well, it still is, but I have not listened to it for ages.   But more pertinently, I have had no reply from  MH. &nbsp; This worries me somewhat, I was sure that I would receive some kind of reply within 48 hours. I extended an olive branch, and he has not taken it. I worry that he is in-cahoots with  Mni,  (whose horoscope for today proclaims: "...you will be craving physical contact, and many of you will engage in the act of lovemaking." It makes me cringe to think of him with A/-. Really, really cringe.)&nbsp;   Anyway, for some unknown reason, the gorgeous and&nbsp;languorously broody  MH , deliciously sexy  MH , whose face really must have been carved by angels, does not want to know me. The temptation to romanticise this situation is almost unbearable. It puzzles me, I don't know what the deal is. We had such a great thing going, we ended it nicely, it was all good.   I planned to see him when I got to Sweden, meet his current shag and rip her apart with wit and humour, in a polite kind of way (that makes me sound like a ghastly person, but I am actually quite nice irl) . No, seriously, I wish I had kept some photos - a single photo - of him , to show my grandkids the incredibly beautiful man who could have been their grandfather, if only I had not been so greedy.

      Today I received a small wooden&nbsp;polished trinket box. It's round and has lovely colourful paintings: of a woman in a voluminous skirt on the front and and a garland of flowers along the side. I wish I could take a photo of it and post it up, it's lovely. A colleague of mine brought it back for me from the Ukraine, which was fantastic of him.  Going to see my gorgeous green-eyed trainer this afternoon, and then I have Trivia, as I always do on Thursday nights. Only 29 days to NYC, I have to watch what&nbsp;I eat! I just stuffed myself today at lunchtime, we had a welcome lunch for the students who arrived about a week ago. They are ok, not bad, but the look up to me so that is good.  I was just telling a friend of mine that I have such a weakness for green-eyes. Blue eyes are just *so* overdone.  Mni  had green/golden eyes. They were beautiful to stare into.

      just to fill the space he left heeere....  &nbsp;  I wanted to add a post yesterday, but didn't get a chance, was too busy.  &nbsp;  Today, I plucked up the courage to email  MH . I wrote about him a couple of days ago, and&nbsp;I think he just stuck in my mind, for some reason. When he left we were on very good terms, but he only sent me an SMS on 31st Jan and nothing after that. I found out from various friends that he had a few girls to choose from and he settled on a dark-haired Jewish one.&nbsp; I was insanely jealous when I heard, but, what can you do.  I was kind of hoping to hear from him on&nbsp;my birthday :(  I hope he emails back tomorrow.   I did however, receive a lovely "Happy Birthday" video message from my friend  RH&nbsp;  who I&nbsp;have mentioned before,&nbsp;it was fantastic!&nbsp;He and I used to joke around about  Monkey Magic,&nbsp;  the&nbsp;chinese animated series we used to watch as kids. And he&nbsp;played the theme music in the background while doing his greeting video. Gosh I love him! Love your work  RH !!   I have been reading the crime-caper I got from my birthday by the Norwegian author Karin something-or-other. It's not too bad. A bit dream-like, interesting in that way. I want to get the Bergdorf Blondes to read on the flight. Hopefully&nbsp;I will get some cool movies on the way over. It's a 21 hour flight to NYC. Can't wait, YAY! I hope to be able to buy a pair of Manolos, I need to keep saving...!   Got lots more nonsense to talk about, but honestly, it's just garbage, no use polluting cyberspace.&nbsp;

      Had an awesome birthday party on Friday night. Arrived late, of course, but not intentionally, by friend  JM  came over to my place to get ready, and it was all her fault. Love ya JM!! JM is going to move in with us as soon as  Mlin  moves out, out, out and back to Sverige, the Land of the Shag. She will have  MH 's old room (oh-MH, you were so dreamy! My sister likes to say he had "a face carved by angels". He was gorgeous, my mother loved him).&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Jas  didn't rock up to the party, which was themed (people like themes I think, it gives them the novelty factor), apparently he was working late on Fri, and early again on&nbsp;Sat morning, and moving on Sunday; he's in real estate and Fri and Sat are the two busiest days of the week - can anyone out there verify this, or is he just giving me the flick?!?&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Received lots of great gifts, a set of Donna Hay's modern classics (gosh, I love the pictures in those recipe books, printed on beautifully thick matt paper, hmmm), and quite a number of novels, including a crime caper by a Norwegian author and&nbsp;an&nbsp;original japanese copy of The Ring.&nbsp; Also got a "Learn to speak swedish" book from my smartass uni friends, lots of different kinds of alcohol, CDs (including Chillout Sessions5) and diamond jewelry from The Parentals.&nbsp; I love diamonds.  &nbsp;  It has occured to me that having a 25th Birthday is great because by this time most of your friends know you well enough to give you good presents.  &nbsp;  Had a bit of a moment with both  JMK  and his friend&nbsp; R . I told JMK he was my favourite person in a drunken&nbsp;daze and he reprimanded me accordingly. I am sure that his g/f would not&nbsp;have approved at all (but she went home early, all's fair in love and stirring).&nbsp;It's kind of cute because I feel so comfortable around him, I know I can pretty much say anything. I knew that I was trying to stir him up even as I opened my mouth to say it, but he knew immediately what I was up to, knows me too well, ha! Also had a moment with R, he's somewhat pretty and impressive, not really my type at all, but definitely intriguing.&nbsp;But it's a no go, unfortunately,&nbsp;he's only interested in&nbsp;ONE thing, and JMK would not be too happy at all. Gotta&nbsp;love your posse of pretty Norwegian&nbsp;boys ;)  &nbsp;  I received an email today also from my dearest friend  MA  in Sweden, saying Happy Birthday. She really is the sweetest girl ever... I wish I was more like her. She is going through a bit of a tough time, but she always has time for all her friends, even though our problems are truly banal (mine in particular). She mentioned that  Mni  is worried&nbsp;about me going over&nbsp;to Sweden.&nbsp;I don't know how to&nbsp;react to that, I had decided not to see him when I was over there, but my first feeling is of overwhelming concern for him. I want to reassure him, and then I realise that he doesn't - repeat, DOES NOT- deserve it. Let him squirm for a while longer. It may do him good not to be in control of a situation. The gossip has reached far and wide, much to my&nbsp;"upsetness" (as my buddy  RT  would proclaim).  &nbsp;  Also&nbsp;got a&nbsp;bit of a suprise&nbsp;email from&nbsp; TW  in Lund. He's such a sweetie, but he left here about 4 months ago and had sent no word at all. I thought&nbsp;he'd forgotten me altogether.&nbsp;He is a real cutie pie who can sing; one of the most interesting swedish boys&nbsp;I have had the pleasure&nbsp;of meeting.&nbsp; We had the most interesting chats cause he was so down to earth. I remember him belting out Sinatra songs in my kitchen as we all worked together to tidy up the place and cook crayfishes. Apparently in Sweden they are having the worst weather EVER. What a bummer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        I received a lovely email from my friend   RH   today (I have decided to revert to a different naming code simply because the three letter thing was a lameass idea. I'll keep Mni and Jas for posterity's sake, and a small but significant reminder to myself to stop trying to be a smart-ass). He is one of those people with endless amounts of energy and wonderful vibes and just this luminous honesty, it makes me want to wilt away and hide in a dark corner. He's in Sweden at the moment, so he will miss my birthday "do" this Friday.  He was one of a group of five or six of us that used to go and worship the music alsmot every weekend last spring and summer. It was one of those "just-click" kind of groups where everyone loved the music and wanted to share it with everyone else. We danced until our heels bled; we danced and the music just soaked our friendships in a warm caramel syrup; we danced "like when dancing was really, really dancing". It saddens me to think that we are never going to get that back. We've all gone our separate ways now, we'll never share anything like that again, the six of us, and we all know it. But I seem to be missing it more than most. I was the youngest of the group, and I must admit, have a bad habit of holding on to things a little longer than I should: not that these classify as reasons at all, but maybe lame explanations.   ***  Yesterday I had a terrible thought that made me feel like "there was a dead person in the room." Sort of like when the small hairs at the back of your neck and you just want to run. My friend  DF , in trying to understand what I meant, said: "Scared and confused" and got it in one. Now why couldn't  I  have said that?

      While browsing this morning's blue collar paper, I spotted the following:  "WHILE having a quiet hit last week at the Brookvale tennis courts,  Pat Rafter  was accosted by Ten's Sports Tonight presenter  Ryan Phelan , who was practising on the next court. Not one to miss an opportunity, Phelan asked Rafter for an interview for his show, which he accepted. Next day, cameras rolling, Rafter opened up on several topics, including how he thinks Lleyton Hewitt will burn out if he keeps playing the way he does. The interview airs in two parts on Wednesday and Thursday night."  For some background:  I was an excitable Rafter groupie for a large chunk of my life between my teens and (very) early twenties... I tracked his progress as he went from being ranked 73 to number 1, winning back to back US Open Crowns. YAY for Rafter!! Remember when he used to wear those cute green/orange/purple stripey polo shirts from Reebok? At age 18, I hoped to bear his firstborn, until thankfully, I saw the error of my ways.  As for Phelan, he's my late night sports news reader. He's fairly new at the job, probably been a relief reader since January maybe? But he is completely yummy, and I bore my friends to death when I decide it's time for a Phelan tirade of worship. And now he seems to have the top late night and weekend news gig because the other guy, Matthew White, has gone over to a rival network.   So, this week I am going to be in FANTASY-BOY-HEAVEN when I watch those interviews... oooh, I can't wait.

      Ok, so I have decided that I will use small three letter pseudonyms for the people I will write about to protect both the innocent and guilty. I am listening to the Annual 2002. (1) And I am thinking of  Mni . And how funny/cool he was ;)  He burned all these Annual CDs for my birthday last year at Angel, he promised me he would take care of the music, and he got me a really nice copy of Lolita. He wrapped it and everything himself, in silver tissue paper, probably didn’t even consult A/-, and it was such a classic to see her pick up the book after I’d opened it and read what he had written inside, (which was lame enough, “This is a great book, Enjoy! Mni”), I wish it had been a little more incendiary. I remember sitting on that little sofa and watching her read the message, and turn it over to look at the blurb and then hand it back to me, those big baby blue eyes of hers somewhat clouded over (or so I like to think). I remember her realizing that I had been watching her. It was a million dollar moment.  I miss him this week. A lot. It's only cause I am having my first birthday with him gone.  Must think of lovelier things, like  Jas . Yay for Jas.. woo-hoo jas. whatever. YAY FOR MNI!  Jas is my current boy-interest. With all of these three letter names, it will be hard to remember who is who, but Jas is the guy whose two best friends tried to convince him to sell his sperm on the Internet because they were sure that women who planned to turkey baste their children into this world would be queing for the privilege.

      Ok, so I have yet to see what my blog will actually look like. But apparently, this is the place to start. I am not quite sure what will be happening here; whether I will take to it and whatnot, but since I spend so much of my time in front of a machine, I might as well make proper use of my time and post all these bits of craziness that whiz around, nay stumble around more like, in my head. I was insipired by a blogger (who I never met in person), who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day to day existance, and somewhat entertained at the same time... while I have no such aspirations of my own, I guess for the most part, I want this to be cathartic, and I guess, liberating, in a weird disclosure kind of way...

      So I leave on Friday, I am way too excited. I really need to calm down.  Preparations are underway, I have scheduled all my time (right up until an hour before I leave) with utter precision, one misstep and it could all go awry.  This week my two new students came in on separate days, and I really am too soft on them, I should make it a little harder for them and not spoonfeed them too much. There is art and skill in student supervision, let me tell you that much.  I am dissappointed that my trip preparation has been less than stellar. I had planned to be a buff, confident and tanned carefree gal travelling around the world with no shackles on her feet. Instead, I am a slightly heavy, tentative and.. well, tentative... girl, travelling to meet friends, hoping not to fall apart at the chasm of masochism she is sending herself into. Let me make sense of this for you, dear Reader: 1. Not planning to see Mni or his g/f, but if I do, only badness can come of it. 2. Not sure how MH will receive me or me him, it could be embarrasing or teary because I wont want to leave 3. I hope I don't run out of money, that is always a problem with me, I am slightly irresponsible in this respect - and I have no back up plan! 4. This is my first time travelling "on my own". I have someone to meet me everywhere, but I will be doing most of the sightseeing on my own. 5. Tentative/ tentative / tentative - I feel like I am walking on eggshells.  My first stop is NYC, which is familiar territory, so if things go well here that will definately be a confidence boost for the rest of the trip. I hope to have a mellow time in Sweden too, even though it will be completely new. France is going to be good too, while RH is with me...! Then comes the clincher - Paris on my own...! I want to be excited! But I am so afraid at the same time. I don't want to blow it being afraid to be lost or get mugged etc... *sigh*

      I don't even like Monte Carlos. I'd meant to get Kingstons but somehow failed. Don't know what was going through my mind at that time. Twas slightly annoying to say the least. I spent two hours in front of the box last night, watching the finale of The Apprentice. I really wanted  Kwame  to win, instead of that silly Bill, who'd been running around like a headless chook. Alas, Burnett failed to make my dreams come true. If only there was a rich, cheesy-enough mogul in Australia to run the Aussie version!  The Starburst babies are really something. They taste just like juice. YUM. Ate my way through an entire packet. Also had some cup-a-soup with extra angel hair noodles and chicken breast pieces, and steamed vegies. When EH came home, he made bolognese and I had some of that too. I came close to gorging myself on PW's famour chocolate cake too, but there was just no room. It wasn't really a binge night, but I don't want to eat as much tonight... (fat chance).  I am making some quiche with CL's recipe. Thanks CL! You're such a good mum to your kids! Wish you were my mum! CL and I have worked at two different companies together, she is a Financial Controller for the organisation that I work for.  Incidentally, my picture cropped up on one of the pages of the website, I am typing away at my desk, my hair looks nice and shiny and long and straight! YAY! You can't see that much of my face, only a tiny bit of profile. And my kimono-like wrap-around pin-striped shirt from Cue looks great too! Hello Miss Vanity.  I am planning to get a new phone. My current slick Motv60 is dying, a slow and painful death, and it seems that the v220 kind of phones are not making it here to OZland. what a pity. There are no nice phones out there, all of them are seriously chunky. *sigh*

      Though no stranger to the above kind of conundrum (and I must say, not always achieving a happy outcome), I await with trepidation at what the next three weeks will bring. I don't normally believe in what the horoscopes say, but the predictions for the next three weeks seemed to be uncannily accurate... I hope things turn out ok.  Haven't been here in a while, have just been flat out at work. Didn't have the greatest day on Thursday, but all things pass. On Friday night, I went to  Peppermint Lounge  with  JM  and  EH , and met up with  Beckham , the my favourite bartender. I've known him for about three years, when I first started to get tino the glam kind-of scene, in fact, back then all of the bartenders apart from Beckham were pretty gay boys. Beckham has been mixing my caprioskas and mojitos ever since I can remember, he was always the best with the infamous "stick action"... and of course Peppermint has always been a special place for me, it was there that  Mni  and I had our first real pash. It's a funky 70's kind of groove place, not very big, but lush comfortable atmostphere. A year ago it was filled to the brim with glam girls and boys, but now it's toned down a bit, the uglies have found it and it's become a less self-conscious crowd.  JM and I were feeling a little frisky (?) and we wanted to find her a bartender of her very own. Since she's moving in and all, we thought it would be a good bonding experience for us. So we recruited  Michael  (I don't know if that is his real name even, we'd had about three caprioskas by this point), whom I conveniently offended when I asked for Beckham... oops. We had a laugh playing the good cop/bad cop with him - the glam girl clubbing version.  Michael immediately took the bait and made JM the best Frangelico drink she's ever had. EVER.  EH is back from Sweden, and apparently he is in love. He was my wingman for the night, but a fat lot of good it did judging from my success rate 0/0.  There weren't even any potentials! *sigh*

      First things first.  I am sorry, I just have no patience for people who have lameass versions of my hang-ups, and lameass rationalizations for not getting involved with other people. Like this morning, I read something to this effect: "Oooh-oooh-oooh, I won’t allow myself to miss him because then I couldn’t cope…yadda yadda yadda"  Obviously from someone who has no idea that feelings are involuntary; when they come, they come, no if-s or but-s. It’s not like you can stop feeling something just because you want to, or think you should, or even know you should. Feelings are overwhelming and all encompassing…  *sigh*  It makes me so angry because she really doesn’t know better, she just thinks she is poetic.  ******************  Now that that boulder is safely off my chest, I thought I would write a little about what I am thinking about  MH  . I thought I had it figured out in my head what I thought about him, but it seems that the closer I am to my trip over there, the more I am thinking about him, and about the time that we spent together. I have lots of wonderful memories of him, and the things he said, and the expressions on his face, and the funny things that he did. But probably the best time was on NYE 03/04 when he whispered in my ear: "It's so good to see you really happy." And it just resonated in my heart, it was so opportune and appropriate, it was just so perfect. That moment will stay with me forever. So when I dwell on things like this, I realise more and more that I really cared about him, I have often said that it was just really really bad timing for us, but I don't really know. I know I trusted him generally, even though I know he is a formidable enemy when he is hurt or not on your side. I think he might just be the guy for me. It kind of surprised me when I thought it and took myself seriously, because when I get onto an idea, I wring every last drop of life out of it. But this is more of a quiet assertion. I know this is true, but I am not tripping myself over in an effort to make things happen. Also, I am not sure that he thinks I am the right girl for him. He likes my look, probably more now that I have been going to my PT and working out a lot more, but I think he has reservations because of the Mni thing. Gosh that was  so  ugly and  so  corrupt.  One of my best friends told me on Saturday (or was it Friday) that I was a masochist. I am afraid to think he might be right.
