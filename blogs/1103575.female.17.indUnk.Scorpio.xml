      It's my dad's birthday. Yummy German Chocolate cake for me tonight!!!! At dinner they told us that some of our friends at church invited us to go with them to visit their family in the Philippeans this summer...  Now if we could really go, would that not be INCREDIBLE?????????        I'm already excited, and I'm probably not even going.   Today I feel "unpretty"  Maggie told me I looked like MY DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  mean huh?  she didn't really mean it... it was funny oh and my mom took my cell phone away from me for the weekend so if you want to talk to me, you'll have to call the house

      I'm exhausted... I was at church babysitting for my service hours.  Wow kids are a handful!!  One little boy started screaming every time I tried to put him down, It's nice to know I'm so loved, but other kids wanted me to pick them up too...  AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  My right arm is numb...    My parents are seriously considering letting me transfer to O'Hara, I'm just so incredibly stressed out about school now...  But would I really transfer???  I doubt it.

      MICHING MALLECHO... (it means mischief) -- says Hamlet to the fair Ophelia  Finally I have dirt on somebody.  I'm not going to tell you who becuase then I won't be able to use this dirt when and how I want.  (If I were capable of an evil laugh, i would... but it's just not like me!!) I'm depressed again today (NO ITS NOT BeCAUSE OF yOU, YOU PIG-HEADED...)   Today I like the Used again...  this time it "Bury Me alive"

      Where did I see this??? It's pathetic... You would slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I would apologize for bleeding on your shirt. Is that lyrics to a song or something???  It's stuck in my head. I wrote this the other night... I don't know what's the matter with me...  Anymore it's all crap.  I've had a crappy day, I sit and stare at the girl in the mirror that is not me. I am 2 dimensional. I wonder what you see in her. I don't take off my make-up,  I'm too tired It doesn't matter anyway, I'll just look like a racoom in the morning.

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    BORED OUT OF MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I really need to call some people for newspaper, but I really REALLY REALLY don't want to.  I hate newspaper, the only part I like is having my pictures in the paper.  Maybe I'll drop it next year and pick up some art classes so I really can get into Corcoran ( see link at  I found this spiffy Elven site today too.  I need to find somebody to teach it to me, I LOVED it in the movie. I'm sure I'll be back later... Oh what am I listening to right now?:::  korn...   fun stuff

      This was on some other guy's blog, its funny: "so he texted you want to have sex or watch LOTR later? how arrogant. he can go to his damn motels alone. and i've seen LOTR already. " lol, wow, but then you might not find it funny, I have the oddest sense of humor. I also find this funny... Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love --hamlet

      Let's see, who am I in love with today???  Probably the Used.  They're going to be at the Warped Tour, I'm excited!!  Right now I'm listening to Relient K...  Becca made me listen to them last night, and now I'm dying for the cd.  I need to be friends with somebody who listens to good music and can burn these cd's for me, I've only got, like 20, and in this day and age that's very very sad.(Chantele, you're still working on Disturbed for me aren't you?  You can borrow SR-71 if you do lol) Oh and while I'm thinking about it, what do you guys think of the Vines' version of Ms. Jackson??  I laughed the first time I heard it, hated it the second time, and its been growing on me ever since. Today I pinned my hair up, it looked incredibly cool, rather like Padme's in Ep. 2 when its all loopy, ya' know? But now I have a headache from having those pins stuck into my scalp all day. lol, yeah you GUYS, you just don't understand.  It hurts like hell. And apparently, there have been rumors going around about me being suicidal?  Well, I'm not.  I'm about as close as you can get without actually being suicidal, and making a comeback, so don't worry about me, I'm fine really!!!! We discovered today that I'm a little on the stubborn prideful side... basically, once I've done something... I've not going back on it, even when I do regret it... poor me. Oh and last night I decided that Marshmallow Fluff is supposed to be refrigerated, just so you know. (lol) PS...  you guys might call me tonight, make sure I haven't passed out, I rather feel like it just now

      I knew you guys shouldn't have let me sit at home by myself tonight.  I've been reading Margret Atwood. My favorite quotes from books come from her, and I'm really bored (aren't I always??  I say that every night)  so I'm going to type them all out so I have them all in one place. --" 'It's absolutely no use saying you should stop loving someone.  It doesn't work like that!'     'Well you should if you know its bad for you,' said Charis.    'Bad for you had nothing to do with it,' said Roz.   'I like hamburgers,' said Charis, 'but I don't eat them.'    'Hamburgers are not an emotion,' said Roz.    'Yes they are,' said Charis.                                             --Robber Bride  (that one's my favorite)  "On that day, blood ran like water, so afterwards it must have been very clean."                                                       --the Blind Assasin  "I am a fool to confuse this with goodness. I am not good.  I know too much to be good.  I know myself. I know myself to be vengeful, greedy, secretive, and sly.                                       --Cat's Eye  "I think about becoming invisible.  I think about eating the deadly nightshade berries from the bushes beside the path.  I think about drinking the Javex out of the skull and cross bones bottle in the laundry room, about jumping off the bridge, smashing down there like a pumkin, half of an eye, half of a grin.  I would come apart like that, I would be dead, like the dead people. I don't want to do these things, I'm afraid of them.  BUt I think about her telling me to do them, not in her scornful voice, in her kind one.  I hear her kind voice inside my head.   Do it. Come on.  I would be doing these things to please her."                                -- Cat's Eye

      yes I'm back again.. I feel like ranting, the snow is melting.  Last night was the last straw, but now I'm left with an empty cup. Nothing is ever what it seems, and once again, I've brought this on myself, and for me there is no going back, Will you catch up?  The tears will not fall, but the pain will go away.  I sit and laugh, because I have been here before and will be here again. Its okay, I'll live, I always do, its my sense of humor that saves me.  Sarcastic as it may be, and as much as you may hate it, It has saved me, I would have gone long ago if not for it, my trusty shield, you never got as close as you could have, it saved me.  It ruined me. hm, rather abstract tonight, huh?

      The snow is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I've already gone out and shot 2 rolls of film this morning.  I love my Baby. (NO CHANTELE, YOU WERE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO NAME IT THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  yeah, um back to the snow...  Its weird how Bobby has picked up my snow day habits.  Snow days are the only no school days that you don't sleep in.  We get up, put on  a ton of clothes and go out into the woods and look for animal tracks.  We always walk single file, to mess up less snow.  The only reason Bobby does it is because he knows I would SMACK him if he didn't. (hee hee)  Oh and I wrote this last night too: The girl is beautiful her pale silouette outlined against the dark hair  spread across her pillow Glowing in the light reflected off the snow outside her window she is beautiful and so am I  Its pretty crappy, but I thought you'd like it (yes you Chantele)

      Today we had fun.  I threw a banana at Chantele, and we discovered my lightning fast reflexes.  Chantele and I also decided that we were going to take over the world like Alexander the Great... It will most likely entail having affairs with world politicians and then poisoning them at breakfast. Poor Sama lost her voice and had to call us really REALLY bad names to get us to pay attention to her.  I would also like to take this opportunity to point out the fact that I am MADLY in love with Joel from gc, and Deryk (?) from Sum 41.  MADLy i tell you.  Well I suppose I'm done for now.  I'm horridly tired and bored, I need to get out of this house!!!!!!!!!!!

      Its really weird how everyone feels so overprotective of me, I mean, my parents...  Need I say more???  And I found out today that Chantele's been threatening people with the "If you ever hurt her..."  Some of my friends won't even hug me because they think their gonna "break" me. I hear the "DOn't do anything I would do" thing all the time too.  WHy is it that everyone I know is so bad that they have to warn me that whatever it is their doing is wrong?  Io it bugs me.  I like a certain amount of protectiveness from my guys, its cute, but I get tired of it after awhile.  Oh and what's up with this nickname for Rachel thing? I have a gazillion different names.  Rachella... rather reminicent of Cinderella.  Popo...  not quite so much of a "poet pope" any more...  My papal visions have gone Kaput.  Um..  Baby- Reminds me too much of that wonderful performance of mine in the Fall play, and besides, that's my camera's name.  Poke...  no I don't like it when people touch w/o some kind of prior warning, but its neccessary to remind everyone of this new kind of entertainment... "Watch Rachel Cringe"????  BE A JEAN!  (that was for Chantilly)  Let's see... what else?  SHeep...  baaaa?  NO. RaeRae...  doesn't bother me so much, I'll answer to it but I didn't win state in soccar last year!!! The list is endless..  poor me.

      Funny thing, life is.  You know, its really cool to think about the millions/thousands of people you meet/see/walk past in your lifetime that all have this unseen force in them that gives them the ability to walk/think/gain intelligence etc.  I was babysitting this little two year old boy last night and he fell asleep on my shoulder, it was so cute, I love the feeling of having a sleeping child in my arms. I wonder if I'll ever end up having my own kids, creating life...  hmmm...

      I wonder what's the matter with me?   I've been the BIGGEST bitch lately, and I'm not really like that.  I want to lay down and die.  If it were that easy, I probably would too!!  Too bad I'd never really be able to do it. Oh well. While I'm thinking about it, someone needs to come up with a name for me...   Some guy came up to me the other night and called me Xyloa...  I'm afraid to find out what that means, in elvish, or whatever it is. But then its not like I ever actually play D&D, I just hear Chantele's stories, and Kevin really wanted me to play with him at one time, except I don't think he does that kind of stuff anymore, now that he's converted to Daoism. Poor me. I'm so bored...

      UHG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to go to school in the morning, I think I'll cry.  I felt like crying this morning when I woke up. (Of course I didn't.  I need to stop that, someday, I think I'll die from withheld tears or something)  I get like that sometimes, its weird.  My mom thinks its hormones, but I really don't think so, I know what hormones feels like.  I'm just moody. (wow, I picked a good name for this, I'm already ranting.) I HATE confirmation class.  I hate every single person in the class except for Kristy, Jessica, and Rachel (no not me, I'm not quite THAT pigheaded)  You should have seen Larry, I wanted to kill him...  No wait, I take that back, I shouldn't be that mean.  He REALLY REALLY REALLY pissed me off, just by being alive.  Can't you tell I'm in a horrid mood tonight? I WANT IT TO RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It started sprinkling yesterday and got me all excited, and the clouds were really cool, and it SMELLED like rain, I could even SEE it raining in the distance, but what did I get?  Disappointment. Ok, Chantele needs a name for her mag, what'll it be?  huh?  huh?  Didn't think so.

      I've had a really good past couple days.  Wednesday I found out I'm going to be photo editor of the newspaper next year.  That means I'll get to spend all my time taking pictures, and will have to write very few, if any, stories for the paper.  Even though Mr. Thomas said  that considering my past couple stories, I'm a completely different writer than I was at the beginning of the year (that's a really good thing, I sucked so bad at the beginning of the year)  and since the juniors and seniors have been gone all week, I've been the only person in my newspaper classes, so Mr.Thomas has been talking to me about photography...  He's sort of taken me on as his "apprentice"  and he was showing me different techniques and stuff.  It was fun.  So yeah there's that, and its snowed the past couple days, which makes me happy, and Andrew and I actually had a civil conversation yesterday!!!  Oh, and I haven't had any homework all week, so that's a TON of stuff I don't have to worry about this week, although I should probably go do some of the Latin due on Monday...  Nah.  I'm such a slacker.  Speaking of Latin, the JCL test is in a couple weeks, its a standardized international Latin test.  Last year I did really well on it..  Magna cum Laude or something... I got a silver medal... Only Kate did better, but that doesn't really bother me.... I'm NEVER going to do better than Kate, freaking GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok well, who knows what I'm doing tonight, I may be around, I may not, but if you call and I don't answer, leave me a message... I'll probably either be talking to Chantele on the phone, or at a rave and can't hear my phone... lol, jk...  I'm not going to a Rave... yes Kevin I'm sure.  I'm NOT GOING TO GET MYSELF HIGH!!!  nor have I ever done such a thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Its okay, I'll live, I always do. :~)   We went to the dedication of the cathedral today, and I saw a ton of people that I know.  It feels really good to walk through a church that big, and get stopped every couple of seconds by people I know.  A friend of my mom's hadn't seen me in around four years, and he didn't even really recognize me, he just looked at me, and I smiled and waved at him.  He came over and was like, You're... You're...  so I told him who I was and he like freaked out.  He was like wow...  you're a lot older now, you've gotten to be absolutely gorgeous.  I hate it when people tell me that...  I know its not true, but sometimes its still nice to hear that someone really thinks so.

      let's see... tomorrow night is the charity volleyball game at Rockhurst...  let me take this opportunity to say that the Rock is going to be ground into dust, they just can't take the heat of the stars...  but then Friday we're playing sion, and THAT storm is DEFINATELY going to blow  over.  and I think we're doing something with Ish too.  I think Chantele's going to spend the night, and then Saturday morning is the rededication of the Cathedral...  which I got tickets to because of our leadership role in the youth world of the Diocese  (yeah I know, where the hell did they come up with my name?)   Saturday night is the battle of the bands at Rockhurst, which is going to be great... and something must be happening sunday.. hmmm I'm listening to Relient K, and Home Grown...    oh and that one song...  Make up your mind....   who sings that???????

      I was over at sama's house last night, working on our history project, which is a comparison of indian and american weddings, and i found this poem: "Give me a kiss, and to that kiss a score; Then to that twenty, add a hundred more: A thousand to that hundred: so kiss on, To make that thousand up a million. Treble that million, and when that is done, Let's kiss afresh, as when we first begun." -Robert Herrick Its really funny, and those of you that need to know why its funny, know

      wayway  WAY too much sugar yesterday... but we had fun last night. Mary and I drove around for a couple hours after school, we went to her house, and then Sid's house.  Maggie, Lauren and Elise came by.  We went to Winstead's and watched Lauren be mean to her date, and then we went and saw How to lose a guy in 10 days.  There were a whole bunch of drunk freshmen in the row in front of us and we made fun of them.  I missed the last 15 min of the movie though because Chantele had to leave at 9:40 and couldn't go by herself... Her parents think she's going to get mobbed

      I'm so tired of doing this...   what's this you ask?  well, since no one really reads this, I could tell you, but then with my luck, someone, like just the person I don't want reading this particular thing, would come and read it..  haa haa. funny isn't it, that's how my life works. I was talking to Cindy today, and she said Mary Mueller wants Chantele and I to go to the rededication of the Cathedral, and representatives of Youth Leadership in the Diocese...  Wow, Youth Leadership in the diocese, and MY name comes up??  ha ha, I like that.  Of course we're going, and we're both really excited. the Father/Daughter Dance is tonight at Union Station.  Its more like a costume ball than anything else I've ever been to.  My dad and I are going as Woody and Little Bo Peep, from Toy Story.  I'm gonna be stuck all night with people telling me how incredibly cute I am. Speaking of people calling me cute, I need to explain about my problem with this.   I get called cute ALL THE TIME, and quite frankly, am VERY sick of it.  Even at HYU, I LOSE MY VOICE, and its ADORABLE!!!  At church Its all I hear too, I f you must say something, tell me I'm unbelievably gorgeous, Please.

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We had fun.  We went to Town Center and I bought Kate a shirt that said spin my driedel (lol)  and I bought me a new ring, and got yelled at for wearing it upside down...  long story...  don't ask.  Then we went bowling and scored like a 57 or something.  My name also changed several times through out the night  i started out rae rae, but then I was Poke (seriously, this 'let's watch Rachel cringe and laugh at her hysterically' thing is REALLY not funny.)  and then later it something else, and then VVVVVVVVVVVVV m...  again, don't ask.  Sama was having control issues with the computer, hah a We went back to Kate's house after that and watched 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorite movies, aaaaahhhh  Heath Ledger...  HOTTIE!!) and a Walk to Remember, and guess what, a TEAR ACTUALLY ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEK!!!  what is that, the first time since HYU? and I'm not even gonna go into what happened this morning,   I don't even really know, i just woke up with Chantele sitting on me, grinning evily, holding my cell phone...   I think she was harrassing Andrew...  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      today was weird, We had our NHS induction assembly, which made me feel lazy and worthless, but after that I had fun.  I felt loved today. except for Chantele I swear to god some day i'm going to beat the crap out of her.  But yeah, London ditched school and came back and told us all about it...  stupid girl.  In newspaper, Katy took my second story so I have less work to do now... I've got all kinds of pictures to take, but that's a good thing.  Then I was talking to Britanny, she's going to be editor of the Dart next year.  She was talking to me, and then all of a sudden she goes, "Oh my god, you are SO gorgeous.  I can't believe you don't have like 5 boyfriends."  I was rather shocked to hear her say this, partially because SHE'S the one who's gorgeous, and people don't normally tell me I'm gorgeous.  I'm alway cute.  But that's only one of the reasons I hate it when people call me that. People always tell me my hair is really pretty, but I'm never pretty. but that's only one of the reasons I want to chop it off.  hmmm... While on the subject of my appearance, I would like to talk about how everone thinks I'm anerexically skinny.  Its funny really.  My mom tells me I'm fat all the time, and yells at me if I eat more than she thinks I should... I really don't eat that much anyway... but I guess she thinks so.  But then If I should decide to skip a meal, THEN she drags my dad into and they practially shove food down my throat.  Its so weird.  Should you ask Chantele, she would tell you that I'm really normal sized and that I fake being skinny...  She will..  and seriously mean it too..  ugh  When I'm really skipping meals though, nobody notices... I probably shouldn't say this, but then wait, no one reads this anyway so it doesn't matter...  I can go for weeks without eating virtually anything, and no one will notice... But then I start eating again for a while... It all depends on the mood I'm in.  Oh well.

      another day gone by...  It's weird some times to observe time passing...  relativity, what and interesting concept... you know its true, the barriers of time are only in your mind.  What would you do if you were some where with no clocks, and you couldn't see the sun to see the day pass by...  what would it be like?  Hmmm??? Would you know several hours had passed when you were hungry again?  or would you never be hungry because to you, no time had passed what so ever?  I wonder how long the next six years are going to seem, if I live to see the next six years that is.

      ... wow, its been a while hasn't it???   hmmm... there's lots of stuff i feasibly CoULd tell you, but probably shouldn't, since its NONE of your business...  Spring break just got over, I'm already hating school again.  The break was quite interesting... I went to TEC, and met some really cool people, and got a chance to recenter my self, In most ways anyway... I got WAY off in other ways.  Monday I was in the most bizarre mood and said things I shouldn't have.  Tuesday night Chantele came over and I talked to Andrew some... Wednesday and Thursday were mostly uneventful, Friday night I talked to Andrew for five hours on the phone... i was happy after that, Saturday was a good day until my parents ruined it, and Sunday I was at church half the day, then I realized that i was going to have to go back to school today and did a little freaking out, and then I talked to Andrew some more...   So yeah that's my break... and then today???  I HATE Ms. Rowland (latin teacher)  I don't know anyone else in the WORLD that could make me feel so STUPID!!!!!!!!!  oh well.  CALL ME I'M BOReD>>>  luv y'all

      “Goodbye,” he said to the flower. But she made no answer. “Goodbye,” he said again. The flower coughed.  But it was not because she had a cold. “I have been silly,” she said to him at last, “I ask your forgiveness.  Try to be happy…” He was surprised by this absence of reproached.  He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid air.  He did not understand this quiet sweetness. “Of course I love you the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance.  But you- you have been just as foolish as I.  Try to be happy… Let the glass globe be.  I don’t want it any more.” “But the wind -” “My cold is not so bad as all that… The cool night air will do me good.  I am a flower.” “But the animals-” “Well I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.  It seems to me that they are very beautiful.  And if not the butterflies- and the caterpillars- who will call upon me?  You will be far away…As for the large animals- I am not at all afraid of them.  I have my claws.” And, naively, she showed her four thorns.  Then she added: “Don’t linger like this.  You have decided to go away.  Now go!” For she did not want him to see her crying.  She was such a proud flower. -The Little Prince Antoine de Saint Exupery

      I love this weather, I thrive on tank tops, shorts, and playing in the rain...  Of course I love the snow and all, but the rain's so much better.  I love going out and getting soaked to the skin, feeling the drops hit my face... and I love the sound of thunder. It sends chills down my spine every time I hear it.  mmm...  Just thinking about it makes me smile.  Supposedly I haven't been able to stop smiling all day.  I had Latin first thing this morning, and London was singing at the top of her lungs...  Oh it was the funniest thing ever, I laughed so hard I had tears streaming down my face. (Note:  London could NOT sing if her life depended on it, it was more like screeching, but I think she was doing that on purpose.)  What else happened today...  I finished my newspaper story, so I don't have to worry about that any more, and Mr. Thomas said it was a good story, which made me feel better because, I thought it was crap... Supposedly I'm overly critical of myself, because I hate most of the pictures I take, I hate everything I write, everything I do is always screwed up, but people are like... Rachel, this is incredible, what's your problem?  oh well... maybe that's a good thing though, because then I try harder... maybe.  hmm... It just occured to me that I haven't written in a couple of weeks, in which a lot of things have happened, but the only person who now even knows where this is (that'd be you Andrew)  knows all that stuff, so I don't need to worry about it anyway.  :-)

      what a pretty rain.  It used  to make me happy...  now it...now it... i don't know how to explain it to you... its like... I know it used to make me happy, and now it pelts every mistake into my soul...  and that's still not quite it.  the thunder still gives me goosebumps though..    I'm in an off mood right now.  I'm tired of being me again...  but that's nothing new.  it doesn't matter anymore anyway.  I want to go home, curl up in my bed, and never do anything ever again.

      Shelley sent me these lyrics.  I found that rather amusing... This will NOT happen. John Mayer - 3x5 lyrics I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been You held this letter probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it  didn't have a camera by my side this time hopping I would see the world with both my eyes maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way with words  Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliche' And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky are next to mountains anyway  Didn't have a camera by my side this time Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside just no more 3x5's  Guess you had to be there Guess you had to be with me  Today I finally overcame tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside just no more 3x5's no more 3x5's

      so I fixed the quotes....   wow.  Really, I am just not capable of typing a whole word without screwing it up.   Seriously, I've backspaced about a hundred times already just typing this.  I think I'm getting sick too.  One of the guys from the St. Louis office called this morning, and when I answered the phone he said I sounded like I had been into some bad whiskey this weekend.  I told him not to tell my dad.  It was kind of funny.  I seriously can not wait till next week.  I need out of the house SO INCREDIBLY BAD.  I can go to HYU  have fun with people who don't need to know anything about me, and forget about my real life.  The thought is horribly pleasing.  If only I knew it was going to be the same as last year though,  that was fun.  Oh well, we'll see.

      So I've been reading Margaret Atwood again...  It's almost like listening to Konstantine.   Anyway, I've got to keep these quotes somewhere...  otherwise I'll forget them. "I'm stuck on that wretched term paper.  Once I went to the zoo and there was a cage with a frenzied armadillo in it going around in figure-eights, just around and around the same path.  I can still remember the funny metallic sound its feet made on the bottom of the cage.   They say all caged animals get that way when they're caged, it's a form of psychosis, and even if you set the animals free after they go like that they'll just run around in the same pattern.  You read and read the material and after you've read the twentieth article you can't make any sense out of it any more, and then you start thinking about the number of books that are published in any given year in any given moth, and in any given week and that's just too much. Words,' he said, looking in my direction finally, but with his eyes strangely unfoucused, as though he was really looking at a poin several inches beneath my skin, "are beginning to lose their meanings.'                                                        -The Edible Woman  And this is the one I'm reading now, this is how it starts: "I don't know how I should live.  I don't know how anyone should live.  All I know is how I do live.  I live like a  peeled snail.  And that's no way to make money. I want that shell back, it took me long enought to make.  You've got it with you, wherever you are.  You were good at removing.  I want a shell like a sequined dress, made of silver nickels and dimes and dollars overlappin like the scales of an armadillo.  Armored dildo.  Impermeable; like a French raincoat. I wish I didn't have to think about you.  You wanted to impress me; well I'm not impressed, I'm disgusted.  That was a disgusting thing to do, childish and stupid.  A tantrum, smashing a doll, but what you smashed was your own head, your own  body.  You wanted to make damn good and sure I'd never be able to turn over in bed again with out feeling that body beside me, not there, but tangible, like a leg that's been cut off.  Gone but the place still hurts.  You wanted me to cry, mourn, sit in a rocker with a black-edged handkerchief, bleeding from the eyes.  But I'm not crying, I'm angry.   I'm so angry I could kill you.  If you hadn't already done that for yourself."                                                                      -Life before Man.  I wish I could write like Margaret Atwood.  I love reading her books.  They are examples of books that are not junk. ... that I can actually lose my self in.   I can be depressed because of the book, instead of being depressed because of my life.  That's a good thing.  Samantha was talking about how "fiberous" I am.  She said everything I do has something to do with paper.  I love paper, I love the way it feels.  Its very personal.  That's why I write letters to people so much.  I don't know anyone else who does that.  I just sit there and think...  I should write to so and so... and so I do.  They mean more effort than just calling somebody up, you have to spend 37 cents for a stamp and actually put it in the mail.  Taking the effort means its important to you.  I wish people would realize that.      I really have been sick of myself lately.    I wonder what's the matter with me.   Well, I know what's the matter with me... But I should have figured that out by now... It's the same old...."I'll be fine."  "I'll be fine."  I keep telling myself that... Maybe eventually I'll believe it,  maybe eventually I will be fine...  Maybe I'll be better than fine.  Maybe I'll be happy.   Those words echo over and over again in my head...  Maybe... eventually... Someday...    and I think, "ugh."

      ::drum roll please:: AND THE RESULTS ARE:   I didn't do nearly as bad as I said/thought I was going to.  C's stand for "special Commendation"  and A's stand for "Needs Attention"  therefore, c's are better than a's.  I had 34 C's, with things like "Wow!" and "Beautiful" and "YES!" written after them, and I knew I was going to get those 3  A's, I was so nervous, my left hand was a quarter of a beat ahead of my right hand (UHG!)  and I really screwed up my scales (as usual.)  So yes Bobby did better than I did, He got 34 C's and no A's... so its not really THAT much better, and he had easy peasy songs. but still, its the principal of the thing.  oh well  ::sigh::  I've been doing a lot of "oh well-ing" and sigh-ing lately... does that tell you anything about the kind of mood I'm in?  ::sigh::  :-)   My parents are coming home tonight so I should probably go get some work done.  ::sigh::

      mmm.. I like this one better anyway So, we all knew I was going to do this.  Today is the day of my competition and I can't remember a note of either of the songs I'm supposed to play.  I can't even play my scales.  I am so incredibly nervous.  I knew I was going to screw it up.  Oh well.  and then I have to go and have lessons with my teacher right after that.  but then we don't get our results till next week, so she won't be able to yell at me for how horrible I did until then.  Bobby'll go and do incredibly well, and I will have SUCKED!!!!!  oh well.  This was supposed to keep my mind off of other things I didn't want to think about but now I don't want to think about this either.  I really need to figure out how to stop thinking all together.  That would be so much easier, no emotions, no intelligence, I envy those   people who are vegetables.   I think I would enjoy that blissful oblivion.  No such luck though I guess.  I've got to go though... guess why... Bobby wants to use the computer  (which makes sense, I stole it from him in the first place, but hey, it used to be my computer.)

      I went shopping today.  :-)  I bought two dresses, on sale.  heehee, its kinda funny, they're completely different.  One's like fire engine red, and comes just past my knees, sort of retro 50's-ish I guess, and the other one is white and has a huge full skirt of layered tulle, like a cloud.  Its really pretty.  I love trying on formal dresses.  They make me feel pretty.  like Maria...  {... I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty, and witty, and bright! and I pity, yes I pity, any girl who isn't me tonight...    sad, that I can type those from memory isn't it?}  anyway...  and I went to visit Rebecca and gave her her birthday present finally...  her birthday is in September. lol.  Tomorrow I'm driving to Rolla... I want to stay home and talk to my friends... well, everybody's leaving tomorrow too, oh well.  .:sigh:.   Last night, I had the most fun sitting in my room by myself I think I've ever had. {wow, that makes me sound like a pathetic loser doesn't it?}   I was on the phone with Samantha and Chantele... wow, I had forgotten how much fun we have when the three of us are together.  and I had forgotten how incredibly insane Chantele is.  We were joking around about her boyfriend Ben's evil laugh {which is incredibly scary}  so she calls him on her cell phone, and sticks it up next to the other phone and makes him do it over the phone...   Its even scarier that way.  lol.

      My family means the world to me. They've always been there for me, and I think I know that no matter what I do they will always love me. I have never been as grateful for them as I should be, but I will always love them too, and I would never consciously do anything to hurt them. I hope that I'm the kind of person who would never intentionally hurt anyone, especially those people who are so very close to me. I seem to have forgotten all of this though. Sometimes my frustrations get the better of me. I feel horrible. I'm sorry. I seem to have found a way to mess everything up lately. I'm sorry.

Won't you find me some water? Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline and collect a couple forks, hold them three feet apart and wait for lightning to strike to burn me up? Cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today. My head is swirling. It's been carried off in the sky and where it lands is where is lands. So I guess that I will get another head and then get on with my life and leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time. And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap. No, I'll just wear my insides. You want to know who I really am? Yeah so do I, yeah so do I. Cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today. Right now I am turning off the lights cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today.

That sort of deflated my "happy balloon" {wow, what a dork}  but I'm still in a pretty good mood...  I have youth group stuff tonight, and I'm hoping Sama and Chantele and I are going to see Legally Blonde 2 tomorrow night {just because we're really cool like that... we need a girl's night out anyway, what better way to solve that problem than to go  see the biggest chic flic ever??????}  and I was planning on going out Friday night...  but somebody decided he didn't want to pay his brother to drive him out to lee's summit >:-I  {jk... you know I luv you-- but you better get your insurance soon!!}  Saturday is my cousin's wedding reception thing, I guess... they had a little civil court house ceremony, and they're just having a party in some park in Rolla {yay!  more sun for Rachel... at this rate, i just might not be paper white when school starts}

      mmmm....  This past week has been really good.  I'm happy again.  {which is a good thing, because I eat more when I'm depressed}  I love my friends {I love you guys}  I spent all day yesterday having fun with Lisa and David and Stephanie, and then came  home, talked to Sama for an hour and a half, went to bed at like 8:45... I love knowing that there are people who really care about me, that I can trust.  I really am so happy today, I just want to wrap it around me, and curl up back in bed and sleep all day, being happy {because if I'm awake something's bound to ruin it} Of course I still have bad thoughts floating around in the back of my mind... but I'm not letting them surface at the moment.  I'll just deal with those bridges when I come to them :-)

I hate people who are inconsistant. {don't be inconsistant} I want someone to send me flowers... lol, just kidding. tomorrow i get to go to Worlds of Fun with Tiffany and Aaron and Stephen and Alex and maybe Jason  and all those people.  I'm excited.  I always have fun with those people..

      Oh, you should have seen the sunrise when I woke up this morning.  The sun wasn't even up at all yet, the light was just barely starting to reflecting off the clouds.  It was that blood red color that only the sunrise has, and there were only a few touches of it, it looked like paint brush strokes.  I wanted a fisheye filter for my camera to contort it, but those things cost a lot.

      I want to be superficial.  I have this song stuck in my head Sugarcult - Hate Every Beautiful Day lyrics Something's gotta change again I'm losing, my inspirations gone, oh no oh no Seeing through some different eyes I can't find, my medications failed, again again  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day  Faces in the crowd Fake smiles for miles My imitations wrong of them again Trapped inside this cheap hotel Bored as hell turing the channels 'round  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it I'm not the same, not the same lost my feeling  All I know I'll never know All I know I'll never know  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day Every beautiful day Every beautiful day Every beautiful day    It doesn't mean anything... just that I listen to this cd WAY too much

         urlLink This is my aunt's ranch.   I'm so random.  Oh my god.  I just found out that the brother of one of the guys i went to grade school with was electrocuted to death.  I never particularly liked Brady or his brother, but the guy was only 18... what a horrible thing to happen.  Its all in the newspaper too.  urlLink article   Crappy week.  I had fun last night at church though.  I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  {ask me about it some time, it was quite an amusing story}  funny isn't it? Tuesday night I was crying, Wednesday night, i'm laughing.   .:sigh:.  that's my life for you ;-) ugh.

      What can I say?     I have too much pride for my own good. My mom wants to know if anybody besides her knows how horribly depressed I really am. Do you know?  You can't possibly. I'm very good at hiding it.  I'm getting no where. I'm going no where. I need out of  here. There isn't anywhere to go?  Yes, I know I'm being vague.  Assume what you like. It doesn't matter anyway. Nothing matters anymore.

      so, I completely snapped last night.  I just really couldn't deal with the stress anymore. I don't think I've cried like that since I was five.  I was violently sobbing {as much as I hate to admit it}  and I couldn't stop.  I think I cried for almost an hour.  It was really horrible.  I feel better now though, I've released all that anxiety.

      There's an article in the paper about how three local golf courses' pro shops were broken into last night.  Its a mystery!  Just think, I could go, and gather clues... and be just like Nancy Drew!  I can see it now... My books would be green, instead of that weird yellow color, and the very first one, with a giant #1 on the front of it would be "Rachel and the Case of the Missing Golf Clubs".   wow, am I bored or what?  and my parents are gone too.  Too bad I don't have anyone to talk to.

      You know you're obsessed when the first thing you do after you get payed is go to the camera shop and blow 50 bucks, and a whole hour, talking to the woman who owns the shop about different developing processes... which I did, today.  and I'm still very excited.  I can't wait to go home and try out my new filters. wow... that really is sad isn't it?  They asked me to do a reflection on my relationship with God for a whole bunch of Middle Schoolers tomorrow night.  Supposedly I'm good at this kind of thing.    So I have a lot of thinking to do between now and tomorrow night.  {Note:  I STILL have D.C. Sleeps stuck in my head...  Its been what two weeks now?}

      darn.  We didn't win the lottery.   I would have had fun with 216 million dollars.  that's a lot of money I think I'm going miniature golfing with St. Robert's youth group tonight.  I haven't been putt-putting in forever.  lol.  St. Robert's is adopting our youth group over the summer since Cindy went a got a job with the state so she can talk to kids with REAL problems. lol.  But yeah Pat (LPM) and Josh (RDL) have apparently volunteered me to help out at St. roberts with this middle schoolers thing every night next week, and play volleyball Sunday night.  yay.  I'm excited.  I missed volleyball.

      think  happy  thoughts... {lol sound of music, favorite things... Rachel style} ...hmmm... late night conversations ;-) finding out something I didn't know before warm sunshine on my skin rain on my face sleeping in on Saturdays till noon zipping along in my car with the radio turned up ALL ThE WAY  {even though my speakers suck, so i can't turn the bass up all the way :-( } Bobby, when he's being a good cute sweet little brother {we're not even going to think about the bratty lil brother I've got sometimes... but ok... let me interject this story really quick.  Bobby has this program on his computer that came with a little camera, and lets you record and cut and edit video and all that, so he makes these movies with it.  He's getting really good at it.  the other day he did one that was a talent show, but it was all him, with different hats etc. on... lol  it was hysterical.  I can see it now, he's gonna be the next Steven Spielburg.... lol and I'll be nobody.}  anyway... moving on... happy thoughts... getting flowers, even if they are crazy colored and make me think I'm delusional watching the patterns of light change in the forest as the light filters down through the leaves being loved doing absolutely nothing and knowing that there isn't anything i should be doing while I'm doing nothing. {Not that that happens that often...  I should be doing other things right now...  like working... oh well} having money spending money knowing I'm really lucky and should be grateful for all of the above.  We're going to be in California the first full week of August.  I think we're leaving on the second. I think that'll be ok.  I miss people, but I'll get to spend time with my family, and we're going to go tide pooling...  Did you know those are some of the most diverse self-contained ecological systems in the world?   Can you tell I'm excited?   My dad thinks I should go and shoot all black and white film, and mess around with different filters and stuff.  I think I'm going to like this trip.   Maybe eventually I'll get my dad to set up my dark room for me and I can actually start on my college portfolio.

      The wise man is he who possesses a torch of his own; He is the guide and leader of the caravan. That leader is his own director and light; That illuminated one follows his own lead. He is his own protector; do ye also seek protection From that light whereon his soul is nurtured. The second, he, namely, who is half wise, Knows the wise man to be the light of his eyes. He clings to the wise man like a blind man to his guide, So as to become possessed of the wise man's sight. But the fool, who has no particle of wisdom, Has no wisdom of his own, and quits the wise man. He knows nothing of the way, great or small, And is ashamed to follow the footsteps of the guide. He wanders into the boundless desert, Sometimes halting and despairing, sometimes running. He has no lamp wherewith to light himself on his way, Nor half a lamp which might recognise and seek light. He lacks wisdom, so as to boast of being alive, And also half wisdom, so as to assume to be dead. That half wise one became as one utterly dead In order to rise up out of his degradation. If you lack perfect wisdom, make yourself as dead Under the shadow of the wise, whose words give life. The fool is neither alive so as to companion with Isa, [=Jesus] Nor yet dead so as to feel the power of Isa's breath. His blind soul wanders in every direction, And at last makes a spring, but springs not upwards.                                    Rumi   I've got that song {D.C. Sleeps...

      mm...  I was going to rant about time/clocks/watches... like what it says about our society that we are so dependent on time that we all carry little miniature clocks around on on our wrists {or in several other forms as well}  but I suppose thats just me being ridiculous {again}. I found a cool old watch in our basement yesterday, that's why i was thinking about it.  Anyway...  Lately I've been extremely jumpy, even for me.  My mom reached over and patted my arm at dinner last night and I MAJORLY freaked out.  It scared the crap out of me.  I woke up last night virtually in tears... I keep having these dreams that bad things are happening to the people I love, and there isn't anything I can do. {there isn't ever anything I can do... not even in the waking world}  I couldn't go back to sleep, every muscle in my body was tensed up... so much that I'm still sore.  once again, I wish there was a way I could prevent my dreams from coming.  I need real sleep.  I don't know when the last time I had real, solid sleep was. {well, I guess it was when I was heavily sedated last week... }

      So, I guess its kind of like this... I already told you I've fallen to pieces, except the pieces are still together, just broken, and it takes every ounce of my being to hold the pieces together.  And every ounce of my being is tired {exhausted} of holding the pieces of me together.  I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.  {too bad I don't have any other choice.} There isn't anything else left.  I know what could put me back together {two things actually}  but neither look about to happen in the near future.

      My name is Rachel.  {duh, we already knew that.}  rachel is hebrew, and means ewe {ya know, like a mamma sheep} Ewe also somehow converts into meaning lamb, or mother...{those are other quote-unquote definitions of Rachel}  So, I'm supposed to be lamb-like, and motherly {I suppose that's rather amusing isn't it?}  so I was sitting here, looking at my name on the piece of paper in front of me, and I realized just how hebrew my name really is, I mean, look at it... Ra-chel...  those aren't normal syllables found in our language.  And since my name is hebrew, the language of the Israelis, or used to be the language of the israelis.. am I supposed to be devoted to the israelis, and scorn the palestinians?  {am i really jewish???} The more I look at it the weirder it looks. {rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel}  Hey that [ wow...

Why so green and lonely? Lonely, lonely…  Heaven sent you to me To me, to me…  We are accidents waiting Waiting to happen  We are accidents waiting Waiting to happen

      peaches are the nectar of the gods.  mmmmmmmmm...  Sometimes, when I'm laying awake at night, in the ungodly hours of the twighlight morning, I forget things...  and remember other things I had forgotten before. I remember.  remembering isn't always a good thing. That's when I fall asleep, I fall asleep to forget again, before I do something I dare not. before I do something drastic.   I'm rather anxious about starting the new school year.  I want to know if its going to be  a good or bad year. I want to know how things are going to be now that they're different.

Really sad. By the way, its common knowledge that more people with great goals and aspirations die young.

      Ok, so this is the last time today, I promise...  I'm just being really REALLY good at procrastinating. Tomorrow, I will only post once, because I have five and a half pages to pull out of thin air. {that's a lot of work you know}  In a minute, I will go to my room and sit and read the book I am reading.  It's called "my legendary girlfriend"  which is... quote-unquote "a novel for those who have dumped, been dumped, or live in a dump."  that in of itself was enough to get me to pick up this book at the library.  I've only read the first page though, so I can't tell you if I like it or not.  Speaking of books though... I thought this was interesting.  {I don't neccessarily agree, I just thought it was interesting.} "'So one time when I was working in this motel one of the toilets leaked and I have to replace the flapper ball.  Here's what it said on the package;  I kept it till I knew it by heart:  'Please Note.  Parts are included for all installations, but no installation requires all of the parts.'  That's kind of my philosophy about men.  I don't think there's an installation out there that could use all of my parts.'   Lou Ann covered her mouth to hide a laugh.  I wondered who had ever told her laughing was a federal offense. 'I'm serious, now.  I'm talkin mental capacity and everything, not just parts like what they cut a chicken into.'  By this time she was laughing out loud.... 'They can always use a breast or a thigh or a leg, but nobady wants the scroungy old neckbones!' 'Don't forget the wings,' I said.  'They always want to gobble up your wings right off the bat.'"   The Bean Trees  Barbara Kingsolver  Isn't that interesting?  Rather ironic I suppose, but I love ironicizims... {yes I know I'm making up words, but hey, its my blog}  I need to go back and start reading Kurt Vonnegut again. Good-night.

      Sometimes, I swear this song is about me. 3am  Matchbox Twenty  she say it’s cold outside and she hands me my raincoat  she’s always worried about things like that  she says it’s all gonna end and it might as well be my fault  and she only sleeps when it’s raining  and she screams and her voice is straining   (chorus)  she says baby  it’s 3 am I must be lonely  when she says baby  well I can’t help but be scared of it all sometimes  says the rain’s gonna wash away I believe it   she’s got a little bit of something, God it’s better than nothing  and in her color portrait world she believes that she’s got it all  she swears the moon don’t hang quite as high as it used to  and she only sleeps when it’s raining  and she screams and her voice is straining   (chorus)   she believes that life is made up of all that you’re used to  and the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days  she thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway  but outside it’s stopped raining   (chorus)   Are you asleep?  would you tell me if you weren't?  what if I needed you right now?

      so much for sleeping...  I know what time it is... I know what time it used to be. I think maybe I know what's happening. I think I just like pretending I know. I know how things are supposed to be, and by golly, I'm gonna make 'em that way.  Do you think reciting the things I think/know makes me feel better? Perhaps once they leak out of my head, I no longer have to think/know them. and then I can think/know other things. Perhaps. I like that word... its so hopeful, in a sort of not going to happen sort of way. Perhaps.

      This is that Sylvia Plath poem I was talking about.  Tulips                 Sylvia Plath        The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in   I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly   As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.   They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.   Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.   The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,   They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,   Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   So it is impossible to tell how many there are.   My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.   They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage -   My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.   I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.   They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.   I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.   How free it is, you have no idea how free -   The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,   And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.   It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.   They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,   A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.   Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me   Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,   And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.   Before they came the air was calm enough,      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.   Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   They concentrate my attention, that was happy   Playing and resting without committing itself.   The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes   Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.   The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,   And comes from a country far away as health.

      So... I had another one of those dreams last night...  except this time it was {or at least I was telling myself it was} my fault.  Bobby and I were driving somewhere... on the highway, and all of a sudden a car come flying up an exit ramp, and of course, we were right at the end of the ramp, and I was boxed in, so there wasn't anywhere I could go.  It was like it was in slow motion, and I could see the car coming careening drunkenly at 100 miles an hour towards Bobby.{no not towards us... towards Bobby, that's what I was thinking.} The other car slammed into Bobby's side of the car, and we got pushed into the car on my side too... so I've got blood all over me, and I can see Bobby disgustingly mangled... so I pick up my cell phone, and call 911, but I'm so disoriented I have no idea where we are, so all I can do is cry   Help me, help me, help me help me help me, and then I blacked out.  Then I woke up in the hospital,and there were all these people in my room, and it was all white... {reminds me of a Sylvia Plath poem... I'll look it up  in a minute}  but the second I realized what happened I was screaming for Bobby... WHERE IS HE????  BOBBY  BOBBY... WHERE IS HE??  and everybody just sort of looked at each other, and somebody was said something like "hes in a better place now..."  I was sobbing, sort of chanting under my breath... no.. no. no. no.. I woke up choking on my tears/screams... Its a good thing nobody was home to hear me.

      mmm... strawberry tea for breakfast. Tomorrow I think I will be depressed.  Tomorrow is orientation...  which means I need to get my shiz-nit together, and stop being such a lazy bum...  which reminds me... I still have a TON of schtuff {MY WORD!} all over my room, and I have six pages to write before tuesday, AND I have to vacuum the downstairs for my mom... oh, and I need to wash my hair...{I got pancake batter in it this morning... just because I'm THAT GOOD!!!}  The other day, I was screwing around on the phone with Samantha doing the ditzy voice {yes also known as the "Hi, I'm Baby, don't you wanna slap me?" voice... DON'T ask!}  and Sama was like... you're way too good at that... maybe its because that's like the anti-you, and you just have to get all that out of you somehow.... And some people would say that's the epitome of me.... hmmm.. yup, I'm rambling... I think I'll go now.

      well, today I went to church and talked to the music director for  two and a half hours... then I went and got my mom some lunch, and picked up my mom's book at the library.  When I got home I did laundry.  Sean came over at 5, and we hung out, and watched Moulin Rouge...  Amanda's having a show friday, Underdog Conspiracy, and Fed Up are playing, and I don't know who else, Amanda said six or seven bands... its from 5-10... you should all come.    I like daisies.

      Ok, so I'm going to post some more. Honestly I really am happy. I love my life the way it is right now. I suppose some people might think I'm kind of odd saying this, but I feel like I'm doing what God wants me to be doing.  This is where I'm supposed to be.  I'm so happy to have the people that I love so much, who mean so much to me.  I'm happy to have the tasks I have to be doing.  People keep telling me I go around looking like I'm glowing, because I'm so happy.  This world is too beautiful to waste my time here being unhappy.  When I was at World Youth Day, Alexandro {a guy we met there...}  called me 'the Smiley girl'.  At the time I thought that was an insult, but now I see that it was really an extremely nice complement {well, he didn't mean it that way, he DID mean it as an insult but hey...} I wish I could give people little slices of sunshine, and rain showers with a little thunder on the side... maybe a few hugs and a kiss, a years supply of friendly smiles from people you don't even know, and perhaps then all people could be happy like me.  I'm still telling you too much.

      Random somewhat ironic thoughts in my head:  1. I try to be understanding...  but there is only so much I can comprehend.  2. Every time you try to slam a door in my face, a window swings open.  Its funny how words bounce around in my head like that, until they run into each other, and hook up into at least semi-comprehendable phrases like that, until my thoughts become a constant refrain of these words, and I have to get them out.  Sometimes I think I know too much, sometimes I think I see too much.  Sometimes I think I think too much, and sometimes I think I'm blind.  Its also funny how words bounce around in my head, and I can't let them out, because then I would be saying too much... Or maybe I would be saying just enough, but then I would be feeling too much.  There are things I want to explain to you, but I'm so bad at this.  I told you that didn't I?     There are lots of things I wish. Silly things, I should be glad to be the way I am... I'm not unsatisfied with the way I am, but sometimes it just seems like, if I were a little different... if only I could just...   then everything would always be perfect.  Wouldn't it?  I told Sean maybe I'm pouring too much into this.  I think I'm right... you can see too much of me here. and that's dangerous.

      Yesterday was a very very long day... and I was really crabby for most of it.  We had to go uniform shopping for Bobby, and we went about ten different places to find the right size.  We were at Oak Park mall for a while, so when Sean called me, I told him to come save me.  About ten minutes after he got there, my parents decided that we were done shopping, and that I had to go home with them...  so then I was in an even worse mood...  but then on the way home I asked my mom if it would be ok if Sean just came to the house and we hung out there for a while, and she said that'd be fine... so Sean came over to the house, and had pizza with my family, and then we sat out on the back patio until he had to go home.  So I didn't end up going to bed in a bad mood, and I woke up in a REALLy good mood this morning. ;-) Today I have to practice my harmonies for mass tomorrow.  Otherwise I might mess up, and THAT would be bad. I'm hungry... I'll probably post more later....

      From the Pratt Institute of Art book I got in the mail today:  "How do you see the world? Here's a simple test: Find a plain cardboard box.  Cut a rectangular hole in one side.Put the box over your head, and look through the hole.  Now, what do you see, or more to the point, how do you feel?  Boxed in, limited, or claustrophobic? Or do the edges of your box suggest new ways of looking at the world, of isolating and composing elements, of telling a story?  Okay, you can take the box off y our head now.  It may seem like a silly exercise, but the truth is, most filmakers and photographers live their linves in that box, shaping individual images and whole worlds within those few simple lines.  The experience isn't limiting... its liberating."  YAY!!! That's how I feel... I see the world through a BOX!!!!!!! that sounds horrible I know, but I LOVE IT... love it more than anything...

      ugh  I had forgotten,   You don 't know  who I really am  So don't think any differently   of me than you did before.  Ignore the little glimpse of darkness, It's just   a little piece of me  If only I could laugh   like Lauren Krum  You would laugh too  and forget the little piece of me you saw

HYU... I already can't wait till next year! {except my mom's threatening to not let me go because they're hoping to let me go to photojournalism camp at Corcoran next summer} 2.The couple of times I spent on the phone 3-way with Sama and Chantele... oh wow. 3.getting my car :-) 4. ...going tower climbing with St. Roberts... THAT was cool.... I climbed like 55ft up in the air, and then jumped off the top... WHEEEEeee!!! 5. when Sama came over and taught me how to make guacamole... 6.going swing dancing with Sean and Meghan, 7. playing in the rain with Bobby... back when it DID rain...{Sean LIED to me last night and told me it was going to rain, and I got all excited, and it didn't.} 8. prayer jams at St. Robert's 9.going to Thoroughly Modern Millie with my dad 10. doing the Excited About Christ week at St. Roberts...  that was the weekend Sean came over for the prayer service , and then afterwards we went over to Tiffany's house to go swimming, and I got thrown in fully clothed.  oh that was probably the best. 11.going to world's of fun with David, and... yet again, the St. robert's people 12.going to california with my family 13. The day Chantele and Sean came over, and we went swimming and screwed around all day. 14.going to see the Sound of Music with Samantha, 15. and Samantha's birthday.  wow, its all me hanging out with the same people...

      Today was another good day.  I drove to school and got my schedule changed... well that wasn't so good, but I'm not going to think about that right now, and then I had a liturgy planning commitee meeting and I got to see Katherine... I love her SO much.  And I talked to Samantha and Chantele both today... I had lots of stuff to tell them... and then I met with Fr. Don tonight, and talked about the youth group and a scholarship I got from the parish, and liturgies and other general topics.... THEN I had my first cantor practice for mass sunday.  Yes, I will be singing at noon mass on Sunday... I don't think you can even BEGIN to understand what a big step that is for me.  but I talked to the music director, and she wants us to get more youth music started and wants me to help.  So give me two weeks and I'll have St. John's whipped up into tip top shape for youth ministry!!!!!!!!!  Don't you just HATE having to do everything yourself? anyway, I'm excited about my general prospects for the future, I can't wait to see the new journalism room at school, and hopefully I'll get to see more of Sean once school starts, and I'm already over in that direction anyway, and I'm praying I won't be so stressed out at school this year  {I won't have to worry about the social issues I did last year} and NCYC is in November, and hopefully I'll be getting to sing lots of fun songs at church now....  la la la la la la la!!!!!!!!!

Don't let me forget!  except we probably won't buy it... my mom has to wait until she can buy all three of them together... .:sigh:. but I'll go rent it and then watch it eight times.  I can't wait till the Return of the King comes out... will you come with me to go see it?  I'll probably have finals or something that day... I did last year, but Chantele and I went afterwards.  I was looking at pics and stuff though, hee hee... Eowyn's still my favorite.

      I miss Italy...  it was so beautiful, and there was so much to take in.  When I'm in college I'm going to spend a summer there, in Bologna... no commercialized English speaking cities for me...  I was fourteen when we went before...  I don't think I really quite understood what an incredible experience I was experiencing {don't you love repetitiveness?} The culture in Europe is so much richer than what we have here... Thinking about it makes me feel shallow... Am I shallow?  I'm pretty sure I am.  Seriously... I'm sixteen years old, and incredibly naive, and I intend to stay that way, and if being shallow is the  price I have to pay... .:sigh:. oh well.  see look, I'm so shallow I can't even stay on topic...  but then I'm famous for my ramblings aren't i?  ANYWAY... and someday, I'll go back to Italy for Lent/Easter, and go to the Carnevale, the Venician version of Mardi Gras. Its amazing, people get dressed up in incredibly ornate costumes and everybody wears masks, so you never know who you end up partying with, and people, because everyone's wearing masks, do things they'd never do as an ordinary person... doesn't that sound like something I'd do?  The piazzas and vias of Venice {Venezia} are filled with an incredible mix of the most vibrant colors, and the sounds of laughter and singing and music...   and after then go to the Duomo basilica in Florence for Easter Sunday mass... they light fireworks during the mass.  i thought the italian guy was lieing to me when he told me that, but apparently he wasn't.  and I suppose that's enough of my hopeless dreaming. Last night after I posted I sort of got in a bad mood again, so I went and listened to "The Best Deception" like eight times  Well don't you see, don't you see that the charade is over? And all the "Best Deceptions" and the "Clever Cover Story" awards Go to you So kiss me hard 'cause this will be the last time that I let you You will be back someday And this awkward kiss that screams of other people's lips Will be of service to giving you away To giving you away  I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers I'll be all right when my hands get warm Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing I'd rather you'd never heard my voice  You're calling too late, too late to be gracious And you do not warrant long good-byes You're calling too late You're calling too late You're calling too late   {Dashboard confessional of course}  and then Sean called and made me laugh, and we talked for a couple of hours...even though he had to go to school today :-P after that I felt a lot better ...I fell asleep smiling. ;~)

      mmm... fun. So, we went to applebee's...and Sama and Chantele and I all ordered salads... and I just made Sean eat the rest of mine...and then the applebee's people all came out and sang to Sama, and we all went back to Samantha's house.  I love that house, that family, really... I feel more at home in that house than I do anywhere else besides my own house.  We messed around for a while, Chantele tried to pluck Sean's eyebrows while I was sitting on him, which was just mean, but Samantha caught her just in time. I'm content.... well sort of anyway... there's always school starting, and other things making me anxious/excited.  Sama call me if you read this tonight... I need to talk to you.  Having the three of  you right now means the world to me... I'd never be where I am right now. mmm... I thought I was done, but the plot continues to thicken... its so thick its dried concrete, and I'm standing on it now.  standing on it laughing at you.  you can't do it. and suppose you think its you I'm talking about...  don't be so selfish... do you think you're the only one I think about?  of course not.  Someday  I'll slap some sense into you pretty one... but right now I need you where you are. but I sound mean that way... I have to harden myself sometimes... eventually... "You need to be more harsh..." I think I'll go to bed.

      happy birthday to you... happy birthday to you...  happy birthday dear Sama, happy birthday to you!!!  yay, I'm excited to go out tonight. except I really am exhausted... don't let me fall asleep in my soup! I babysat last night, and I told Sean that I'm never going to have chubby kids because I would never be able to lug them around all the time like that... seriously, I was only there for three hours, i can't even imagine all day everyday I started reading The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver.  I only read ten pages or so, but I was amazed at how fast that book drags you through different emotions, it goes from astonishment to pity to amusement to anger...

      I'm wondering what you think of when you think of me. won't you tell me? do you think the things you say? do  you laugh? I hope you laugh. I think of warmth, safety and yellow. I think of security, and smiles. I think of thorny roses, and mauve. Maybe you don't know. maybe I don't either. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? perhaps today I will be sweet and innocent. Do I dare be anything else? I think I'm rambling. broken thoughts. I've drifted in to vagueness again. but there are things that just can't be said. and so I release my thoughts like butterflies and watch them flutter away... Perhaps you'll catch them in your net... and read the patterns on their wings.

       Climb every mountain, search high and low Follow every by way, every path you know Climb every mountain, ford every stream Follow every rainbow, till you find your dream A dream that will need, all the love you can give Everyday of your life, for as long as you live   Sama and I want to go see Sing-a-long Wizard of Oz at the Lied Center in Lawrence...and Yo-Yo Ma, and the Miami city ballet... we need season tickets!  urlLink http://www.lied.ku.edu/    I am sixteen going on seventeen, I know that I'm naive Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet, and willingly I believe I am sixteen going on seventeen, innocent as a rose...   I'm getting over being annoyed with people at church calling me cute all the time... at least I know they don't think I'm ugly!!  I went to noon mass this morning by myself {I was a eucharistic minister.} and Mrs. Honkomp was there, and I talked to her for a while... She was there when I was born.  seriously. That church is full of people who have known me since I was born, and that really is a cool thing... but sometimes its a little scary too.  I also signed up to cantor at the noon masses...  I'm diving in head first!  AND I have a meeting with Fr. Don Thursday night to talk about this scholarship I'm getting from the parish, and a little bit about the youth group too....:groan:. He said that they'll be hiring a new youth minister by January...  JANUARY... there will be no point in hiring a youth minister by January, we won't even HAVE a youth group then... .:sigh:. oh well.   What would this day be like, I wonder What will my future be, I wonder...  It could be so exciting  To be out in the world to be free My heart should be wildly rejoicing Oh what's the matter with me  I've always longed for adventure To do the things I never dared Now here I am facing adventure Then why am I so scared  Captain with seven children... What so fearsome about that  Oh I must stop these doubts all these worries If I don't I just know I'll turn back I must dream of the things I am seeking I am seeking the courage I lack  The courage to serve them with reliance Face my mistakes without defiance Show them I'm worthy And while I'll show them...I'll show me...so...  Let them bring on all their problems I'll do better than my best I have confidence they'll put me to the test But I'll make them see I have confidence in me  Somehow I will impress them I will be firm but kind And all those children, heaven bless them They will look up to me and mind me  With each step I am more certain Everything will turn out fine I have confidence the world can all be mine They'll have to agree I have confidence in me  I have confidence in sunshine I have confidence in rain I have confidence that spring will come again Besides which you see I have confidence in me  Strength doesn't lie in numbers Strength doesn't lie in wealth Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers When you wake up, wake up!  It tells me all I trust I leave my heart to All I trust becomes my own I have confidence in confidence alone...  I have confidence in confidence alone! Besides what you see, I have confidence in me.

      I think I'm glowing right now. but I almost fell to pieces again. I know better than that now. I've learned my lesson. I learned it for myself. With a little help from  the divine signs sent to me. I saw them. They made me happy. and I am happy. and you can't take that away from me anymore. don't even waste your breath. I'm happy... so very happy. Thank you.

      oh yeah, I forgot. I watched "The Hours" with Chantele last night.  I LOVED it.  It made me cry, and you know how I am about things like that.  The  soundtrack was gorgeous, and the photography was enough to take my breath away.  It had an incredible attention to detail, and it was an extremely well made movie... four and a half stars out of five from Rachel...:-)

      mmm.... I had so much fun last night...  I really needed that.  Chantele and I went over to Sean's house at like six, and we just basically screwed around all night... listened to music, and just hung around ;)...and then I spent the night at Chantele's house.  You'd think that since she's my one of my best friends, and I talk to her all the time, we wouldn't find it neccessary to talk until four o'clock in the morning...  but we do anyway.  I think its something about the dark... its more conducive (sp?) to these conversations we have. Tonight I'm going to Starlight to see the sound of Music with Samantha... I'm excited.  It's going to be fun.  I haven't seen Sama in a while.  We're going to sing along with all the songs, hee hee.  we're in like the 34th row of the very very last back corner section, so I don't think there will be anyone around to mind. This is going to be a good weekend.

      Your Political Philosophy   According to your answers, your political philosophy is left-liberal.   Left-Liberal  Left-Liberals prefer self-government in personal matters and central decision-making on economics. They want government to serve the disadvantaged in the name of fairness. Leftists tolerate social diversity, but work for economic equality.  interesting...  lucky charms are yummy.

      So I've been a little depressed the past few days...  not near as depressed as I was before, but once again, I'm tired of being me...  having to deal with the things I always have to deal with...  I want to deal with someone else's problems for a while... surely I'd be better at than than stuck in this stalemate I seem to be in with my own issues.  I'm tired.  I want to be done for a while... I'm never done.  Oh well.  I'm going over to Sean's house tomorrow night for a party, and Chantele's going to come.  That'll be fun, I haven't seen either of them since before I left.  and I'm still looking forward to November too. Stupid scheduling people didn't give me an extra elective, next to newspaper... I have to have those credits or else I won't graduate!  so I have to get my schedule fixed.  I have four classes a week with Chantele first semester... and I'm thinking just four with Samantha too, because she's in the smart people classes... sigh... every time I think about that it makes me sick... I'm basically screwed if I want to go to a normal college, because my grades are crap, because I got jipped out of honors classes freshman year, and have been screwed ever since.  anyway...  I'll have four classes with Samantha... Latin III  I'm so incredibly excited to start that class!!!!  {that would be what is known as EXTREME sarcasm.}  I'm going to fail that class... miserably.  but no, I'm going to do well this year, I am NOT going to get stressed out... I will NOT worry about other people... I will NOT get stressed out... I will NOT get stressed out...  {that's one of those things I think, if I say it enough, I might actually believe it}  I will NOT get stressed out...   ugh. but school's still two and a half weeks away...{what? have I started my six page summer reading paper yet?  no...  Do I even have the book yet? no...   I will NOT get stressed out!}  lol. There are things I want to say... but I can't.  I'm afraid....   terribly so.  I would like to explain...but I can't.  That's too dangerous.  I'll end up broken hearted...   again. Nickelback's come out with a song called "someday"... ironic how that word haunts me.

      I have a fascination with light and the different ways it is manipulated.  Before I started school, I remember going into my parent’s bedroom in the mornings when the sun would shine through the prisms my mom had hanging in her window, and I would sit there warmed by the sun and watch the rainbows move across the walls as the day went by. {Pollyanna was always one of my favorite movies too}  When I was in sixth grade, I made my own kaleidoscopes for a science project, and experimented with number of mirrors involved and what angles they were placed at.  Now I have this infatuation with capturing light on film.  Digital cameras are boring; they have nothing to do with the light, all they do is translate real life into pixels.  With film, I can manipulate the way the light is recorded, by experimenting with different chemicals.  I can’t wait till I have my own dark room so I can learn the tricks of the trade.  I’m looking forward to going back to school, if only to be photo editor of the newspaper.  Last year, I really fell in love with journalistic photography when Mr. Thomas asked me to stay after school the day we had had a shooting at a house behind the school.  He handed me the staff camera, and walked over to ‘the scene of the crime’ with me.  I could feel the adrenaline pumping into my blood, pulsing through my hands as I tried to hold the camera steady.  We slipped into the taped off section for the press.  I felt so important… I almost actually belonged there.  There were reporters from news stations and local newpapers, and I was threading through them to get the perfect shot.  When the negatives came back everyone exclaimed over my pictures, and how good they were.. I wasn’t that impressed.  But Mr. Thomas helped me pick the best one to be printed.  {as the year went on, he spent a lot of time at the light table with me, helping me pick photos.  I’m hoping I’ll be cured of my self consciousness and be able to decide on the best photos faster this year… otherwise we’ll never get anything done.}  Anyway, the picture I had taken of the shooting ended up being published on the front page of  ‘The Dart’ {our school newspaper}  I don’t think I had ever been so excited to see my name in print, “Photo by Rachel Straughn”    Last week I was perpetually getting myself grubby crawling around places to get the perfect shot.  My mom kept yelling at me for laying flat on my back in the dirt to take pictures of the sequoia trees, but it was the only way I could get the perfect angle.  When we went to see the tide pools, I was wading around in them with my jeans rolled up to my knees, braving the dangerous crabs that were as big as my toe.  Of course I had my camera with me, but I kept a careful eye on the waves coming up behind me so as not to get my beloved wet, and that night I carefully wiped off all the ocean salt.  When we climbed up on Morro rock I wriggled into a tight crevice to get the perfect shot of the mountainous horizon framed by the crevice I was in.  I cried when I left a roll of film on top of our van. { I had been standing up out of the sliding door shooting pictures of the mama bear and cubs that we saw.}  It rolled off down into the valley.  I was a little consoled when my dad told me it happens to every photographer.  I got more than a little upset later in the week though, when my mom asked my dad to take some pictures of a waterfall instead of me, when I already had the camera.  She said, “I’m sorry Rachel, you just shoot film like its water, and I don’t want you to waste it.”  I think I got a little huffy after that.  I love every part of photography, everything from the so-called mundane cropping photos to be put in the paper, or flipping through negatives to shooting the pictures themselves, or seeing my name in print.  This is my dream.  I want to be buried with my camera.  Maybe they’ll decoupage my casket with the pictures I’ve taken… with my view of the world.  There have been many instances where I have wished I could show people the world in the way I see it, and with photography I can begin to do so. I only wish I could completely convey the emotions I feel or the things I remember when I see the images I capture.  Perhaps someday I will be able to that.  Perhaps someday I will be that talented.

      why is it that all of a sudden punk music is so depressing??   so won't you kill me? so I die happy...    I still love that radiohead song though...  {see the archives, from a couple weeks ago...}  I seriously listened to it over and over and over again on the airplane...  its weird how I get stuck on one song like that.  definately not normal...  {yeah, yeah... weirdo ;) }  so a lot of stuff happened while I was gone that I wished I could have been here for, but that's ok, I'm home now...  but now I feel unloved, Chantilly won't ever call me back, Sama's supposed to be home, but isn't when I call her... and Sean is incessantly mean to me...  poor Rachel.

      silence swinging by a thread to and fro and somehow the words echo before they are even spoken. it is raining now and  I would sleep curled in a corner feeling grey and cobalt blue tears tremble unheard these are my silent tears you will not know  such pain that crumbles my world. and my delicate iridescent orb of happiness is shattered again.  bent hairpins remind me of that which cannot be, and my fingertips are bloodied, slit open by my own  masochistic dreams and I wonder if  you know what that means. do you?  I might have told you, but now it is late, perhaps an eternity late too late, and whispered words pass away unheard, like the butterflies I loved too, butterflies and fireflies shattered with the green glass vase which is no longer green but blue a deep dark mourning cobalt blue

I love roses.    and more Margaret Atwood: you might get it, and you might not, read it all ok?: "And that is how we go on.  He asks a question, and I say an answer...Before, every word that came out of my mouth was as if burnt onto paper, and once I said a thing I knew I could never get the words back; only they were the wrong words, because whatever I said would be twisted around, even if it was the plain truth in the first place... But now I feel as if everything I say is right.  As long as I say something, anything at all...   I feel as if he is drawing me;  or not drawing me, drawing on me -drawing on my skin- not with a pencil, but with an old-fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end.  As if hundreds of butterflies have settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.  But underneath that is another feeling, a feeling of being wide-eyed awake and watchful.  It's like being wakened suddenly in the middle of the night by a hand over your face, and you sit up with your heart going fast, and no one is there.  And underneath that is another feeling still, a feeling of being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord.                     and inside the peach there's a stone."  That's not really how I felt, it just reminded me of that.  I'm much less dramatic about it.  I think that's everything.

      So I'm kind of behind on recent events, but I really don't feel like typing out every thing that's happened in the past week or so... it hasn't exactly been a good week...  I mean it CERTAINLY had its good moments, but in general, over all, I need a vacation...  already.  When's Thanksgiving? Ms. Dolan, my english teacher is kind of sad.  She's really cute, and really funny, and she's only like 28 or so, but she's single, and she seems really unhappy, in general anyway...  Today she was talking about how she has no life, and never goes out on weekends and stuff...  and she has this way of twisting her claddagh ring around rather wistfully... {yes Chantele, I took mine off, and put the demon ring back on, just because you wanted me too...  even though it doesn't really mean ANYTHING} anyway.. I think we should set Ms. Dolan up with someone, lol. oh, and I saw this old junky beat up sedan car with an NOS sticker on it... that made me laugh... {I can never remember what the s stands for though... its Nitrous Oxide  systems?   I dunno.  maybe I'll go look it up.}

      so I've been awake for two hours now.  I'm not quite sure what's the matter with me... but I don't really mind being up... I like it quiet like this.  and I like lying in bed, watching the waning moon cross the sky.  I also like feeling empty, and not being hungry....  its not like being anarexic, that's not what I mean...  I just like this feeling of emptiness, like if my stomach is empty, then I can be empty of everything else as well.  lying awake, its kind of like anything I want to be real, can be...  projected on to my ceiling or walls, or wrapped up in my sheets and pillows.   my sweet dreams are waking night-dreams...  and I don't want to sleep for fear of missing them.

        so I've been remembering how I used to be.  How I woke up in the mornings with a horrible sickening lump in my stomach... how every day I wished that I didn't have to get up, that I could just stay there and not have to deal with the world, and the people in it.  I kept promising myself that if I just stuck it through that eventually everything would be all right.  I had dreams of someday so distant that I knew they wouldn't come true.  I was suffocating, drowning, dying away. but then somewhere I found the strength to swim to shore, I was safe again.  and I'm so happy now, I love how things are now.  I can't get enough of everyday.  And there are a few people who mean so much to me, thank you, for everything.

      So I'm reading Margaret Atwood again... "Out of the gravel there are peonies growing  They come up through the loose grey pebbles, their buds testing the air like snails' eyes, then swelling and opening, huge dark red flowers all shining and glossy like satin.  Then the burst and fall to the ground." "If I am good enough and quiet enough, perhaps after all they will let me go; but it's not easy being quiet and good, it's like hanging on to the edge of a bridge when you've already fallen over;  you don't seem to be moving, just dangling there, and yet it it taking all your strength." --Alias Grace for other margaret atwood quotes see: June 6 and Jan 17

      So, I've been being really bad lately.  I've been saying things about people behind their backs, and I really shouldn't do that.  I'm being snotty and 'clique-y'. Mandy doesn't even consider me a friend any more because I've shoved her aside so many times to do stuff with Sama and Chantilly...  Alison Jaros has really been getting on my nerves with newspaper and stuff but still, I shouldn't talk about her either... I was teasing Chantele today about not having anybody to sit with since Sama and I had psat prep, and she was like... I have other friends... I'm not as picky as you are about the people I hang out with...   so maybe as much as I try not to judge people, or snub any one... I'm really bad about it.  That really bugs me when I realize stuff like that.  I don't want to be a bad person.  On a different note...  I was talking to Mr. Thomas about my photo column for the newspaper today, and he was like..."We need to figure out a good way to display the photographical genius you'll be showcasing this year..."  and I burst out laughing, and he was like...

      I told my chemistry teacher that I haven't been sleeping much lately, and she was like, " Rachel, that's bad!.  It's only the third week of school, and if you're already so stressed out that you can't sleep... you need help.  You need to go take a yoga class or something... and learn how to sleep at night."  I think I really am stressed out.  List of things I need to remember/have to deal with: Chemistry test tomorrow Latin test Monday Photo Editor Duties -shoot center spread pictures...  how do I get parents checking up on their kids if I can't use my friends?? -shoot my photo column -shoot internet piracy/are you addicted to the internet pictures -collect photo assignment sheets -keep track of what film goes where -keep track of who's shooting what story -make sure pictures are decent -scan all pictures into the computer -become queen of photoshop -make film canister labels continuing on... Church Duties -Thursday night rehearsals for cantoring -youth group -youth minister hiring committee -lector/eucharistic minister... {crap  I have to go to a retraining session tomorrow night!} -volunteer babysitter every tuesday night. -liturgy planning piano lessons every Monday night practice piano at least 30 min a day {YEAH RIGHT!!!!!} an average of 2-3 hours of homework every night does my car have gas? ...if I make the play {fingers crossed, but not getting hopes up} PSAT prep class darkroom class? ...friends {aka sanity} family {ack!} eat/sleep  {Heh, heh} liturgy planning committee at school {Where do I find TRACY HADEN?????} um... St. Roberts stuff...  I need to start practicing the music for the Oct. Contemp. Mass  ... and that's just all of the stuff off the top of my head...  I think I'm a little overbooked, what about you?  oh... and I forgot stuff like  HAVING A LIFE!!!!!!  and also add to that the fact that I memorized a 1min 30sec monologue over night monday... I'm meeting Allison during my free tomorrow to go through the newspapers negatives from last year... club registration is Friday, and I want to be president of Photography club I need to figure out what I'm wearing to Cindy's wedding... {I'm doing the guest book!} homecoming is in four weeks... I need to start putting my portfolio together if I want to go to college the NPDA is coming Oct. 25 {Saturday}  and I need to memorize the metric system by tomorrow... {except I think I've got most of that done.}  and my allergies are killing me and I'm exhausted.

I'm watching the black and white Nancy Drew... from like 1936...  the guy just said "gee that's swell..." lol.

      Notes on yesterday: I'm not sure you even noticed. I just can't. oh wow. obsessive compulsive {Smack!} indecisive?  of course.  So that was me being vague... and now I can tell you what happened... I went home with Chantele, and then Ben and Sean came over, and the four of us hung out... nothing TOO terribly exciting.  For some reason I have a tendency to sit in a corner and watch in situations like that. {which isn't really like me... I don't think.  Unless I've been lying to myself about who I am for the past four years.}  I think it might have something to do with the competition thing... taking myself out of the contest I don't want to be in... That is not one I have any desire to win. not that its bad... just not right, right now. I don't think I'm making any sense.  I'm going to go take a shower.

      You know what's really bad?  When its only the second week of school, and you're already so stressed out about school that you intentionally go to the library and get really dorky, girly books about dorky girly teenage girls...  who are dorky and girly {get the point?}  and always have adorable boyfriends, and do the most dorky girly things that are so stupid you laugh out loud in your bedroom all by yourself, when really you should be doing your chem lab instead of reading dorky girly books... and now, I'm going to go attempt to go finish my chem lab... or maybe study for the Latin test?

      I am fully and completely exhausted. Its a really good thing I have a late start tomorrow.  I think I'm going to go take a brief nap, and do my chem lab until Chantele calls me and tells me what the crap is going on tomorrow. {I want to tell you something...  I wish you already knew... but I don't know where to begin.}

      beyond my wants...   beyond my fears... what is this that I fear? what is this that terrifies me so? why so many questions? yes, yet another, ironic isn't it? the walls of my head are a prison. my thoughts prisioners,  held injustly, against their will. and with no crime no charge against them at all. so many questions? that curve and a final dot it mocks me. ?  and for some reason some reason {what reason?} I know that this is good. {though I may not be.} This is it this is now. oh, but whatever happened to yesterday? and when shall I wonder about this yesterday which is now?     so today was weird, I was in an incredibly good mood this morning... {maybe I just happened to start it out right}  but you know, having the homework piled on doesn't exactly keep your spirits up.    I did have a little brownie for breakfast today, but I guess it wasn't enough, because I really couldn't stand up right all day without blacking out...  I was so close to falling over on the stairs, and there were a ton of people behind me, that would have been really bad.  So I just kept walking, which is always good. I just got back from getting my new outfit for confirmation, and I got really excited because I actually fit in a size five pair of pants!!!!!!!!  Because before, my hips were too wide...  anyway, I'm sure you really wanted to know what size pants I can fit into now... horribly enriching content I've got on this site, huh?

      well, I really cried today... violent sobs, yeah all that... it was really bad.  Then I had to go to the grocery store all gross and splotchy...  That's what kind of a day it was... all gross and splotchy... I still feel gross.... once again though, nothing I do is ever good enough.  I'm never quite what I should be.  I'm never who you need me to be.  I am a miserable failure. I shouldn't have eaten dinner, I knew I wasn't hungry.    I did get to talk to Sean for a little while though, a little bit of an escape.    Then I had confirmation rehearsal...  Those people bug me so much...  all those guys I went to grade school with... yeah, the kind of guys that after they look at you, you want to go run and take a shower...  so then I felt even more gross...  but I talked to Kevin for a while... about how he cut my shoe laces off in first grade...  lol.   but yeah, so now I'm going to go take my shower, and then maybe I won't feel so gross.

      Ok, so I'm getting really sick of my parents freaking out every time I want to do something.  I wanted to see Sean this weekend, but my mom decided that I already had too much to do, and I haven't seen Sean for almost two weeks, which isn't fun.  and then I asked if I could go out with the St. Robert's people for a couple of hours, and I was going to be home before 8:30, and they still made the huge deal of it, and yelled at me and stuff.  I'm really getting sick of it. I'm sixteen years old, and I do have a life, whether or not my parents like it. and I want to live it!!!!!!!!! Chantele... we're all doing something next weekend.

       urlLink read my profound xanga entry   I'm getting paranoid that people really honestly don't like me. I'm not really so sure, but I just get this vibe that people just don't like how peppy I can be sometimes, how I'm always happy/smiling...  I think I lot of people think I'm a "poser" too... when I'm really not... I'm not "punk"  I don't have bracelets all the way up to my elbows or anything, but I really like a lot of punk music, and a LOT of my friends are "punk"  but I'm definately not a "prep" either... I dunno, I just get really dirty looks some times from people like Marcy and  Rose, who are both people that I think are very interesting... but I think they both hate me.... I dunno.  And Sarah was talking about my "giddy-ness" again today...   ugh.

      hmmmmmmmmmm......................?   You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   that's odd...

      Today was a good day.  I somehow managed to remember how to conjugate verbs into future tense in Latin, and after school I went in to talk to Mr. Thomas about photography, and showed him some of my pictures, and he really liked them.  He was like, "These are REALLY great Rachel." {take THAT silent bob} Mr. Thomas has sort of become my photography mentor.  He wants me to come in a couple nights after school so he can show me how to use Photoshop, and he's going to help me put together my portfolio for the NPDA thing.  I always feel so much better about my photography after I talk to him, and he always gets me so excited about it.  and my mom's going to sign me up for darkroom classes at the community college!!!!!!!!!!  I did get kind of depressed listening to Chantele talk about her art stuff today... its kinda hard to explain though.

      Interesting conversation I had today: Sarah was talking about how Chandler didn't seem her usual perky self today, and then she said, "well, but then again, nobody's very perky today... except for you Rachel, you're always perky.  I think you have an extra organ inside you that manufactures your caffiene for you."  and I said, "Wow, I must be really annoying then if I'm really that hyper all of the time..."  " Well, I'm not really around you that much, so its just kind of nice, you make me smile, but if I were around you all the time it might get kind of annoying."   Does that mean I need to tone myself down a little bit? I don't want to be annoying.  oh, and just in case you were wondering, my first day of school went very well compared to how I thought it was going to go.  I hope tomorrow is better though, since I have all the good classes tomorrow.

      So its that same question I've been asking since I was old enough to have my own identity {about third grade}  Who am I really?  and who do I want to be?  Do I want to be the person I know people want me to be?  because I want other people to be happy, and so I will be who I am to make them so?  Do I want to be the person I know my parents want me to be?  Do I want to be sweet and innocent?  Do I want to be strong and powerful?  Can I be both?  Do I want to be the person that can be depended on to always say 'Yes'? Do I want to be the one people feel protective of, and be 'babied' to a point?  Do I want to be the one who is wildly successful, though has given up every thing else to be so?   WHO DO I WANT TO BE?  WHO AM I NOW?  am I who I've heard people think I am?  Am I really the one who, {supposedly}  when my best friend is having her first child, will be in the amazon, connected by cell phone yelling support?  Am I the graceful beauty some people say I am, {though I see things quite differently}?   Am I as 'good' as I've heard others say?  {I know I'm not.}  Am I catty and mean?  Am I a fraud?  Am I just a brilliant pretender, so good I've even fooled myself?  Am I worth all the trouble?  Am I a horribly irresponsible child?  a slacker?  lazy bum {lol, yes}?  Am I really who you think I am?  Who is that?  Am I someone?  Anybody at all?  Who am I in relationship to this world I live in?  in relationship to the God I praise?  In relationship to myself?

      So I had another revelation while I was driving with the radio off tonight.  I was think about how we're supposed to be able to see the Aurora tonight, and I thought that would be the coolest thing ever to be able to see, I decided that I am meant to see all these amazing things that God has made, and that I just have this longing in the depths of my soul to see every miracle in this world that there is to see, and that I should do so... I just don't know how my catholic faith fits in with all that... its not like I can go to mass on sunday when I'm out in the ocean, or in the middle of Cambodia or something. I'm sure it'll all work itself out by the time I actually get there.

      I want for everything to just be fine for a while.  I want to not be yelled at every time I come out of my stupid room, I want to know that's its ok that I want to do what I want to do, I want to not have to drag myself out of bed to go to school, I want to just get up, and be excited to go, but I'm not.  I want to not have to think about anything for while, but there's always something... and if there's not, then I'll make up something.  I want to sleep through a whole night.  I want to be warm.  I want to feel safe.  I want to not have to worry about other people.  I want to know what you're thinking.  I want to know if you really mean it.  I want to just chill out for a while.    I can't wait for NCYC.  I need to go away from here, and be with people who don't know who I am and don't know all my problems, and with whom I can be who ever I want.  and I won't have to worry about what anybody thinks of me.  not even my parents, or my best friends.    I feel so encumbered right now. I want to be set free.

      So yesterday I went to the Kansas City Art Institute to have my portfolio reviewed, and I think it went really well.  Milwaukee and Cincinnati both really liked my work, but they said I need to start drawing...  so I suppose I'm going to start drawing... UGH!  Albany tried to accept me right on the spot, which was kind of cool, and then I was like... uh, I'm a JUNIOR.  so they changed their mind.  The lady from the art institute of chicago didn't like my conventional photography though, she liked the work I had done with my altered book...  So it was a very learning experience for me, and I'll be ready for this when it comes around again next year.

      So, yeah, now I'VE copied it... but I need to save it, because I think its something I should read every now and again. oh, and eventually I promise I'll catch up on everything that's happened... Teresian, etc...     Have you ever  wondered which hurts the most?  Saying something and wishing you hadn't? or saying nothing and wishing you had?   I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.   Don't be afraid to tell  someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you  might break theirs.   Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid  of losing what you already had with that person?   Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't.   You can't tell your heart what to do.   It does it on its own....when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.   Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?   Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.   Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?   We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.    But every time  we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.   Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.   Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could  have had.

      Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around? Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out? Things are never gonna be the way you want. Where's it gonna get you acting serious? Things are never gonna be quite what you want. Or even at 25, you gotta start sometime. I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. Now all I need is just to hear a song I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around? Are you gonna waste your time? Gotta make a move or you'll miss out. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about. Stick around nostalgia won't let you down. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about. Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. Now all I need is just to hear a song I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Crimson and clover, over and over. Crimson and clover, over and over. Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet? Started my rock 'n roll fantasy. Don't don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part? Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart. I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. So come on Davey, sing me somethin' that I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Here tonight. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine I wanna fall in love tonight.    So apparently this is the song of the week.  It's been stuck in my head since Saturday, and it keeps popping up places.  It seems to shove everything that I've been trying to ignore since June or so back in my face.   Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out?  and I can't pretend that nothing ever happened anymore.  Everything that happened with Andrew is over, I have no regrets for being with him as long as I was, and I have no regrets about leaving him when I did.  But a heart that has been shredded to pieces and scattered to the ends of the earth is not easily healed.  Stick around nostalgia won't let you down.  I am so happy where I am now, all the pieces fit together, I no longer have a stone around my neck...  But I still have that thought in the back of mind, that once, I did have that stone around my neck, and I know how very easy it would be to get it back.   I wanna fall in love tonight.   Sean means the world to me, and we have so much fun together, I wouldn't want to give that up for anything.  but I'm so desperately afraid, and I can't even imagine Sean putting me through some of the things that happened before, and I really do trust him... but my heart is scarred, and the walls that I thought had been broken down before almost seem stronger than ever.  I want to believe they're not, I want to believe that I have learned what a beautiful thing love can be... but I'm afraid to test it.  I don't want to question anything.  I want to accept things at face value, and believe that beauty {in this form called love anyway} is only skin deep.  BUT I KNOW BETTER.  Gotta make a move or you'll miss out. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about.  I know that nothing can stay the same forever, people change and evolve...  Chantele's figuring that out right now.  I know that I'm not going to stay the same and things will change.  I have to take charge of my life, and stop this...  I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. So come on Davey, sing me somethin' that I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Here tonight. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine I wanna fall in love tonight.    so perhaps we'll see...

      "It's dark as a stone in this room, and hot as a roasting heart; if you atare into the darkness with your eyes open you are sure to see something after a time.  I hope it will not be flowers.  But this is the time they like to grow, the red flowers, the shining red peonies which are like satin, which are like splashes of paint.  THe soil for them is emptiness, it is empty space, and silence.  I whisper, Talk to me; because I would rather have talking than the slow gardening that takes place in silence, with the red satin petals dripping down the wall.  I think I sleep...  ...Here I come, I am coming now.  You never obey me, you never do what I say, you dirty girl.  Now you will have to be punished.  It is not my fault.  What can I do now, where can I turn?  You must unlock the door, you must open the window, you must let me in.  Oh look, oh look at all the spilt petals, what have you done?  I think I sleep...  ...On the palm of my hand there's a disaster.  I must have been born with it.  I carry it with me wherever I go.  When he touched me, the bad luck came off on him.  I think I sleep...  ...When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered flass and splintered wood; like a house in a whirlwind. or else a boat crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard powerless to stop it.  It's only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all.  When you are telling it, to yourself, or to someone else."                               --Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood.

      I'm having one  of those nights. God is talking to me. I was driving to the grocery store, and I was playing some music, and was concentrating really hard on driving because it was raining pretty hard, and then I remembered our theme at school this year... "Presence"  and in talking about this theme, we've come up with different ways to apply this... Stopping and listening to others, or being present to them; presence of mind in class; or the Presence of God.  and we keep coming back to the idea of silence as well.  Like taking the time to turn off the music and listen to what God is saying to you.  So while I was driving, I turned off the radio, and cleared my mind... well, other than focusing on the road anyway...  and was thinking about how our church has just hired a new youth minister, which I'm very excited about, and praying that this is what is best for our church, and then I started thinking about how much my church activities mean to me.  There are two things in life that I'm passionate about.  Photography, and God.  {that sounds funny, doesn't it?}  and then I started thinking about what I want to do with my life.  I want so badly to be a photojournalist at National Geographic, and travel around the world, and see everything there is to see.  and in the past, I have applied this to my faith in the idea that I would be opening up the wonders of God's world to everyone. and that I would be able to help people less fortunate etc. etc.  but I also think I might have a vocation to the Church.  Probably not like religious life or anything {though I haven't ruled it out.. but I like kids too much I think}  but I think I would be a really good youth minister, and I have the talents for it, and I love every minute of what I'm doing now.  Just like I love every minute I spend behind a camera.  So something has come to distract me from my life's focus.  And God put it there.  So now what do I do?

      I'm in the best mood today...  and I had a lot of fun last night.  Sean came and picked me up around six, and then we went back to his house and had dinner... then we went to the dance, but we only stayed there for like an hour, and went back to his house, changed our clothes, and went over to Alex's house, and there were a bunch of people from HYU there...  Then we went back to Sean's house AGAIN, and stayed there till my mom came and got me.  ok, so I suppose it doesn't really sound like fun, but it was... I promise.  This morning I got up and went to church, and saw lots of people I know, Cindy was there and was telling me about her wedding...  That day is going to be a full day, I'm going to the Kansas City Art institute for a portfolio review... {UGH!  that's so scary}  and that goes till four, and I'm supposed to be back for her wedding by four... and then there's the reception, and then Sean's parish is having a lockin  that I'm hoping I can go to.  any way, and then on the way home from church, I was sitting at a stop light behind a mini van, and this really good song came on the radio {I don't even remember what it was}  but I was singing along, having fun, playing the drums on the steering wheel etc.  lol, and I look up, and can see the guy driving the mini van in front of me watching me in his rear view mirror, and then like four kids in the back seat all turn around to look at me...  it was really fun, I laughed pretty much all the rest of the way home... I'm such a dork...  I don't want to go to school tomorrow.  but our first issue of The Dart is coming out Thursday, so I've got lots of work to do.  I'm going to have to stay after monday and tuesday to get it all finished... but that's ok, it'll be fun.  I'm craving a grossly fat huge chipotle burrito.

      I think I'm having an identity crisis.  I feel like I don't quite fit where I did before.  I'm growing out of my old self, and some parts of my life are growing and changing with me, and some parts aren't.  As much as I hate to admit it, I'm growing up.  Like tonight, I went and interviewed someone for a job.  I , at sixteen years old, am making decisions like who my parish should hire for what jobs.  I'm not quite sure that's normal.  and I'm taking on normal high school responsibilities, like photo editor, prez of the photo club, liturgy committee, study groups.  Then there's normal school work...  believe me, taking eight difficult classes is NO FUN. Then there's always church stuff.  and I'm doing double time on that, juggling St. John's and St. Robert's.   and I'm really worried about Kate and Elizabeth, and I have two homecomings back to back {not that I'm not horribly excited, because I am, its just a lot of work.}, and THEN there's Cindy's wedding, and maybe a lockin.  AND I might have to go to O'Hara tomorrow night.  AAAAAAAAAAAAH!.

      I have way too much to do this weekend.  And I really don't want to do any of it.  I kinda want to go haunted housing with St. Roberts tonight, but I'm pretty sure I don't have time. I was supposed to sing at the  contemporary mass this weekend at St. Roberts, but when I went up there Thursday night, Mary Mueller was there talking to the NCYC chaperones... so I guess I missed practice, and I have to sing at noon mass on sunday anyway, so this is a good thing.   I'm SO out of every loop I'm supposed to be in. ugh.

      You know what I love? This song:  Switchfoot-- Meant to Live  Fumbling his confidence And wond'ring why the world has passed him by Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments And failed attempts to fly, fly  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside  Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open Maybe we're bent and broken, broken  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside  We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than the wars of our fathers And everything inside screams for second life  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live We were meant to live   You know what else I love? getting back my first roll of newspaper film, and the majority of them are really good, and they are ALL at least semi usable {can you say Photoshop?}  Ms. Rez calling me 'hon', which means she likes me, which is neat because she's one of my favorite teachers.  Mr. Egner stopping me in the hall to talk to me, even though he's never had me in a class or anything, and he knows my name because 1. he caught me reading National Geographic once, and was in shock...{I'm not sure why, but he was} and 2. He came up after Mass at school Friday and told me that the reflection I gave was one of the best he ever heard, and he said he wasn't lieing, even though I'm pretty sure he was.  ....and also on that note, that people are still stopping me in the halls to tell me they liked what I said Friday.  Five of my teachers STOPPED CLASS to tell me they thought I did a good job, and random people I don't even know stop in the halls between classes.  I was so scared people would make fun of me about that...    AH!  I have to go find Bobby a birthday present. {maybe more later?}

      THIS DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T CARE!  I  DON'T  CARE!   It's like playing the same cd over and over and you up hating just the first song because its the only one you listen to, and you just let the rest p  l  a  y        p  l  a  y       p  l  a  y  and I miss you,     horribly  I let the word roll across my tongue, so it sounds like I don't mean it.  It's like seeing the mirror, seeing  me  and the darkness that  disturbs  me residing under my eyes.   I stare with hatred at this one dimentional creature and the mirror   cracks    like lightning... broken, the bad luck already written across the palm of my hand, the palm I press against you, pushing  you away.  It leaves a stain, and I cry  myself to sleep.  Ironic, the connection,  the falling rain       falling down my face. singing me to sleep. yes::::::::::::::::::::::          s        l           e              e              p.     I wonder who  'you'  is. It could be  you   It could be the one. or it could be HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED {ha ha, harrypotter} because we just don't want to talk about it. You wonder if its YOU don't you? Sometimes it is.   A lot of times it is, but you can't differentiate, and it doesn't matter anyway.  There is a reason you don't know who you are.  You can't make the connections, the things you know about me.  Do you really know anything about me?  You. do.   You know too much, and yet still not enough  My maze {ha ha!}  perhaps you are lost.... of course you are, this is my maze and  I  don't even know where I am.

      Oh I wish for someone, for you For you whom my heart whispers to in night, When I am drowning in the darkness. You for whom my heart whispers silently… A sound so silent I feel as if I could not possibly bear yet another night of such roaring silence. How I wish for the sound of your voice that makes me smile… The words, the warmth that would bring me sleep.  But for yet another night I am shivering in the violent silence, And I cannot bear it any longer. I only want what is my own...

      I feel really good about the past week. I've been trying to be nicer/more 'good'  lately, because I was really starting to dislike my own personality.  Thus I had fun sitting watching movies with my parents friday night, I walked across the quad and had a very interesting conversation with Mattea {a girl at school a lot of people don't really like to be around}   Ali Sherman told me she though I was cool because I know what I believe in, and my faith is really strong, and yet I'm still willing to listen to other people's opinions. Mary Martha called me sweet. and I stood up... yes I stood up for Allison Jaros... THAT was hard.  I was ready to go in on her, but I somehow managed to stop myself.  In english Maggie and I were talking about misconceptions we have about people, and I was talking about some of the above mentioned girls, and then Maggie brought up Chantele...  oh and Rose was sort of in on this conversation...  and I was like, yeah a lot of people really don't understand Chantele, but there are times I want to slap her too... and Rose was like, Aren't you guys like bestest friends?  and I said, yes, there are times she wants to slap me too, and we're friends because when one of us needs to be slapped, the other one does so.... anyway.  Thanksgiving is tomorrow... as Mr. Thomas said in his Thanksgiving speech at mass yesterday... "turn the 'have-to's' into 'get-to-do's"...

      I'm sick.   ugh.   I think I'm dieing.  It makes me happier that we're staying here for Thanksgiving though... cuz I'll have time to recuperate...   but I think I'm going to have to help a lot with dinner, since  everybody seems to have something wrong with them...   and I have a piano recital in a week and a half, and I haven't really practiced  UGH!   Then there's something I'm not talking about because I refuse to mess with it...   oh, and I think I might go roller skating on Friday with Sama and Chantilly!  YAY!   and all I have left to say is...  .:sigh:.

I'll just wait and see which direction I am sent... or which direction comes to me...

      Ok, this song really is beautiful...  its a duet on Matt Maher's cd called "Set me as a Seal"  Set me as a seal on your heart, set me as a seal on your soul, for strong as death is love, unyielding as the grave.   Nothing will quench its flame...  nothing will quench its flame.  kiss me, my love that your name be on my lips. You intoxicate my being with the fragrance of your presence.   How beautiful you are my darling.  Show me your face, let me hear your voice.   Sweet as the dew in the early morn, like a lily among the thorns.  I looked for you, the one my heart lovew.  I looked for you, but did not find you.  I searched through the night until I rested in your sight.  NOw I will never let you go.   You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride, you have stolen my hear with one glance of your eyes.    Your lips are so sweet, adorned with honey.  My hands, they drip with myrrh.  Set me as a seal on your heart, set me as a seal on your soul.  For strong as death is love, unyielding as the grave.   Nothing will quench its flame.    I actually got to talk to Matt Maher at NCYC... which was really cool, and I told him I absolutely loved this song, and he explained to me that its not just about a boy and a girl, its actually about the relationship between God and the Church/his people, which I thought was amazing...  I've listened to this song like five times today... the harmonies are stuck in my head.  oh well.

      jazzboyj99 [7:43 PM]:  so have you recovered from NCYC   Soybeenchik847 [7:43 PM]:  not in the slightest     Soybeenchik847 [7:44 PM]:  I want to go back already     jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]:  lol    jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]:  why do you want to go back   Soybeenchik847 [7:45 PM]:  because I love that environment, where I can actually decide what I want to do for myself, and I love being around people who all believe the same thing I do, and I want to be WARM again     jazzboyj99 [7:45 PM]:  did you gain anything spiritually from NCYC   Soybeenchik847 [7:46 PM]:  Yeah to me, its real proof that what I live for is something real.  it just seems like 23,000 oeople who are that excited about that excited about their faith can't possibly be wrong     Soybeenchik847 [7:46 PM]:  *people     jazzboyj99 [7:46 PM]:  lol   jazzboyj99 [7:47 PM]:  i don't think any faith is wrong necessarily   Soybeenchik847 [7:48 PM]:  I suppose that's not really what I mean...  its just kind of like a support for what sometimes feels like I'm the only one that believes in it     jazzboyj99 [7:48 PM]:  ah i see   jazzboyj99 [7:48 PM]:  you go to a catholic school   jazzboyj99 [7:48 PM]:  how is that possible   Soybeenchik847 [7:49 PM]:  It just seems like most people don't really care... yeah they're catholic, but it doesn't really mean anything     jazzboyj99 [7:49 PM]:  so did you feel everyone in our church were as spiritually stirred as you were   Soybeenchik847 [7:53 PM]:  ok... well, I don't really know. SOme times I feel like maybe I'm a little too obsessed I guess... though I'm not sure that really makes sense... like maybe my faith means so much to me that it isn't really genuine     jazzboyj99 [7:53 PM]:  you don't have a genuine faith?   Soybeenchik847 [7:54 PM]:  I think I do, but sometimes I wonder if its not just me really needing something to hold on to, and overexaggerating my faith     jazzboyj99 [7:55 PM]:  why would you need something to hold on to   Soybeenchik847 [7:56 PM]:  because everything else that is important to me is really unstable     jazzboyj99 [7:57 PM]:  how strongly do you believe in the creed   Soybeenchik847 [7:58 PM]:  I think out of every part of the catholic church the creed is what makes the most sense to me     jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  then your faith is fine   jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  it outlines everything we, as catholics believe, and if you are in line with that   jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  i don't see a problem   Soybeenchik847 [7:59 PM]:  yeah...     jazzboyj99 [8:00 PM]:  it's good that catholicism is stable for you   jazzboyj99 [8:00 PM]:  a lot of times one's religion is a very unstable part of their livse, and for you to say it is stable, is very cool   Soybeenchik847 [8:03 PM]:  Its the one thing that has remained constant since the day I was born...     jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  so why this questioning of your genuine beliefs then   jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  you can never lean on religion too much, it represents so much of who we are and what we believe   jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  it impacts most of our daily lives   Soybeenchik847 [8:06 PM]:  because its something I've known since the day I was born... I never really had to work for it, it was just there, so how do I know its really real?     jazzboyj99 [8:06 PM]:  by applying to everything you do and living your faith   jazzboyj99 [8:10 PM]:  do you feel you do that   Soybeenchik847 [8:10 PM]:  I could always do better...     jazzboyj99 [8:14 PM]:  we all could   jazzboyj99 [8:14 PM]:  here's a secret, nobody is perfect   Soybeenchik847 [8:14 PM]:  really???     Soybeenchik847 [8:15 PM]:  lol     jazzboyj99 [8:15 PM]:  yep   jazzboyj99 [8:16 PM]:  are you bored with catholicism   Soybeenchik847 [8:17 PM]:  no, I'm still always learning something new that occupies me, and then I move on to something else...  Catholicism is so deep and complex, I don't think I could ever be bored with it     jazzboyj99 [8:17 PM]:  lol ok   jazzboyj99 [8:17 PM]:  i used to be really bored with it   jazzboyj99 [8:18 PM]:  i didn't start this youth ministry track till like my junior year in college   Soybeenchik847 [8:19 PM]:  I think living with my mom, and being as involved as I am at church, there's always something I'm trying to understand... if not specifically about catechism, or how the church works, about who God is, or how my faith fits in with everything     Soybeenchik847 [8:20 PM]:  see... that's what I don't understand...  how come most people don't really know or understand their faith until they get older, and my main occupation right now is my faith?     jazzboyj99 [8:20 PM]:  maturity maybe, something grabbed you, and you rode it   jazzboyj99 [8:20 PM]:  i never had any spiritual influences in my life   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  i went to church because dad made me   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  and when i got more involved in college, things kind of took off   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  for every person it's something different   Soybeenchik847 [8:22 PM]:  yeah, I guess     jazzboyj99 [8:22 PM]:  what bothers you about it   jazzboyj99 [8:23 PM]:  you aren't allowed to have such a deep faith at your age?   Soybeenchik847 [8:24 PM]:  I don't know... just compared to most other people, it seems weird     jazzboyj99 [8:25 PM]:  what about that one dude at ncyc who started freeing children at age 12   Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  see that's something extraordinary, and nothing I'm doing compares to that... I meant compared to people who actually seem real to me     jazzboyj99 [8:26 PM]:  lol   jazzboyj99 [8:26 PM]:  why do you have to compare at all   Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  because that's what being a teenager is all about...     Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  lol     jazzboyj99 [8:27 PM]:  what you think adults don't compare?   Soybeenchik847 [8:27 PM]:  lol, well, then its just human nature in general     jazzboyj99 [8:28 PM]:  maybe   Soybeenchik847 [8:30 PM]:  I don't know.... Catholicism has always facinated me... I remember in 2nd grade this kid calling me a walking religion book, and when my mom started working in the Religious Ed. office at St. John's, I'd go in there twice a week or so, and be like, "I have a question."  and usually neither my mom or the DRE knew the answer, but they'd help me look it up     jazzboyj99 [8:31 PM]:  so you think because you are ahead of your times maybe your beliefs aren't as strong   Soybeenchik847 [8:31 PM]:  or maybe I'm just a nerd...     Soybeenchik847 [8:31 PM]:  lol     jazzboyj99 [8:31 PM]:  i'm a nerd, but that's common knowledge   jazzboyj99 [8:33 PM]:  i don't think you should worry about it   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  speaking of being a nerd though, I should probably go finish some research for my theology paper     jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  i think your faith is fine, unless you are seriously doubting right now   jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  yeah, i have to study myself   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  no, that was freshman year...     jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  later   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  I wanted to be jewish     Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  lol     Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  bye

      For some reason I have a facination with what people think of me, or who people think of me as.  Yesterday Mandy said that I'm a good person, because I automatically like people, and she's a bad person because she hates strangers and people she doesn't know.  I told her she couldn't hate someone she doesn't know.  I find this intriguing.  She also told me that I should not be like her because she was a "sad model of a human being"  and that I should stay like me?  mmmhmmm...

      And so I'll promise you that none of this really matters. I've been saying for ages that its not that big of a deal.  I'll put in some excerpts from what I wrote the other day: {I can't put all, because then you might actually begin to understand, and we can't have that, can we?} I want, so very badly, to go away, to be gone, to hold my breath and disappear into nothingness, and for my existance to be forgotten.  Therefore, it wouldn't matter any more, nothing would.  You would have never known me, and been all the better for it.  This sickening knot would melt into serenity and would be no more.   Marbles roll across the floor to disappear between cracks in the floorboards, and pictures flicker across the movie screen which is the landscape of my mind.  Images which possibly never were, figments {a fig is a fruit, a fruit that was meant to be?} of my imagination.  Do I miss the fruit? I miss what used to be my reality, perhaps not a real reality, but mine all the same.  I've come to hate the sound of my name on people's lips.  It's inconsistancy tires me.... I also think  If I really were perfect, then everything would be ok.  Then I would know all the answers. This is merely my response... yet another piece of fruit.  I think of Margaret Atwood, and her heroine who drove off the side of a bridge in her sister's car, and with yet another piece of fruit {perhaps this time it is a pear}  I think of the girl's hands, gloves cuffed with lace, clutching the steering wheel. and I look up and see the lacey iron works of the side of the bridge... but my car is my own, and I have no gloves.  ...On the palm of my hand there's a disaster.  I must have been born with it.  I carry it with me wherever I go.  When he touched me, the bad luck came off on him.  I am awake now. I think of the questions they've asked. Are you happy Rachel?  I think  please, please don't say my name. and I say yes of course I am.  Things are going very well for me.  I smile. Is everything ok Rachel?   not my name.  my name. Everything's fine, why do you ask? Are you sure?  I feel the pressure, bugging out my eyeballs.  I blink.  Yes of course.  and I am craving a fig newton.    and I think I've already said too much, but I need someone to save me.  I need a piece of sanity. but it never seems to be enough. and its never the right person. there always seems to be more instead of less. and I am not thankful for this bountiful harvest. I feel as if I should be crying tears of something other than mere salty water, these tears should tears of lead, though their release doesn't lighten my load at all,  and I keep them to myself. You don't need to know this nor do I. There are things I wish I had never known things I wish I could forget. things I wish would cease their constant flashing across my mind. and I have nothing left to do there was never anything I could do. Perhaps I should be yet another depressed teenager restrained by drugs. or perhaps I will be alright,  just like I always am, and none of this matters, just like I said.

      So perhaps my puzzle pieces don't fit together the way I thought they had, and need rearranging. I feel like I'm always pulling away from everything.  For once I want to dive in head first. Sometimes I wonder if something happened to me, if I would start getting the answers I want.  Would I find out what really matters? Won't someone finally tell me the things I need to know?  Looking back, I've been asking so many questions lately. INEEDANSWERS.

      all I want is to be  at peace   at peace with my reason and my heart { Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point  do look it up, it might mean something to you... its french.}  I want to be free of this constant inner turmoil, and for the nightmares to go away.  I want to sleep at night... enveloped in the safety of... of something {I'm witholding things again.}  I can't make you understand... I can't make you understand how I can't cry anymore, and I fear I can't feel any more, that I've gone numb from this constant tearing.  I wake up in the middle of the night just in time to silence my coming screams, and in the dieing hours of the night, I remember things that by right are not my own.  I remember the nights I've died over and again.  The nights my wrists were slit, the nights my heart was gouged from between my ribs.  I do not understand this constant turmoil that you have bequeathed to me, why has this become mine, and how shall you save me from it, if you shall.  Why do I not believe a word that comes out of your mouth... why does it seem that each word drips with honey that instead of being golden sweet is bitter bloody red? and yet I long for the nights gone past when I was torn body from soul, and did not know the meaning of the word light, I did not know light or love, but I thought I did.  I thought I did and that was all that mattered.  I was safe locked in the dark dungeons of your heart, buried alive, but safe... and loved.  and that was all that mattered {Isn't it all that matters?}  It doesn't matter.  Nothing does. stumbling across things that remind me of you, the residue that you left, I find the words that made me smile, things I curse you for now, because I find that pieces still ring clear and true, and pieces are lies, all lies...promises made, the things I would never ask of you {or him either}  and I want to cry but I can't... why?  the threats, I've found those too, and I remember why, the swollen lump in my throat, the gasping for breath comes back all over again, and I remember why, I remember the pain... but there's still the pain I bear now, though different.  This pain is dull, like an ancient sword rusted away through ages of memory.  Your pain was sharp,  a sparkling dagger at my trembling throat.  I'm wearied of this hurt, and wish it to be no more...  I know you could kill this pain... but I fear you could bring your pain again as well.  These irrelevant familiarities kill me.  I know you too well, while I know you not at all.  You've always known that... always was a long, long time ago.  I was wrong then, and so were you.  Whose to say that things would be right now? {right now, not the future.}  Not the future, that you would not ask again the impossible of me.  Things you asked... the things I longed to do... the impossible.   and What of my dreams, my hope... my passion and will to live?  smothered and turned away... The trampled roses, blood red that I have nurtured to be more beautiful than before,  They shall not die. I am not quite who I was before.  I have learned not to fear the silence so.  I have learned that it is better to go than to stay, but to stay is neccesary if anything is to be accomplished.  I have learned what it is to be who I am, and I don't believe I could be bent like before {I don't believe, but I doubt, and that is my greatest fear.}  I don't understand.  that is all.  I don't understand.  ...and no, this time, I'm not alright.

      You know for a while there, I was terribly frightened.  I had returned {unto} my concious life, and realized that it was not genuine, as I had hoped.  Now I turn again to a little night music {Sondheim?} for a fragment of reality which is a figment of my imagination.  and now I am safe once more, wrapped in the hammock of pinpricks {light or perhaps pain}  but it doesn't matter.  yes, there it is again.

      its not what you think it is...  please I begged you  on my knees  what more did you want  you said  I can't make it stop  but you did  eventually  I haven't stopped  bleeding  bleeding for you  my soul pouring out  and draining away  draining into  your blue suffocating lungs  sustaining life.  You are breathing my blood.  and I shall die.  I can feel you  when you're never there  I can feel your blackness creeping into the depths of me  I can feel your blackness choking... drowning me  drowning in you    and honestly, I just don't understand this.  My life seems to be going around in circles.  I'm standing in the same place I have been for the past year, and I find myself wondering the same questions I've been asking for ages now, and still I am left completely without answers. I DON'T understand, the only thing I've come to realize is that this is not how things are supposed to be, and I have no idea how to change them.  The only thing I can depend on being consistant is me, and God... I feel like God's telling me something, but its like the message is in an ancient language that was forgotten ions ago, that no one can help me understand.  Even my blog entries seem to be repeating themselves.  Going back through my archives, I see the same questions {?}, the same longing {unquenched thirst} for answers, and the same empty {gaping} holes waiting to be filled with the missing pieces.   pleasepleaseanswers

       She said   "don't, don't let it go to your head  Boys like you are a dime a dozen,  Boys like you are a dime a dozen"   She said   "you're a touch overrated,  you're a lush and I hate it  but these grass stains on my knees  they won't mean a thing"    She says  it's cold outside and she hands me a raincoat  She's always worried about things like that  She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault  And she only sleeps when it's raining  And she screams and her voice is straining    She says  baby  It's 3 am I must be lonely  When she says baby  Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes  Says the rain's gonna wash it away I believe it    She's got a little bit of something,  God it's better than nothing  And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all  She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to  And she only sleeps when it's raining  And she screams and her voice is straining    She believes  that life is made up of all that you're used to  And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days  She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway  but outside it's stopped raining    She dreams  a champagne dream Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper Lavender and cream Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her She says that love is for fools who fall behind   she woke  in the morning she knew that her life had passed her by. and  she called out a warning , warning "dont ever let life pass you by."   She screams  in silence  A sullen riot penetrating through her mind Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self control   She's figured out  all her doubts Were someone else's point of view Scream at me until my ears bleed I'm taking heed just for you    She says  I’m not her man She says it’s not that way I cannot remember what she says I hear the trumpets blow I hear the music play And I hear most every word she says   She says she’s not afraid  to be on her own And I should not worry where she’s gone But she says she cries when she’s alone And she’s still alone   She can  turn me in I can do the same And everybody disappears She can turn me round She can scream my name And I don’t even hear her tears  And  she had to know  it would be like this But it’s not as bad as she thinks it is And she says she cries when she’s alone She’s still alone  It’s a silent world and I don’t belong And she must have known that all along   She’s an ancient queen  In a modern land I just want to take and hold her hand I do what she says It’s the least I can And she wants to know who I think I am  But she says she cries when she’s alone And she’s still alone   And she says  its over now I hope you see And she wants to rid herself of me But she says she cries when she’s alone and  she’s still alone    and tell me, why does every thing always have to be so hard?

      ...this makes me laugh... I saw Taylor Hill at church today...  I haven't seen him in a long long long time...  that all seems like it was ages ago...  It almost makes me want to say that I miss him, and maybe I do, but I won't say that... just like I won't say lots of things.  This really does feel kinda weird, but it feels good too.  I haven't been really single for almost two years, and I'm intending to enjoy it now. .:excuse me, my favorite song just came on the radio{bush, glycerine}:.  anyway... I like feeling like I am completely independent, and that I don't need  anybody  to make me happy.  I am completely self sufficient... and I'm starting to think that relationships in general are a bad idea, somebody always gets hurt, no matter what happens. so maybe I will stay single... at least until college...  but there's nothing wrong with friends with benefits right? but you know me, always lieing to myself. the next guy that comes along, that happens to be to my liking...  I miss feeling loved, and knowing that somebody is thinking about me...  and I miss feeling safe wrapped in someone's arms...  and having somebody to talk to, confide in, laugh with...  but it doesn't matter... I can take care of myself, I don't need anyone.

      What if someday, every thing I want is no longer what I want?  What if I find myself in the middle of Tibet in a buddhist monestary, on assignment from National Geographic {I can't even begin to make you understand how wonderfully beautiful that sounds now} and I find that I despise the lifestyle I've taken on?  What if my passion ceases to be passionate?  What will I do now?  I suppose that, for now, all I can do is be as fervently passionate as I can... because a fire that burns higher than the trees cannot possibly be extinguished in a single moment... can it?   and look, there's 900 hits... soon I'll have a thousand...  that's kind of cool.  On the main blogger site there's an article about Bloggers getting book deals because of their blogs.  Maybe I'll get a book deal?  {ha, yeah right!}

      one more thing before I go to bed...{I have to get up early in the morning and go to church to practice our music for Christmas Eve.} I am torn. .:to shreds:. my god, my god, why have you forsaken me? when I know truely truely, it I, I who have forsaken forsaken forsaken Rachel, forsaken her GOD?  never.... Rachel, Rachel, why have you forsaken YOURSELF? you have/are making this darkness around you drawing it closer, painting its pain for mere entertainment. What is this? WHY? WHY ARE THERE SO MANY QUESTIONS? and so precious few answers?  and why is everything, everything always the same? just as the early hours of the twighlight morning reflect, mirrored from day to day...

      "You're the most beautiful person I know." she says. "I love you." he replies. "but you scare me..." she whispers. "I love you." he says again." "I'll always be frightened of you." "I love you." and that makes it alright.   "salome, don't you believe in god?" "does he believe in me?" "have you given him any reason to?" "no I suppose not."

      Yellowcard--Ocean Avenue There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

      I have decided that I hate hospitals.  I am horribly closterphobic right now, and I have a way of adopting other people's pain as my own....  if not just my mother's... as I was walking past ICU, a lady came out, and she looked as though she hadn't slept in days, her eyes were bloodshot, as though she had been crying. {2:11}  I felt a horrible sadness rise up inside me, and I had tears running down my face as I  continued down the hall, and I was imagining the trials this woman must be going through.  Now I am sitting in a tiny  room with my mother, watching her heart beat on the monitor... she's sleeping, because her pulse is only 65...  My mother has tubes coming out of her all over the place, and oxygen to her nose, and she is very very extrememly pale.{2:19... I have to help her remember what time to take her medicine...}  I think I'll be here the rest of the day... and probably most of tomorrow, except for my american lit final at 8...    I know everything is going to be ok, but why am I still so scared?

      I feel self-contained right now, which is good.  I'm working the kinks out of my life.  I have less to worry about, because I'm beginning to accomplish what I set out to do last March, and accept today for today, and realize that right now IS RIGHT NOW, and that I can't waste Right Now on what has already been, or what is to come.  It is my mission to understand what is right now, and how to find a happy medium between being reckless with my future, and being reckless with my present...  and this might not make sense to you, but it does to me.  There are things in the past that have caused wrinkles in my present, but I'm beginning to smooth them out, and that makes me feel a lot better.  I'm reading another comfort food book from my past... A Wrinkle in Time, Madeline L'Engle: " Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait  point.   French.  Pascal.  The heart has its reasons, whereof reason knows nothing."

      {This is the last one.  This is the real reason I'm afraid I'll never have the courage to have kids.} "When my mother first told me she was pregnant, she added, "At last! We really are going to fill this house up with children."  At first I didn't like the idea.  What was wrong with just having me?  My mother, father, and I were our own little unit. As the baby grew inside her, my mother let me listen to its heartbeat and feel it kicking against her, and I started looking forward to seeing this baby.  I hoped it would be a girl, and I would have a little sister.  Together my father, my mother and I decorated the nursery.  WE painted it sparkling white and hung yellow curtains.  My father stripped an old dresser and repainted it.  People gave us the tiniest baby clothes.  We washed and folded each shirt, each jumpsuit, each sleeper.  We bought fresh new cloth diapers because my mother liked to see diapers hanging on the line outside. The one thing we could not settle on was a name.  Nothing seemed quite right.  Nothing was perfect enough for this baby.  My father seemed more worried about this than my mother.  "Something will come to us," my mother said."The perfect name will arrive in the air one day."  Three weeks before the baby was due, it came.  I heard my father telephoning the doctor.  "She won't make it," he said. "Its happening, right now." I walked down the hall.  My mother was sunk into the pillow sweating, and groaning.  "Something's wrong," she said to my father.  She saw mestanding there and said, "You shouldn't watch.  I don't think I'm very good at this."  In the hallway outside her room, I lowered my self to the floor.  The doctor came.  My mother screamed just one, one long, mournful wail, and then it was quiet.  When the doctor carried the baby out of the room, I asked to see it.  It had a pale bluish tinge and there were marks on its neck where the umbilical chord had strangled it.  "It might have been dead for hours," the doctor told my father.  "I just can't say exactly." "Was it a boy or a girl?" I asked. The doctor whispered his answer, "A girl."  My father looked shaken, but he didn't seem concerned about the baby anymore.  He kept going in and touching my mother.  I went into my mother's room and crawled up on the bed beside her.  She was staring at the ceiling.  "Let me hold it," she said. "Hold what?" "The baby," she said.  Her voice sounded odd and silly.  My father came in and she asked him for the baby.  He leaned down and said, "I wish- I wish-" "The baby," she said. "It didn't make it," he said. "I'll hold the baby," she said. "It didn't make it," he repeated. "It can't be dead," she said, in that same singsong voice.  "It was alive just a minute ago."

      " ... I started daydreaming about my mother, who loved books almost as much as she loved all her outdoor treasures.  She liked to carry little books in her pocket and sometimes when we were out in the fields, she would flop down in the grass and started reading aloud."   "One morning when I awoke very early, I was my mother walking up the hill to the barn.  Mist hung about the ground, finches were singing in te oak tree beside the house, and there was my mother, her pregnant belly sticking out in front of her.  She was strolling up the hill swinging her arms singing:  Oh, don't fall in love with a sailor boy, a sailor boy, a sailor boy- oh don't fall in love with a sailor boy, 'Cause he'll take your heart to sea.-  As she approached the corner of the barn where the sugar maple stands, she plucked a few blackberries and popped them into her mouth.  SHe looked all around her- back at the house, across the fields, and up into the canopy of branches overhead.  She took several quick steps up to the tree of the maple, threw her arms around it, and kissed that tree soundly. Later that day, I examined this tree trunk.  I tried to wrap my arms about it, but the trunk was much bigger than it had seemed from my window.  I looked up at where her mouth must have touched the trunk.  I probably imagined this, but I thought I could detect a small dark stain, as from a blackberry kiss."   " 'Phoebe's mother went away," I said. He {her father} looke up at me. "She left some notes.  She says she's coming back, but I don't believe it." I went up stairs and tried to work on my mythology project.  My father came to the doorway and said, "People usually come back." Now I can see that he was just talking in general, just trying to be comforting, but then- that night-  what I heard in what he said was the tiniest reassurance of something I had been thinking and hoping. I had been praying that a miracle whould happen and my mother would come back and we would return to Bybanks and everything would be exactly as it used to be."   "'How do you know that someone didn't make Mom go to Idaho?  Maybe it was blackmail..." "Sal your mother went because she wanted to go." "We should have stopped her." "A person isn't a bird.  You can't cage a person." "She shouldn't have gone.  I she hadn't fone-' "Sal, I'm sure she intended to come back...You can't predict-a person can't foresee- you never know." He put his arm around me and we sat there together on the porch, two people being completely pitiful and lost."

      "My mother was right when she said my father was good.  He was always thinking of little things to cheer up someone else.  THis nearly drove my mother crazy because I think she wanted to keep up with him, but it was not her natural gift like it was with my father... "I had never seeh him angry.  "Sometimes I don't think you're human," my mother told him.  It was the sort of thing she said just before she left, and it bothered me because it seemed as if she wanted him to be meaner, less good.  Two days before she left, when I first heard her raise the subject of leaving, she said, "I feel so rotten in comparison." "Sugar, you're not rotten," he said. "See?" she said. "See?  Why couldn't you at least believe I'm rotten?" "Because you're not," he said.  She said she had to leave in order to clear her head, and to clear her heart of all the bad things.  She needed to learn about who she was. "You can do that here, Sugar," he said. "I need to do it on my own," she said.  " I can't think.  All I see here is what I am not.  I am not brave.  I am not good.  And I wish someone would call me by my real name.  My name isn't Sugar.  It's Chanhassen."  She had not been well.  She had had some terrible shocks, it is true, but I did not understand why she could not get better with us.  I begged her to take me with her, but she said I could not miss school, and my father needed me and besides, she had to go alone.  She HAD to. I thought she might change her mind, or at least tell me when she was leaving.  But she did neither of those things.  She left me a letter which explained that if she said good-bye, it would be too terribly painful and it would sound too permanent.  She wanted me to know that she would think of me every minute and that she would be back before the tulips bloomed.  But, of course, she was not back before the tulips bloomed."

      So maybe I'm even weirder than I thought I was.  Apparently I picked up a LOT of things from Walk Two Moons...  "Then he said to me, 'Don't people touch each other at your house?'  'What's that supposed to mean?'  'I just wondered,' he said. 'You flinch every time someone touches you.'  'I do not.'  'You do.'  He touched my arm.  I  have to admit, my instinct was to flinch but I caught myself....  He touched my arm again.  When I flinched he said, "Ha! Gotcha!'...maybe I was starting to flinch whenever anyone touched me."  and I thought that was just a weird quirky thing I came up with on my own...  Its been a long time since I've read this book...  its like a comfort food or a little kids blanket... its very calming.   and for some reason, I just know I'm going to end up being like the mom in this story...  or that its very possible.  Maybe that's why I'm so afraid of commitment...  "Lying in bed remembering those blackberries made me think of something else too.  It was something that happened a couple years ago, on a morning when my mother slept late.  It was that time she was pregnant. My father had already eaten breakfast, and he was out in the fields.  On the table, my father had left a single flower in each of two juice glasses- a black-eyed susan in front of my place, and a white petunia in front of my mother's. When my mother came into the kitchen, she said, "Glory!"  She bent her face towards each flower.  "Let's go find him." We climbed the hill to the barn, crawled between the fence wires, and crossed the field.  My father was standing at the far end of the field, his back to us, hands on his hips. looking at a section of fence. My mother slowed down when she saw him.  I was right behind her.  I looked as if she wanted to creep up and surprise him, so I was quiet too and cautios in my steps.  I could hardly keep from giggling.  It seemed so daring to be sneaking up on my father and I was sure my mother was going to throw her arems around him and kiss hime and hug him and tell him how much she loved the flower on the kitchen table.  My mother always loved anything that normally grows or lives out of doors-anything- lizards, trees, cows, caterpillars, birds, flowers, crickets, toads, ants, pigs. Just before we reached my father, he turned around.  THis startled my mother and threw her off guard.  She stopped. 'Sugar-' he said.  {Sugar is her name... really... isn't that cool?} My mother opened her mouth, and I was thinking, 'Come on! Throw your arms around him! Tell him!'  but before she could speak my father pointed to the fence and said, 'Look at that.  A morning's work."  He indicated a new length of wire strung between two new posts.  THere was sweat on his face and arms. And then I saw that my mother was crying.  My father saw it too.  'What-' he said. 'Oh you're too  good , John.' she said.  'You're too good.  All you Hiddles are too good.  I'll never be so good.  I"ll never be able to think of all the things-' My father looked down at me.  'The flowers,' I said. 'oh.'   He put his sweaty arms around her, but she was still crying, and it wasn't what I had imagined it would be.  It was all sad instead of happy. The next morning when I went into the kitchen, my father was standing beside the table looking at two small dishes of blackberries- still shiny and wet with dew- one dish at his place, and one dish at mine.  'Thanks' I said. 'No, it wasn't me,' he said. 'It was your mother.' Just then, she came in from the back porch.  My father put his arms around her and they smooched and it was all tremendously romantic, and I started to turn away, but my mother caught my arm and said to me, -though it was almost meant for my father, I think- 'See?  I'm  almost  as good as your father!'  She said it in a shy way, laughing a little.  I felt betrayed, but I didn't know why."  That is what I'm going to be like.  and you don't know the rest of what this mother does...  but its me.  I promise. I probably won't be writing much just from me until I'm done reading this book, I'll just give you more little pieces of her/me.

      I was just re-reading Walk Two Moons, by Sharon Creech.  Its a book I was madly in love with when I was 5th grade/middle school, back when I had no friends, and did nothing but read books day and night.  As I was re-reading this book I realized how much I really picked up from those books I read back then, like as I was reading this one particular part... "  She slid into the seat next to me and said, 'You are brave.'  To tell you the truth, I was surprisied.  You could have knocked me over with a chicken feather.  'Me?  I'm not brave.'  'You are.  You are brave.'  I was not.  I, Salamanca Tree Hiddle, was afraid of lots and lots of things.  For example, I was terrified of car accidents, death, cancer, brain tumors, nuclear war, pregnant women, loud noises, strict teachers, elevators, and scads of other things. But I was not afraid of spiders, snakes and wasps.  Phoebe, and nearly everyone else in my new class did not have much fondness for these creatures. But on that day, when a dignified black spider was investigating my desk, I cupped my hands around it and carried it to the window, and sit it outside on the ledge.  Mary Lou Finney said, 'Alpha and Omega will you look at that!'  Beth Ann was as white as milk.  All around the room people were acting as if I had single-handedly taken on a fire breathing dragon. What I have since realized is that if people expect you to be brave sometimes you pretend that you are, even when you are frightened down to your very bones."  and I {I, Rachel} when I read that in fifth grade greatly admired Salamanca Tree Hiddle and wanted to be brave like her... and I have not been afraid of spiders, snakes or wasps... but I did sort of switch frogs/turtles/lizards  for the snake part... I'm not all that fond of their beady eyes and forked tongue.  And people  have that same reaction to me walking around with bugs on my hands.

      Idiots.  All idiots. Just leave me alone. Please.  Red handed, I cup the light in my hands, At my touch it glimmers, Falters, and its Holy halo Flickers away.  The silence has taught me all it has to teach, And in its forgetfulness, Has begun its lessons again.  In my mind… The hands, reaching out,   Spinning? Much to fast, And suddenly they are stopped.  If only if only  I wish perhaps you knew… but yet again, it would be too much.. And I have neither the strength nor the mental capacity to deal with you right now,  And I will not answer the phone.   He thinks he has me figured out Ha Ha ha… Now THAT is amusing.  Be listened.  Disjointed thoughts, don’t bother pondering… I’m random enough as it is, And today, my head hurts.  Don’t tell me what you think Don’t tell me at all  I don’t care who you are. I don’t care who you were. I don’t care It doesn’t matter {If I say it enough, it will work, it WILL}

        The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top The snow is softly fallin' The air is still within the silence of my room I hear your voice softly callin'  If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon the page The words of love you sent me  If I could know within my heart That you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are liftin' The mornin' light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are driftin'  If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love And to be once again with with you To be once again with with you   I'm tired of dreaming about my future...  I want to live my dreams now.  I want things to end up the way they're supposed to, NOW.  I'm tired of promises that everything will be alright eventually... someday... oh how I hate that word.  and I'm dreadfully cold again.

      So I was driving home from school today, by myself {Megan, my carpool went home sick...  again.}  and I was listening to a song that reminded me of stuff that happened a long time ago,  and ended up almost in tears, trying to drive through the grandview triangle.  Then I started laughing at myself because I am so dumb.  {ha ha}  Then I got in my weird angry mood, and now I feel rather...beige...  and I was thinking about some of the stuff I write on here...  because I keep talking to 'you'... and its really bugging me, because I don't even know who this mysterious person is...  and I decided that 'you' is a conglomeration{sp?}  of pieces of some of the people who have really affected me and who I've become, and thus also includes pieces of myself, the person I wish I was, and the imaginary person who I have made up to be my perfect...  companion?  something like that.   YOU!   WHO ARE YOU AND WHEN ARE YOU COMING!!   lol.  I'm a dork. ps.  I LOVE   YOU!

      I don't really have anything to say, and yet I'm talking{typing} anyway.  My thoughts are pacing back and forth across the chambers of my head, driving me mad with their monotony.  I hate depending on other people for my happiness.  Why can't I make myself happy?  Maybe not even happy for heaven's sake.  Just... content.  Maybe its just my mindset.  I shouldn't hope for so much. I   need  my knight in shining armor to come save me.  {too bad for me I'm not a damsel in distress locked in a tower in the twelfth century or something.}

      I'm seventeen years old and I have been to five different countries. {Mexico when I was one... Canada twice, Britain by way of an airport, France,  ditto.  Italy for a week... Bologna, Florence, Venice, and Pisa.} I have been  in a crowd of 400,000 people my age. I have seen the pope. I have been to Disney World twice. I have gone to Houston without my parents to hang out with 25,000 kids my age for my birthday. I have played the piano for more than nine years. I have been  loved. I have am loved. My parents are still together, and still love each other. I have a little brother.  { even though he's a brat,   he's still a blessing.} I have two best friends and many many other friends who  genuinely care about me. When I walk across the quad at school, with a smile on my face,  people smile back. I have photography. I am not blind. I am not  deaf. I am not horribly disfigured. I go to a beautiful old private school. I have worn a uniform to school since kindergarten. I am part of a wonderful faith community. I have a house. {a big beautiful house.} I have food. I probably don't deserve all this.  Which means I probably do  deserve all the bad things.

      "A story is like a letter.   Dear You , I'll say.  Just  you ,  without a name.  Attaching a name attaches  you  to the world of fact,  which is riskier, moree hazardous: who knows what chances are out there, of survival, of yours?  I will  say  you, you  like an old love song.    You   can mean more than one.  You  can  mean  thousands. I'm not in any immediate danger, I'll say to you. I'll  pretend  you can hear me. But it's no  good, because I know you can't." -The Handmaid's Tale,  Margaret Atwood. { you're  probably getting tired of her aren't  you ?  I'm not.}

      Ironic how this is the night I'm left without anyone to talk to.  You don't realize that you've lied to me again, and that this time I'm really done.  This time I do have something against you. So that which used to be my forever is reduced to never {my love} I'm safe at last.  You called me selfish.  You read my thoughts as if they are dictionary definitions, but don't take the time to understand the truest essence of the word.  I know your temper as well as you know my thoughts, and I know what to say. I feel ruthless and mean.  Perhaps I am selfish, but my motivation for being so comes from others. Ironic.  7 am the garbage truck beeps as it backs up  and i start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.  could i push rewind? all the credits traverse signifying the end   but I've missed the best part could we please go back to the start forgive my indecision then again, then again, then again you're always first when no one's on your side...7 am the garbage truck beeps as it backs up  and i start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.  could i push rewind? all the credits traverse signifying the end   but I've missed the best part could we please go back to the start forgive my indecision then again, then again, then again you're always first when no one's on your side...

       She said   I don't know if I've ever been good enough  I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in  And I don't know if I've ever been really loved  By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's  Gonna give  And I'm a little bit angry, well   This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you  Around  You don't owe me, we might change  Yeah we just might feel good     I wanna push you around, I will, I will  I wanna push you down, I will, I will  I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted  I will    She said   I don't know why you ever would lie to me  Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is  Gonna hurt ya  And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me  You couldn't stand to be near me  When my face don't seem to want to shine  Cuz it's a little bit dirty well   Don't just stand there, say nice things to me  I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you  You don't know me, I can't change  I won't do anything at all    I wanna push you around, I will, I will  I wanna push you down, I will, I will  I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted  I will    Oh but don't bowl me over  Just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart, things get so  Crazy, crazy  Don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby

      Today at church, Mr. Maschler offered to let me borrow his bass guitar for a few weeks, so now all we need is a drummer, and Bobby and I can start a band.  Any name suggestions? ha ha, that very most likely won't happen.  Also after church, Mrs. Winner asked me if I would take pictures of her son Michael at his gymnastics meet, and she said she would pay me for it...  She also told me that her husband, who used to work for the AP still was in touch with his friend who is the head of the Photography department at the AP in Washington D.C., so when I go there this summer, he could call him and get me a private tour of the photo lab.  {Do you KNOW how COOL that is?}  Look and see what happens when you follow you true passion!  Its really interesting, because I feel like people are finally recognizing me as my own entity in my parish, instead of just being connected to the Straughn family...  People know that I am Rachel, not just Rose and Mike's daughter...  which I like... a lot.

      Well, this time I'm just going to let it go.  It's just like old times, except this time it {really} is my fault.  But there isn't anything else I can do.  This is what I need to do right now.  It may not be what's best for later, but I'll deal with that then...  {..."but after all, Tomorrow is another day"...:thank you Scarlett:....  tomorrow is a day that never comes.}  Maybe you were right, and maybe you were horribly horribly wrong, and I failed to correct you.  {you don't love me for my details, you mock me for them... but I don't mind.}  What ever happens is what will happen and I don't care.  The heart is fickle thing... so don't tell me to follow it.    urlLink  This is why.

      Damien Rice - Cannonball  Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt Still a little hard to say what's going on  Still a little bit of your ghost your witness Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed You step a little closer each day That I can't see what's going on  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannonball  Still a little bit of your song in my ear Still a little bit of your words I long to hear You step a little closer to me So close that I can't see what's going on  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannon  Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to cry So come on courage Teach me to be shy 'Cause it's not hard to fall And I don't want to scare her It's not hard to fall And I don't wanna lose It's not hard to grow When you know that you just don't know   Perhaps this is what I had intended all along. I've chosen a different sort of masochism, I'm oddly satiated.

      Now I'm reading  The Robber Bride  by guess who...{hint=M.A., as usual.} "Where to start is the problem, because nothing begins when it begins and nothing's over when it's over, and everything needs a preface: a preface, a postscript, a chart of simultaneous events.  History is a construct... Any point of entry is possible and all choices are arbitrary.   Still, there are definative moments we use as references, because they break our sense of continuity, they change the direction of time.  We can look at these events and we can say that after them things were never the same again.  They provide beginnings for us, and endings too.  Births and deaths, for instance, and marriages."   "This isn't evil, however.  It's dangerous only to  her .  It's her seam, it's where she's sewn together, it's where she could split apart.  Nevertheless, she still indulges in it.  A risky nostalgia.  Aiglatson. (A viking chieftain of the Dark Ages?  An up-market laxative?)"  Today was rather interesting.  Maybe I really will write a book when this is all over.  I might be dead then, though.

      I hate how you've tainted my life.  How I cannot open my eyes in the morning and not see you. I spend my days desperately trying not to hate. but how can I not, when every where I look I see you?  I try so hard to be good... to be who I am. You are the anti-me, regardless of whether you are better or not. To be with you is to be away from me.  To suffocate  to die.  "I haven't stopped  bleeding  bleeding for you  my soul pouring out  and draining away  draining into  your blue suffocating lungs  sustaining life.  You are breathing my blood.  and I shall die.  I can feel you  when you're never there  I can feel your blackness creeping into the depths of me  I can feel your blackness choking... drowning me  drowning in you "  Old familiarities are coming back to me. I don't eat anymore... I can't eat anymore. and sleep, I need it so much more now. I am not refreshed {enriched, ha}  and he isn't going to save me,  I don't think.  When will I learn to save myself? I thought that was what I had left to learn.  Apparently I didn't.  Someday I'll write a book about this, like Margaret Atwood, and I will tell everything. Maybe I'll start now.  Once there was a girl who was horribly naive, but thought she was quite cultured, saavy, intelligent. She didn't think about the things she said, and usually sounded rather stupid, but she was sweet which made up for it, so everyone loved her. That ended up to be not such a good thing. One day she finally escaped from her house for a while.  She was finally free to test her sweet innocence in the world alone.  Everyone still loved her. One more than all the rest. and this was how she learned about love.   don't lie to me.  ever.  I won't believe you.

      My history homework: "People make a personal connection through photographs, when they look into the grey green eyes of the Afghani girl on the cover of National Geographic, or when they recognize true terror in the faces of the people running from the crumbling World Trade Center.  Photographs leave single images that bury themselves in people's minds.  They make a true impact and invoke emotions which can sway opinions....  Photographers have a duty to shoot what they see.  If they see horrible injustices taking place during a war, it is their duty to photograph it, but another photographer may not see what is taking place as an injustice, and portray those committing it as great heroes.  In this way, all sides will be shown.  Good photographers are able to create pictures that show how they feel about their subjects.  It is impossible for a photographer to be unbiased and apolitical and produce good photographs.  If a photographer feels that a war is unneccesary, when they are lloking for subjects to photograph, they will find those which prove their point.  Thus while shooting what they see, they might not be showing all aspects of war.  Although, I do think that photographers should form their opinions by educating themselves and asessing the true situation before they manipulate the opinions of others through their work.

      Its time for me to start practicing my pieces for the NPTA guild again.  Every year, about this time I start practicing constantly, non-stop.  I spend every waking moment at my beloved baby grand, in our very cold unfinishedbasement.  {that's the only place in our house we have room for a baby grand.}I practice so much I am quite practiced out by the time Guild day comes along, and refrain from practicing till about this time comes around again.  So yes, I'm at the point where I have actually started practicing piano again, having rediscovered how much I love my ability to make melodiously harmonic butterflies flutter from the piano. {isn't that a lovely picture?  no, you're quite right, I'll try again.}  having rediscovered my passion for recreating a more {or perhaps less} tangible form of the music written on the page in front of me.  {I like that a little better.}  So, I will practice like crazy from now until sometime in late April or May, and then become a lazy bum again until about the middle of next January.  .:sigh:. the irony...

      I need {want} so desperately to be loved. I can't get away from it.  I sit and watch sappy old black and white and sepia love story movies, and I know what that's like.  I know what they are acting {pretending} they feel, and I need that.  I need to feel the electricity flowing from fingertip to my body.  I am loved, I love, but it isn't like that...  This love turns the very core of my being to pure liquid terror.  The fingertips that touch send tremors of fear through me.  I don't understand how I am to cope with this.  I do understand much too much else.  I miss you. I wish you were never born.

      ...I am horribly miserable with the way things are right now.  What happened?  Three months ago I was happy, things were good.  What happened?  Maybe I know what happened, and I'm just pretending I don't, or maybe I have an inkling of what might have happened, but I know I"m wrong.  Maybe so many little tiny things happened that there is no way I could possibly pin my sudden misery on any one event.  Or maybe I'm just in denial.  Maybe I just don't like being happy.  I told Chantele the other day that I am perfectly happy with being unhappy.  I like things this way.  At least I know what I'm feeling.  I'm not torn. I am fully and completely miserable.  and we all know I am at least emotionally masochistic, and maybe a tiny bit physically masochistic. {needle through the foot...

I will wake up, at exactly 5:50 in the morning to my cd player coming on {most likely it will be Incubus, that's the kind of mood I'm in right now.}  I will lay sprawled across my bed for about five minutes and almost fall back asleep, but then jump up thinking I've been laying there for twenty minutes.  I'll breathe a sigh of relief when I see the clock, and stand up, bracing myself for the moment of blackout I always get, then sneeze twice {always twice, I'm allergic to any hour later that 3 am, and earlier than nine.}  I'll switch on the lamp next to my bed, and go to my closet and find my little red, black and yellow plaid skirt, and "STA" embroidered white polo, get dressed, pick up my backpack and camera, and head downstairs...  just like always...  just like always...

      So many thoughts have come and gone, but the thoughts  I wish to banish will not be swept away.  These consistancies resurface and resurface in two hundred different ways, and then begin at the beginning again.  I have no desire to think this way, to be this way, I want to be the person that I am, but I have long since lost sight of her in the ebbing and flowing of the lies that are my life.  I am not depressed, but I have done/seen/experienced things that no person in their right mind would have made the efforts I did to do so.  There are things people have said that make me remember who I am supposed to be that echo every now and again...  "then again, you aren't like other girls."  "Rachel isn't shy, she just isn't...  talky"  "Rachel, you're gorgeous, you'll be happy someday..."  "You act like you're eight years old, when are you going to finally grow up and take responsibility for yourself?"    "I love you."   and I don't really understand what any of these things means, at least, what they mean to me.  I just don't know.  so I'll just sit here.  sit here.  alone.   again.

      Lots {nothing} has happened, but I really don't feel  like blogging. Sunday was our ring ceremony at school.  I like our class rings, their really pretty.   This week I am off school for service projects.  We have to get 30 hours of service this week. My project is at a Little Sisters of the Poor Residence for the elderly. Old people are both hysterical and depressing. Their unconditional love is heartwarming, and cures a broken heart, at least for a few hours. They are also exhausting.   Don't waste your time on me you're already a voice inside my head.

      My poems which are being published in Windmoor {my school's literary magazine.}:  I'm suffocating.  My lungs are bursting.  If you hit me,  I would pop  like a brown paper lunch bag clenched in your fist.  minus the air.  inhale  inhale  inhale,  shaky, like a child who's been sobbing on my shoulder for eternity.  sigh...  perhaps I'll float away, like a big red balloon.  oxygen deprived,  plenty of helium.      . the irises are blooming the irises of my eyes blooming like the blood on the white sheets blooming like the bodies buried, hidden coming up roses here's the knife let me carve out the part that hurts lay it on the altar an offering

      one more thing before I go off to dreamland:  e dixit ignotas animam dimittit in artes naturamque novat   latin clicked today.  its so beautiful. I love it. I love the way it sounds.   protinus Aeoliis Aquilonem claudit in antris emittitque Notum;  madidis Notus ecolat alis; barba gravis nimbis, canis fluit unda capillis. fit fragor; hinc densi funduntur ab aethere nimbi

      So I finally decided I would write about the woman I met a week and a half ago {two saturdays ago.} or just about the day I guess.  It was a good day.  I went to Good Shepherd Parish over in Kansas {Sean's church}  Its a beautiful place, and enormous.  I thought St. Johns was big.  I was wrong.  They were hosting a retreat/workshop type thing for music ministers from the Kansas City/St. Jo and Kansas City Kansas Diocese.  Pat asked me to go and help him present a  workshop called the War between Youth and Liturgy.  So I went, and talked about how we as Catholics see God in 4 parts of the liturgy, in the scriptures, in the clergy, in the eucharist, and in the community.  If any part of the community is missing, the infants, the elderly, the youth, we are missing out on seeing a part of God.  Therefore, efforts to separate youth from the rest of the parish are efforts to seperate the youth and the parish from a part of God.  I understand that this is by no means deliberate, but its wrong all the same.  I also talked about how it is important for parishes to make a strong effort, even outside of confirmation classes {which are often the only exposure high school kids have to Catholicism} to educate youth on the catechetical and canonical teachings of the Church... especially the part about being morally bound to follow our consciences above all else.  Otherwise youth think that they have to follow the teaching to the letter, which often makes them feel already out of place.  Anyway, enough of me ranting about Catholic teachings. {I got it from my mom.  When I was younger I asked lots of questions about the Church, and I always got much longer answers than I really needed.  But that's a good thing.  I like where I am now.  At least concerning my faith.}  Afterwards, the nicest old woman came up to me and told me what a intelligent young woman she thought I was.  I couldn't help but give her a hug, and I think it startled her a little.  I stuck around, and found out a little of how much my name, at 17 years old, has floated around the diocese.  Its always a little scary when you introduce yourself to someone you've never met before, and they go, "Oh, YOU'RE Rachel Straughn?"...{Its kind of like calling the Chancery, and having people recognize your voice.}  After the last session of the day, I saw the old lady again, and went to tell her how she had made my day by complimenting me.  She  then told me that I had made her day, and said "Don't you ever let anyone tell you that teenagers are bad, when there are good people like you." She told me that I was going to become the first female pope... {yes I know, laugh, but if given the opportunity, I would DEFINATELY do it...  if women were allowed to be ordained, then I would most certainly feel that I had a vocation for such} and she also told me that I was a grain of wheat which had fallen on fertile ground.  She made me feel wonderful, just for a little while; its always good to know that there is someone somewhere who thinks so highly of you.  Anyway, so that's a brief look into my Catholic life.   I think I need to talk about it more, because its so important to me... I've found a few Catholic blogs that are all about faith.  I even found one by a priest!  I think that's the coolest thing ever.  Fr. Don should get a blog, ha ha.  speaking of which, I've got catholic social teachings {social concerns} test to study for.  Got to love catholic college prep education.  {PS.  as much as I love the Catholic Church itself, its really important for me to remember that its God I'm thinking about here.  its terrible, but sometimes I forget.  and as for the last few posts, I really do feel more horribly alone right now than I think I have in a long long time, since the nerdy days of middle school.  I've got God, but its still important to feel like you have physically present concrete people who care about you.  And right now I don't.}

      I would have blogged last night, but my computer was temporarily incapacitated, as I was installing my new {yummy} 120gig hard drive. So I wrote in my notebook: {I can't do that too often or else I'll stop writing  here! oh no!} I think  the main problem in my life is that the main characters are you and I,  and I cannot decide who you, or I are {am}.   It is from this problem that all others stem.  I didn't tell you the whole truth, but I didn't lie either.  and I still don't believe you. {stick around nostalgia won't let you dow-own.}  Richie, the boy at Rockhurst that everybody knew, was stabbed to death.  It was terrible, and everyone was upset.  I wonder if anyone would care at all if I died.  Beside my parents. {My mom cried the other day when I suggested that I would die before her.  That means I can't} I really wish I could die, just to see what other people really think of me.  But I could never self-induce it.  I'm too afraid.  Maybe I might go to hell.  No one would understand why I did it anyway.  Even in all my wrtitings, I can't explain to you what it is that is the matter with me.  I am "psycho-depressed" {so diagnosed by someone who would know}  and I suspect I am bi-polar and a little schitzophrenic as well.  But its not like I know anything about mental illnesses.  Maybe I'll get help eventually.  But I don't want to be another american kid hopped up on a bunch of anti-depressant drugs {just what they try and keep us "off the streets" to avoid}   My greatest desire is the very thing that I most fear and abhor...      "You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss". Your romance is Casablanca. A classic story of love in trying times, chock full of both cynicism and hope. You obviously believe in true love, but you're also constantly aware of practicality and societal expectations. That's not always fun, but at least it's realistic. Try not to let the Nazis get you down too much.    urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    .

      I'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone   these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now I'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and I've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me I've been alone all along  when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and I've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me me, me.....   I don't know why it is that these songs insist on getting stuck in my thoughts.  It isn't as if I wanted to hear them in the first place.  They only remind me of things in the past that I try so hard to forget.  I know that the past has past, and that it will not,  nor would I want it to come back, but still things that are long past linger here in the forefront of my mind.  Things that I have long forgiven cause new sickening pains in my stomach, and the things which caused me once to be happy cause even deeper sickening pains in my stomach.  Last night I went  ice skating...  I love my beautiful white skates, they make me feel like I know what I'm doing.  after making sure Chantele would be alright I went around a few times by myself.  The grooves in the ice are mesmerizing.  Chantele found someone else {a boy of course} to keep her company, and I was completely on my own.  I watched the couples  on their day-late valentines date, showing off, laughing, holding hands.  I was jealous.  My hatred for Kansas City came back to me as I went...  There is no room left for any part of me here anymore.  I can't wait to leave.  another idea struck me.  What if I looked up, and you were there.  you wouldn't be there of course.  I haven't become quite that unlucky, but what if...  what would happen.  perhaps I would become part of the ice itself, or it would melt away beneath me...  or maybe I would just raise an eyebrow, and give you half a smile then turn away... the way things would always have been before.  or maybe you would kill me.  I wouldn't be suprised... nor would I blame  you.  Yes, I probably deserve to live...  and I would... but you'd kill me again all the same.    as I skated, my skates began cutting into my ankles, I had laced them  too tight.  I kept skating... {what was that?  masochist?  no, I didn't lace them too tight on purpose.}  finally the laces became too loose at the toe, and still too tight around the ankle, so I decided to relace them.  I had been stupid and not brought gloves.  It was very cold, and my hands were numb.  I couldn't feel my fingertips, and I clumsily fumbled with the knots.  One of the guys there offered to help me.  I looked up at him and laughed.   "No, its alright, I'm very self-sufficient."  There was a certain tone of irony in my voice; he gave me an odd look and turned away.  I undid the knots.   My ankles were bleeding rather badly.  I relaced my beautiful white skates, and began going around again. Thats when I realized that I was alone.  Its come to one of those points where I'm rambling again.  I haven't really done that in a long time.  I learned where to stop myself... see I'm reverting to old habits again.   I think perhaps I just want someone to love me, without making me love them.  I think I really am selfish. oh well. It doesn't matter. {isn't it ironic how I say that over and over again? what does it mean?  we all know it means exactly the opposite.} It  does  matter. {no, that hurts much too much.} It doesn't. It doesn't  I don't care at all.  please,  please  just go away and  let  me be alone. besides, I'd only lie to you, and myself, or  give you one of my sardonic half-smiles,  raise an eyebrow, and turn away.

      I have finally come to accept the fact that I am totally and completely, truly alone on the face of this desolate planet.  I have realized that the people I had counted on trusting for the rest of my life are no longer the people that I had trusted.  one has  grown tired  of me, and the other drags me along with her as company, then  abandons  me knowing that it isn't a good night for that.  Yet another only considers me  a cure  for boredom, and another  hates  me... my  own doing {intentionally}. With these realizations comes the idea that none of what I  supposedly had  with these people before was really there, and thus the past three years of my life have been a lie.  and I  never  bothered getting close enough to anyone else for them to  care .  So I am officially a loner... entirely of my own  fault , and yet not at all of my own  will .  Oh well,  I'll be alright , I always am. I'm reverting to old middle school habits I thought I had broken.  I haven't read this much since seventh grade. I'll throw myself into my work...  pay off my new camera...{maybe, this isn't final yet.} I'll have straight A's this semester. {ok, maybe not, but hey, its an idea.} and it won't matter because I'm self-sufficient. I   don't  need anyone.

      Today, I am stuck on the songs that mean something to me.  Or did at one  point in time.  They make me rather sad. but I was right when I said I can't do this anymore.  I can barely stand to live anymore.  I've given up on you, both of you. {too late, you gave up on me a long time ago.} move on move on it doesn't matter. 166 days till I leave for Washington.  urlLink corcoran  {see young people's programs, then Focus on Photojournalism.} I need to leave for church in about twenty minutes.

      Kate told me I was an emo kid when she read this in my planner:  in need of consolation I look to my new ruby sneakers {is there anywhere else but home?} the gaiety of the eyeball white laces makes me want to wretch and the redness reminds me of your blood, fresh from your throat, which I slit.   They cancelled my darkroom classes.   I had been clinging to the fact that I would be having darkroom classes this morning for the past three terrible weeks.  and they cancelled them.  I know some people would think it was funny. {oh Rachel, you're so obsessed, its just a couple classes, ha ha ha  ha .:mocking me:.} but its not.  its not. what the  hell  am I going to do now?

      Right now, if I had no God, I think I would be dead.  Revive my heart ... renew my soul ...  In You, O Lord I am made whole. No more in fear will I wander, 'Cause you're my God, my Lord and Lover.  Like a burning fire, be my one desire. I wanna be holy just like you. I wanna go where you lead me to. With reckless abandon to your truth, I wanna fall deeper in love with you.     O lift me up God my father; in all this world there is no other. I'm dancin' in your holy presence. Your glory fills all my senses.    Like a burning fire, be my one desire. I wanna be holy just like you. I wanna go where you lead me to. With reckless abandon to your truth, I wanna fall deeper in love with you.

      that which is unrequited is not love. {I don't think} and you won't even think of me. all I want is for you to care. All I want is for anyone to care. All I want... what do I really want? to  be happy? to be at peace? I don't really know any more. maybe I just want to be dead. I want you to care. and you know... hate is not the  opposite of love. Hate means you have feelings toward someone. complete indifference is the opposite of love. I've been permanently frozen,  goodnight, my love.

      I remember the day I died.  Not died like "the end" or more so than a doornail, but like death to become a new life.  Like Jesus, though I would never presume to make my resurrection the salvation of the world.  The Fates have cut my thread in several places,  only to spin the shards of wool into a single yarn again.  Thus I have lived many lives, some of which are not mine to  live.  The voice ... a  paradox {or a lie} in of itself, had become my comfort food, and I yearned for it.  It was a comfort food like the most searingly hot mexican chile.  That was why...  Because we had no truth, Everything we were to each other was a lie, and I hate{ed} lies. {don't lie to me.}  You love someone for the little things you know.  But the silence grows between us like an irridescent bubble.  When it  pops, all that will be left will be space, and silence.  "In their jars the snail-nosed babies moon and glow.   He hands her the cut-out heart like a cracked heirloom." ~Two Views of a Cadaver Room, Sylvia Plath.  "What I want back is what I was Before the bed, before the knife, Before the brooch-pin and the salve Fixed me in this parenthesis; Horses fluent in the wind, a place, a time gone out of mind." ~ The Eye-mote, Sylvia Plath  {from: The Colossus and other poems.}

      Last notes before the lady recedes to her chamber for the night: I will turn eighteen approximately ten days after the presidential elections this year, and that upsets me, because I do care.  Though I have problems with the whole voting for your conscience vs.  voting to make an impact thing.... Tomorrow I am going to UMKC to see the metamorphosis with my Latin class. Having memories isn't such a good thing.  I came across a few old e-mails earlier and they made me cry.   It's funny how I always end up wanting what I can't have. I wish I weren't so superficial.  Son couer est un luth suspendu, Sitot qu'on le touche il resonne.  I feel kind of lost. and I need somebody to find me. {what am I saying?

      wow, I have  had the  weirdest  dreams lately. I just fell asleep for a few hours and had a dream I had been invited to be in a secret society, but I had missed the first meeting so I didn't know any of the little rituals.  It was bizarre.  I had a dream a couple of days ago that the librarian at school was my nanny, and bought me all kinds of weird books for christmas.  and there have been lots of other weird dreams too.  I just wish I could sleep a good, deep sleep so I'd feel a little better in the morning. {yay for the little blue pill}

      If some day I am forced {reduced} to become an algebra teacher, I will entertain myself by writing pulitzer prize winning word problems with characters with names like Ophelia and Balthazar.   And we read this today, in Latin... I will post the other things we read in Latin, and the e.e. cummings poems I read at two in the morning when I get home.  from Aglaura. SONG. WHY so pale and wan, fond lover ?                    Prithee, why so pale ?  Will, when looking well can't move her,                    Looking ill prevail ?                    Prithee, why so pale ?   Why so dull and mute, young sinner ?                    Prithee, why so mute ?  Will, when speaking well can't win her,                    Saying nothing do 't ?                    Prithee, why so mute ?   Quit, quit, for shame, this will not move :                    This cannot take her.  If of herself she will not love,                    Nothing can make her :                    The devil take her !   ~Sir John Suckling.

      So guys, if,   IF   we do not have school tomorrow, Please do not deign  it neccessary to call me and tell me we  don't have school.  I will know.  Though it did make me feel rather loved last week when you did... ha ha.  Call me later, for instance, call me after 9:30 or so, because I will be up, and I will be bored by then.  Ok?  Great. .:something annoyingly affectionate that makes me sound like the teenage girl that I am such as *kisses!* or *luv ya!*:.  P.S. All I'm really asking is that you love me to pieces, its not hard, lots of people do...   though it does get a little tiring after a while, when I have to keep picking up my pieces and moving on... ha ha.

      All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want some one to say to me I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape escape...escape...escape... All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane...it's not sane

      So, on suggestion of Brittany Cummings, I looked up Ricky Votolato on the internet.  This is what I found:  the days behind you are haunting / the ones your living in now / the ghost of your past carries / the weight of your name / where would you be who are you / without the scaring and the heals that stepped on you / that you cling to with all of your strength / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done  58 guthrie street / an old postcard you sent / to help close up wounds that I love to reopen / quarters in the tequila / on the streets of houston / you can keep on drinking / but never drown out where you've been / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done   there is a statesman servant beneath / the thick skin of remembering / armor for protection / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done  Tonight I went to reconciliation...  That's one of the things I love about Catholicism that a lot of people hate.  For me, it's something more than just being forgiven.  Its a reassurance that I'm loved.  Sure, I can lie awake in bed every night and say, "Oh God, I'm sorry.  Please help me be better.  Please help me be patient, please help me not to judge, please help me understand that other people hurt as much as I do.  Help me heal other's wounds instead of cause them.  I'm sorry, please forgive me.  Help me not to do it again."  But as much as I say those things, and as much as I know that God hears me and does help me, it feels wonderful to hear a person I know is of God say those words of absolution.  It makes it official somehow, and I feel renewed in God's love for me.  { loving and forgiving are you,  oh Lord, loving and forgiving are you }  and so every night, I fall asleep wrapped in arms of love.  Whose arms they are, I'm not sure, but they consist of love, and love is always of God.  So its ok. Love is of God, so its ok.

      weird quirky things about me that make me weird and quirky: 1. I am seventeen years old and I am terrified of the dark... or being alone in the dark I guess...  or maybe NOT being alone in the dark. 2. When I have kids I am going to name them cool names like Artaxias or Atreyu, and Saloriana 3. I listen to dashboard confessional-esque emo music and it actually makes me cry. 4. Most of the time, the majority of the people have no idea what I am thinking or feeling.  I wear many masks {wahaahaahahaha} 5. I was incredibly excited the other day when I found out that private school kids can get into the lyric opera for free. 6. I go to a private school, and I like it... well, more than I would any other school. 7. I read a lot. mostly Margaret Atwood, because I'm obsessed, but I read other things too. 8. my friends/boyfriend...  enough said.  they convey enough weird and quirkinesses to me in the space of one day to complete an entire list. 9. my favorite soda is diet mountain dew. 10. I am a vegetarian... and really for no good reason now too.  Though I still really like cows.  they're cute.  P.S. I love you.

      I love the sound of laughter.  It is fullbodied {like hair, or wine.}  and it makes me smile. I got the April National Geographic today. I find it interesting how open some of the people at school have become about their sexuality.  For some people I know its a personal thing, like Jessie and Camille.  I really do think they are adorable together.  but for other people it seems to have become a social thing... hey lets be bi, because we can, why should we be limited to a specific sex?  I'm not judging anyone based on this, but it bothers me that sex/sexuality has been made into such a casual thing by some people. Lately, I've been a terrible person.  Just because I have an excuse doesn't mean I should. Somethings are lovely though.  They make me happy. I think I'll go curl up in bed for a while.  I feel the consistancy of sleep fill my my veins and seep into my limbs like the sand used to hold back oncoming floods.

      3.	somewhere i have never traveled, gladly beyond  any experience, your eyes have their silence:  in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,  or which i cannot touch because they are too near;  your slightest look easily will unclose me  though i have closed myself as fingers,  you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens  (touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose;  or if your wish be to close me, i and  my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,  as when the heart of this flower imagines  the snow carefully everywhere descending;  nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals  the power of your intense fragility:  whose texture  compels me with the color of its countries,  rendering death and forever with each breathing;  (i do not know what it is about you that closes  and opens; only something in me understands  the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)  nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.    e.e. cummings  its beautiful isn't it?

      I'm watching the MTV special on gay marriages in America and attitudes toward homosexuality, and being infuriated, I would like to state my opinion. I am Catholic.  Within the Catholic church, gay couples cannot be married, and I believe one of the main reasons is because part of the expectations of a Catholic couple is to have children, and obviously a homosexual couple cannot do that... {yes I know, they can adopt, but it isn't quite the same.  Just go with me here.  and I'm sure there are other reasons as well, I just haven't had a chance to look them up} and pre-marital sex is considered a sin, so homosexuals cannot practice their sexual orientation with in the Catholic faith, but they will always be welcome within the Church.  These people are often encouraged to consider a religious vocation  I support these ideas.  BUT  for homosexuals who are not Catholic, I do not think that the government has any right to make moral decisions like that.  These people love each other and have every right to be able to make a permanent commitment to each other..  One statement the show made said that if the President makes this proposed ammendment to the constitution it will be the first ammendment to ban a group of people from something, and what kind of prescedent would that be?  I think it is just as ridiculous for the government to discriminate against gay people as it is for them to discriminate again people because of the color of their skin.  I also think it is ridiculous when I hear stories about gay couples who have been together for twenty years, but when one gets sick, their partner can't go into the hospital room to see them, or couples that can't share their health plans because they aren't legally married. It also  infuriates  me when I see people protesting gay marriages saying things like "God hates Fags."  I think that is horrible, unchristian behavior.  Biblical support for this statement comes from the old testament, which although inspired by God, was written to conform to the societal norms of people THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO!  God LOVES everyone, no matter who they are or what their sexual orientation.  And if two women or two men love each other, I believe that that love is of God, and they should be allowed to be together.

      Let's see...  what brilliant pearls of wisdom shall fall out of my head today?  oh, Brittany Cummings, our new Academy Woman today said: "If I could live a day, I would love you forever." I love her dearly. to see what else I have said about her see: october 21.. i think, and march 27. she's adorable, and she makes everyone love her. I really wish I were like that.  I'm pretty sure there are more people who hate me than love me.  but I had a lot of compliments today, Mrs. Rowland said I was really sweet, and when I went to pick up Bobby from school today, my kindergarten teacher said, "Look at that beautiful girl...  Your mom told us you were going to save the world... or at least photograph it."  That made me smile.

      "I want out!" she screamed, her voice gravely and grated like a sheet of metal with holes in it, or like a spoon scraping brownie batter from the side of a bowl.  I doubt too much.  I stand reassured, but I doubt too much.  But don't make me confess it.  I think too much, too. and I wonder what I would give, just to have a new life. would I give up all this? history says I wouldn't. ha ha. sometimes things just really don't make sense.  I know this isn't quite true, but you know sometimes, it feels like it: She thinks about herself and cares about nobody else because the only friends she has all put her down They hate her when she's beautiful and even more when she's a fool They talk behind her back when it's her birthday  every time they put her down, she makes a fist and the tears roll down She packs her bags and plans to run away And every time she makes a friend, the vicious cycle starts again She's never, ever, ever looking back  She's saying goodbye and leaving tonight She's wasted all her lonely tear drops She's saying goodbye and leaving tonight She's used up all her lonely tear drops now  She's saying goodbye, she's wasted all her lonely tear drops Saying goodbye, she's used up all her lonely tear drops now  every time they put her down, she makes a fist and the tears roll down She packs her bags and plans to run away from here And everytime she makes a friend, the vicious cycle starts again She's never, ever, ever looking back  She's saying goodbye and leaving tonight She's wasted all her lonely tear drops She's saying goodbye and leaving tonight She's used up all her lonely tear drops now  She's wasted all her lonely tear drops now  and I won't be able to make anyone understand this...

      what was it she called it? ...oh yes, a sinking ship... going down with...  and something about tattered textiles taken by the wind.   nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem, qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati ultimi flos praetereunte postquam tactus aratro est.  -Catullus  "Oh Jimmy, you would like it better maybe if we all starved to death?' said Oryx, with her small rippling laugh he feared most from her, because it disguised amused contempt.  It chilled him: a cold breeze on a moonlit lake." -Margaret Atwood, Oryx and Crake.  "She knows what she wants: an event, by which she means a slip of the knife, a dropped wineglass or bomb, something broken.  A little acid, a little gossip, a little hi-tech megadeath: a sharp thing that will wake her up.  Run a tank over the geraniums, turn the wind up to hurricane so the daisies' heads tear off and hurtle through the air like bullets, drop the baby from the balcony and watch the mother swan-dive after him,  with her snarled Ophelia hair and addled screams." -Margaret Atwood, {Again} Bad News.  Oh God, how I need you.

      this ghost of a monster consumses my thoughts as if they are of little sustinance, and it is unsatiable. I'm confined much too much with my thoughts,  they drag me along behind them, down the dirt road deaf to my screams for mercy.  I'm so tired of being here, supressed by all my childish fears.   Perfection is not the object. {but you wanted {it}{you} to be. }  where are you? and I'm so sorry   I think I'll sit in my corner, and watch. Back off, back off. Some how I always manage to get myself in trouble.  I'm  in no mood for complicities at the moment. I need things to be simple, black and white.  and I know, I don't want to know... Yeah I guess I know, I just hate how it sounds.   My life is a rainbow of greys.  I miss old friends, conversations,  stick around nostalgia won't let you down   and I cling to the oddest things at the oddest times   I believe in God, the father the almighty creator of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen.

      Bobby is  playing everclear on his guitar he  is  your child after all. a terrifying  thought you should know better. you  should  know better. silly g ew se .: :-) :.  "...And when you look in my eyes, please know my heart is in your hands It's nothing that I understand, but when in your arms you have complete power over me So be gentle if you please 'cause your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth ..." my God, that scares me. {remember, no one can tell me what to do, I don't need anyone...  ha ha, I wish...}  why does everything {/one} have to be so complex, so multifaceted?  oh, if you {anyone} could read the many many layers of my thoughts... I think perhaps I would be doomed. I could be certain {anchored} in my misery, instead of drifting like this. Oh well.  [Teacher: any questions?  {keep them to yourself.}]

      nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem. qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam tactus aratro est. {not  for you.}  I've found that which I wanted to be enveloped in.  but I don't know how to describe it to you.  its lovely, like velvet.  Another interesting thing I discovered today: Social Concerns is the theology class I'm taking right now.  We study the Catholic Social Teachings. Today we were talking about societal attitudes toward the elderly, and came to the topic of why people find it neccessary to dye their hair so the grey doesn't show.  I made the point that things like wrinkles and grey hairs are physical evidence that we are growing older, and the older we come, the closer to death we come...  People are afraid of death, and so they erase these reminders of their mortality with dyes and plastic surgeries. Then my mind sort of dropped out of the discussion and continued on its own.  The theory of time and its relativity has always been obvious to me in my life.  Those minutes in the classroom on a Friday afternoon really do last for hours, relatively.  There is no constant of time.  My life is like one of those commercials where falling papers are frozen in mid-air, but the actors continue to move.   Then Mr. Bertalott's voice came through my reverie asking, "When do you think you will look in the mirror and consider yourself old?"  and I thought, I already am old.  In my time, the rest of what is left of my life could fly by in a relative night, and I could die tomorrow at the age of 102.  I am ancient.

      another identity crisis { this isn't me. }  She never mentions the word addiction In certain company Yes, she’ll tell you she’s an orphan After you meet her family  She paints her eyes as black as night, now Pulls those shades down tight Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain comes, The pain’s gonna make everything alright  Says she talks to angels, They call her out by her name She talks to angels, Says they call her out by her name  She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket She wears a cross around her neck Yes, the hair is from a little boy And the cross is someone she has not met, not yet  Says she talks to angels, Says they all know her name Oh yeah, she talks to angels, Says they call her out by her name  She don’t know no lover, None that I ever seen Yes, to her that ain’t nothing But to me, yeah me, It’s everything  She paints her eyes as black as night now She pulls those shades down tight Oh yeah, there’s a smile when the pain comes, The pain’s gonna make everything alright, alright yeah  She talks to angels, Says they call her out by her name Oh yeah, yeah, angels Call her out by her name Oh, angels They call her out by her name Oh, she talks to angels They call her out Yeah, they call her out Don’t you know that they call her out by her name    today I  walked from Latin class to history with Ali Ryan.   As we started down the stairs Ali began talking about a girl in our Latin class who she {and a lot of other people, including myself} can't stand.  I easily fell into the conversation, agreeing with her.  London joined us with a rather conspiratorial "Who are you talking about?"  {We'll call her... Chef.  ha ha, don't you love wordplay.}  As we walked across the quad we continued to decimate this girl.  I was walking between Ali and London, I felt "chummy" with these girls, but then I thought, this is terrible, that we've come to this comradarie through our nastiness.  It happens a lot.  I really do feel  terrible.

      Its amazing how some of the littlest things can change your point of view.   I've been in a much better mood lately {which unfortunately means less to write about...}  and I can't decided if its because of the lovely weather, or because of Sean.  Probably both.  and the other day Mr. Thomas suggested that he thinks going to MU {University of Missouri, Columbia} would be really good for me.  His opinion means a lot to me.  Therefore, I am going to visit there next week, during spring break. He also said that one of the photos I took for the issue that's coming out tomorrow is the best I've had published all year.    Tonight I went to a Lenten prayer service at church.  They played a video on poverty around the world.  It was terribly depressing.  If I give up all the things I own, how would that help the  people who live in garbage dumps in South America?  Could I sell my car, and donate the money from it, and the gas money I would save to a charity?  I don't think I could.   I'm too selfish.  The thought makes me sick to my stomach.   I do feel a little less stressed though...  I got some good prayer time in.  I always feel so much cleaner after I've prayed.  Lately, my prayers have just been letting my thoughts flow through my head,  opening them to God, and dwelling on people who I care about,  who need my prayers, and who I am thankful for.  Then I've fallen into my faults.  I wish there was some way I could force myself to be more selfless.  I want to exist soley for the good of others, but somehow I always fall back to doing things for my own good, and taking care of my wants.  I feel guilty for wanting so many things, especially when I know how little they really matter.  I also feel guilty for needing so much attention.  So much of what I do is to get the attention and compliments of others.  Does any of the good I do for this  purpose even really count?  I talk about people behind their backs, and I judge people based on the way they look or talk.    Honestly?  I think I really am a terrible person. God help me.

      When I was little, I used to be terrified of a lot of things.  Creakings in the attic {there  had  to be someone, or something there didn't there?}  being alone... sleeping away from home, and the dark, I was more scared of the dark I think than anything else {remnants of this still remain with me... but I didn't admit it.} I can't begin to explain how I ended up that way... my parents never gave me any cause to feel unsafe...  but for a terribly long time I hated the night, I hated going to bed.  The very thought of trying to sleep sent sparks of fear to my heart.  I would lay in bed wide awake,  feeling almost as if I had been placed  in a vacuum, a void of everything good.  There aren't words to describe to you how I felt.  I had forgotten about that until earlier today... it just came back to me all of a sudden.  I really was the oddest child.  I'm weird now, but so is everyone.   When I was little, I was just odd... strange...  what people must have thought of me...

      Ille mi par esse deo videtur, ille, si fas est, superare divos, qui sedens adversus identidem te spectat et audit  dulce ridentem, misero quod omnis eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te, Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi  lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus flamma demanat, sonitu suopte tintinant aures, gemina teguntur lumina nocte.  otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est: otio exsultas nimiumque gestis: otium et reges prius et beatas perdidit urbes.  {aka}  Godlike the man who sits at her side, who watches and catches that laughter which (softly) tears me to tatters: nothing is left of me, each time I see her, ...tongue numbed; arms, legs melting, on fire; drum drumming in ears; head- lights gone black.  Coda  Her ease is your sloth, Catullus you itch & roll in her ease:  former kings and cities lost in the valley of her arm.    usually, driving down this road {lane, path, street} the trees reach across to the freedom of crossing the blue sky  but now they reach out to me, to steal my freedom stealing my space my sanity.

      I am sick.  ew. Random bits of thought: locked out twisty-ties,  drawn out scarlet danger. Be a sponge! {ha, that's WAY out there...}  never mind, I shouldn't do that.  It confuses people.  Its kind of like when I was in seventh grade, and I started writing  my own secret code that really had no pattern whatsoever... It was just the first letters of what ever words I was thinking, and every now and then I would thrown in random words that corresponded with other words like eye for I, or something....  and I'd just capitalize a few letters here and there to make it look cool.  So it would be something like... eyemsgTwrwhwaNaeyeLwtrsmplywtr, ntsnnfAnyel.   people pretended that had it figured out and they knew what I was saying.  It was amusing.  I was such a weird kid.

Then we took pictures, and went to the dance.   Public  school dances really are different from our school dances...  in a really weird kind of way...  anyway...

      I am so  incredibly stressed out today. My eye was twitching earlier, that's how stressed out I am. all my muscles are in knots... and this doesn't show any signs of letting up. I mean, I got home from school today and found out my mom was in a car wreck. tomorrow night? STA vs. Sion at Arrowhead Stadium.  Tickets: $8 I'll be on the field shooting pictures {YAY!  at least that's SOMETHING to be looking forward to.}

      Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known  That any one who fled to your* protection, implored your help  Or sought your intercession, was left unaided.  Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To you I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful; O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions,  But in your clemency hear and answer me. Amen.

      so last night I didn't quite get all my make-up off... and this morning when I woke up,  my mascara had run down my face as if I had been crying in my sleep.  Maybe I really am as messed up as everybody says, and I just don't know it.

      I feel like things are crawling all over me, in me, through me. spiders. every thing is    rearranging, replacing.  I found that old shoebox in my closet today. Every girl has one. Things, they're just things... so why do they have such an effect on me? some things so lovely, some things so painful {bloodied.} some things so lovely lovely.  I need to be reassured. Can you believe it? I need something{/one}. Don't get used to it you know how self sufficient I am. So will you reassure me?

          look! its me! with the piece of lime green yarn in my hair which is to be the subject of this entry. {I find the weirdest things to talk about!}P.S.  I know I'm a mess.  Its been a long day. I wear ribbon/yarn bows on my pony tails because 1. pony tails are boring, generic, and you know me, I'm always finding ways to differ from the norm  2. I think its cute.  Apparently it has become a Rachel-signature-type thing.  I wear this particular yarn in my hair a lot, just because it's fun.  In Latin today Ali Ryan said... "I was driving behind you on the way to school today.  I wasn't quite sure it was you until I saw the green yarn in your hair, and I was like Yep, that's Rachel."  Then Kathleen Musgrave, who was sitting behind me in chemistry said, "Rachel, I love the way you always have a bow in your hair, its so cute!"  People {such as Chantele, or Mandy} also insist on yanking on the ends of my ribbons so that the bows come untied, which is rather annoying... I also vaguely remember someone, {I think it was Marcy} telling me that this particular one looks like the grinch.  I think it was around Christmas time.    On another note, today Mr. Thomas stopped me in the hall to ask me if I was ok.  I'm just REALLY REALLY stressed out right now.  Too much is going on. But it meant a lot to me that one of my teachers knew me well enough, and cared enough to notice that I was a little more flustered than usual.  After I explained that I just had a lot going on to Mr. Thomas, he said "well make sure you take care of yourself."  Someday when I'm really successful, I will give him the credit he deserves for his effects on my work... AND my well-being.  Anyway back to the ribbon thing.  There are lot of little things like that that people associate with me, and seem to embody my personality. things like the way I smell...?  For some reason it upsets me when people tag one thing or another on me.  I don't like being limited to one thing.  I got a chemistry test back today on which I got a 94, and my teacher wrote me a note on the back of it that said "I don't know Rachel- there aren't too many people who can do both math/science & hist/Eng well!!! :-)"  It kind of scared me a little bit, seeing as how she couldn't know that I'm good at history and English too unless she had been talking to my other teachers about me...  Do teachers really stand around and talk about their students like that?  That really is scary.  But the point is...  I am seemingly a well rounded person.... and its really annoying.  I can do so many things "good enough" but I don't really especially excel in one area.  I'm not a straight A student, I get a mixture of A's and B's...  I used to be one of the better players on my volleyball team, but I was definitely not the best. {I had to quit because my shoulders are so messed up.} I've done one of the school plays, but I haven't made one since...  I've played piano for nine years, and I can play decently, but I'm no Beethoven...  {I know it sounds like I'm bragging...  but this really bothers me.}  And of course there's always photography...  I'm good, but I'm not brilliant.  The difference with it is that I really love it, and I've chosen to focus on it.  I have the resources and the support to follow it.  And one of the things I love about it is that it allows me to follow all of my different interests.   Samantha called me over the summer to ask me how to make a quill because I  "know lots of random stuff."  With  photography I can apply all that random information.    But the real point is that I have so many bases covered that I can't be pinned down on any one hobby, personality type, social group{i.e. I listen to alternative rock, and love the music, but I don't really dress like a punk kid.}, etc.  Even my moods.  Most people would characterize me as being really happy, fun, always smiling type person... and I am.  But if people take the time to dig down through a lot of layers, they find out that I've gone through a lot of crap, and that I hide a lot of darkness and depression.  Its a constant battle and if I ever let it out, even just a little bit, it would become a total warfare, and that would be a horrible thing.  but at the same time, I love people, I love life, and I will embrace just about anyone who needs me to.   I'm so incredibly multi-faceted, I don't think its really possible to understand.  I don't get it.  I don't know why I do most of the things I do.  So like, you couldn't write a manual for me {like Sean! :-P}   I've come a long way from that lime green piece of yarn.

      when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me    Bleeding thoughts  Cracking boulder  Don't fall over   Fake your laughter  Burn the tear  Sing it louder  Twist and shout   Way up here  We stand on shoulders  Growing colder   Laugh or cry  I won't mind  Sing it louder  Twist and shout   Immovable shadows  The concrete girl  They'll rock your world to nothing   And they're swimming around again, again  And they're swimming around  The concrete girl   Catch your breath like four-leaf clover  Hand it over   Scream to no one  Take your time  Sing it louder  Twist and shout   Nothing to run from is worse than something  And all your fears of nothing   And they're swimming around again, again  And they're swimming around  The concrete girl   Concrete girl don't fall down  In this broken world around you  Concrete girl don't fall down  Don't fall down my concrete girl   Don't stop thinking  Don't stop feeling now   One step away from where we were  And one step back to nothing   And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears  And we're fighting for words now concrete girl  And we're swimming around again, again  And we're swimming around now  Concrete girl   Concrete girl don't fall down in this broken world around you Concrete girl don't fall down Don't fall down my concrete girl  Concrete girl don't fall down in this concrete world around you Concrete girl don't fall down Don't break down my concrete girl   and so I will be the rock in the ocean that is never washed away. I will be here with this entity...  you called it strength... I will be here... waiting. and I will be alright, just like always.  I'm always alright.  Goodnight,  my love.

      Sometimes, going to church events is just too much for me.  So many of those people have literally known me since I was born.  There are such high expectations of me there.  We had our Sedar meal tonight, which is our Catholic celebration of our Jewish heritage... we go through a version of the passover rituals... the child asks the questions etc, then everybody eats.  So many people from the parish are there.  Right now, my face hurts from smiling sweetly so much. Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hi Rachel How are you? I'm good, how are you?  That's how the night goes...  This is usuallly followed by: How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy. How's school going?  Its going really well.  I'm having a lot of fun, and keeping very busy.  I feel so fake, automatic, and Robot-ish. Everyone says how pretty they think I am, how proud of me they are...  How I did a wonderful job singing and/or reading and/or distributing communion.  Its so nice to hear people say all these lovely things about me, but after a while it almost seems like they're just saying that, that they don't really mean it.  Everyone thinks I'm so good.   Even  people I only talk to on the internet every couple of weeks or so will ask me questions like "You probably hate alcohol don't you" and when I ask them why they would say something like that they say, "You just don't seem like the kind of person to do stuff like that."  I don't understand how they know that.  I can't exactly beam my charming smile at people over the internet...  Sometimes I just wish I could go away for a year or so, and leave all these expectations of me behind...

      what can I possibly say?  Qualities/Virtues I wish I possesed: patience kindness grace serenity mercy gumption {they say if you have it, you know what it is, and if you don't have it, you can't every really understand.  I want to understand.} athleticisim a good gpa {that probably doesn't count, but its my list :-P} perseverance real generosity and charity.  I want to be one of those people who radiates a peaceful inner beauty, and always knows what the right thing is to do.  Why do I always feel so inadequate?  I'm not who I want to be, and I'm never who other people need me to be. Is it something I'll grow out of? I feel oddly like Jo, talking to Marmie in  Little Women   Danielle Rose:  You are all I am not Oh, you are all that I am break down these walls Take all my brokenness Rebuild me to shelter your name  Help me forgive myself Help me to lift the cross I've laid upon my soul Help me to look at myself through your eyes To see all I am and still be satisfied Help me forgive myself  Within my secrets, Jesus there you reside And I need you to reconcile to renew all that's inside For if I want to love you Then with you love, Jesus, I must love myself humbly too.  You are all I am not Oh, you are all that I am break down these walls Take all my brokenness Rebuild me to shelter your name

I don't think anyone would ever know it though.   its almost as if its become a reflex reaction to... well... just about anything.  Its really weird, and I can tell I'm not doing a very good job of explaining it so I'm just going to stop.  Good night.

       Rachel in a Nutshell  I'm just a girl who wants to see the world {through the lens of a camera} a single word of praise can make my day, and a single word of criticism can ruin it. {perhaps I'm bipolar} Bagels spy on me, which makes me paranoid, and I have my own Stalkers Club. {JUST KIDDING!} My favorite book is  Walk Two Moons  by Sharon Creech {see Dec. 8}, but I also love books by Margaret Atwood, though her books put me in a somewhat depressed, off sort of a mood.  I don't like being poked... I love hugs.  My favorite color is green... a shade somewhere between sage and celery...  I save worms from terrible deaths.  When I actually eat food at Winsteads I order a fried egg sandwich with tomato.  I have a tendecy to switch letters in words around {matato}  I believe that peaches are the nectar of the gods.  I've played piano for nine years, and just now discovered that I love music... even though I suck at piano.  I saw Mary once, and I pray every night before I go to sleep {though I'm sure some people wouldn't call that praying.}  I've been to 5 different countries.  I wear ribbons on my ponytail.  I don't really cry.  I'm kind of clumsy {maybe really clumsy} I am terrified of the dark.  My favorite inspirational quote is in French, and I don't speak french. { le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point. }  I've gone through somethings that no one should ever have to go through {most people have} and I've finally gotten over it. {yes really, finally. I'm not sure when this happened, but today one of those songs came on the radio, and I remembered.  All I felt was a twinge of anger.  Do you know what a wonderful feeling that was?}  I worry too much.  I spent three days in the hospital with my mom, and those three days changed me.  I learned the depth of compassion, and guilt.  I wish I could pack up a box of all the food I don't eat anyway and send it to the starving people.  I want to be good, but most of the time I am not.  In general, I am a mediocre person... but I'm very lucky, so that makes up for it.  I have never had a ballet class before in my life, but I turn pirouettes across the kitchen while I'm unloading the dishwasher.  I have a love/hate relationship with my best friend.  I know a lot of stuff, but I'm not smart.  I think its not that big of a deal.  I know every word to every song on Matchbox Twenty's "Yourself or Something like you" CD.  I love the sound of thunder... it makes me giggle.  clouds make me giggle too {:-)   And even after all this, I am still suffering from an identity crisis.  Or maybe its because of all this.

      I've had the most  wonderful  past few days. Of course I'm a little stressed about finals, but whatever.  We had a good mass at school on Friday, yay for LPM skills coming to good use... The priest actually told me I should consider being a liturgist...  at the moment I think that's my 2nd choice...  Ms. Prentiss stopped me after school to tell me how much she liked the photo I took that she bought at the Fine Arts Showcase.  She said, "It's beautiful."  I don't think much other praise has ever meant more to me.  This is why I am a photographer. AND! I saw Sean last night, and today.  Its amazing  how just having him{you} here makes me feel wonderful...  like just being around you makes me feel prettier{I should add that to the list}, Like I could glow with enough light to turn the night to day. :-)

I really do. {you too} and we practiced for mass today, and sang my lil' heart out.  Singing makes me in a good mood... unless I'm in a crappy mood.  .:giggle:.

      I love strawberries     A weird thing about me:  I hate thinking about worms suffocating and drying up to death on the driveway, so after it rains {like this morning} I go and pick all of them up off the driveway and throw them back in the grass.    There are some things, some thoughts that just can't be released from the constraints of my mind. If I told you, something terrible might happen.   But: when is it too much?  Is that even possible?  Why doesn it scare me so much?   .:giggle:.  I have a plot.

      last night was...  wonderful {what else?} I went bowling with Bobby and Sean...  it was pretty funny.   On a completely different note: I've discovered another fault of mine.  I a very unforgiving person.  I hold grudges against people for stuff they did  to me in 3rd grade {Anna Stewart}  I just can't let go for some reason...  and because I can't forgive these things, I can't let go of the pain they caused. .:sigh:.

      Conversations with Sean--  Soybeenchik847 [6:41 PM]:  silly Seano   Realitys Cry [6:41 PM]:  racheo  Realitys Cry [6:41 PM]:  rachello  Soybeenchik847 [6:41 PM]:  that would make you seao   Soybeenchik847 [6:41 PM]:  lol   Realitys Cry [6:41 PM]:  ra-cello  Realitys Cry [6:42 PM]:  rajello  Realitys Cry [6:42 PM]:  Rejello!!  Soybeenchik847 [6:42 PM]:  or maybe not   I wrote this on Tuesday:  I'm eating a bagel... again.  I love bagels.  Last week when I went to buy my bagel, the man who took my order seemed to tell what I was going to order just by looking at me. He asked me if I wanted my reciept, and I said, "Yes, please."  He gave me the oddest look and said, "I thought so."  Today I had to drive to the bank to make sure I had the money for a bagel.  When I pulled out of the bank, there was a college student wearing a red polo shirt standing on the sidewalk.  I noted his presense, but thought nothing of it.  I drove the few blocks to the bagel shop, and there he was again, crossing the street in front of me. When I went into the shop, he was already in line, ordering a bagel.  I thought:    "The bagels are spying on me."

      Ms. Hernon is my Algebra II teacher.  She's probably in her fifties, and looks kind of severe, at first glance anyway, but I'll talk more about that later.  She has salt and pepper hair that never has a single strand out of place.  A lot of people in our class are a little bit afraid of her because she gives people "evil-eye glares" and says things like, "If one more person tries to tell me {blah blah blah} then I think I'm going to slit my wrists." {She's funny like that.} But:  I think she's probably one of the better teachers I've had at STA.  And if given a second glance I think she's kind of cute, she has the most interesting sense of humor, and she genuinely cares about how her students are doing. {It  is  possible she's just been in a pretty good mood the past couple of days and she's left a good impression on me.}    No one knows if she's married or not... I've even heard rumors she was in the Peace Corps.  She orders clothes online while we're taking tests, and her toenails are painted pink. {It's kind of hard to imagine Ms. Hernon going to get a pedicure, or even painting her own toenails.}   A couple months ago she was teaching us about "depressed polynomials".  When she announced this topic, she turned from the board, and with a slight smile she said,"Now girls, this has nothing to do with the mental state of the numbers."  It is a sign of how afraid the girls in our class are of her, that I was the only one who laughed.  Today, we were going over some of our problems from homework last night, and we all were exclaiming about how we had all made the same mistake. Ms. Hernon interrupted us from her desk and said, "Well this would be one case where majority does  not  rule."  For me, math has Never been a forte.  I didn't learn my times tables until something like 7th grade.  Because I was impeded by this, I didn't do well in my math classes, and I decided I hated them.  My feelings toward mathmatics have become a little less vehement since I've been at STA, but I still don't always look forward to climbing the stairs to the second floor of Donnelly, where the math classes are.  At the moment, I am not exactly excelling in algebra, so today I went to ask Ms. Hernon what I have been doing wrong.  Even I had been a little afraid of going to her one-on-one to ask for help, but I mustered up all of my courage, and dived into her classroom.  She knew exactly what I needed to do {I haven't been studying properly.} and she helped me figure out how to fix that problem.  She was genuinely concerned with my grade, and told me several times how she knows I'm completely capable of doing well in her class.  It always helps to know that your teacher thinks your competent {maybe even intellegent.}  I've already written a lot about Mr. Thomas, and there are several other teachers here who really have made a difference, not just in my education, but in  how I view myself.  Magistra Rowland, my Latin teacher is moving to St. Louis this summer, and I'm really upset because she would have been the only teacher who had me all four years of my high school career.  She's taken an interest in my photography as well.  Whenever I bring in photos or my portfolio or something to school she always expresses interest, and she asked me if I would take photos for the Latin club dinner.  I remember one day, I forgot my book, and I was scared to ask her if I could borrow a book because I know she hates it when girls don't bring their books to class, but I did ask her and she said, "Well Rachel, since you're so sweet, I suppose you can borrow one."  She has also made me fall in love with the Latin languange, and Roman culture, and I will always be indebted to her for that.  Thank God for all my wonderful teachers, and for today, especially Ms. Hernon.

      so I'm pretty sure I don't really like the new blogger.  Hopefully I'll get used to it soon.  I was worried about Jamie before, because I hadn't heard anything about how she was doing. Now I know how she's doing, and I'm still worried about her.  But I think she'll be alright.  It was terrible though.  I just can't fathom what she must be going through.  I knew there wasn't really anything I could say, so I hugged her, and told her that if she needed anything, that I was there. I will continue to keep them in my prayers. but at the moment, I can't emotionally afford to let this get to me too much. {does that make me sound selfish?  I am.} But I'm going to write about something else now...  something that makes me happy.  Every time we talk, every time we're together, I feel myself falling deeper and deeper in love with you.  The miracle of it all is that I'm not afraid of the darkness of these depths.  I'm not drowning,  I'm thriving.  I feel safe, {perhaps beyond my better judgement, but I do...}  These depths are my refuge, my comfort.  I can draw from my love for you to find the strength to love others the way I should...  You make me a better person. :-)

      There isn't really anything for me to say, except that this isn't getting any better. Juana got a blog too.    I love irises. They're blooming now.  This is the poem I wrote about irises last year:  the irises are blooming the irises of my eyes blooming like the blood on the white sheets blooming like the bodies buried, hidden coming up roses here's the knife let me carve out the part that hurts lay it on the altar an offering   funny how it still somewhat applies. In general though, I'm much happier than I was then.

      Wonderful Things: I'm watching South Pacific:   I expect everyone of my crowd to make fun Of my proud protestations of faith in romance, And they'll say I'm naïve as a babe to believe Every fable I hear from a person in pants.  Fearlessly I'll face them and argue their doubts away, Loudly I'll sing about flowers in spring, Flatly I'll stand on my little flat feet and say Love is a grand and a beautiful thing! I'm not ashamed to reveal The world famous feelin' I feel.  I'm as corny as Kansas in August, I'm as normal as blueberry pie. No more a smart little girl with no heart, I have found me a wonderful guy!  I am in a conventional dither, With a conventional star in my eye. And you will note there's a lump in my throat When I speak of that wonderful guy!  I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May, A cliché comin' true! I'm bromidic and bright As a moon-happy night Pourin' light on the dew!  I'm as corny as Kansas in August, High as a flag on the Fourth of July! If you'll excuse an expression I use, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy!  I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May, A cliché comin' true! I'm bromidic and bright As a moon-happy night Pourin' light on the dew!  I'm as corny as Kansas in August, High as a flag on the Fourth of July!  If you'll excuse an expression I use, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy!   :-)

      ::Rachel recites/sings along with Singin in the Rain::   All I do the whole night through Is dream of you. With the dawn I still go on  Dreamin' of you. You're every thought, you're everything, You're every song I ever sing Summer, winter, autumn, and spring. Were there more than 24 hours a day, They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away. Sky's are gray! Sky's are blue! Morning, noon, and night-time, too! All I do the whole day through  Is dream of you-o-u! All I do the whole night through Is dream of you. With the dawn I still go on  Dreamin' of you. You're every thought, you're everything, You're every song I ever sing Summer, winter, autumn, and spring.

      So I found the box in my closet with all of my stuff from World Youth Day in it.  I had forgotten how much that trip touched me.  On our way to Toronto, we stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, I met Sister Marguerite, who I spoke with for almost half an hour speaking with, and when I left she gave me the special blessing of Our Lady to carry to the youth from all over the world who I would be meeting with, who she said were the Torch-bearers, Our Lady's soldiers of love.  When we got to Toronto, we met our hosts, whose house we would be living in for a week.  Our hosts names were Gerry and Kath.  They had moved to Toronto from England, and they were the most loving people I have ever met in my entire life.  Everything we could possibly have needed they had for us, which included leaving pices of chocolate on our bed every day.  The first night of World Youth Day 300,000 people gathered, and we had Mass together.  I have never felt such great faith in one place.  And I rather doubt I ever will.  It was amazing to hear the Our Father said in so many different languages at once, It truly was beautiful.   Finally the day came when I got to see the pope.  I think it is impossible to describe the aura that surrounds him, or what its like to hear him speak, despite his Parkinsons...  We slept outside with the whole community on the last night, and woke up in the morning to celebrate Mass with the Holy Father.  He blessed us all as we left. When it was time to leave Toronto, Gerry traced the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and kissed both our cheeks, yet another  blessing that had been placed on.  I truly am so blessed. I couldn't even begin to list the miracles that have occured in my life. Thank you.

      I had forgotten what wonderful therapy driving through the country with the radio blaring is. I'm in the best mood now. And Lauren Taylor called me and asked if I wanted to go see Spiderman 2 with her and Sarah. Redemption comes from the oddest places.  Somebody asked about the lyrics on my AIM profile, at the bottom so... Its Radiohead, "Living in a Glass House", and there are two versions:  Once again I'm in trouble with my only friend She is papering the window panes She is putting on a smile Living in a glass house  Once again packed like frozen food and battery hens Think of all the starving millions Don't talk politics and don't throw stones Your royal highnesses  Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat But someone's listening in  Once again we are hungry for a lynching That's a strange mistake to make You should turn the other cheek Living in a glasshouse  Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat Only only only only only only only only.... There's someone listening in    and then   once again, she is smashing up her house again  she is throwing things through windows  she is mad at someone else again,  it is now a broken home   once again, i am so low with my only friend  he is smashing up his house again  you are throwing things at me again  and i'm wrecked up all inside   well if i stop that singing now and shout  well if i stop that singing to you friend  well if i stop that singing now and shout  someone is standing there   there i'm home, once the feet inside shout it out  once a beating when i make my way out  once a beating when i'm home inside  there is nothing wrong at all   well if I stop that singing now and shout  well if I stop that singing to you friend  well if I stop that singing now and shout  someone is standing there

      I don't think I remember ever being this frustrated in so many directions before. My parents are driving me crazy, I hate my job. {sitting at a desk all day going "I hate this, I hate this, I hate this..." isn't very good for your morals. I feel terribly sorry for people who have to do this their whole lives.} I don't know what I want anymore. My life just might end up being a waste of time. {would that surprise you?}  I feel like I'm in a canyon in the badlands,  and the screams of my soul are echoing all around me, and cannot be silenced. I'm standing in the midst of this, and laughing.  Laughing hysterically.  I am a madwoman.

      Baseball is a nother cause {I just typed a-nother... ha ha.  I'm leaving that because that's funny.} of nostalgia for me.  When I was little we'd always go to the game on the 4th of July to watch the fireworks with our next door neighbors, and my childhood best friend, Rynie {or Ryan... but I called him Rynie.}  That was back when Bo Jackson played for the Royals, and I would sit on my dad's shoulders and yell "Go Bo! Go Bo!" in my little 4-year-old voice.  George Brett still played then too, so the Royals were actually a decent team.   Not so anymore.  They lost to the Cardinals 10-3, but I was rooting for the Cardinals anyway. Pitching for both teams was amazingly terrible.  Amazingly. oh well.

      I love fireflies/lightning bugs.   The glimpses of light in the darkness are incredibly comforting for me, little bits of hope. I remember catching them when I was really little, and keeping them in jars with holes punched in the lids.  I had to let them out before I went to bed though, otherwise they'd be dead by morning. One night, freshman year I was over at a family friend's house out in the country, and we were all out in the yard.  I was playing with the little kids who were catching the fireflies.  They would all catch one and bring it to me to hold in my hands.  After I while I had ten or so cupped in my hands, and one of the little girls was convinced that when I let them go, they would all fly up, and make a little lighted circle in the air.  It was a little weird, but I thought it was cute.  I told one of the guys I was dating at the time about this... maybe Travis or Ishmael {that was before I stopped dating Rockhurst guys} and he said something like, "If I had known fireflies would capture your heart, I would have caught you one a long time ago."  I thought that was really cute too, until he brought me an envelope full of dead fireflies the next time I saw him.  I was so upset that he had killed them all, that was the last time I talked to him I think. I also remember going out to catch them at a sleepover in first grade, and squishing their glowing tails onto our skin to make interestingly beautiful, yet morbid and shortlived jewelry.   I'm thinking if I get a tripod, and leave my shutter open long enough I could capture a whole field of them on film...  .:ponders:.  pray that it rains tonight so I can get some sleep...

      I wonder what would happen and I just came out and said all the things that I never admit to. Just for curiousity's sake:  I am afraid of life.  I keep up a front of not fearing anything because I am afraid people will see me as vulnerable, and hurt me. {this hasn't worked well.}  I let my parents run my life because I am afraid of what would happen if I really rebelled.  I am afraid of what other people think of me.  My closest friends aren't really my friends anymore, but I stick with them anyway because I'm afraid to go out on my own because other people will think I'm a loser with no friends.  but I really am, so it doesn't matter.  I'm afraid of admitting to who I really am.  I've spent my whole life learning useless information, and in the process missed the useFUL information.  I'm afraid of being wrong.  I'm afraid to show what I really feel.  I can't bring myself to tell you how much I miss you, because you probably don't miss me, and it would make things awkward, and I would lose you all together.  I am afraid that I think too highly of myself.  I belittle other people when I say things with out thinking. I am afraid that the people this actually affects might read it, and understand what I am saying.  I am afraid to go to Corcoran in July because they might tell me that I'm really not all that good, and that I should find another dream to follow.  I am afraid I might end up at the end of my life without anything, or anyone to show for it.  In doing this I have come to the conclusion that I am desperately afraid that everything I am is a lie. My actions, My emotions, the people I care about.  What if it is all a  lie? Then what do I do? Where can I find truth?  Yesterday I was sorry.  Today I am afraid. What day will I be finished?

I'm sorry I'm not who you want me to be. {not you} I'm so sorry, I've been so lucky. {but can't you see I'm so guilty?} {I don't like half-sentences.} I'm sorry. {that works...  yes, a noun and a verb.} I'm sorry I can't function on my own. I'm sorry I'm such a mess. I'm sorry I can only deal with so much at a time,  I'm sorry so much isn't very much. I'm sorry I'm an ungrateful wretch. I'm sorry I'm not hungry. I'm so very very sorry. I'm sorry I look so terrible {I've been crying again, even though I never cry.} I'm sorry I'm so self centered I'm sorry my world revolves around  me . I'm sorry I can't let go of my past. I'm sorry I can't let go of the pain. I'm sorry I'm such a wimp. I'm sorry I never say the things I mean. I'm sorry my dreams cost so much. I'm sorry my dreams are so fragile. I'm sorry I'm so fragile. I'm sorry I tend to say stupid things I'm sorry I say things I don't mean. I'm sorry I say things I shouldn't  I'm sorry I don't think before I speak. I'm sorry I've finally lost it completely. I'm sorry I'm falling. I'm sorry I've fallen. I'm sorry I just keep going. I can't stop. I'm so sorry. I have to stop. This is the end.

      Won't you tell me what it all means? There are still questions I'm dying to ask, answers I need to hear.   People make mistakes. {but I don't.  I'm not people.} People should be patient.  {I'm not.  I'm not people.}  I'm entertained at work, listening to the "soft rock" radio station that is the... auditory concensus at the office.  antagonizing love songs, and music from the 90's that remind me of middle school dances.  I remember dancing once with John Chamberlain to a Backstreet Boys song, and being "madly in love" with him for a year.  Madly in love... that's what makes me laugh. I've since heard that he was suspended from O'Hara for being caught with marajuana. Surprise, Surprise. Now don't you go all druggie on me. Then a Michelle Branch song comes on.  You should have heard what Bobby said earlier, without any prompting or encouragement, like he knew what he was talking about.  Maybe he does.  There's more to this than I'm willing/going to tell. I just think too much.  In the course of a lifetime, what does it matter?  That's going to be my new motto.  It puts things into perspective.  and my strategy for life is to live 5 minutes at a time.  Ha HA!  I'm positively brilliant. .:I curtsey:.

      somehow the thought makes me feel rather ill. .:sigh:. {again}  I love this song. It's about me.  She says it's cold outside  And she hands me my raincoat She's always worried  About things like that She says it's all gonna end And it might as well  Be my fault And she only sleeps  When it's raining And she screams  And her voice is straining  She says baby It's 3 am  I must be lonely When she says baby Well I can't help  But be scared of it  All sometimes Says the rain's  Gonna wash away,  I believe it  She's got a little bit Of something,  God it's better  Than nothing And in her  Color portrait world,  She believes  That she's got it all She swears the moon don't hang  Quite as high as it used to And she only sleeps  When it's raining And she screams  And her voice is straining She says baby It's 3 am  I must be lonely When she says baby Well I can't help  But be scared of it  All sometimes Says the rain's  Gonna wash away,  I believe it  She believes that life  Is made up of all  That you're used to And the clock on the wall  Has been stuck at three for days,  And days She thinks that happiness  Is a mat that sits on her doorway But outside it stopped raining  She says baby It's 3 am  I must be lonely When she says baby Well I can't help  But be scared of it  All sometimes Says the rain's  Gonna wash away,  I believe it  Baby, it's 3 AM, and I'm lonely...

      So I definately had a hour long conversation about my hair with a guy I had never met before in my life. And he definately talked more than I did.   His  hair was blue.  I kept thinking I was having another one of my psychotic dreams.  and I ate more chocolate than I ever thought possible, ha ha. Just for the record... Rebecca's friends are crazy. oh wow. .:deep breath:. .:laugh:. .:sigh:.

      I miss my Juana.  So I spent three hours suspended by a rope about fifty or more feet in the air this afternoon.  That was definately fun. and I grow fonder and fonder of Stephen the more I'm around him. and Alli will always be dear to my heart.  She didn't even want to start the climb to the top of the towers, but I encouraged her to try, and she did the WHOLE thing.  I'm SO proud of her. and Josh and I have become good friends over the past week, which I think is really cool.  Cindy was my closest confidant for so long, I knew that whoever ended up being youth minister couldn't take her place.  but I'm so glad we have Josh.  Tomorrow will be the fifth day in a row I've seen him, lol.   and I had so much fun with Tiffany and Alex, and Ali, Will, Emily, and everyone else too.  It was a good couple days.  P.S.  I've lost more weight in the past two weeks than I have in the past three years.   I'm  even a little worried

      Now the grocery store has orange juice with calcium PLUS Vitamin D.  I think you might as well mix regular orange juice and milk together and drink it. ew. Don't they know people can DIE from too many vitamins?  and our bones can only absorb so much calcium.  they're going to give us all kidney stones. Its a conspiracy, so doctors make more money removing them....  AHHH!

      “Goodbye,” he said to the flower. But she made no answer. “Goodbye,” he said again. The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. “I have been silly,” she said to him at last, “I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy…” He was surprised by this absence of reproached. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. “Of course I love you the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… Let the glass globe be. I don’t want it any more.” “But the wind -” “My cold is not so bad as all that… The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.” “But the animals-” “Well I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems to me that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies- and the caterpillars- who will call upon me? You will be far away…As for the large animals- I am not at all afraid of them. I have my claws.” And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: “Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!” For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower. -The Little Prince Antoine de Saint Exupery

      I'm definately going to have to say I do love music after this past week. I was drawn to music like a moth to a flame... Pat played piano, Steven played cello, and Craig played his guitar... lol, Craig made me laugh right when I needed it.  That was cool.  and then when we were playing Catch Phrase, I started laughing hysterically and couldn't stop...  it was really kind of weird.  This week was really amazing.  I wish I could have been more focused on it, but it was ok. {Attention HYU attendees who have yet to do JPI: SPOILERS AHEAD!!}{Non-HYU-ers... HYU stands for Heartland Youth University, a Catholic Church camp...  there are different sections, called institutes: LPM- LIturgy Prayer and Music, RDL-Relationships, Dating and Love, CLI- Christian Leadership Institute, and JPI-Justice and Peace Institute, the one I took this year.}  Monday we drove up to Maryville, and walked into the Student Union, where I was immediately greeted by so many people I think I actually started jumping up and down I felt so happy. Pat caught me and told me that Brooke from St. Robert's was going to be my roommate and asked me if I would keep an eye on her.  Of course I gladly agreed. We found our dorm rooms, half the girls I was supposed to watch were across the hall, and the other half were just down a flight of stairs.  I roamed around campus a little bit, and then when back to the Union to hang out.  I sat wit Bethany and Maria from LPM last year, then Sean came in, then we went to the opening HYU meeting.  That went as normal.. blah blah blah no drugs blah blah no drinking blah blah, etc. lol.  Then we divided into our groups.  JPI was lead by Fr. Bob and Connie.  I've known Fr. Bob for a long time, so I knew the week was going to be ok, and Connie seemed nice.  We did some introductions etc...  and split into small groups.  Our group adult's name was Paula.  I was bored, and just doodling in my notebook, and she glanced over my shoulder and commented, "You're an artist aren't you?" {if I write this much for every day its going to take FOREVER!!} Then we did this activity where we evaluated different personal values.  We picked three, and wrote about how certain ones were hard for us.  I wrote: "Loving is hard for me because loving people can lead to pain, and when I get signals of possible pain, I close up."  My other important values were Faith and Hope...  at the moment I'm doubting that hope part. We also had a debate on whether the world would be better or worse off in 40 years.  There were more people on the worse off side.  The realization I came to: "If you do something to make the world better for one person, then in 40 years  their world  will be better."  In my journal that night I wrote: "Everytime I come to HYU, they tell me to be open... to let go... to take off the mask.  Like that is what you're supposed to do.  Where does it ever say that I should be open to letting myself be painfully wounded?... I can't let go this week.  I can't afford to break right now.  I am CLOSING when they are saying to OPEN.  That doesn't work so well...  ... For right now, I think I'm just going to pretend nothing is wrong."    arg, I'm tired of typing now. more later.

      Sometimes it amazes me the way pieces fall together. or fall apart.

I need somebody to talk to. but I'm going to be self sufficient.  lol.

      I'm home now.   HYU was wonderful as usual.  It's always nice to go somewhere where everybody knows your name... like Cheers.  and know there are people who genuinely care about you. {Mary especially.  We watched the lightening last night...  and talked.  a lot.} Bobby's mad at me. My head feels like somebody slammed it with a sledge hammer. I know why I feel the way I do now. Several people said some amazingly nice things about me.  It means so much to me that they think these things. but if I'm such an "intellegent, articulate, beautiful, talented, sweet" person, Why don't things ever go the way they're supposed to?  Sometimes it sucks to be the one people look to for everything, to be the role model, the one who knows stuff {They actually flipped a coin to see who got me on their Trivial Pursuit game.} to be the shepherdess {just for the record, I truly love my sophomores, every one of them. Its just hard worrying about them sometimes.  Maybe in my next post I will give acknowledge amazing people I met this week.}  Ali:  "Rachel why aren't you smiling?  That's not like you."  and I really wasn't myself this week.  or maybe I was myself, stripped of all my...     aluminum foil?  {lol, do you get it? never mind.}    I'm rambling about the things that prevent me from thinking about the things I'm not thinking about.  It's going to take a while for me to get this out of my system.

      Sorry guys, I abandoned you.  I've been at church camp all this week, and I got too busy before I left to explain where I was going.  but I guess the bottom line of what I need to post is that Sean and I broke up.  People keep asking me if I'm ok...  Yeah, sure I'm fine just like always.  except when Josh asked me if I was alright I started sobbing. Yeah, sure I'm fine just like always.  More than anything I just want to know what he's thinking.  I feel horribly empty, and yet horribly heavy, and now, I'm still sinking farther, but now I have no air supply and I'm drowning.  But everybody knows how I am with those basic human needs like that.  I don't eat or sleep.  Why should I need air?  Why?

      What I wrote in my journal last night:  This is one of those times that I can't let go of what's clinging to my soul, because I'm afraid if I do, all hinges will  become unloosed, and I will fall to pieces all over again.  {and I won't be able to pick up the pieces this time.} It has nothing to do with anyone except myself,  and at the same time has  everything to do with the people around me.  Or the people who aren't around me.  Or the people I can't tell are around me.  I am terrified, horrified. I can see it coming  or at least I think I can but I'm praying that its another one of my wretched nightmares The ones where everyone I love is torn from my too-tight grasp. I don't deal well with this.  ...would you believe me if I said it didn't matter?

      Read the post before this first.  If you know me at all, you probably know, I've usually got a pretty good grip on myself, my emotions, my hormones... whatever the hell you want to call it. Tonight I definately didn't and that's not cool.  After I posted earlier, I went and cried myself to sleep, woke up twenty minutes later from a nightmare which made things that much worse. Talked to Juana for a while, which made me feel better for a while, then not so much.  I worry about other people too much sometimes.  Then my parents came home, and my mom merely mentioned the fact that I forgot to clean the kitchen like I told her I would, and I pretty much melted into a puddle.  I need a hug.    I HATE this.    I'm not going to sleep tonight... I don't think I can deal with any more nightmares.

      I'm going to have to say that was the crappiest day I've had in a long, long time. I was nearly smashed SEVERAL times today by various semi-trucks and minivans. I was yelled at by my doctor because I haven't been taking my meds... My drawing teacher kept yelling at me {well she doesn't yell, she's very quiet, but she Scolded me.} about cutting AWAY from my art. Work was not fun. Then I came home, my family ate dinner without me. again. I found out I'd overdrawn on my bank account again, when I was convinced I was finally learning how to keep up  with it,  and then I found out that one of the babies that I babysit is so close to dieing.  He had meningitis or something, and was in the hospital for a while, but they finally sent him home, and over the weekend he had a stroke.  He's only like 9 months old. Even if he does live, he might not be able to walk, and he might be blind. I'm so scared for him and his family.  Please pray for him.  Pray for a miracle.  I think I'm going to cry.  I feel terrible.

I'm ready to go home, and be home, and see people...  etc.  I'm not ready to go home and go back to work, or have my mom yelling at me every waking moment of the day.  .:sigh:.  Susan said I did a good job. She likes me. .:contentment:. there goes  that  part of it...  I haven't become attached to these kids like I do at HYU.  So I don't think there are any people I will miss...  I think I'll just miss the environment...  being surrounded by art, and people who know art.  And being co-ed.  That's still so weird to me.  I'll be so focused on what we're learning, and then I'll be like, "Oh wow, there are GUYS here."  its weird.  I'm sleepy.

      Last night, I was sitting in my dorm room reading, and I heard my roommate out in the hall talking on her cell phone, pacing back and forth.   She sounded desperate, almost panic stricken.  She had lost the concentration to cover up the southern accent she's been hiding all week.  She stood out in the hall talking for a while, then she came into the room, and walked into the bathroom, and shut the door.  The walls of the bathroom are very thin.  I could hear every word she said, even though I tried not to listen...  "How could you let me tell you I loved you all this time when You KNEW you didn't feel that way?  You were just using me so you could make yourself feel good.  Well, I can't do that for you"...  she was quiet for a while, then I heard a choked sob, "Well, you know what, fuck  you Abe...  Fuck you for using me like that, Fuck you for wasting my time on something that was never there..."  After a while, I heard her hang up her phone, and listened to her choked sobs for a while.  She and I have not gotten along too terribly well this week. We just aren't compatible I guess.  But I went to the door, and said {I hoped gently} "Charlotte, are you alright?" {I thought, that was a stupid question of course she's not alright.} She snapped back,  "Yes, I'm fine."   "If you need anything, let me know, ok?" "Yeah, sure"  she said, before I had even finished.  Later apparently Abe called her back, because I heard her crying hysterically again, saying, "I'm so angry right now, I can't talk to you.  I would never say anything like that to you.  Don't you love me?"  I had a horrible urge to go in and slap her, tell her to suck it up.    Don't let him know what he's done to you  I didn't, of course.  I've decided that relationships are a bad idea.  Someone always gets hurt,  unbearably hurt.  Why chance causing or bearing such pain? {again.}   What is the worth of a broken heart?

      Why is everyone so sad?  Why can't we all be wonderfully happy? it would be so much easier. I kind of want to curl up in a corner and cry for a while. but I won't, because that would be a bad thing. a bad bad thing. I've convinced myself that even if I could bring myself to tell you, you wouldn't {don't} care, and it wouldn't make a difference. I hate being slapped in the face with my loserdom... lol. I'm incredibly cold right now. Today Mark Kettenhoffer from Nikon is coming to tell us all about the spiffy new stuff Nikon's coming out with. I like Nikon. It makes me happy. See?   I'm  happy.

      I  LOVE it! but now I have a photoshop workshop, I'll ttyl.  I'm back.  Last night we went on a boat down the potomac river, while it was raining.  We went with the other Corcoran group that's here, and I was offered a chair at a table full of guys from the other program.  We had SO  much fun...   We had contests to see who could hold their breath the longest.  I started laughing almost immediately every time, it was terrible.   Tonight we're going to a show at the Kennedy Center... YAY!  I am on a first-name basis with a pulitzer prize winning photographer.  I told you I'm lucky.  {oh, and sorry I didn't answer the phone when you guys called last night, for some reason my phone didn't ring.  I looked at my phone around 3:30, and I had like 10 missed calls, and I felt really bad, because I wanted to talk to you guys...  and it was too late to call you back.}

      Here I am, at the Georgetown campus of the Corcoran College of Art+Design. Jesus Christ, I'm never nervous, what's the matter with me?  I love Georgetown though, its beautiful.  I keep looking around thinking, "I could be living here next year.  This could be my home, this could be where I belong." and then I think, "but what if its not?"  Last night we went to the World War II memorial,  I was just in awe of how much those people gave up for us.  My eyes filled with tears when I saw a framed photo wrapped in plastic wrap placed at the base of one of the pillars.  There was a face put to all the monument stands for.  There aren't very many kids here... 39 I think she said. tomorrow I have my first college interview with the admissions office. .:smothers a terrified scream:.

I continued to walk, but my shoe did not.&nbsp; I managed to stay upright, but not without much waving of arms, and grabbing onto complete strangers to balance myself.&nbsp; I’m so incredibly talented.         &nbsp;       Once again, I wish I were just a little less clumsy.

      I can't see!  Somebody light a candle!  &nbsp;  Bobby is listening to Lost Prophets...  "I wonder if you're listening Picking up on the signals Sent back from within Sometimes it feels like I don't really know whats going on Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here"  that's his favorite song.  &nbsp;  I'm too afraid to look, too afraid that I won't&nbsp;find what I'm looking for  I'm too afraid to ask, too afraid the answers won't be the ones I need.  &nbsp;  and yet I'm fearless. {an infinate contradiction... that's why I don't know&nbsp;who I am}  &nbsp;  I'm exhausted.&nbsp;

      I think I'll go insane. I'm still awake. WHY? WHY CAN'T I SLEEP? {I know why...} I'm telling you, my ceiling is much too entertaining to stare at, especially when I can't see it because its dark. I tried watching Venus rise, but now she's past my window. and a storm blew past a couple of hours ago. I'm still awake. .:sigh:.

      Don't be ridiculous. &nbsp; Bobby is taller than&nbsp;I am now.&nbsp; It makes me feel 1.) short, and&nbsp;2.) old.&nbsp; How can I be old enough to have a younger brother who is taller than I am?&nbsp; .:sigh:.&nbsp; He and I have been getting along so much better lately though.&nbsp; Its incredibly nice.&nbsp; I can tell he looks up to me because he always has something to show&nbsp;me.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; He makes me laugh. {not that that is a hard thing to do...} He's even kind of started being protective of me.&nbsp; That makes me laugh too.&nbsp; My little brother, my adorable little brother worries about me.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;

      hmmm... This could be a new way to let you into Rachel's head.&nbsp; Completely random, again.  --Edit--  I decided&nbsp;that if I added&nbsp;two more songs, there would be 40, and I could make it a top forty list. now, what top fourty this is, I have no idea.&nbsp; I think they're just songs that make me think of something.&nbsp; They all have connections to random things that I don't think anyone could possibly know unless they lived in my brain, which would be weird...&nbsp; and they're in no particular order. &nbsp;    Audiovent-- When the Rain    The Postal Service-- The District Sleeps Alone Tonight {D.C.

      I'm home now.&nbsp;  I wrote this in the hospital: "My hatred for hospitals is only being reenforced, but I'd rather be here, than back in the hospitals where my mom and dad had their surgeries.&nbsp; My grandpa has changed so much since my mom was young.&nbsp; They used to not get along very well, but now he grasps her hand, his thumb crossed over hers, and puts her hand to his lips.&nbsp; He is glad we are here.&nbsp; He is not alone. In the waiting room, there is a dry erase board, and scribbled along to bottom of it, it says, "May God be with you and your family."&nbsp; It is comforting to think that someone has thought of me, even if in such a general manner.&nbsp;  There is a man sitting across the room, who has the desensitized look of someone who has been here for a long time, yet his jet black suit is still impeccably pressed, and his pink tie still snug around his neck.&nbsp; I entertain myself by imagining his life story." &nbsp; hmmm... I have so much to do before I leave on Saturday.  My horoscope for today: "That certain person you've been dreaming about? The one who's just confident enough to actually keep you interested? The feelings are mutual. Be the first to mention them." &nbsp; wow...&nbsp; can I take a rain check on that one?&nbsp; nothing's changed. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      A fellow blogger from Texas sent me an e-mail this morning saying that maybe I could write a book the same way I write here, and get it published.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd never thought of that before.&nbsp; That could be intriguing.&nbsp; I don't think I have to patience to write a whole book though.&nbsp; We'll see.  &nbsp;  He also said that I sound like I'm searching for something, "perhaps yourself."&nbsp;  and I am.&nbsp; I know I am.  &nbsp;  But at the same time I KNOW who I am.&nbsp; I know the things I love, I know my opinions, my thought process...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don't get it.  &nbsp; I'm off to St. Louis.&nbsp; Pray for my grandpa, pray for me.&nbsp; and call me too, if you want.&nbsp; Distract me from the horrors of the hospital.&nbsp; {that means you, Juana!}

      sweet, blogger redid everything again. I got a new template.&nbsp; It kind of matches the mood I've been in lately.&nbsp; In ways too complex for me to possibly explain to you, its just something about the gaudy fakeness of the color pink...&nbsp; It won't stay long, I promise... &nbsp; I had another dr.'s appointment today.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting.&nbsp; She had problems finding my heartbeat too.&nbsp; lol, I don't have a heart!&nbsp; I found it kind of entertaining when she went through the list of questions she's supposed to ask me, and just made assumptions, "You don't drink alcohol, you don't smoke, you don't do drugs, you aren't sexually active...&nbsp; etc."&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to defend my morals!&nbsp; or I could have turned into a party machine since last year, and she would never know, haha. {I haven't.}&nbsp; She commented on how much I've changed since middle school, which is true.&nbsp; I had braces from 3rd grade through 8th grade.&nbsp; No wonder I was such a loser.&nbsp; Then they did some tests on my blood, and it turns out I might have something called HSP or something.&nbsp; I'm going to die... just kidding. &nbsp; a week and a day...&nbsp; then everything will be absolutely perfect again.&nbsp; I will adopt my new life, meet the people with whom I hope to be spending the next significant chunk of my life with, the people who I may find my niche with, the people with whom I will finally figure out how the hell my life is going to end up. I'm nervous.&nbsp; but anxious too.&nbsp; Sama's out of town,&nbsp; Chantele's leaving tomorrow for a week, I'm leaving for St. Louis for the weekend, even though I still don't want to go.&nbsp; I don't think I have the strength to deal with all that right now.&nbsp; I'll just live in my book all weekend.&nbsp; Or you could call me and keep me sane... but that would be asking too much wouldn't it?&nbsp; And I'm even missing Alli's birthday party tomorrow night... at Lunar Bowl no less.&nbsp; But I'm going to go to St. Louis, in case my grandpa DIES.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I sound like a horrible person, and I am.&nbsp; But I'm not as unfeeling towards my grandpa as I sound.&nbsp; I'm really worried about him, but I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm counting on the fact that he's going to be fine,&nbsp; in which case this weekend will be a complete waste of my time, and I will be missing my last weekend before I leave, {I know its only a week, but you never know, I might just decide to stay there.} and I will have to sit there, in a hospital the reasons for which I despise it, I have already discussed {that didn't make sense... but you get the point.}&nbsp; and be with all my aunts, most of whom like to pretend I'm still 8 years old, and cover my ears before saying something they probaby shouldn't.&nbsp; {Arrrrggrrrrrah!!} &nbsp; .:sigh:.&nbsp;&nbsp;  and there's even more I  COULD  on and on about, but I won't, because its already bad enough as it is.

      .:sigh:. I'm bored of this already.  oh well.  St. Robert's kids make me laugh.  One of the middle schoolers suggested something that scared me just a little bit though...    eek! Alli and I had a dance party after we got eliminated from musical chairs.  Reba says I'm being stupid.  lol.  She's probably right.  She likes to tell me what she would do if she had my life.  I'm glad she doesn't have my life.  I need to stop hanging out with her.  I think she's a bad influence.   oh well.  She makes me laugh.

      So I was wrong, my grandpa's surgery was this morning...  My mom was waiting to go visit him until he got out of ICU I guess, I dunno.  He came out of the surgery ok, but he has to make it through the next 48 hours before he'll be alright.  He's 78 years old.  This kind of thing is really hard on an old body.  .:sigh:.  I'm exhausted. I need a hug.

      I'm reading  Caucasia  for my summer reading:  "There are people in your life who seem good, and people who seem just all right, " she told me, twirling a copper strand of hair and chewing thoughtfully on a fry.  "But when it comes to a crisis there are only those who will save you, and those who will abandon you."

      I am a horrible person. {again}  My grandpa is still in the hospital, and he is having major heart surgery Friday afternoon.  My mom is driving to St. Louis to see him.  She asked me if I wanted to go.  I don't. I hate hospitals. I hate the smell, I hate the merciless florescent lighting.  I hate the shapelessness of scrubs.  I hate how I can feel the pain and suffering, the mourning of death seeping into me as I sit there, waiting.  I hate waiting.   and I know I will end up sitting in a corner of the waiting room, while my mother and her sisters ignore my presence, as always.   I don't want to be there if something happens to him.   but I'm going anyway.    .:please pray for my grandpa:.

      Vacation Bible School is fun, little kids love so unconditionally, it never ceases to amaze me.  I think I got more hugs in three hours than I have in the past month.  I love watching their faces as they learn new things, they're so curious, and their wonder is so great.  I can't help but smile. and I learned to be prepared when I sit on the floor.  I think I had four kids in my lap at one time, lol.  .:contentment:.

      I'm watching the electrical storm blow in.  It isn't raining or thundering, just lightning. So I'm sedated, but not asleep. This would be a bad time for the enemy to ask me the secrets of the world, because I would spill them all.  but I'm still kind of in a disgruntled mood.  I hate it when I have off days.  We played volleyball and I seemed incapable of hitting the ball over the net, and water {like the pool} just makes me even more graceless. More than anything I wish I possesed at least a little grace.  But I don't. I'm terribly clumsy.  it was definately an interesting day.  I'm watching When Harry Met Sally... it makes me sad.

      mmm... that was fun.  Julius Caesar is definately not my favorite Shakespearian play, but I have a feeling I would have liked it a little better this time if I had actually gotten to watch it.  and I got a little sleepy on the ride back to my car....   but that's ok I suppose.  Hmm.. that self-portrait of me that I  took is weird because I didn't know that my eyes were capable of being that color.  but it doesn't really surprise me.  My eyes are not one color.  They vary depending on the mood I'm in, what I'm wearing, what I eat...  Its kind of cool.  but even when they do change, its still impossible to tell what color they are. Somewhere between blue, green, and grey.  its intriguing.  I don't think I'll sleep tonight, just for the fun of it!

      Rebecca says I'm "not allowed" to be single for very long because I "need someone to take care of me."  I asked her what the hell that was supposed to mean, and she said that there has to be someone who's around me a lot to make sure I eat/sleep/don't walk into anything, because I tend to forget about things like eating, or I just don't... lol, and I guess you can tell by the circles under my eyes that I haven't really slept in a while. {and I thought the make-up had done a good job of hiding them.} She acted as if I'm not perfectly capable of taking care of myself.   That is absolutely ridiculous.  Now I'm going to have to die an old maid just to spite her. besides, it isn't anyone's business if I've decided to starve myself to death. {I'm kidding!}  .:sigh:. I've been thinking about it a little more, and you know, I guess I know the essence of who I am.  The part that drives me crazy is the expectations people have of me.  For some reason, it bothers me to have people assume things about me, even if their assumptions are correct.  Because I hate it when I might  actually  make a mistake, and everyone freaks out.  Sometimes I think I just want to stand up and scream, "FUCK YOU!"  just to see what would happen.  I think the whole world would die of shock. And I know how flawed I really am.  I have MY OWN shoes to fill, and its really hard.  I don't know how I managed to get here.  But I guess its a good thing people have such high expectations of me, because it challenges me to better myself.  I can and will be the person that everyone needs me to be. :-)

      I don't know how to deal with this.  My world is in ruins around me. There is no shelter left for me... and somehow I'm supposed to still be smiling... {which I am, its my  duty  and I'm not me if I don't.} There is no where left for me to turn.    I keep losing control of my emotions.  I used to be so good at holding things in, at least until it got really really really REALLY bad.  But then there were people to help me.  There isn't anyone any more.  So then I get frustrated with myself for losing control, which doesn't help.  Then things get worse.  There is no way I'm ever going to make my parents happy.  Nothing is ever right.  There's always something else I should have done...  But if I would just TRY HARDER, I would be good.  Then there's Chantele, who makes me so mad, and then I feel terrible for being so pissed at my best friend. Samantha, is Samantha.  I always feel like I am not near as much to her as she is to me.  I feel like I don't really know her. And everyone else I love dearly, but it takes a lot of trust for me to be able to talk.  and then there's Sean.  I'm trying so hard not to think about it...  but then I'll go to youth group, like tonight, when Madie said, "It makes me so sad that you and Frog broke up.  You guys were perfect..."  like that's supposed to be helpful or something.  and now my grandpa's in the hospital, and my mom said it isn't anything to worry about, but you know how I am about worrying.  Who's visiting my grandma in the nursing home, if he's in the hospital?    I'm so nervous about Corcoran, I almost don't want to go. and on top of that, I'm questioning what I want to do with my future. {but we won't go there now.}  I'm already stressed about school again. {NINE CLASSES.  WHAT WAS I THINKING????}  and I keep finding flaws in myself. I feel like a horrible person.  There is so much crap in my head right now.  This is the brief version, I haven't even begun to tell the complete stories.  I can't get it out.  but its ok.  if you want you can pretend I didn't say any of this, because I'm still smiling, and I'm still me. see?---> :-)

      So I found even more proof that I am a foot-whore while Chantele and I were shoe shopping yesterday.  Apparently, when your toes are long enough that when you wear the new low cut shoes you can see your toes start to separate, it is called "toe cleavage", and this is seductive.  lol, my toes stick out a lot.  So not only will I steal your foot from you because its nice and clean, I will SEDUCE it away from you.  lol, oh how that makes me laugh.

      Well, now I'm worried about Chantele.   It's better when I'm worried about someone else, then I can't think about myself,  which I shouldn't be doing in the first place, anyway.  I'm working on being selfless. That's my impossible goal for the summer.

      Oh, and Happy Independence Day.  All of my pyromaniac friends should try not to kill themselves. Which would be all my guy friends. {I have support for this theory.  I heard on the radio that 75% of all firework-related injuries are male, and 25% of all firework-related injuries are bystanders.  Those would be the girls. lol.  ok, well I don't really trust the radio's numbers, but the connection is amusing.}  but really.  I like you a lot better with all your fingers, eyes, etc.  but have fun.    My brother put his shirt in the freezer "because it was hot."  That was it. He makes me laugh, I like him.

      Pieces of the puzzle: {Don't you know how terribly INSANE I am?  You'll never be able to figure it out.}  "So where  is  the crazy guy when you need him?" There's something you're not telling us. {wouldn't you like to know.} Rachel {not me} cut her hair.  She looks like a lion now.  It's cute. .:pat pat:. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? ba ba ba da-da ba ba-ba "This is so painful it hurts." {yes, yes it is.} I feel adorable in this dress... "That's because you are!" YOU are such a liar.  Don't you know I hate it more than anything when people lie to me?    and I am FLAWED, but I am cleaning up so well!!!!!  So who's going to take care of you? OHMYGOD step-turn-fall {flat on your face, please.} mmm...  or am I origami, fold it up and just pretend?  {yes.} Is there a whole? Yesss.  I'm falling through it. I bought new shoes.  They came in a box.  Antony Trakas can just EAT HIS HEART OUT. 20 days. Let's MOVE! Wait, do you want to move? Where have I been?  Right behind me. "You're always a lot safer with your back against the wall in a room full of backstabbing bitches" {such an astute observation.} ah.. the tangled webs we weave... "WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO AVRIL LAVIGNE??" "BECAUSE IT MAKES ME HAPPY"  "hm.  That's cool, because you're crying" "whoa, I am!" {insert scary hysterical laugh here} What do you honestly think? "You're the most beautiful creature I've ever seen." Thank you. {what did I say about lieing?} I'm quite capable of fending for myself. Even I don't posses that kind of strength. {Do you remember?} "THE LIGHT IS RED!" oh. you're right, it is. "Have a good night, what's your name again?" Shirley Jones. And they lived happily ever after, the end.  Thank you for flying Rachel's random connections, please collect your personal references, and exit toward the left of the blog.  Sorry kids.  Random thoughts in my head, I had to get them out some how.  I

      Shopping makes me happy.  That's terrible. Clothes are only things.   But I got the cutest little black sundress, and new shoes, and I can fit in a size 3 skirt now. That makes me happy too.  Thank God I have other things to think about now. Like summer reading.  AH! and 21 days till Corcoran... 21 days... .:sigh:.  Will you  miss me?

      Definitely had mucho fun last night.  Definitely have one hell of a headache now. We had a dance party in Lauren's backyard, and then went to  see Spidey...  lol.  {Tobey McGuire is adorable.}  I have been so jumpy lately.  Not only did I scream out loud during the movie Several times, I screamed during the PREVIEWS.  I don't know what's the matter with me.  Sarah was teasing me about it afterwards, and Elizabeth said, "Yeah, I'm pretty sure the whole theater heard you."  I'm a little embarrassed.    The movie itself was ok, special effects were cool, as I said, Tobey McGuire is adorable, love story... eh, I really don't like Kirsten Dunst very much.  She always seems horribly fake to me.  I'd give it ** out of ****  And apparently I look different now.  Elizabeth seemed to think I've lost weight, and Chandler thought I had gotten highlights. {My hair is still completely Au Natural, though I'm going to Rebecca's again tonight, so I'm not sure how long that's going to last.}  I don't think I've changed at all... have I? I was... {lol}  We also had some interesting conversations, one of which I need to rant about, but I'll do it later because I need to think about how to do it in a calm, intellegent way without hurting anyone's feelings.

      I want to be the person everyone seems to think I am. I want to embody the compliments that I recieve. ...but I need to learn humility as well.  I get a little {maybe a lot} too self-involved. Sometimes people say things about me that I don't understand.  They confuse my sense of identity... "but then, Rachel, you aren't like other girls..."   Is that a good thing?  a bad thing?  "sometimes, I'm just in awe of you..."   what does THAT mean?    I feel like there's a bubble surrounding me that keeps me seperated from other people.  I'm NOT different.  I'm just like everyone else.    anyone want to tell me who I am?

                                  My parents keep telling me that I&#8217;m going to have to work really hard to get into the college I want to, because they can&#8217;t afford to pay for it. &nbsp;They say it&#8217;s not going to just fall into my lap.           &nbsp;         And the thing is, I think I&#8217;m expecting it to. &nbsp;I really don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had to work hard for anything in my life. &nbsp;I just always end up with what I want, it seems.           &nbsp;         In my profile, I say I&#8217;m a very mediocre person, but I&#8217;m very lucky, so that makes up for it.          And it does. &nbsp;My dad makes fun of me because when I try to make a basket with a wadded up piece of paper, I usually throw it horribly wrong, but it&#8217;ll hit the side of the bookcase just right so that it bounces in. &nbsp;That&#8217;s how my life goes.           &nbsp;         I guess maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so good at photography. &nbsp;So much of it is based on luck. &nbsp;You always hope that you lucked out and clicked the shutter at exactly the right time.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a shooting strategy called the &#8220;hail mary&#8221;, where you hold your camera up over your head to get a better angle, and you pray that you get it right. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m lucky, so more often than not, I do get the shot.           &nbsp;         I&#8217;m lucky because I never studied for a chem or history test, and I still ended up with and A in both classes. &nbsp;           &nbsp;         I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;Its really weird. &nbsp;It just seems like everything falls together for me, just the way its supposed to. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t decided whether or not this is a good thing.          I think I&#8217;m afraid that eventually my good luck will run out, and then I won&#8217;t have any idea how to take care of myself.           &nbsp;         You know, I think I might be a little bit of a megalomaniac {you&#8217;re no Jesus!... &nbsp;only he says it JAY-zus&#8230;} &nbsp;&nbsp;maybe. &nbsp;Maybe not.           &nbsp;

      This picture is probably going to be really big, and I'll have to delete it later...  Too bad my computer's broken and I can't use picasa to fix it.  Arg.   It's me and Bobby outside of our hotel.  My dad says I'm giving him the evil eye, but I'm not really...  I'm just looking at him!

                                  I find it really kind of odd how everyone&#8217;s reacting to Sean and I being together again.&nbsp; It seems like everyone has their input.&nbsp; Some people are exasperated {which is weird} and some people are really excited {which is even weirder.}&nbsp; I almost feel like we&#8217;re a celebrity couple or something, lol.&nbsp; I have had several people call me the past couple days and want to talk about it&#8230;           &nbsp;         I guess the bottom line is that its between Sean and me, we&#8217;re the only ones who really know what&#8217;s going on, and there&#8217;s no way I could possibly explain it to you.          Only just that its pretty cool&#8230;&nbsp;     J

                                  I&#8217;m really excited about doing   The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe   &nbsp;its going to be great.&nbsp; And I think I&#8217;ve wanted to be a nymph since about 3 rd  grade or something.&nbsp; I remember walking around in the woods behind our house, and talking to the trees.&nbsp; I   knew   they had spirits. {yes, I know.&nbsp; I was a weird kid like that.} &nbsp;And I got the idea from the Chronicles of Narnia&#8230;&nbsp; so it all fits together.           &nbsp;         Sean and I are going to get sushi for lunch.&nbsp; Yum&#8230;

      Feel good moment of the day: I was at the grocery store, in the egg section.  Next to me there was a cart with a little girl with blonde curly hair, and her mom. The little girl kept looking at me, so I smiled back at her, and as her mom started moving on I heard the little girl say, "That girl is really pretty Mama."  That made me smile.  I am listening to MxPx: Do Your Feet Hurt? lol.  I really want an iPod now, after all those kids at Corcoran had one.  They're pretty spiffy. I want an iBook too, and I want my dad to let me have the D70...  he bought it a couple weeks ago, and as much as I hate to relent to the convenience of digital...  its slowly creeping into me.  I'm getting ready for school to start.  I miss my newspaper girls.  and all my teachers.  and I'm bored of working.  I don't have to work tomorrow though, which is a very good thing.  I still haven't sent in my summer reading and it was due yesterday.  slacker=me.

I was going to go out with Chantele until I discovered she was using me to avoid going out with Phil.  She is so mean to guys after she's "finished" with them. seriously.  I loved D.c. I loved Corcoran.   I really want to call Mr. Thomas and tell him all about it. lol.
