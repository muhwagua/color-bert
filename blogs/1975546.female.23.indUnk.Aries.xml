      it is possible that we can move beyond the past and create a new world that no longer has the dark cast of demons and ghosts?  is it possible to forgive and still love anew?  am i a phoenix rising from the ashes or just a soot-covered fool?

      nobody reads this damn thing anyway, so i'll attempt to be poetic (and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love).  when we love and we feel that sense of spiritual understanding, that interweaving of self, and we hold each other and cry.  crying for joy because of what we have been given, the gift that we sense so few have had, and crying knowing that death, time, or own forgetfulness of that moment will take it away.   we argue about the petty, meaningless issues that make up our justification for an existence and forget the times when we were angels - and knowing that was all that mattered.  we look back in our lives and laugh.  laugh because of the love that we have encountered, the beauty we have seen and for each ending we know there is a beginning and the understanding that the cycle will continually renew.  or as john lennon would put it - "why on earth are we here?  surely not to live in pain and fear.  why are earth are you over there?  when you're everywhere.  come and get your share."  so, it's late, and that is my opinion about love ....

      No, Mark, Tree lives in NYC. And it's suddenly cold; but since it's April ("springtime in Germany...") we'll have nice weather again at a moment's notice. --And the cult-cha! Sister, I'm telling you this place is crawling with it. Ironically, I am now working at the costume shop that made the white Elvis-style jumpsuit for Britney Spears' Las Vegas concert PR campaign (she sent us a signed poster of herself in it recently). So much for the highbrow artsy theatre stuff. Sigh.

      me again, with more advice on happy blogging.   the best page to bookmark (and the only one you need) is  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com .  from here, you can read what's up, and then if you decide to post something, you can click on the  click here to login and post  link on the left side (this takes you to www.blogger.com).  from there, login to "circle of irony", type in your words of wisdom, click on "post & publish", and then click on the  view web page  link in the left and center of the page to see how what you've written looks like on the blog (alternatively, you can just refresh the  yelahneb.blogspot.com page ).   REMEMBER:   don't forget to "post" AND "publish" your missives (there's also a single  "post & publish"  key).  if you only click on "post" and not "publish", the sysop (me) has to come in behind you and "publish" your text - otherwise, it doesn't show up on the blog.  everyone wants to read what you have to say - don't deny us!  ;)

      hello group - now that i'm starting to get the hang of writing HTML, please post any suggestions you might have about the look of the site - things like font size, color, etc.  for that matter, if any of you are having trouble with logging on, posting, etc., please email me.  also - for those wanting to look cool and clever, you can have whatever hip "handle" you want on the blog.  that way all you shadowrunners can remain pseudo-anonymous!     to change your handle:   while you're on the "post and publish" side of the blog, click on "team", click on your name, and then click on "edit your profile" in the top right hand corner.  if you want a single word for your handle, just choose a character of some sort (like a ! or a number or something similar) for your first name, and enter your handle in the last name field (you have to do it this way because Blogger forces you to fill out both name fields).  of course, you're entirely welcome to go by your actual name, but that's soooo 20th century.  ;)    while you're on this screen, go ahead and set your time zone to EST if you haven't already.  you can put in a relevant email addy for yourself if you wish, but it isn't necessary.

      welcome, chummers, to the new and improved   circle of irony  .    join us as we blather on with a sense of relevence and self-importance about an endless array of topics:  politics... science... religion... politics again... yes, this is hard electronic proof that i (and now you, apparently) have one or more of the following:   1.  no life 2   too much idle time 3.  a job with a computer (those fools think you're working - you'll show *them*!) 4.  an idiot in your life named ben   sooo, with those qualifiers out of the way, let the posturing and mindless chatter commence!  this way, there's no need for us to clog our inboxes with meandering discussion threads - and if you no likey the thread, you can simply not visit the site for a few days.  it's beautiful, man...  now get posting!  if you've replied to the "blogger invite" that i sent, you should be able to post by now to the special "publishing" site.  the page that you add posts to (or "publish", as blogger describes it) gives you an entry screen at the top.  once you've "published" whatever bit of wry writ you've come up with, you can then go to  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com  to check it out by clicking on the "view web page" link.  in other words, the site you enter your rant on isn't the same site for viewing everyone else's. if you have any questions, give me a holler.  if this seems like more trouble than it's worth, go back to sleep.

      Speaking of Russia, what in the world is going on here?  Russia became a junior member of NATO recently (like 2 days ago).  Correct if I'm wrong, but NATO was formed to combat the Warsaw Block (which died 10-15 years ago).  The Warsaw Block was held together by the USSR (aka Russia).  Why do we need NATO anymore if Russia is such a good friend that it is joining the very organization that participated in its defeat during the Cold War?!?!?  Something does not add up here.

      I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say "Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!"  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.  She was not attuned to the Force at that point, masking her from Vader.

      i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.  the issues you are pointing out are due to inconsistency on the part of george lucas.   then again, one could argue why was obi-wan able to communicate with luke after his death but yoda wasn't? or why darth vader could sense luke but couldn't sense leia ? my point being is that there are no real answers to these questions - we could conjecture on what the answers are but none of these very valid points were addressed in the movies so we can only assume that it was lucas who was not paying attention to the details of his films.

      something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: "disappearing" vs. "leaving a corpse" at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan "dies" at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some "thing" one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the "body fade away at death" spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his "disappearence"?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke "saved" him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a "ghost" next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same "place" after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away "off camera", and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the "disappearing death" is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning "midichlorians" gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, "oh crap, that's right.  oh well."

      the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan "better-late-than-never" shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper "blogging" contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be "several" years between e2 and e3, and then "about 20" years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as "infants" in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from "actual" creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the "C-3PO has switched heads with another robot" gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, "look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?"  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that "other" plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan "dies" at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)

      the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead "boogey man" for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.

      Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III:  1)  Who was Jango working for?  On one side, he was the basis for the clones.  On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the "pha", what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.  Alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen.  It was more like riding a roller coaster (i.e. being on a track) than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling SUV.

      even though i know people don't read this - you really should it's great!!!!   anyway, this is about parents and children in the california prison system - it's about how mothers aren't allowed contact with their children while they are in prison and the trauma this produces for those children well, shocks of shocks people -  this is my position these women commited a crime (drug specifically)  - are the problems they have with their children really related to the fact that they are in prison?  were they good parents anyway?     here's the story http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/05/08/contact_visits/index.html

      an argument for absolutes in what seems to be a subjective universe -  in order for certain mechanisms to work they must have an order - there is a specific way it must be done or it will not work.  in order to get a car engine to run there is not one truth for me and one truth for bob - if one of us does not put the engine together correctly, it simply will not run.  there are rules - mathematical and scientific rules that must be followed in order to get results.  these are absolutes.  these are your objective facts.

      watch that pendulum swing baby!     some of my favorite quotes:  "This is new. We have thrown the gender switch," said Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "The War Against Boys." "What does it mean in the long run that we have females who are significantly more literate, significantly more educated than their male counterparts? It is likely to create a lot of social problems. This does not bode well for anyone." and "As a nation, we simply can't afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future," said Susan L. Traiman, director of the group's education initiative  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38887-2002Jun24.html

      one final note (for now) on the marriage as solution issue (and yes, i think salon is presenting an extreme view - shock!)   from what i have experienced in life (which is limited indeed) one of the best feelings one can experience  is to see a person, touch them, and realize that no matter where you physically are, that you are home.

      i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one, there must be a reason why this desire for long-term bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures.  also, what is wrong with wanting stability in an ever-changing world?  yes, there are bad marriages that can ruin a person but in a healthy relationship where both people contribute,compromise, and share it can enhance your life tremendously.

      32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  "But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!".  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new "green" technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.

      Mir - I have no idea how old you are, but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.  I don't know if it falls under the category of "mid-life crisis", but it seems to be similar.  To all those listed below, these are just my observations and are in no way intended to be judgemental.  Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the "mainstream" workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.  I could stay where I am now and provide for my familys needs for the next 30 years,  But, will I be happy?  Probably not.  Is this a local phenomenon or a cultural event?  It is strange that people less than 10 years into a career could be so burned out.

      Aparently, and I have no text to back this up, the report sent to the UN came from the EPA and not the White House - small but significant difference.  President Bush has reaffirmed his opposition to Kyoto (phew).  I am a little concerned that some lower level government official (Christine Todd Whitman at the highest) has the authority to send such a report, supposedly representing the view of the President, to the UN when the report does not agree with his opinion / policy.  In other words - what the hell is going on in DC?

      it's amazing how many diversions and distractions we create for ourselves.  for those of you at china panda last night (and for those of you who weren't - you should really try it - good vegan buffet, free soda and all under 8 bucks!) you may have overhead johnathan and i discussing basically my life and how incredibly fucked up it is.   he had many good points and probably the best was dedicating myself to the now and not existing in the past and future.  also, he made an excellent point about graduate school.  what is the purpose in going since i don't particularly like to write and i don't know what i want to do with the degree? distraction and diversion.  working full time and going to school full time, i won't have a moment to consider life once the heart and soul are dead.   it hasbeen said that religion is the opiate for the masses.  if so, then psychotherapy serves that role for  the intellectuals.  there is nothing better they like to do than to analyze things and vanity inevitably leads us back to the self. what a perfect arrangement and we pay for it.   all distractions until the big tragedies, the few moments of wonder, and the shoulder twisting times of doubt and then we die.  alone.

      Mir, you must be slipping.  I just heard that the Bush administration sent a report to the UN agreeing that global warming does exist and that humans are the likely cause for the warming.  On the flipside, they say there is nothing we can do about it and proposes no changes in fuel consumption and other generally expressed ideas for combatting this.  Talked about mixed signals.

      I agree Mir, the man should not be tried.  They should have removed him from the speech site and barred him from reentry.  I don't know what the background of the speech was (i.e. was it a polotical fund raiser or a paid speech), but decorum demanded that the man allow others to hear what Bush was saying.  Once he broke that "rule", he should have been removed, not arrested and charged with a crime.

      Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as "niggers" and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact — none at all — for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove — through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony — that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on "Saturday Night Live." Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.

      Congratulations, John & brood.  And now, for your collective gustatory pleasures: Andalusian Gazpacho - serves 4 1 piece baguette, 2" long, crust discarded 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, or to taste 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, optional 2-1/2 lbs ripe tomatoes, cored & quartered 1/2 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil garnish: finely chopped red & green bell peppers Soak bread in 1/2 cup water 1 minute, then squeeze dry & discard water. Mince garlic & mash to a paste with salt using flat side of large knife. Blend garlic paste, bread, vinegar, sugar, cumin & half of tomatoes in food processor until tomatoes are very finely chopped. Add remaining tomatoes with motor running &, when very finely chopped, gradually add oil in slow stream, blending until as smooth as possible, about 1 minute. Force soup through a seive into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. Season with salt & vinegar before serving in bowls or glasses. Can be chilled up to 2 days.  Eat you up some Hanover tomatoes for poor little old homesick me. There are no good tomatoes grown by these damned Yankees.

      I was over my brother's house changing the oil in my car. I learned that Nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brother's oil clamp would not grip. They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for "listening".

      University of Connecticut physics professor Ronald Mallett, 57, said in April that after years of study, he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel, involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects. Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

It's just not an easy field to break into, so I feel like I'm paddling upstream sometimes.  But I keep going, 'cause I don't have any choice but to do so.  To give up would not be in keeping with my character.  I may be frustrated and cry and scream and get angry and think the world unjust, but I collect myself and keep trying, 'cause that's me. :)  I'll be fine, trust me.

      Hi, y'all. Just read the postings from the 21st & have to say thanks for the props, and (after "Nice to meet you, Angie lass") DO WHAT YOU LOVE OR LOVE WHAT YOU DO. It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents). But enough about subverted intentions.

      I have mixed feelings about the death penalty.  There's the part of me that says if it were MY family member/spouse/lover/friend murdered so horribly, I would want swift, brutal, American-style justice.  But I don't really believe that.  I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, "Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?"    Food for thought.  Speaking of which, I'm REALLY hungry...

      This I know.  And nothing but accolades to Jennifer and her accomplishments.  I just don't want to be telling myself "you still have plenty of time" in fifteen years. :)  And sometimes I get scared of that.  It's this stagnancy phobia of mine.  After living in Small-Town Mississippi for twelve years, one becomes VERY afraid of being "stuck."  And as I gaze up at the walls of my parents' basement in which I currently reside, that fear becomes ever more potent. :)  But underneath the worry I do hoard an almost obscene level of optimism that everything will turn out as I wish.  I only get worried when reality's timeline for me is not exactly in line with the one in my head. :)  I am, for the most part, a very happy monkey. :)

      Oh, just having a minor-league pity-party for being nowhere near where I thought I'd be at this age.  This pity has since passed.  I'm just kind of having one of those bummer times in life when you literally feel angry that life is not what you want it to be at the moment.  I'd give almost anything to be working right now, doing what I love.  And getting paid for it.  But instead I'm dabbling in what I love and getting a degree in a fallback field in case the dabbling never pays off.    Bleh.  *sigh*  I'm fine.  Just had a poopy moment.  But it has passed.

      MadLib #1  Awake! Fear! Fire! Foes! Awake!   The night deepened. There came the soft sound of otters led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they quibbled, and twenty-nine lavender figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemur capitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seat chafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.  At a second blow the window seat yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The lavender figures passed gleefully in.

      from Francine Prose's novel, "The Lives of the Muses" : "Perhaps psychology has convinced us that the human psyche is too complex to derive something so tough and enduring as art from something so fragile and transitory as love, nearly anything — geography, ambition, expensive tastes, an abusive childhood, poverty — seems a more probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or love."

Well, I can't read the number that you just gave me There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time I think about a love that I thought would save me  Isn't that the way they say it goes? Well, let's forget all that And give me the number if you can find it So I can call just to tell 'em I’m fine and to show I've overcome the blow, I’ve learned to take it well  I only wish my words could just convince myself That it just wasn't real But that's not the way it feels  Operator, let's forget about this call You see there's no one there I really wanted to talk to Thank you for your time, ah, you've been so much more than kind And you can keep the dime  Isn't that the way they say it goes?

      When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks — who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case — was really pregnant.  "She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160," he said. "And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out."  "Was there a pregnancy test done?" I asked.  "No." said Mr. Keahey, adding "There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell."  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that — based on the available evidence — was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  "We have no physical evidence," he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that "a manifest injustice" had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. "He thinks he's God!" said the D.A. "Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant."  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. "They hid it from the rest of the world," he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. "She didn't go to a hospital," he said. He laughed harder. "If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy."

      I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.

      I'd love to reread "Lolita" after learning French.  Humbert has all of these thoughts and musings that I'm sure I'd find fascinating and tender were they in a language I knew.  I don't think you're shallow.  I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.  These are people who use words like "paradigm" in everyday conversation.  I personally find it boring.  I'd rather watch "The Golden Girls."

      I know the feeling you are going though when trying to read a story you like but for some reason the writing style just sets you on edge.  I discovered that after getting through such a book and waiting a length of time, then try re-reading it the story is much more interesting and easier to understand.

      Currently reading "The Master & Margarita" by Mikhail Bulgakov. It's an intriguing story but I am hating the Russian idiom; the names are all blurring together, they all talk too much, & they're all unhappy. Am I lazy? Am I shallow? Why can't I like this book more?

      "This is a fancy way of racial profiling," said Carl Baron, an immigration attorney and researcher at the University of Texas. "Just on the basis of where a person is from the government is going to subject them to these measures. You're going to see fewer Middle Easterners willing to come to the United States and I wonder whether that isn't the real agenda."

       this is, hands down, one of the stupidest things i've ever heard.    SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html

Nice to be back in the Big Apple, though.  Congrats on the onstage murder, AA. Nice to see postings from JLS. Glad you got wheels, MM. And kudos for the promotion. How's the little woman & her cargo, Silentw? Bach, I like the posting format status quo. Thanks for asking. And I don't ever use the links & have none to add.  Wish that I could make it to the Porkfest. Eat for me. Overeat, in fact.  Will be in town September 7 through 9 or 10. Perhaps we could all (or mostly) meet up? Have a wedding to attend evening of 7th....

      the  urlLink health  of the nation http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20669-2002Sep29.html urlLink   i think this article needs a password - in case it doesn't i'll assume the blogmaster will get rid of the actual article and just leave the link Health Coverage Falls  Uninsured Numbers Up After 2 Years of Decline    By Amy Goldstein Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, September 30, 2002; Page A01   The number of Americans who lack health coverage has begun to increase again after a two-year decline, according to federal figures to be released today, which suggest that the faltering economy propelled another 1.4 million people last year into the ranks of the uninsured.  The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  "This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a "Cover the Uninsured Week" next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. "We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits," said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. "The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years," said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.    © 2002 The Washington Post Company

      Hey, Ben, instead of reversing the order of the posts, why not change the archive settings so all that older stuff is on a different page. I would think that having only the last 7 days' posts on this page would be better than not archiving. If that were case, it wouldn't really matter if these things were ascending or decending.

I'll be moving back to Astoria (Queens) in the middle of next month, by the way, to share a place with my lovely former roommate Katharine. Will post relevant info in case of housewarming gift-urges. But I like Shipley's list best.  I like she-males.

      Have a good weekend, people.  And for God's sake, shut that damn computer off and go outside.  Or at least get laid.  Or masturbate, if necessary.  To porn of Asian cross-dressing midgets in latex whipping beared she-males that work at 7-11 named Thomas/Theresa.  But that kind of porn can only be found online, so nevermind.  I mean, that's what I hear. Not like I'd know or anything.  ... shit  I'm not a perv or anything.  Really.  Well, okay.  Maybe I am.  But at least I didn't have "faerieland" on my top places to live.

      Okay, ironic circlists, you heard Ben!  Let's vote!  All in favor of having the blogs post in sequential order from top to bottom (instead of bottom to top) so that it's easier to read, say "Aye!" (make sure you post it on the blog as well instead of just saying it...).  All opposed; well, just keep your opinion to yourself...  Kidding!  If you like the bottom to top order the way it is now, say "Nay".  I for one vote to change it.  So AYE!

      jimi:  like you, i prefer sequential order as well; however, since the page loads from the top, it makes more sense to have all the messages in reverse chronological order, to save you having to scroll all the way to the bottom.   however , if enough people would like it that way, i will certainly change it.

      There definitely are, but it's a question of "filling in the gaps." Sometmes I don't have enough work for a 40 hour week, while some weeks I put in 60+ hours. And the way I look at it, I need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two. Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.   But I won't even go into the hassle I face getting paid on time. Suffice to day, I just got a check for an article I work the beginning of June. Little pain in the arse work can be beneficial, if it brings a little, but steady, paycheck to help carry you through other times.   Anyway, back to more corporal tunnel syndrome-inducing labor.

      As a test run for a potential gig, I just spent the past 3 and a half hours transcribing a 37 min conference call. I think I failed miserably.  The company indicated that you have 90 min plus the length of the call after it ends. So, 9 AM call ended at 9:35. 9:35 + 1:30 = 11:05. 11:05 + :35 = 11:40.  I finished the damn thing at 12:30, an hour late... sigh...  Yet, I'm not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenaline-driven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash. If I were able to do the thing in 2 hours, it'd be good money. But who can type over 50-55 words a min.  I mean really??  I need a nap, and I'm supposed to start another one at 2.  Must. Drink. Coffee.

      Well, my kidney infection is gone.  But once the pain from that subsided, I was shocked, SHOCKED, to discover that my back is hurting badly from an unrelated injury.  I was just hurting from my infection, so I didn't realize it.    I'm seeing my chiropractor tomorrow...until then, I'm staying flat on my back as much as possible.

Others never really caught my eye enough to watch them.  There was one episode of Matlock, however, that I recorded when I was 18, because my girlfriend at the time was in the background in a bikini!  Remember Michele Basye all you Lee Davis Alumni?  It was filmed at Va. Beach on a day that her family happened to be there.  Ahh memories... Anyway, feelin any better Angie?

      I LOVE THE FOOD NETWORK AND ALL THAT IT ENCOMPASSES IRON CHEF RULES  I enjoy almost anything they re-run on A&E...Law & Order, Third Watch, Murder She Wrote, Magnum PI, L.A. Law...I also ADORE St. Elsewhere, which I think they show on Bravo.  I love Matlock, but I can't really deal with Diagnosis Murder...it just tips the cheesy scales too much for me.  I also love Remington Steele and Scarecrow & Mrs. King...Bruce Boxleitner (sp?) + Pierce Brosnan = a double dose of hot!  And of course Columbo rocks.  How can you not love a man who annoys his suspects into confessing?  I also really loved that cheesy mountie show, Due South, when they were rerunning it on TNT.    I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of any right now.  Jesus, I watch way too much television.

My guilty pleasures: Beastmaster, Charmed, Columbo, Hunter, In the Heat of the Night, Iron Chef, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Law & Order, The Lost World, Magnum PI, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, NYPD Blue, Simon & Simon, Walker Texas Ranger, and Witchblade. And Good Eats and Nero Wolfe, which I think are NOT guilty pleasures. I just really like them.

      and now, the moment you've all been waiting for... the  Circle Of Irony Lack Of Participation Awards!   now that the 6-month anniversary of the Circle Of Irony has come (and gone), it's time to recognize those members of the Circle who have better things to do than posting to the blog.  without further adieu, let's take a look at the winners:   3rd Place goes to  Scott Moran , who has only posted twice!   Let's take a look:   So how does this damn thing work anyway? posted by Scott Moran at 2:02:25 PM    and who can forget his next (and final) post:   Ah, crap. It is posting my name and not my selected screen name. Blast this new fangled technology! posted by Scott Moran at 2:03:41 PM    Enthralling!  Let's move on to our 2nd place winners, a three-way tie between  Shannon Erwin ,  Mark Wells  and  Leslie Louick , all of whom have only posted  once !  Read on for their contributions to the forum:   I have not seen Episode II yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread, but I just wanted to let everyone know that I am present and accounted for, and thanks to Ben for inviting me back into the sandbox. I had missed our discussion threads and I now feel loved once again. You like me! You really really like me right now! sniff sob sputter posted by Shannon Erwin at 1:59:37 PM   and how!      Ben, does this mean that you're now living in New York? I never seem to hear about anything that happens on the east coast anymore. posted by Mark Wells at 3:21:06 PM    and the coup de grace:   OK, OK, I finally joined! posted by Leslie Louick at 5:32:30 PM    Wise words all!  But let's not forget our first place winner,  Jason Haley , who despite being an official member of the Circle Of Irony  has never posted a single message!   props to your ironic detachment, my brother!   honorable mention must go out to  Chris King  and  Leigh Amateau , who have been repeatedly invited to the blog, but have never joined.  you guys!     Congratulations to all our winners.   You have a life!

      One of my fiancee's friends from grad school worked for Interfaith Housing Corp. before going back to VCU. It's a Christian-run non-prof here in town that handles real estate and housing via communities of faith. She was Deputy Director, and did a lot of grant writing and PR stuff, as well as meetings with donors and local politicans (::rolls eyes::). I don't know much about the sector or their mission, but I understand they're a little overwhelmed since she left. She is a consultant and still does some work for them, but according to her, it's not enough, and they haven't hired anybody to fill her shoes.   Then again, they might have told her they were going to try and not hire someone else to save bling, bling...

      a very sad tale from a scary city  A Roll Call: Decrepit Rooms to Wrong Pills   Broken Homes | The Operators: Voiceless, Defenseless and a Source of Cash (April 30, 2002  As operators and providers profit from adult homes, state inspection reports show that many of their residents go untreated and unbathed. Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents "ill-groomed and malodorous." Workers "psychologically abusive" to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.

Okay, opening the floor for comments: I need suggestions.  I recently got a gig with AOL, writing reviews of stores and boutiques for their  urlLink Digital City site . Think Citysearch, but I'm not supposed to say that. I need suggestions of places to write up and am open to all possibilities.   FYI: I just did One Eyed Jacques, so RPG geeks have been addressed already (this means you, Jimi!!) I don't think I know my editor quite well enough yet to Priscilla's and Taboo yet (damn!) Help!

      Okay, I guess from now on, my humorous remarks will come after the serious ones.  My comments about the ACLU is because I don't really like most of the causes they persue, not because of the case they are taking for Dr. Rajcoomar.  Now... On the lighter side of things, I watched Monsters Inc. for the first time last night.  Hilarious!

      I would have put a hyperlink for the article but that site requires a password to read their articles.  Considering that the majority of people on this site do not have a pass code for the Washington Post, I decided to post the article instead.    and johnathan, no matter how badly he wants it, will never work for KMFD.  accept it and move on angie.  it's not worth ruining your life over this.

      You're right..Johnathan never worked at Kings MF Dominion.  He has insecurities about it.  He feels as though he missed something.  It keeps him awake at nights, crying himself to sleep, wishing for the day when he could have feasibly worked at KMFD.  He yearns for the smelly polo shirts and the khakis and the white shoes.  He aches for the smell of garbage behind Inferno Funnelcake.  Please, God, just don't talk about it anymore!  It's tearing us both apart!! *sob*

      "He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged." "This was airline security gone berserk."  You know it used to be considered sensationalism for journalists to give opinions or slants of their own on the experiences of others.  But then I guess just reporting the facts doesn't sell newspapers, enthrall television viewers, or attract Internet users to your website anymore.  I am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to Dr. Rajcoomar.  I really don't understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat.  But as for their reaction to the actions toward Mr. Feuer, what would you expect?  If they had asked him to calm down, pretty-please with sugar on top, would be stupid.  They can't take chances in situations like that.  They would have aslo HAD to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others. But wouldn't you know the ACLU would step in--even though no one was openly worshiping God or trying to keep pornography out of the lives of children.  But then peoples' feelings were hurt weren't they?...

      the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours -  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too closely."  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could — and should — have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  "I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin," said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too closely."  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "I had never been treated like that in my life," he said. "I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed."  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  "We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security," said Dr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."

      When I was poor illegal immigrant of only 15, wearing nothing but a mullet, ruffled denim skirt, and fishnet top, Ben picked me up in a lime green 1975 Honda hatchback on the corner of Broad and Belvedere, and I became his bitch.  Fast forward 15 years, and I still owe him money.  Truthfully? Ben and I went to high school together, then worked together at King's MuthaFuckin Dominion ( always  use "MuthaFuckin," people). Way back shiznit. Ben used to DJ at parties at my old apartment when I was at VCU, and we made a pilgrimage to Memphis and Graceland in the mid 90's. Jonathan (I think) contacted me a few months ago after finding a reference to Ben and an old school photo on  urlLink my website . Wasn't long before I'd check in on this page every so often.  Not exactly glamorous, huh?  As for me, I won't take up space here, but my site should explain quite a bit.  urlLink The video of me humping a rocking chair to the Beastie Boys  probably best represents my lack of touch with reality.

I do occasionally feel guilty about my illnesses.  Not so much toward the insurance company, but for those around me who have to deal with it...since, well...I get sick a lot.  I'm just one of those lucky people.  I guess I couldn't be this beautiful and talented and charming without having SOMETHING wrong with me.   But yeah...Cigna can bite my ass.

         can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    "Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

      Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when his telephone rang.  "Hallo, Mr. Hussein!", a heavily accented voice said. "This is Paddy, down at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!"  "Well, Paddy," Saddam replied, "this is indeed important news! How big is your army?"  "Right now," said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, "there is myself, my cousin Sean, my next door neighbor Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!"  Saddam paused. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command."  "Begorra!", said Paddy. "I'll have to ring you back!"  Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. "Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!"  "And what equipment would that be, Paddy?" Saddam asked.  "Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor."  Saddam sighed. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1 and a half million since we last spoke."  "Saints preserve us!" said Paddy. "I'll have to get back to you."  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. "Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Pub have joined us as well!"  Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!"  "Holy Mary, and Joseph!", said Paddy, "I'll have to ring you back."  Paddy called again the next day. "Top o' the mornin,' Mr. Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war."  "I'm sorry to hear that," said Saddam. "Why the sudden change of heart?"  "Well," said Paddy, "we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and decided there's no way we can feed two million prisoners."

      you are right, jennifer, i did state that dates were very unwelcome but what the hell, i thought since you were coming all this way to eat at pasta luna that i shouldn't put the same restrictions on you.  i understand about being tired.  i could get everything in my life done if i just didnt have to sleep.

      No bring no boy. ( No woman no cry.) He's teaching a kids' cooking class in the Bronx for a charity, and I didn't invite him to come anyway. Besides, I thought dates weren't welcome to the Blog Eating Contest (how many blogs did the winner eat last year?). I can't believe I'm a) renting a minivan (for driving my furniture back from RVA to my new apartment) for fuggin' $350 (because the $39.95/day special isn't offered in NYC), b) so tired from working so goddamned much, c) freaked out about the sniper madness, and/or d) all of the above.

      you know, ang, the service there is awfully crummy.  and i don't even like indian food.  but ben does love indian food and if he asked me to whip myself with an extension cord i would which thank god he has only requested twice but you know, i think it's time for me to break free from his tyrannical rule and establish myself as the queen of my own palace, rather than allowing him to wear the flowing robes and tiara all the time.   with all that in mind, i decree that unless anyone disagrees with me, in which case i will immeadiately back down and mumble incoherently to myself, we will be dining at pasta luna!   god save the queen.

      As for the Blogger dinner...I vote for Pasta Luna, for the following reasons:  a)  I love Italian food b)  The portions there are huge c)  They have creme brulee, which is the food of the gods as far as I'm concerned d)  While I loved the food at India K'raja, the service was awful and I suffered from a sad tummy afterward e)  Did I mention I love Italian food? f)   You know what I REALLY love?  Octopussy.  What a great flick.

      i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used "for missions targeting the United States."  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were "six months away from developing a weapon." And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy "for a long period of time."  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  "Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them," Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, "what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right."  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was "imprecise," said it stands by his words. "The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts," Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. "We reject any allegation to the contrary."  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. "There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place," is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for "hard evidence" to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently "extrapolated" the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. "The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' " he said in Michigan last week. "And that could take a long period of time."  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it "does not object" to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: "I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need."  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: "Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material." The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush "was imprecise on this" and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited "one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year." He asserted that "we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet" of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them "targeting the United States."  Bush also stated that in 1998, "information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue." He added, "Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists," an alliance that "could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints."   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an "experiment" and "attempt" and labeled it a "serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region" -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack "on any given day" with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as "low" that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the "extreme step" of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was "unrealistic" to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that "because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away." There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made "the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time."   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was "nothing uncommon" and decried the "explosively larger education bill."   © 2002 The Washington Post Company

So at least it would be something I truly feel...  I, too, have an image of the guy being some pissed off white vet (as in Nam, not as in Dr. I Take Care of Cats...although that would be pretty damned funny, too)...  *sigh*  Stupid ole stupid.

      This is Richmond, not Hollywood. Although knowing Henrico cops, they'd certainly get into that scenario. Some of those guys have been waiting their whole lives for something like this. Sheriff Cook must be crapping his pants with joy.  I myself thought it was somebody upset that Dell fired that Steven dude from their commercials. I know that's enough to make me pick up a gun.

      if this is the sniper that was caught today, then he (they) were extremely disappointing.  i was anticipating a white, mid-30's, ex-militia or military, having a big gun battle with the police, never giving up ground, killing several officers before finally turning himself in and finally telling us his motive for doing all of this like " i believe we shouldn't go to war with iraq because it killed my best friend" or "i want custody of my kids", but instead we have some guy hiding in a van in richmond, va meekly giving up to local police.  what a wuss.

      what warbot had to say about me  Gatekeepers in paradise by R. Robot  "There could be some unwelcome consequences," said Mir this week in a dream I recently had. This is why I could no longer write for Z Magazine, not with a clear conscience. Now that's just bizarrely ad-hominem moral equivalence. After all, this is a man who has amassed a deadly guitarsenal. Like Yasser Arafat, Mir believes in a contemptuously duplicitous philosophy of appeasement. The only word for it is deceitful -- and cynical. Cunning pundits like Robert Scheer and others apparently believe the best way to confront the sniper is to give him a big, sloppy kiss.   When President Bush tries to protect us from deceitful brown men, Mir and her fellow leftoids cry out, "racial profiling!"   God forbid the public be able to vote for moral reform.

      Mir - In my opinion yes one can sacrifice one's mood for the happiness of another. However if one is always having to do this then that relationship is not really a happy one. There has to be some time for oneself for their happiness. In thoses time someone else mood may have to be sacrificed for the happiness to come about.

      I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, §1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. §5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the "intent of the voter." Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a "hanging chad".  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.

      Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted "to be sure that each vote was counted" had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a "man" Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               "The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of today’s Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president."   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.

      A stay would be "the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process," Republicans argued. But that's exactly the point: there is no "federal election process." Elections, even for national office, are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats. The highest arbiter of election disputes is each state's supreme court.  The 2000 Florida dispute resulted in Republicans--historically the great champions of states' rights--obtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states' constitutionally-protected control of elections. An appeal of the Florida Supreme Court's decision, no matter how flawed that decision may have been, violated the Constitution. The fact that Renhquist et al. agreed to hear Bush v. Gore is what makes Bush's regime illegal. Had the court installed Gore rather than Bush, Gore would be the usurper. Recounts, hanging chads, choosing Bush over Gore--those details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup d'état.  A Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court broke the law on behalf of George W. Bush. Would they do it for Douglas Forrester? "The elites beat up on the Supreme Court very severely for Bush v. Gore," commented conservative George Mason University professor Dan Polsby. "I'm sure they don't relish being beat up by those elites again." On Oct. 7 the Supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the Florida case--they refused to hear the case, without comment.  Election disputes, after all, are resolved by each state's supreme court.    urlLink - Ted Rall,  The Ironic Implication of the New Jersey Imbroglio

      When You are Old  W. B. Yeats   When you are old and grey and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true, But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

      The Second Coming  Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre will not hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.  Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming!  Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight; somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with a lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, it's hour come round at last, Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

I want to write bad poetry About pain and sorrow and loss. Maya and teenagers haven’t cornered the market On being downtrodden. After all, What about the white, college-educated, middle-class male? We got our gripes, too.  But I won’t put any effort into it Unless I’m drunk Or sentimental. Which might actually make it worse. I want my poetry  To be the literary version of a Baz Lurmann movie. If Moulin Rouge can win an Oscar Who says I can’t be Poet Laureate?  I want to go on Oprah And have her kiss my ass. I’d act pretentious and sullen And lecture about my triumph over adversity. I’ll make Jonathan Franzen look like her best friend. And If I’m really lucky,  Dr. Phil will come on And I’ll kick his ass.  It’s about time I got recognized As the writer of my generation. Coupland can collect plastic bottles and design furniture, And Ethan Hawke’s novel will wipe my ass. Fuck Damon and Affleck Screenplays are for pussies.  I want to be Kerouac the traveler Fitzgerald the Hollywood-abused Thompson the twisted  And Hemingway the suicidal drunk. Pounded into one person From a 4 AM bar fight in Queens. With a side of Joyce for good measure. I already drink Guinness.  I promise to use vile, filthy words. Stuff I couldn’t say on the Today show. Things like smack, crack, crank, and blow. Shit, fuck, suck a duck. Prick, dick, sniggedy-wick. Give the dog a bone.  I feel better already. Now give me my NEA grant.

      thanks for the clarification johnathan.  sorry that the way i rephrased my question (i wrote a response then went back and edited it - that was what i meant by rephrasing - not rephrasing you but myself -perhaps i should have made that clear) annoyed you.  i was just stating my opinion - wasn't trying to offend.

      Ben - I did not answer the questions because the rephrasing seemed to suggest that the words weren't read at all, which annoyed me because I was in a mood conducive to such. Mir - I answered the first question in my previous post.  In an ideal world, I would answer affirmatively to the second question.  This is not an ideal world, and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, so some socially-agreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves.  I suggest "governmental action" because my initial assumption, that proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, precludes the private sector doing anything unless profit is possible or even guaranteed.

      the new "state-of-the-arf" shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their "living rooms."  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new "state-of-the-arf" shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  "Oh, my gosh!" says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. "I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!"  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to "go no-kill." The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  "What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly," says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. "This place is bright and friendly."  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored "dog living rooms." About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, "I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach."   "They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside," says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A "lifelong dog person," Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. "It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog." A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 "kennel runs," each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat "condos" and three cat "cotillions" -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  "When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level," says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. "If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them," says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. "Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring," the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. "It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs," says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 "companion animals" end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? "It just blew my mind," she says. "Six cats and two dogs."  On the second floor is a "humane library," a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  "Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it," says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an "international chat" online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. "We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity," says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as "The Ultimate Pet Care Facility," it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  "It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change," says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  "You work really hard," says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people "care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes."  What worked in Richmond, she explains, "was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked."  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  "I have trouble with that comparison," she says. "If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  "All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives."

      mir's movie reviews 8-mile - good film. surprised by the acting abilities of eminiem. latest bond film - okay.  not a really big fan of the bond films but i have definitely seen worse.  halle berry looks good.madonna couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  trailer for the two towers - awesome.   trailer for daredevil - mixed.  i like these types of films but i'm having a hard time dealing with the idea that ben affleck will be playing daredevil.  and the chic playing elektra seems kinda lame. trailer for bad ass monk movie - a must see.  has chow young fat or whatever his name is in it.  dude -action, kung fu, and something of a storyline.

      - My thoughts and actions may or may not be the result of societal influence. - Interesting that you read "societal mores are irrelevant to (me)".  Curious as to where that appears in the text. - Interesting that you read "(I) think that each individual should determine their own responsibilities..."  Curious as to where that appears in the text. - Interesting that you refer to "...a governmental body or a group of individuals."  Curious as to where that appears in the text.

      let me rephrase:  are you stating that societal mores are irrevelant to you and that you think each individual should determine their own responsibilities as opposed to having it dictated to them by a governmental body or group of individuals?

      In my opinion, these are questions that a society asks for itself. The universe pre-, during, and post-Human doesn't care. The answers will vary from society to society, as well as from individual to individual. All I ask is that you do not attempt to direct my responsibilities.  I can manage them myself, on my own terms.

      you know the more i think about this, the more it just infuriates me.   what's that, asks zee bear.   that some people believe that not everyone has the right to decent housing, food, clothes, and health care.  these are just fundamental rights.  how could you deny someone these things?  could you honestly go up to a woman who is ill and can't work and tell her,it's just tough shit for her?  don't we as a society have a responsibility for each other? now, how that's going to be done can be debated and realistic solutions should  be created.  but to think that those things are wrong to begin with?  i just don't get that.

      Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.

While her tormentors take a break, she finds herself alone in a room with a figure curled under a bloodstained sheet. When Dianna pulls back the sheet, there is a woman who "opens her eyes, and they are light brown in the black and blue of her face. Her teeth appear in the crack of her swollen lips. She is trying to smile. I catch a sob in my throat and gently take her hand. Her breasts have been cut, and maggots are crawling in them." The woman asks Dianna's name, and says "Dianna, be strong." They hold hands. "For what seems like hours, we hold on to each other."    urlLink http://www.salon.com/books/review/2002/11/19/ortiz/index.html

      The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13 — The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  "We will never raise more money than the Republicans — never," said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. "We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message."  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  "I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees," said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee."  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.

        Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad "Your Cloud" to the irresistibly poppy single "A Sorta Fairytale," Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like "Mrs. Jesus" (yeech) and "Wednesday," which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on "Wednesday" long enough to wheeze, "Lost in a place called America." But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. —Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this

      A quick note, kids: Life has a funny way of working out (to paraphrase Alanis), and the irony of it all is a balm to sooth even the deepest hurts. For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S. The wierdest part was going from 20 degrees and 24" of snow in New Hampshire to 78 degrees and sunny in Hawaii in less than 24 hours.

      I agree with John's comments re: TTT.  I also had issues.  But as a movie, I daresay Joe Moviegoer gets his motherf*ing money's worth in terms of images.  Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.

      For those that have not seen Two Towers yet, read carefully.  Nothing I consider a spoiler, but you may disagree.  As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.

      a tad bit more important than the whole trent lott controversy: The department wishes—without having to establish any evidence of a crime—to record names from organizations' mailing lists and petitions, photograph and videotape protesters, and plant undercover agents inside groups and events, according to its court filings. Among the requirements police want wiped from the Handschu agreement: routine oversight; paper records of surveillance; internal reviews of investigations; and publicly available summaries of basic information, such as the number of new probes opened in a year.     urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0251/lee.php

      Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.

      chris, i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler, not trent lott. actually, i wasn't really comparing hitler to anyone in particular; i was showing an example of how a person can say something that is not overtly racist but could easily be perceived that way.    i agree for the most part with everything that jls said.  this controversy about trent lott really is just a form of misdirection:  so we aren't discussing real problems and coming up with solid and practical solutions.    and like i said in my post, i knew it was an extreme example - it was mostly for fun.

      It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of "colored" people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word "colored," perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought "Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words."  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.

      Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. "Ben," I say, "you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long." [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say "segregation" -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: "Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948." (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); "Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke." (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); "Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday." (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); "...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House." (AP, 16 Dec 02); "...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948." (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: "Gore, speaking on CNN's "Inside Politics," said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'" (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....

      all right, john - i'll use an extreme example but they are always the most fun :) let's say, for whatever reason, that hitler had immigrated to america, and soon all of his nazi past was pretty much forgotten, he had been elected to the senate by the fine state of south carolina multiple times, and hell, he even had some jews on his staff. okay, it's hitler's 100th birthday.  trett lott gets up and says "you know adolf, things would have been very different if you would have won world war II, we could have avoided alot of the problems we have now." now you could assume that trett lott was referring to the autobahn, the volkswagon, the revived german economy, the growth of industry, but you know, no matter how you look at it, you can't get past the idea that one of hitler's main objectives in world war II was to kill all the jews.   some people would find it offensive that trent lott would even conceive that the idea of oppressing/killing a group of people as part of your political platform would be appropriate.   i think that's why people are offended about his comments to strom thurmond.

      Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.

      Hi & welcome, CK. Congrats to D. Fingers crossed for Julie & J. B, I talked to you already, but I'll say it again: I'm glad you're okay.  This is what I get for not checking the blog since Thanksgiving: BACH's smash-up, Dave's enlistment, John's brood, Chris' arrival.... Thank goodness the ladies are okay. Stay safe, all y'all.  Have been working days making costumes for a dance group at a community center in the South Bronx; Hans Chrstian Andersen's "Snow Queen" with elementary & middle school kids & some young guest artists from Dance Theatre of Harlem. Also still wardrobe supervisor at "Salome" down in Brooklyn. Aidan Quinn has joined the cast as our third & newest John the Baptist. (My co-workers are the people I see in onscreen in cinemas! Weird.) Four more performances, then home to RVa on x-mas eve for the holly-day. Who's around? Should we have a coffee klatch next week? I just found a recipe for macadamia-cranberry cookies.  Allen - I'll be in VA until the 27th or 28th, then back up to QNS. Call me when you're up: 917-514-7237. Do you have plans yet for new year's eve? I have an option available. And for the record, last weekend I was in Brooklyn, working.

       urlLink  Free Speech -- Virtually   Legal Constraints on Web Journals Surprise Many 'Bloggers'   Late last year, John Stanforth posted to his personal Web site a reminiscence about software he had developed for internal use by a former employer. It was a minor project, he said, one he never thought would warrant any secrecy.   So he was bewildered when, about two months later, he received a cease-and-desist letter in an e-mail from his old company. It said that by mentioning the project, he had violated the nondisclosure agreement he signed when he joined the firm in June 1997.   Can we say "ACLU," kids?

       So what have I missed?...  / sarcasm   Ben -e-ha-ha... Sorry to hear about your accident. Even more sorry to hear about the treatment you're receiving from the insurance company. Hope you're feeling better.  Dave  - Conrgats (late, but still.. Congrats)  Tree  - We're going to be NY the 26th -1st. You in town?  John  - Hope things are going well. I can pretty much guarantee that I can think negative thoughts better than anyone else in the circle, so count on me to my part.  Takers? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?  Props to Mir and Jimi for making appearances at our Holiday Partay of Festivities last weekend. The rest of you get a big fat finger. (Guess which one?) Ben, of course, is excused due to his unfortunate accident, and Tree, simply since there's no way our partay could compete with an evening in Manhattan.  All right, enough procrastinating. Back to work!  PS - For the record, Strong Bad sucks.

      Topping our news today, Satan has reported that he is opening an outdoor skating ring in Hell to take advantage of a sudden change in climate (see related story "Hell Freezes Over").  It appears that the climate change was brought about by a native of Richmond, Virginia getting engaged.  Mr. David Whiteside has proposed to his girlfriend of almost two years.  The date for the nuptuals has not yet been set.  I guess that leaves Jimi as the last dedicated bachelor out there.

      the latest, for all who care:  my car was declared a total loss by the INS company, so i get a payoff to use against the $ i owe on the loan i originally took out to buy it.  it will cover it and then some, but that "sum" is pretty low.  i expect i will buy another Insight, as it's still the best car on the market as far as i'm concerned, so expect to see "moondog 2.0" within the next 30 days or so.  i have a lawyer now, and he is taking my case forward.  i should only say so much about all that, but i'll speak up as events warrant.  my recovery is slow but sure, and i still do not know when i'll return to work, or to normal life; i still can't sit for anymore than 15-30 minutes without needing to eventually lie down, but the pain i'm having has decreased somewhat.  which is a real drag, considering how badly i want to see certain movies that are out right now, but they will have to wait.  once again, i thank everyone in the circle for their kindness and patience since last wednesday.  apparently, you find out who your friends are when you have a health emergency as well as when you move!  you've all been very supportive and i will not forget.  feel free to email me at home whenever you like; calls are OK too, but it's generally easier for me to concentrate on the written rather than the spoken, per my fatigue and pain.  plus, since i'm sleeping at odd times, you may inadvertently awaken me in the daylight hours; typically i turn my ringer off when i go to sleep, but these days i need to leave it on during the day to get calls from my doctor(s), lawyer and INS folk which tend to be timely and must be taken ASAP.  well, enough of me.  somebody talk about politics or something.

      Damn!  Has it really been three weeks since I last posted?  As the RTG people know, Julie was readmitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago.  Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to "hold out" (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!  And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session.  Way to go dude!  All kidding aside, I'm glad you're OK, and that the Honda lived up to its safety reputation

      Granted, it's unlikely that CIA missiles will begin raining down on Berkeley or other liberal burgs anytime soon. Killing Muslims, even those with U.S. citizenship, is one thing; offing "ordinary" Americans is another. As has been the case with previous Bushie infringements on fundamental civil rights--electronic eavesdropping, jailing people without trial or a visit by a lawyer--most citizens believe themselves safe simply by virtue of their not being terrorists.  They may be right. They might be wrong. It's all in the hands of the executioner-in-chief now.   urlLink http://www.uexpress.com/tedrall/site/viewru.htm

      wtf...   see karl - this is what we should have been talking about last night instead of this silly trent lott thing. The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  "The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system," R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' "Economic Report to the President," scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: "[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder."  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to "take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class," emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers "on the outskirts of poverty." At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  "Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?" he asked. "If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes."  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  "If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed," said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  "These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich," said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. "We're going back some 70 years."  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: "I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor."  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  "This issue is coming to a head," DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. "You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs."  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas "the duck's feet under the water," propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, "The Non-Taxpaying Class."  "Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else," the editorial stated. "They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government."  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  "It's hard to conclude it's anything else," said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  "I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls," he said. "That doesn't seem like a good political agenda."  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  "The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes," Matsui said. "I'd love to debate him on that."  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  "I would hope the public would find it repugnant," he said, "but I suppose you never know."

      Mir -- I AM familiar with THAT kind of two-way (and no, not from personal experience, thank you!). That's not going to be a "two-way" that she can wear.....  The other line from this song that I really like is: "She likes the Godsmack, and I like Agent Orange, Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad"  What an apt description of much of what passes for modern rock these days. Don't get me wrong -- I love aggressive music. It certainly has it's place. But the likes of Disturbed and System of a Down belong on the underground scene -- not on mainstream radio!! There is nothing that can turn a bar full of drunks ugly faster than spinning one of those songs at about 1:00am (and THIS I know from personal experience!)....

      It just occurred to me...with Data's consciousness contained within this new (old) prototype, it is easy to explain the character (Brent Spiner) gaining weight and changing in appearance over time.  It's a new body, so it's ok that he looks so different now.  Riker, on the other hand, needs to lay off the cheeseburgers.  Meanwhile, Deanna seems to be taking beauty tips from Christine Aguilera.

      Greetings from the West Coast -- wanted everyone to know that I woke our little Benjamin up to make sure he was OK. I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for "Drumline," used my free pass (see details below) to get into "Die Another Day," then walked across the hall into "Nemesis" -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with "Drumline." The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, "Nemesis" was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not "Khan." I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is "Search for Data," I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry. Anybody keeping up with "Enterprise," please contradict me and convince me that I'm wrong.  That's all from the Left coast. Hope everyone has a Peaceful holiday!

Sunday's on the phone to Monday,  Tuesday's on the phone to me   She said she'd always been a dancer  She worked at 15 clubs a day  And though she thought I knew the answer  Well I knew what I could not say.   And so I quit the police department  And got myself a steady job  And though she tried her best to help me  She could steal but she could not rob   Didn't anybody tell her?  Didn't anybody see?  Sunday's on the phone to Monday,  Tuesday's on the phone to me  Oh yeah.

      gosh, mir.  what a shame i didn't die - sounds like things would have turned out pretty interesting for you!  of course, you  could  do all those things anyway, if you wanted, even without anybody dying.  for that matter, i don't think the chick who hit me would need to be kung-fooed - if you decided to do away with her, you could just buy a gun.  i'm confident, though, that our justice system will mete out the appropriate penalties - though i appreciate your compliment to me via vendetta.  the world would certainly be more interesting with potential superheroines like yourself!  but i digress.  i live another day!  i'm having to lie on the sofa at this point while i type.  the doc was right - it hurts worse today (it being my body, not the sofa).  ideally, the pain will subside in a few days, and i can rejoin the world of the quick and the foolish at that point, though on a gradual basis.  as JLS has pointed out many times before, in so many ways, it all comes down to medical benefits.  everyone feel free to post amusements here or email them to my home addy to occupy my time as i shuffle about my apartment, bitching and moaning.

      greetings fellow iconoclasts.  i live!  a drunk driver rear ended me wednesday night, totaling my wonderful little moondog, and leaving me with a 2-3 inch gash on the top of my head, busted up shins and an overall profound ache.  i bled for over an hour – head wounds are like that, apparently, and difficult to seal – until they closed the wound with 10 little staples.  currently, my hair is matted down with dried blood, since i can’t wash my head until tomorrow – gross, huh?  i’ll be on bed rest for about a week, and then we’ll see how i’m doing from there.  scary stuff, let me tell you.  it felt like a train had hit my car – the impact was terrifying .  i felt like a bug, squashed beneath the heel of God.  gah.  now comes the paperwork, and the doctors, lawyers and insurance folk.  hopefully my car will be written off as a loss, allowing me to get another one; safe to say that if this comes to pass, it will be another insight.  not sure how long i’ll be down and out – hoping to feel well enough for road to glory, but i’ve just got to see how i’m doing.  i think it's safe to say that i will be unable to attend the winter wonderland dinner, or allen's party afterward - the only way i can currently stay comfortable for any length of time is to lie down - but i hope that the festvities will go on and that everyone has a cool time.  talk to you all soon;thanks for everyone’s kind words and well wishes.

      I thought it would be interesting to juxtapose these two articles...  A bolder investigation would unearth the original U.S. designs for the weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and nuclear -- that now haunt the world. If U.N. investigators were deployed here, they would discover that it was U.S. companies that quite often supplied the materials that permitted other countries to experiment with the means of killing us all.   urlLink  http://www.salon.com/news/col/scheer/2002/12/11/weapons/index.html   "The United States will continue to make clear that it reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force -- including through resort to all of our options -- to the use of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] against the United States, our forces abroad, and friends and allies," the statement reads, in part.   "In addition to our conventional and nuclear response and defense capabilities, our overall deterrent posture against WMD threats is reinforced by effective intelligence, surveillance, and interdiction, and domestic law enforcement capabilities," the statement says.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/12/11/bush.weapons.security/index.html

      I just found out i got an A in my non-fiction writing class!!  and this is how it makes me feel:  Well you should see Polythene Pam  She's so good-looking but she looks like a man  Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag  Yes you should see Polythene Pam.  Yeah yeah yeah  Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt  She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt  She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"  Yes you could say she was attractively built.  Yeah yeah yeah.

      I would have to vote for something by Blondie, Talking Heads (early), or Elvis Costello (early) -- something from the mid- to late-70s, because from 1980/1-onward New Wave changed into something slightly different.  It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's "Cars" or perhaps Berlin's "The Metro."  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.

      That's nothing! You should have heard him at 5:30 in the morning on the radio....  Ask him about backwards masking the Tiffany song!  Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole "in his own image" issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. "But what about the separation of church and state," you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent "Under God" Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between "What's He Got?" by The Producers and "Talk To Ya Later" by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?

      - I have decided that the Oklahoma City bombing was worthy of shock; September 11 was not.  The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.  The Puritans are far more evident in our national psyche than the spirit of '76 ever was. - The only thing that will ever unify the humans species is an overwhelming threat from beyond our planet.  In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.  Everything else will forever be violent variations of existing themes. - Love is not what someone does for you, or what you do for someone; it is persistent and mindful engagement in another's spiritual growth. - I wish to be the citizen of a nation; not the subject of an empire. - Women have a right to be angry at the media's pervasive images, but I don't know what they can do to solve it.  As soon as a coherent and effective plan is formed, I'll back it all the way. - Writing is dreaming in language.  This is why poetry is the highest form of the language arts, because in it words are pre-verbal.  Rhetoric does not occur until the mind moves the language from pre-verbal dream into the public sphere. - We think by pattern matching.  This is why it is not foolish to open the refrigerator when  you need the microwave.  Both have doors and handles; you are acting on the premature matching of an incomplete pattern. - It seems everything I see is an advertisement. - Music is humanity's greatest artistic achievement. - I am grateful for cinnamon toast.

      Wow. I am overwhelmed by your responses. [sniff] It's good to be back amongst friends.... [sniff, sniff] I LOVE you guys!  Mir -- been doing my part for the war effort. I'm training Transportation Security Administration baggage screeners at your nation's airports. That's why I'm here in LA (where, I hesitate to mention, that it's sixty degrees and sunny).  Benjamin -- I can see already that you are right about the blog -- it IS chaotic and more than a little confusing!  Will someone hold my hand?  Ms. Streisand -- Mr. Shipley has nothing but wonderful things to say about you. I look forward to greeting you and your college-aged piece of ass in person.  Yesterday afternoon at LAX, a ceramic plate tested positive for explosives residue and even failed a radiation test. It almost shut down the airport. The bomb dog decided it wasn't a threat and the LEO (Law Enforcement Official) determined that the lady carrying it had a credible story. If any of you are traveling for the holidays, might I suggest shipping your presents separately?  What else do I need to know about this realm?

      more lyrics for members of the circle of irony: Just Like Anyone  So maybe I wasn't that good a friend but you were one of us and I will wonder just like anyone if there was something else I could've done So maybe it's true that your cry for help was oh, so very faint but still I heard and knew something was wrong just nothing you could put your finger on and I will wonder just like anyone just like anyone     Susan  Oh, Susan, you were clued in you knew just how this thing would go a prognosis that was hopeless from the very first domino I guess I see it all in hindsight I tried to keep perspective despite the flash of the fuse, the smell of cordite Now I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now Oh, Suzy - they get to me they can really be wearying but he threw me rope and buoy let me use his decoder ring there must have been some kind of parade we kissed for a while to see how it played and pulled the pin on another grenade Now I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now Oh, Susan, the hope of fusion is that the halo will reappear it may be pure illusion but it's beautiful while it's here I had some trouble with the  goodbye I checked my Roman candle supply and watched the vapor trail in the sky But I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now

How am I different? How am I different?   I can't do it so move along do you really want to wait until I prove you wrong? And don't tell me-- let me guess I could change it all around if I would just say yes   But how am I different? How am I different? How am I different?   And just one question before I pack-- when you fuck it up later, do I get my money back?   I can't do it and as for you-- can you in good conscience even ask me to Cause what do you care  about the great divide as long as you come down on the winner's side   And how am I different? How am I different? How am I different?   Just one question before I pack-- when you fuck it up later, do I get my money back?

      Many artists love to roll about in the deep, rich, oily goo of death and decay like so many bloated, misguided swine.  Their overwrought odes to pain and suffering often seem to me as no more than poorly disguised narcissistic masturbations, and upon reading them I am overcome with a strange combination of numb apathy and weary rage.

      not a poem i wrote, but from a publication i am interning for -  urlLink http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/  i am hoping the mighty circle of irony master will link this to our blogger site - anyway, here's the poem - and don't forget, vote for me as despair on january 27th! CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them— they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtain—loud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying do—as if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.

      She wears a diaphanous black gown, her small feet shod in black boots, cautiously padding down the corridor.  She bears a resemblance to her brothers and sisters though her "gifts" are of a different nature.  She has red hair, eyes that go from blue to green to grey, petite and very pale, normally a somber look on her face.  She has three brothers and two sisters:  she is brooding and philosophical like Dream, understands the purpose and beauty of Death, shares the insanity of Delirium, has coldness and indifference like Desire and Destiny, envies Destruction for his ability to walk away.   When you first meet her, you would think she is her own nemesis.  She understands your grief and pain and you feel compelled to share and have her listen.  And she understands and you feel soothed.  Then she gives back your burdens to you but adds some and she grieves for you and all the others that she cannot help, but is immobile by her nature.   I take on the mantle of the last sibling.  Hello my brothers and sisters,  I am Despair.

      "...We are reminded that, in power, both the Nazis and the Soviets banned and burned abstract art. Curious, that art which claimed to represent nothing nevertheless represented so much to them. Perhaps art is a threat to totalitarianism when it does not have a clear, censurable subject and is left to the musings of the citizen."

      Thank you, Neal. :)  Dieting is always a double-edged sword.  You feel good that you're going to get to your ideal weight, but it makes your current weight seem soooo much heavier.    I have no idea of which cabbage my love speaks...I feel it is all the work of an uber-arugala, personally.

      Julie delivered two baby boys yesterday:  Aaron James Robinson, 5 lbs 15 oz, 18 3/4 in @ 15:12 William John Robinson, 5 lbs 9 oz, 19 in @ 15:13  Mom is doing fine recovering from her c-section, and will be up walking around this afternoon..  The babies are in the NICU, currently being treated for acute repiratory distress because of their immature lungs.  The doctors are very positive in their prognosis, and they should be removed from assisted breathing devices in the next 3-4 days.  After that, once they start eating properly, they will be allowed to come home.  Probably in 2-3 weeks, assuming no other complications.

      I must take issue with such a sweeping statement -- I, for one, am not "culturally set up" to do this.  I have always been satisfied with my own company -- though the right person can certainly enhance the experience.  I recommend planting a garden instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.

      quote from allan gurganus: We're all culturally set up to look for that one other beloved object who will complete us and satisfy us and sate us and make us look good. But while we're looking for that chimera, that unicorn that will never appear, it's damn good to have lots of friends to console you and to support you and literally to carry you down the steps when you can't walk.

      Personally, I have nothing against predictable movies.  I know a symphony will have four movements; I know sonata form is often fast-slow-fast; I know many pop songs have two verses, two choruses, and a bridge; I know James Bond will win; I know the meal will end with dessert; I know people in romantic comedies fall in love, despite the obstacles in the way.  Unpredictability is an attribute, not a virtue.

      "Toe pick!"  I like the Cutting Edge too.  Probably the only Moira Kelly film that I do.  I also like D.B Sweeney, though most people don't.  I am very surprised at your list of movies Johnathan.  From discussing movies with over the past couple of years, my previous post is what I thought I knew of your movie preferences.  Obviously I was just a *little* off in my understanding.  There is only one movie on the list that I have not seen (Purple Rain) and only one I don't care for (The Karate Kid - he makes Luke Skywalker seem like a mature adult).  I guess we have more similar taste than I realized.  My apologies.  Angie - Boys are gross.

      Some random popcorn movies I consider equal to the Greats:  Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Jaws, Goldfinger, The Matrix (with reservations), Terminator 2 (the first I consider only borderline popcorn, like Alien or Blade Runner), Aliens, True Lies, Dirty Harry, Ghostbusters, Animal House, Back to the Future, Beverly Hills Cop, Wargames, Trek II, Lethal Weapon.  Some random movies many consider bad or inconsequential, that I shamelessly adore:  The Cutting Edge, Dirty Dancing, Purple Rain, The Karate Kid, Caddyshack, Rocky III, Big Trouble in Little China, Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Top Gun, St. Elmo's Fire.  Not an art film in the pack, none of them independent, and any one will please me as much as Allen, Fellini, Kurosawa, or Hitchock.

      I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their "best sales ever") accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

      All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.  I know: Judge not lest ye be judged....

      You're right -- success does affect my opinion.  I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.

      I sort of boycotted the film mainly because I don't like "look, it's funny 'cause their culture is different from our culture" movies.  And the ads for the series are...just...awful.  Not to mention that the main actress has a face that just makes me want to punch her.  So no, okay, you're right.  I didn't see it.   Call me close-minded. You're probably right.  But I also never saw half the Corey movies, which were all the rage at the time, and I don't really feel as though I've missed anything. Maybe I'll see it one day, but I doubt it will change my life.  Plus, with my impending nuptuals, I don't want to see a wacky "everything's going awry" wedding movie.  My own family is mental enough as it is.

      Ahem. Just how many of you people that are professing undying hatred for MBFGW actually saw the damn thing? And it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really funny to see how success affects people's opinions. Who are we to be so quick to pull somebody down just because their idea worked? I saw the movie in the arthouse theatre down the street, long before it went wide and "mainstream" -- and at the time I thought it was clever and well done. I doubt that the movie has deteriorated in quality just because it's popular  And my favorite quote from that horrible rant on SUVs that started this newest thread: "Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution."  Consider this startling fact: I can make up any damn fiction I want, and as long as I state that it is explicitly a fact, readers will accept it as so (especially if they are already pre-disposed to agree with said fact), even without any type of documentation to back me up.  It doesn't matter what I say So long as I say it with inflection That makes you feel that I'll convey Some inner truth of vast reflection But I've said nothing so far And I canm keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter who you are If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks

      Hi, y'all. Here's my 2 cents (2 words) on the SUV thread: mass transit. Thank the Holy Ghost that I live in a city that has a system that mostly works. (And yes, JLS, the damn things actually are trucks anyway.) BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set. No more doses of Vardalos, parakalos. Pass the feta instead.

      It would be nice if from an emissions standpoint, the SUV was classified as a truck instead of a car.  I mean, after all, it really is a truck.  That's really my only beef.

       urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   "SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do," said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   "SUVs are very safe vehicles," said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   "They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes," Cischke said. "Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts."    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   "The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation," Claybrook said. "The government has also dropped the ball."   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.

      In retrospect, I was pretty much describing the average American in that last post, so to include SUVs was irrelevant.  Any opinion I have on the issue is targeted at a kind of person, regardless what they drive.  Ultimately I have no opinion about SUVs, except that I personally don't care to own one.

      SUVs....for myself, if I had kids I'd prefer the Honda Odyssey.  If I want a truck, I'll buy a truck.  From what I've experienced of SUVs, the owners have been duped by clever marketing.  There's equal or more room to be found in a station wagon or a minivan -- and better value, to boot.  People who own SUVs are likely to have gushed about My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and probably think it's an adventure to go white water rafting with their coworkers.  I don't care what they drive; but it's generous of them to wear such obvious badges -- makes it easier to see them coming, so I can move to another table at the restaurant.  And hey -- they keep Dockers slacks in business, so...God bless 'em.

      so true: After several gentle conversations, I have finally gotten my fiancé to share his fantasy with me: He wants to have sex on the top of a bunk bed. He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fiancé wants to have sex in a "restricted space" with your bodies "really close." Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fiancé is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires "several gentle conversations" to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, "I wanna have sex in a bunk bed." Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fiancé really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apart—about three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.

"Given the poor economic climate and the unclear nature of the Holy Ghost's duties, I felt this was a sensible and necessary decision," God said. "The Holy Ghost will be given fewer and fewer responsibilities until His formal resignation from Trinity duty following Easter services on April 20. Thereafter, the Father and the Son shall be referred to as the Holy Duo."

       urlLink BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  "Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?" asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. "Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads."  "According to their enemies," writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, "SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?"  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV "tickets," and bumper stickers that read "As a matter of fact, I do own the road," encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. "But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency," argues Hochswender. "Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly." He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal "crash compatibility" test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. "Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest," defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs "represent the worst."  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: "Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!'"  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: "What did you people do 20 years ago?" Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles "keyed," stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  "What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?" asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.   urlLink - Ted Rall

      The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.  She's truly my hero -- anyone else in her conditions (and they are plural) would have given in to depression, cynicism, and bitterness long ago.  That she smiles and sings and laughs and dreams is a tribute to the depth of her courage and the size of her heart, and I'm not saying that just because I love her.  If more people could shine a light like hers, the world would be a far better place.  May we all learn that the secret to happiness is perspective, gratitude, and the love of a beautiful person.

      Good luck to Chirs on the interview. If you interview as well as you debate then you will do very well.  As to debates..... intresting one we seem to be having here. Right now I only have one question. Does any one have a extra lung? I seem to hacked mine up this morning. Bleh! [hack, cough, cough]  [crawls back to the corner]

      Wow, a debate with more than me and Mr. Wigglepants involved.  First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the "arrogant conservative President" comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.

      Disclaimer:  The ideological phallus of which I spoke, or rather the waving of such, refers primarily to government officials of all stripes and the numerous pundits and talking heads who appear in the various media.  My present interlocutor, much to his credit and to my satisfaction, throughout my history of knowing him (including in the present argument), has mostly kept his ideological willie safely tucked away in his pants.

      Good luck on your interview.  I only hope that all these strategies, while relevant to rational opponents, transfer smoothly when applied to irrational opponents.  I'm not entirely convinced that the policymakers in control right now fully understand how different it is when your opponent perceives him- or herself as the servant of God.  Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.  I must say, though, that I'm glad we're sending *billions* to Turkey so they'll let us put a base there.  I'd hate to think we could have wasted some of that money on collapsing school buildings, kids without health insurance, or parents unable to tend to their mentally ill children.  For now, I'll continue to reluctantly support the "war," such as it is; I'll reserve more comprehensive judgment until more time has passed.

      Unfortunately, Madonna, you are correct. It is all we're showing them now. See my earlier comments on my opinion of how this administration has handled foreign policy....  And, yes, harmony, we are going to engage a part of the world with the Screaming Eagles. Sometimes, people will only stop and listen when you hit them over the head with a very big stick.... I have to say that the military has become a very effective instrument of exporting the good parts of America. See Dana Priest's new book: 'The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace With America's Military' for more information (and very engaging reading) about how the US military has successfully stepped in and delivered peace and security in places like Kosovo when institutions like the UN have failed utterly.  Can you tell how I've been spending my free time?  Another interview at 1:00 today -- keep your fingers crossed.....

      My thought exactly.   How can we show them that we're about more than just McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents when, from my perspective, that's all we're really showing them right now?  I'd like to believe that America is so cool for school that we can make the rest of the world like us...and I completely agree that there are a lot of wonderful things about this country that could appeal to many.  But I don't think that's the image we're really showing right now.

      Thanks for the dance response -- I understood it better than the previous post.  Curious:  So when will we get around to addressing the reason?  It seems to me we've been leaving the reason for later since 1948.  Which is acceptable, if it has indeed taken these 50+ years to put out the flames (although my amateur eyes don't see the fire getting smaller).  How many years does one fight flames until one can reach the oil flow?  Analogies Amok -- Am I correct in rephrasing that violent terrorists of any kind flourish because there is very little oxygen (economic growth) in the room, and the terrorists supply a half-opened window; and that in this room, everyone else (the mass population) can't breathe clearly, and thus can't think clearly; and that our intent is to force oxygen into the room, thus allowing everyone (the mass population) to breathe easier, which will allow them to gather their wits, and be happy, thus making the terrorists and their little half-opened window irrelevant?

      And, and.... Mir -- I hope you are feeling better soon. Drink OJ and sleep -- 's the only way to beat the damned flu.  P.S. Whether we are comfortable with it or not, we are the most powerful country the world has ever seen. Do we use that power to shut ourselves off from the world, turn inward and merrily go along, fiddly dee, tomorrow is another day? I think that we are 50 years past the time when the oceans could protect our country from the world (see 9/11). Like it or not, we have the opportunity to raise the world's standard of living, to bring hope, elightenment and cash flow to billions who would never know the joys of good dental hygene or low infant mortality rates, or education (which are the flip sides of consumerism and Jerry Springer). We must engage the parts of the world that hate us, and let them see the things that make our country and our system great, so that they can understand that it is not just about McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents.   "With great power comes great responsibility."

      And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario:  Yes, we're at a party, and yes, we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's "Dead Man's Party" sounds pretty good to me right now...), and yes, we'd love for everyone to dance. But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.

      Another question, and I'm only trying to understand:  So we're essentially at a party (the world) where not all the people (nations) are dancing (joining our economic vision), so we're turning up the music louder and louder (cramming our economic solution down their throats) until either all people (nations) are dancing (just like us) or they are whimpering in the corner (forgotten [central Africa]) or under our direct command (colonized [Iraq] by our forces)?

      i have had the flu since friday night.  i have thrown up, had chills, back aches, horrible headaches, and overall dizziness and fever.   right now, i'm sweating and about ready to throw up my food from last night.   the only thing, honestly i have tried everything else, that has truly helped me is pot.  pain killers can't seem to get rid of the aches and the nausea is still there.  but when i smoke pot, the nausea is gone, my pains are gone, and i can actually eat.  and believe it or not, i feel less dizzy when i'm stoned. and no, it doesn't feel like a normal high at all.  it just makes me feel - more normal - able to function. so does someone wish to explain to me why medicinal marijuana is illegal?  urlLink http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2002/11/05/drugwar/index.html  - just some extra info.

      Bear in mind that I am not at all articulate about such things, but I have to say that I don't like the image presented by CK's argument.  I feel as though America, if it takes the approach that CK presents, would become imperialist bullies.  I feel like we're the the snot-nosed brats of the world, stomping and whining about how we want everything to be our way or the highway.  And I fear that the global community will become fed up with our audacious attitudes.  For about ten minutes after 9/11, we were the whole world's sweet wounded child.  Now we're the world's screaming bratty embarrassment.  *shrug*

      I'm still not understanding.  Someone please explain to me why addressing the deed and not the reason is safer and more effective than simultaneously addressing the deed and the reason.

      Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like "You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you..." -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: "The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War." If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  "Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap."  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article – it’s incredibly enlightening.  So – JS and John – it doesn’t have to come down to either/or….

      Sadly, I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out, but that will not happen, nor should it.  There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.

      Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word "ideology," because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.

      If I am understanding you correctly, you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.  That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be "spoiling" sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.  But, appeasement does not work.  Just ask Neville Chamberlain.

      If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of "They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!", and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S. You can search Ebert's reviews by various fields, one of which is # of stars.  Other movies have received 0's and 1/2s.

      To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't "rescue."  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.  Rage never dies, and it always finds a way.

      I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.  I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said "OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between "defying" an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.

      Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.  We -- the citizens of this country -- are about to be enlisted in a cause for which we may die.  Not the soldiers, not the pilots, not the marines -- us.  The question is not are you willing to sacrifice the professional soldiers for this cause -- but are you willing to sacrifice yourself, on the battlefield of the shopping mall or apartment building?  Are you willing to trade the life of your three-year-old so that peace will prevail?  Because the Apache helicopter is awfully hard to hit.  But a playground, now -- right down the road from you -- that's easy pickings.  I suspect a great many people have not made the logical connection from the desert waaaaay over there to their own office building.  Sure, we watched the WTC fall; we watched the people jumping from windows.  But it is human nature to believe oneself immortal; to believe it's all a video game.  Which it is, until the stage catches fire and the night club is filling with smoke and you're reminded that Hey, dude, this is, like, real.  This posting is not for or against the war -- just a reminder that a vote for it is a tacit acceptance of the possibility that the cost of the goal will not be professional soldiers, but your niece, burned or gassed or diseased or shot.  Granted, one may feel that is going to happen anyway, so what the hell.  And a valid argument can be made for that.  I just hope our eyes are open.  Wide.

      from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan, and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict, how much destruction would result, and "how deep" the corruption of the Iraqi government goes. The administration has declined to estimate how long U.S. forces would remain in Iraq. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman told Congress last week that it might be two years before the Iraqis regained administrative control of their country. But "they're terrified of being caught in a time frame," said retired Army Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, one of a number of senior military and civilian experts who have been briefed by the Pentagon on the plan. "My own view is that it will take five years, with substantial military power, to establish and exploit the peace" in Iraq.

      op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in "nation-building." And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the "coalition of the willing" President Bush spoke of turns out to be a "coalition of the bought off" instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the "spoils of war."   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

      We continue to avoid the strongest argument: Even though Asia is worth 7 armies, there are only three reasons to hold the Middle East:  (1) as a buffer for holding Africa, (2) as a buffer for holding Europe (though the Ukraine and Southern Europe are the weaker points); and (3) as a launching point for the seizing of Australia. Personally, I think our time would be better spent taking South America and holding tight for a while; once Alaska or Quebec falls, we need an escape route. Then again -- maybe we just need another card to complete a set.

      hmmm.. why i'm against the war with iraq.  1. there seems to be no defined reason why we are specifically going to war with iraq as opposed to any other nation.  they are other countries which have violated u.n. sanctions and decrees (here in the us we simply don't sign the agreements or ignore them) 2. iraq is not a genuine threat to u.s. interests - which violates the powell doctrine (colin powell) that the u.s. should only enter a war when u.s. interests are clearly at stake - he bases that philosophy on his experiences in vietnam. 3. there is limited public support for this war.  a war without public support is not likely to get the funding it needs to be successful. 4. yes, of course, we could win the war against iraq if all we wanted to do was to bomb it and then leave.however,  bush has said that there will be a regime change.  this will require years of occupation by the u.s. military in order to have a peaceful transition - if one is possible.  after an u.s. invasion - it is likely that muslim fundamentalist will be the most organized and well-funded group in iraq. 5. assuming the u.s. does win this war, the kurds, which at this time mainly occupied the u.n. controlled northern half of iraq, would demand their own country.  this would cause unrest in turkey which has a sizeable kurdish population.  turkey would not want to give up land or anything else to the kurds - the kurds are considered "terrorists" in turkey. 6. as mr. wigglepants pointed out, this also does not solve any of the problems that exist in the middle east.  the islamic population will still believe that the u.s. is occupying muslim lands and should leave.  the palestinians  will still not have a homeland.  the israelis will still be hated by the rest of the middle eastern community.   7. war is wrong unless it is the absolute last resort - diplomacy is still an option. 8.  what gives the u.s. the right to dispose of a leader?  and why just saddam hussein?  where does it go from here?  9. how does this fight the war on terrorism?  will we be safer after this?

      OK, I'll rise to it....  IMHO: Military Intelligence is still an oxymoron. Politicians still get the military into trouble by overpromising. The military still sucks at PR. War is still an ugly, tiring, destructive thing that hurts people, sometimes permenantly.  I think that second marketplace that was hit (the one that killed 50+ Iraqi civilians) was planted by Iraqi security forces -- the timing was too convenient, and they didn't do anything to restrict reports from reporting on it -- even better -- they  encouraged  reporters to go there and see for themselves.  We're in for the long-haul, kids. So sit back and stay tuned.   Finally, it still stirs something very primal in me to see 65 tons of depleted uranium and hardened steel churning across a desert at 55 miles an hour.... Does anyone else want to agree with me if I said I missed my calling as a tank commander?  P.S. Don't be misled by that 1.3 million number for our armed forces -- a solid majority are not involved in actual combat.... The Army is going to be so committed to Iraq that if something else happens (North Korea, anyone?), we're going to be in deep kimchee....

      "...U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warns Syria that the U.S. considers military shipments to Iraq a 'hostile act.'"  Wonder if Iran felt that way, when we armed him for the Iran-Iraq war.

      Come on, conservatives!  120,000 more ground troops are on the way!  Soon hundreds, maybe thousands will be gassed or diseased, and your suspicions will be quickly and effectively proved true!  The Arab world trembles before our might, and no terrorist would ever think of striking back, now that they've seen how strong we are!  And democracy is about to dawn across the Middle East!  Yet the Blog remains silent!  Come on, kids -- this is your day!  Speak up!  Praise!  Attack!  Gloat!  Something!

      Cordy has her moments.  You know what owns?  "Inside Out" by  urlLink Eve 6 .  I'm going to really make myself look young here and just say that song is one of the anthems of my generation.  I rocked out to it to the point of nearly losing my voice on the way home from work today.  It kicks that much ass.  You know what else owns?  A good tuna melt.    I wish I could be happy today not feeling so guilty about how badly we're getting our asses beat right now.

      An observation:  We seem unable to function without fear.  Whether the reaction is passive or aggressive, our identity seems almost entirely dependent upon fear.  Try to take fear away from the fearful, and they get angry.  There is a fierce pride in fear:  the fearful perceive fear as a sign of intelligence; those without fear are deemed stupid or ill-informed.  It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.  It seems nearly impossible to make any decision free of fear.  Fear appears to be not an emotion, but rather the inescapable, invisible framework of human experience.  Without fear and our reaction to it, we are nothing.

      thought this might infuriate john and chris; inspire ben and well, i guess just me and ben - Director Moore criticizes U.S.-Iraq war  March 23, 2003  |     Michael Moore criticized President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq during his acceptance speech at Sunday's Academy Awards, drawing a partial standing ovation and some jeers from Hollywood's elite.   The documentary maker won his first Oscar for “Bowling for Columbine,” but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these “fictitious times.”   “We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president,” Moore said. “We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   “We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you,” Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   “It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it,” Martin joked. “The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.”   “Bowling for Columbine” was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: “I'm an American.”   “Is that all?” a reporter asked.   “Oh, that's a lot,” Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: “Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.”   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary “Roger & Me,” in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book “Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation,” which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   “In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace,” Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for “Adaptation.”   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war

      Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing, I'm thinking.  Halle Berry's dress was a bit unflattering...and it's hard to NOT flatter that body.  I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, "Shit!" when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was "Zorro" and "Traffic," so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).  I really hope she gets one someday, because she's just really first-rate.  This was going to be a short post that turned into a long ramble because I'm avoiding doing my task at work, i.e., labeling and taping brochure mail-outs.  Blah.  Save me.

      Chris - Do you really need my answers?  You should know them already.  1)  FALSE.  2) FALSE.  3) FALSE  As for the oil argument, I can think of three much easier targets militarily and one domestically than spending billions of dollars invading a relatively well defended country.  Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to "conquer" them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.

      1. I believe oil is one reason of several, and the coalition gives varying priorities to each.  I would need more information and expertise to rank them on my own; however, I do doubt the validity of some of the reasons, only because they are not treated equally in all situations.  2. I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say "in general" because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.  I would be delighted for the outcome to show that Iraq is an exception.  -- I respectfully decline Chris' offer of immunity; others are free to respond to my post.

      Mir: Please tell me you don't really believe that oil is the reason we are at war. Please tell me that you are just writing the party line because you are in the grip of dispair and it is prevent you from thinking for yourself.   For that matter, by a voice vote -- who here believes oil the the reason we are at war? I am very curious about the legs on this line of thinking. For that matter (again):  Who here thinks that giving the inspectors more time would have brought this crisis to a peaceful conclusion? Who believes that leaving Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance?  All you lurkers out there -- here's your chance to chime in. I won't lecture or post about your responses -- I'm just curious about how everyone is feeling about this adventure. So, to recap, three questions, true or false answers -- and if you'd like, email me (crk@mindspring.com): 1. Oil is the reason we are at war. 2. Allowing the inspectors more time to search Iraq would have lead to a peaceful conclusion. 3. Leaving Saddam Hussein in power is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance (with the very real possibility of chaos and failure to create a viable government).  P.S. 40?!?! Thanks, man. I wasn't feeling old until now!  8-p

      The Independent Speaks:  In this case, I would much prefer conservatives proved right than liberals proved right.  The war is under way and it is beyond my control; the only healthy way to live is to release oneself from concern about things one cannot control, and instead reserve judgment until more information becomes available.  Despair serves no one, least of all oneself.  For today's events, I choose hope.

      so it would, harmony.  but i, i feel powerless in this war situation.  i don't agree with it; it sickens me to think of people dying for oil, but i do not know what i can do about it.  bar angie, we come from a generation of those who are apathetic.  we grew up believing that at any time our entire nation could be lost by nuclear warfare, our entire planet could be destroyed by uncontrolled hostilities.  that must do something to a person to believe those things.   and people will die - and the region will become even more fundamentalist and destablilized and my life will stay the same - going from one moment of happiness to a moment of sadness.  people i love will please me and betray me - people i dislike will stay the same.

      The Dune and Raiders references re: a sandstorm and divine intervention, on the eve of a war with religious undertones, struck me as amusing.  I assume you are joking in interpreting my post as implying that I want a sandstorm to wipe out the US Army.  The irony of Paul's quote re: the sandstorm, on the eve of the current war, is that it could apply to both sides.  That's as far as the implication, such as it is, goes.  It seemed an appropriate attempt at humor, perhaps even commentary, given the title of our blog.

      Got an email from my mom -- she says these points are from Dennis Miller (tho I doubt it), but the selected ones below elicited a chuckle: 1. Between president bush and Saddam Hussein ... Hussein is the bad guy.  2. If you have faith in the United Nations to do the right thing keep  this in mind, they have Libya heading the committee on human rights and Iraq  heading the global disarmament committee. Do your own math here  3. If you use google search and type in "French military victories,"  your reply will be "did you mean French military defeats?"  4. If your only anti-war slogan is "no war for oil," sue your school  district for allowing you to slip through the cracks and robbing you of the  education you deserve.  5. Saddam and bin laden will not seek United Nations approval before  they try to kill us.  ... 7. Even if you are anti-war, you are still an "infidel!" and bin laden  wants you dead, too.  ... 10. Whether you are for military action or against it, our young men  and women overseas are fighting for us to defend our right to speak out. We  all need to support them without reservation.

      Anyone care to lay odds on whether the French embassy in Baghdad will be "accidently" destroyed during the bombing campaign or during the street fighting?   John -- SciFi is not the issue -- access to the VCR is. See, with the jury-rigged set up I have going so I can use the damned cable box  and  the picture-in-picture feature of my beloved TV, I had to set up the VCR so that you watch what you tape. And since I am outnumbered and surrounded in the scifi fan department up here, Saddam's got a better chance of scoring a town home on South Beach in Miami than I have in taping the durned thing. I'll replace the tape(s), if you would be so kind!  Let's see Harmony -- are you trying to tell us that the US Army should be wiped out by a sandstorm?

      Jones: Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark. (Lost Ark?)  The Ark of the Covenant, the chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments in...the original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mt. Heron and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, where it stayed for many years, until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it was gone.  (Gone?  Where?)  Nobody knows where.  Brody: However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls... However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year, wiped clean by the wrath of God....

       urlLink Praying is fine, but Bush should make up his own mind    I keep returning to thoughts of Bush's face and voice during that extraordinary press conference. He said he was convinced he was doing the right thing, but I sensed no enthusiasm for the task. He was not trying to persuade us, excite us, convert us or lead us. He was simply telling us what he had to do.   The pope sent a cardinal from the Vatican to have an hour's discussion with Bush--not about politics, but about theology. The cardinal told the president that the pope disagrees that God supports an invasion of Iraq. ''God does not intervene in the affairs of man,'' the papal emissary said.     - excerpt from an urlLink  article  by Roger Ebert

      Angie - I took absolutely no offense at your post.  It just made me realize what I did not know.  Ah, jazz.  I love big band.  I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at "good" orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat "the continent" for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

      In my opinion, America has given the world two unique things of lasting value: (1) jazz, and (2) jeans (though this could be expanded to "The West" in general).  Everything else is a synthesis of something else.  But in terms of contributing beauty to the world, America alone can claim jazz.  I personally find that a great honor.

      Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of "fashion," which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.  But it's also a big part of why we're a fat nation, too...

      Okay, guys.  I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and "we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?"  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...

      ENOUGH WITH THE DISTORTED DOGS!  I was watching Star Wars for the 10,000th time the other night and I think I caught a little continuity gaff.  During the approach to the Death Star, the squadron leader asks for a sound off.  Wedge was Red 2,  Luke was Red 5, and I think Porkins was Red 6.  Later in the fight, someone asks Red 6 if they can spot (or cover) Red 5.  If it was Porkins, that would be a little difficult seeing as he was already dead.  Oops.

When people used to ask why, he’d explain in depth. ‘‘The Name Tag Dissertation,’’ his friends called it. So, now he keeps the response simple: Name tags make people friendlier.

Though except for a few unique products, that huge wall of games at CompUSA starts getting repetetive after a while -- at first I'm envious, then I start noticing that it's really just a lot of different flavors of the same soda...first-person shooters, mystery games, strategy games, simulations.  There are so many variations of Age of Empires it becomes comical.  AOE -- with orcs!  AOE -- with spaceships!  AOE -- with fuzzy wombats!

      Apple is working on a PC version of iTunes.  Beyond that, the rumor mill includes a deal with AOL, which would make iTunes the cross-platform default for AOL music interaction.  I'm not convinced this is a good thing -- if iTunes crashes because of Windows issues, then Apple looks bad, not MS -- but it should be interesting to find out if this is the corporate pale shadow phoenix that rises from Napster's ashes.  By the by -- iPods have also been updated, and I think there will be Windows-compatible versions of those, as well.  Re architecture:  There are several websites dedicated to reconfiguring a Mac to run Linux.  Wonder if Linux will always be an underground, back-door movement.  Not sure what the benefit is of running Linux on a Mac vs. a PC -- maybe it's a cool factor, being in a different box.

      Are you trying to thumb your nose at us Harmony?  The fine print (ok, it's not so fine) at the bottom says you must have a Mac operating OS X.  I think you are the only here that meets those requirements.  Given that 1) I am a corporate slave using MS products or products that only seem to run on PCs (AutoCAD and it's associated engineering software) and 2) That an easier to use download system is not incentive enough for me to change my home systems, I guess I will make do with my rickety old PCs.  Oh, if only Apple had not been so stubborn about closed architecture 20 years ago.  Bill Gates would not be obscenely rich and computers would be more stable.

      yes, you are correct, the first part was definitely meant as a joke.a  negative self-image can exist at any age.  god knows it took me years of therapy to get rid of mine.   i had d&d dreams last night.  but about the actual sessions.  we were all in johnathan's house except it was bigger and had a wall of windows on the bottom floor and his mother lived with him.  angie slept on couch in the living room but right before we left she transformed it into a room that was the color of a sunset.  it was beautiful. ben was the dungeon master and he seemed irritated that was no one was paying attention and everyone seemed more interested in eating.  i just woke up so everything is still fresh in mine but i'm still too tired to be terrribly coherent.   jimi was there and someone was challenging him about the rules.  i think they were getting ready to have a big rules-off.  it was fun and i needed to have fun dreams last night.  i'm grateful to my mind.

      i don't know harmony.  would that be happening before, during, or after recess?   what would matter would be the intent of the person saying it.  if someone happens not to find someone attractive who i think may look like me, it generally doesn't bother me.  however, if the person seems to be doing so in order to hurt my feelings then i would think less of the person who said it.  i would definitely not think less of myself.

      please john don't pass out but i agree with you on this.  they are entertainers - part of their job is to be judged on their appearance.  they went into this profession voluntarily - knowing that there would insults but also great financial rewards.   but i would still say that she has great hair.

      Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ("Are you happier today?" "In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.")  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.

      Back to my male pigginess.  Looking at the Entertainment Weekly picture, first let me say that the blonde on the right who looks to be about 6' 6" tall would be drop dead gorgeous if she lost some of the eye shadow.  Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).  I could go with a description I heard from my boss today and describe where as one with the Porky Piggish face.  I'll stick with the general fat/skinny adjectives.

      As I posted a week or so ago, I am not a huge cat person.  That being said, when Julie and I started dating, she had a cat named Shadow.  It was very much a love me, love my cat situation.  Well, it took about half an hour.  Shadow was a very affectionate cat.  She would generally come when called.  She would even deign to play with us from time to time.  When she was about 14, she became listless and uninterested in eating.  I even tried tuna.  Previously, whenever we would even pop open a can of tuna, eShadow came flying in and loudly meowed and rubbed agains you to let you know what she wanted.  She was still uninterested.  She to stopped using the litter box.  We took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with renal failure.  The vet told us that one of her kidneys had atrophied, and the other was giving out.  We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.  But, she eventually started sliding again.  I had the difficult task of coming home one afternoon to find her dead.  It was one of the most upsetting things that has happened in my life, even though I knew it was coming.  That one cat has made me open to the possibility of having cats in the future.  We have opted to wait until the children a older to introduce a kitten.  The bottom line is that I feel for you Mir.

      Miriam...my cat Pookie was 14 years old when he was diagnosed with FIV, and he had a stroke which caused him to lose the use of his back legs.  We had to put him to sleep.  It was one of the hardest days of my life.  I understand what you're going through, and I'll be thinking of you, 'cause I know how much you must be hurting right now.    Love for you.

      my cat, sam, who i have had for 12 years, was diagnosed today with renal failure, and i will have to put him to sleep tomorrow.  i cannot express how horrible this is and how painful it is to not only to see him suffer, but to be the one who has to decide that it is time for him to die.   i could let him survive for a few more weeks, but he would just be in pain - it would not be the way he would want to live his life.  he was always a very strong and intelligent cat. now he is basically unable to walk more than 5 steps, unable to use the litter box, (he was, before this, a very fastidious animal), covered in his own drool and urine.  i have tried to brush him and to clean him, but he does not seem to know what it's going on. i don't know if he knows me but he still does respond to his name.  i want to believe he knows me - i want him to know that i tried to save him.   but i couldn't and i feel guilty but i know, logically, that i cannot save him. i have held him, rocked him, placed his almost limp body on the bed next to me, my head against his, and i don't know whether to pray for a quick death in his sleep so i don't have to euthanize him tomorrow - so he won't know what has happened.  i have cried so much today and i know in the next few weeks that it will happen again and again.  i love him - i love him as much as someone can love a cat.  and it hurts, damnit.  it hurts so much.  btw, i just wanted to express this - don't feel it would be rude to post a political or satirical or silly comment after this. i know life goes on - i just wanted to get it out.

      Oooh, now *that's* a story.  Shift the Jedi order so that a master can have two or three apprentices.  Obi-Wan has one apprentice, Qui-Gon, a star pupil in the order.  He then takes on the gifted but troubled Annakin.  Annakin starts to surpass his fellow apprentice; resentment and jealousy brews; something goes wrong; Annakin makes a hotheaded choice that leaves Qui-Gon in a bad spot and he gets killed.  A rift begins between Obi-Wan and Annakin.  Follow through to final confrontation and betrayal.  A whole family unit falls apart.  Mythical, even Biblical.  Wow.  That's great stuff.  I think I'll become famous so one day I'll be at a party where I can walk over and kick Lucas in the shins.

      Now that I think of it, there's no continuity trouble with Chewbacca appearing in III and IV.  In Mos Eisely, we see Obi-Wan discussing with Chewbacca (no dialogue heard, Chewie just nods); a few moments later, Obi-Wan introduces Chewbacca to Luke as "Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us."  They could certainly have met before, possibly as pilot and paying passenger.  It would push the irony angle a bit much for me if Chewie had met Annakin before, and thus served as co-pilot for his son on the way to the Death Star.  But then, Darth Vader made Threepio, so what the hell.

      John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings?  If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.

      Miriam (Congratulations, BTW), you are making some gross, as in large, assumptions concerning the looting.  You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted.  Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.  Johnnathan - No.  And, did we even have advanced notice of the destruction anyway?

      Perhaps I am not being clear.  I'll rephrase:  1) Should people be angry at us because the Iraqis chose to loot their own artifacts and heritage?  2) Should people be angry at us for not stopping the Taliban's destruction of the Buddhist carvings?

      that's not entirely my point, harmony.  one of the ways we are justifying this war is by saying we are freeing the iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.  when did it become our responsibility to become the world's liberators?  there are over 100 nations that currently are violating u.n. human rights mandates - are we going to invade all of them?  my point being is that we were there, we knew the signifigance of the artifacts; we should have stopped it. and, once again, people are offended that the only place we protected was the ministry of oil.  what message does that send to the iraqi people and the world about why we are there? and madonna you would snatch those slippers up in a second and you know it.

      i would think that people are upset about the looting of the iraqi's muesums because the u.s. military did nothing to protect them.   we (the u.s) understood the signifigance of those artifacts even if the iraqi people didn't.  The most disturbing thing is that the only building protected during the looting was the ministry of oil.  it does look poorly on us that we thought that was more important than a nation's culture and history.

      Clarificaton:  I am specifically addressing the artifact/museum issue.  I am not addressing the looting of government property or the looting of private businesses and homes.  The former is understandable given the country's oppressive history; the latter, while unfortunate, is standard practice in any riot or period of lawlessness.

      I've been thinking about this...how, exactly, is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts?  They're not our children.  It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?

"I dream of the U.S. one day fighting for the liberation of the oppressed Ugandan people," said Ankole as he nursed his bloody stumps. "But, alas, our number-one natural resource is sugar cane." Ankole, whose wife, parents, and five children were among the 4,000 slaughtered in Uganda's ethnic killings of 2002, then bowed his head and said a prayer for petroleum.

      Sigourney speaks out.  Make of it what you will...  Alien 5: Whilst promoting "Holes", Sigourney Weaver talked with The Chicago Sun Times about a further 'Alien' adventure: "Ridley Scott and I have talked about it a couple of times. He has some ideas. If we developed a good script, I'd love to play Ripley again. I've always felt so grateful to Ridley Scott because he gave me my first job...The only thing I'm not interested in is going to earth. I saw that 'Star Trek' movie where they went to Earth and ... yawn. I think it's more fun to go to a foreign planet--especially now. Who wants to come to Earth now? Let's go far, far away! Fantasy is what we need!".

      5) Will the male 12-year-old target audience ever figure out that their fantasy hottie is old enough to be their mother? 6) Will Neo recreate the Matrix to resemble the world of Point Break? 7) Will Morpheus tell anyone about his hidden stash of cheeseburgers?

      Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a "monumental failure".  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?

      I could also have had an obtuse moment.  It's certainly happened before.  I may have unconsciously given up on the movie early on, resulting in me not paying close enough attention.  If so, sloppy movie viewing on my part.

      He's the fellow who Smith blends with before he can reach the phone.  Later, he's seen attempting to sneak up on and attack Neo in Zion.  I also missed it at first.  If a key plot point is that difficult to communicate, something's wrong with the writing.  It's the last image of the film, for crying out loud, and a lot of viewers aren't getting it.

      In a recent interview, Joss shares the irony that he was able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the Buffy movie -- about a ditzy and self-absorbed girl becoming heroic -- through Cordelia, from her run on "Buffy" through to her arc on "Angel".  Struck me as interesting, the idea of Cordelia playing out the originally-intended movie-Buffy arc, and series-Buffy playing out a whole different outcast-makes-good arc.

      Oh, Jesus, that would have been funny.  Especially if you've seen "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," in which the guy who plays Smith (whose name completely escapes me at this moment...ah, Percocet!) plays flaming drag queen.  'Twould be funny if he had on a little sequin number underneath that smart black suit, and all the Smiths start line dancing to "We Are Family."

      Johnathan's right...I will sadly be unable to join you all at Sunday's game.  My energy level is as such right now that I know I'm in the big time if I can walk to the living room and back!  But it's okay...'tis for a worthy cause!  Thank God my desk isn't too far from my bed, 'cause I'm such an internet junkie that I'd die if I couldn't blog and stuff...  On a Buffy note, I just saw Amy (Willow's witch friend that lived as a rat for a while) in a Dove Shampoo commercial.  That's kinda sad.

      From what I can gather as an observer, the effect of breast reduction surgery is similar to being hit square and full force in the chest with a baseball bat.  The initial days of recovery appear comparable to repeatedly dipping one's testicles every few minutes in scalding hot water.  I think it's safe to say that Fennie will be gathering supplies and tending to the horses this Sunday.

      From The Washington Post, summarized in The Week:  About 40,000 human embryos are being stored in freezers in fertility clinics throughout the U.S.  Most are leftovers from previous fertility treatments and will never be used.  President Bush has prohibited the embryos from being used in stem cell research, and most couples would prefer to keep them frozen indefinitely, rather than destroy them.  "People just can't cope with the decision," says an official with the American Infertility Association.  ....until one quiet and otherwise innocuous evening, when, without warning, as one, they all...awakened.

      Chris - I did see Farscape from time to time.  Honestly, I forgot all about it when making my list.  I liked it fine, but got frustrated with SciFi's handling of it.  Current season this week.  First season next week.  Not on the following week.  For the record, I HATED the way it ended.  It actually seems that the producers were caught by surprise when it was cancelled, thus the "to be continued".

      Ben - Your post struck a nerve, which surprises me.  While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.

      The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.

      I agree with Johnathan about the stupidity of his being robbed of choice in the end.  Read  urlLink my blog  for more of my thoughts.  I'm honestly too upset to think about it right now.  I know that's stupid because it's just a farkin' TV show, but I get this way about characters in books as well...I just get completely emotionally involved in them, and their tragedies devastate me.  I'm far too empathetic for my own good.

      Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.  It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to read it all.  I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over "discrepancies" of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?

      as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be "good" if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her "cookieness" was worth it.

      I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.

      Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments?  Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks?  Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story, but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves?  Always, always, always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.

      Ok, so of my list of fatalities, I got one and a half right - Spike and Anya.  I had Anya on the 50/50 list, thus only half credit.  How the heck is Spike going to appear on Angel?  He is very dead (i.e. dust)  Did you guys catch the Trogdor Burninator reference?  I thought the ending was to anticlimatic.

      OK, peeps, catching up on the blog (and I didn't have to go  all  the way to the bottom of the 100 post view!)  JS -- I realized tonight that I still have your video tape with Season 3 of B5 (Angie's Journey caused the lightbulb to fizzle on). Need it back? For that matter, does anyone have 4 and 5 on tape? And, yes, I still need VHS, as I have discovered myself to be a rather late-adopter when it comes to home electronics....  Did anyone here ever watch Farscape on SciFi? I noticed that it didn't make John's list - did you just miss it or didn't like it?  BTW, I really like hanging out with you guys as a group, albeit virtually, since this particular collection of minds can easily switch from discussing the inherent unfairness of international power politics vis a vis the individual all the way over to the intricacies of the universe created for "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer." It brings a tear to my eye [sniff].

      It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears "party," that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says "god."  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term "little-d democratic" is far more frequent than "little-r republican," because "democratic" is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.

      i'm probably becoming fascinated by minutia here, but the "upper / lower case" labeling interests me.  now that you've created a definition for the terms, will they only be used in emails and other text-based exchanges of ideas?  in conversation, no one will be able to hear the distinction between the two; would you come up with different terms for your beliefs to use when you were speaking to someone, or would you explain which type of r/Republican you were each time?  if in that same conversation (or another), if the person you were talking to said "i'm a d/Democrat", would you ask them what sort of d/Democrat they were, or would you just make an assumption?  since you mentioned that this is a new thing, it's cool if you don't know the answers to these questions yet - i was just curious.

      Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.

      in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case "republican" and "democrat."  i ignore them merely out of laziness not aesthetics but thanks for the benefit of the doubt - i am in this discourse referring to the concept  of the republican and democratic parties. and i would absolutely agree with harmony's statement that many people are beneficiaries of our lack of social darwinism in this country and are fairly unaware of it.  not many of us would survive in a truly competitive society.  and those who do believe it, in my opinion, are not only insensitive elitists but also sadists.  to ignore one group's suffering or difficulties because they do not match or compliment the most dominant or successful group is disgusting.  we can judge ourselves by how we treat the lowest of our society - i would think a vegan of all people would understand that.   however, when i hear people speak of the ethical dilemna faced by genetic counseling, i do not see the issue.  if someone can be spared the pain of illness or an impariment than let it be.  yes, yes, we get into the whole concept of how a society decides what is aberrant but really, when do we start discussing the realities of people's lives?  in my own case, as many of you know, have suffered from clinical depression for most of my life - i now take medication to control it.  if this could have been prevented before i was born, would i have approved?  you are damn right.  my depression did not build my character - it stripped away years of happiness from me and no one should have that burden placed upon them even if some intellectuals seem to want to make the world suffer in order to satisfy some form of philosophy. and neb, your questions about who runs what are just questions of policy.  what a country would we be living in if only education was taken that seriously! and yes, neb, i know you think life is a cycle but all we can do is try to do what is best - and yes, that is subjective not only to each culture but to each individual but we all have to start realizing some things are wrong.  murder is wrong.  rape is wrong.  letting people suffer needlessly is wrong.

      r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.

      part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets:   *sometimes*, you're dealing with social darwinists, who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.  as they see it, the species, and society, is only as strong as its weakest link; ergo, if you continue to coddle the poorest and weakest elements of the population, they will only continue to breed more poor and weak persons.  evolution has proven time and again that when a given species fails to act or become as strong or stronger than their competitors, they soon go the route of extinction.  mind you, this is a rather extreme point of view, and i seriously doubt that anyone who subscribed to it would come right out and confirm this (at least, in political circles).  there are plenty of milder versions of this philsophy out there - and more extreme ones.  eugenics was committed to the idea that, ultimately, we should set a standard for the human race in regards to intelligence, strength and attractiveness, and eliminate any member of the population who did not meet the minimum requirements established by this standard - or at least discourage if not prevent those same members from producing offspring.  this sort of thing is done all the time to other species by farmers and their ilk; why not on our own race, some have asked.  involuntary sterilization of institutionalized mentally retarded persons continued in virginia until about the seventies or so, i believe.  it does raise some interesting questions about the short term sacrifice, long term gain strategy that miriam spoke of; if via genetics, we could eliminate all disease, physical and mental disability, etc. from the human race via the systematic use of genetic manipulation prior and during each and every human conception, why shouldn't we, for the betterment of our species?  this assumes that the genetics in question were tried and true, and took into account the need to allow for some diversity in order to prevent the human race from being wiped out in one pass by a new, never before seen disease.  as for education of and for all youth, i'm all for it - but who's in charge of creating the curriculum?  should it be creatively or technically driven?  should it be paid for on a county, state or nationwide basis, or some combination thereof?  should teachers or parents have more control and responsibility for children's behavior?  should we offer the benefits of education only to citizens of our country, or to those of others as well?    as for "the social contract which dictates that that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do", it certainly sounds like a good and benevolent concept; the problem with those social contracts is that nobody has to sign them.    in the end, the policies and procedures of the nation (and the world, to a degree) are decided by rich men in high towers, as it has been for thousands of years.  there is a revolution every now and again, and occasionally the men in question are dragged out and shot; but the towers remain, and eventually, someone takes up residence once again.  without them, there can be no true order; with them, there can be no real freedom.

      I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term "best services."  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term "social contract" makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.

      to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game -  you need to have  good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.  republicans overall don't seem to understand the concept of short term sacrifices for long term goals.  for instance - something close to my own life - autistic children.  there is a program in place which can actually "cure" up to 60 percent of all children with autism.  the price of this treatment ranges from free in some states (california) to 55,000 dollars per student in others (virginia)  the conservatives in this state go no we can't put more money into special education!  we don't have the budget!  but what they don't realize or seem to realize is that if they invest the money now they can save money on special education for the rest of the students' lives (the treatment generally takes 2-3 years), not have to pay for special services as they get older - this will actually save money in the long run!!!  and also, don't we have a social contract which dictates that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do?

      Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is "an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres." It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as "discrimination" which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously "mainstream"; that in most States what the Court calls "discrimination" against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such "discrimination" under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such "discrimination" is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. §654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such "discrimination" is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new "constitutional right" by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that "later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress"; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case "does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter." Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to "personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education," and then declares that "[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do." (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is "no legitimate state interest" for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), "[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring"; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising "[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?" Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case "does not involve" the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a "fundamental right" (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.

      Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. "Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code." [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.

       from  urlLink Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in "auto run" and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, “This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.”

The foyer is dark, with two faux stone columns on either side mounted with electric flames, and the soundracks play; cryptic writings on the wall; special events with a "real wizard" and the opportunity to attend dressed as your favorite Harry Potter character.  How wonderful that some children have a rich fantasy to look forward to.  Reminds me of Star Wars days, when I was so excited to dress as Threepio for Halloween.

      Yelahneb - neither the most current version of IE for Mac nor Mac's own new browser, Safari, display Blogger normally.  As I suspected, Blogger programmers are favoring the most recent Windows-based browser coding.  While Mac IE has no problem with any other site I visit, I acknowledge it always lags a version behind what appears on Windows; as for Safari, it is a robust and capable browser, more recent than the latest Windows IE, yet it cannot display Blogger either.  No big deal; I just have to click a few more places than everyone else.  It only reveals the deficiencies of the immature and inexperienced Blogger engineers.

      Well, I guess I have a more updated version of IE at home than I do at work, because I am not stuck with the crappy Lo-Fi sh*t.  This looks more like the old.  However, I will admit that the system/pages seem to load faster than before.  At work, it was nothing for it to take 5 minutes to load the blogspot page.

      JLS - i don't think the OS is the issue; the message you received was "This version of Blogger has been designed for  web browsers   that lack robust Stylesheet and/or DHTML capabilities."  that's why i asked which browser you were using - if you have IE, an upgrade from the MS Update site might be the hook up.    so you don't need Windows XP to get the "hi-fi" blog -  i'm using Windows 2000, with Internet Explorer 6.0, SP1.  i can't think of any reason why you couldn't upgrade your browser, whether you have Windows 95 or OS X Mac; even if you're using Netscape as your browser, newer versions are out there.  let us know what happens...  yeah, this whole interconnectedness thing between characters over the years in the star wars storyline is getting out of hand.  i suppose it's trying to show how Fate is clever and ironic and whatnot, but it's rather heavyhanded.  for that matter, wouldn't have ben said  something  in ep4 about seeing chewbacca again, if they had met years before in the midst of such an important event?  maybe they didn't exchange names the first time.  yeah, that's it...

      The new Blog design must be for XP users -- neither my 95 PC at work nor my OS X Mac at home can view the page in anything other than "Blogger LoFi."  Meanwhile:    .......from Dark Horizons:  Peter Mayhew confirmed in Orlando this past weekend that "Chewbacca rescues and delivers the two children to Ben Kenobi".  It's turned into a Dickens novel.  Everyone is related to everyone else.

      i haven't, but i have at times become hyper-aware of color, and wondered if there are colors i've never seen before.   sometimes if i look at my face (or other faces) long enough, they cease to be familiar, and just look like some bizarre sphere made of skin, fur and sensory organs.  separating yourself from your body (as in, this is my body, and I am just riding around in it) is very trippy.

      Partially based on misinformation.  The part about him treating his people badly and having lots of oil still holds true.  What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.  Well, except for the part about the liberation(?) of the people, and the hidden terrorists in the hills.  Oh, wait -- and the oil.  Yeah.  I keep forgetting about that.  It's so minor...just slips right out of my mind...silly me...

      thanks for your insight angie.  and the tattoo had two distinct meanings for me when it was done.   one is not so important now (okay, hell, it was ben -  back to our regularly scheduled conversation) and the other being my desire to have clarity, balance, and moderation in my life - sometimes i feel close to being there and other times it's like i haven't moved an inch for years.    there are no answers to be discovered but a path that each individual can follow - each path is as different as each individual is.  but we can learn from others in their journeys - from their terrain.

      red - perhaps you could start by thinking about the design on your back.  It seems to have been important enough to have it permanently tattooed on your body.  Unless your interpretation of its meaning applies to something completely different.

      That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.  I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, becaue I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them. :)

      really, do you ever feel like there are people or situations in the world that exist to test you?  i know that claims alot of ego because that would mean that somewhere in the universe someone or something is concerned about your individual enlightenment - but it does seem that way sometimes.

      Cameron Frye was the legendary best friend of Ferris.    "When Cameron was in Egypt's land,  Let my Cameron gooooooo!"  God, he kicked so much ass.    But yeah, he did one Trek movie, so he's set to do the convention circuit for life.  And he was there this year.  And I met him.  And my life will never be the same.  I am a changed woman.  Because I met Alan "Cameron Frye" Ruck.  Among other famous people.  But I will post all about that on my LJ in due time, just as soon as I quit cruisin' down the Lortab Highway.

      Distortion of Evidence  The President took the nation to war based on his assertion that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our country. Now the evidence that backed that assertion is falling apart. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s and a supporter of the war, recently wrote, "Clearly a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq."  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception. With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the distortion of evidence right now. If Bush and his officials deceived the American public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held accountable.

      from salon's cary tennis: Do not fear change. It is better to try to achieve something good than it is to try to avoid something bad. Both paths have risks, but only one can lead to happiness. So do not simply coast along thinking maybe this is as good as it gets. This is not as good as it gets. It gets much better than this. You need only the courage to act. Take strength in knowing you have come a long way and you are doing the right thing.

      Q. In a recent Answer Man, you stated Johnny Depp based his character in "Pirates of the Caribbean" on Keith Richards. While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   "Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' "  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen. That's why actors get the big bucks.

      Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the "bad guys" are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on "24," all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for "Austin Powers," "Legally Blonde," etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: "Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?"

      Usually as the format of the text suggests.  As in:  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  *shrug*  That kind of means, "This is what I'm saying, and after saying it, I'm shrugging, most likely in real life as I type it."   Out of curiosity, why is this so important to you?  I never really gave it much thought before now.   And Tree, I had originally typed the phrase phonetically, but I thought Ben wouldn't know what I was talking about, so I went with the actual spelling of the words so as not to confuse anyone.  Johnny Depp is a fine example of anything, I agree.

      hey angie - a netlanguage question for you.    when you write "*shrugs*" at the end of your posts, what emotion or action are you suggesting?  is it an "i don't know",  an "it's weird, but what can you do?", or is it simply meant to suggest the body language of shrugging, its meaning left for the "viewer" to determine?  for that matter, is it meant to overlay the flow of the entire post, or not until after you're done "speaking"?  in other words, should i imagine the "shrug" amidst the text, or not until after?  the format suggests the latter, but i'm open to ambiguity here.

      Christine Todd Whitman sold her soul to the republican party.  it was rumored that she resigned from the epa because of the dearth of information regarding global warning in the epa report.   however, she came out on npr saying she wanted to spend "more time with her family." but that she was considering a run for the nj senate.  so, it seems the republicans told her that if she kept her trap shut, they would back her for the senate.   i don't bravo is trying to be known as the "gay" network - they are just going for shock value (with boy meets boy) and for advertisers (queer eye for the straight guy).   gay men have a lot of disposable income because normally they have no alimony or kids to deal with.

(ala Lifetime for women and Spike for men).  I was flipping around the other day and saw that Bravo is showing reruns of the West Wing.  I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.

      I saw this coming, because I watch "Third Watch," and they had an episode where the power went out in NYC because the heat of the summer and too many air conditioners running was just too much for the power grid.

      Meanwhile, headlines from MSNBC.com:   "Pedestrians swarm the streets ... In face of blackout, people cope"  Well, I should hope they cope.  What did they expect?  "In face of blackout, massacre ensues"?  Also wondering what it means, exactly, that pedestrians "swarm the streets."  Are they masses of chaotic, swirling dots?  Are they agitated and feeling strongly aggressive?  Are they gathering in larger and larger numbers, helplessly answering a primal drive?  Or perhaps someone threatened the Queen?

      This kind of thing continues to bother me.  From darkhorizons:  "...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film."  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)

      do not fear change.  it is better to try to achieve something good than it is to try to avoid something bad.  both paths have risks, but only one can lead to happiness.  so do not simply coast along thinking maybe this is as good as it gets.  this is not as good as it gets.  it gets much better than this.  you need only the courage to act.  take strength in knowing you have come a long way and you are doing the right thing.

      One cannot truly know another; one can only know another's behavior.  Any feeling of truly knowing another is only the recognition of elements of oneself in another's behavior.  This recognition may vary in accuracy, depending on one's perception.

      Hello everyone!  I'm still in London and living in a house full of comedians.  I don't have a job yet, so I've had plenty of time to read, exercise, and I learned to cook!  For those that do not know me well, this is a huge accomplishment following years of burnt and horrible food.  As for books. . . here are the last four politcal books that that I've read.  -Rogue State (It's kind of like a history book of U.S. fuck ups) -Weapons of Mass Deception (This was fantastic. You all must read it!  Now!) -Stupid White Men (yeah. . .I finally got around to it) -The Best Democracy Money Can Buy (This blew my mind.  Excellent chapters on the Florida election crisis and the World Bank.)  Okay...hope you guys are enjoying not having power, which probably means that you won't read this until you do have power again.  (Yes, I definitely got the brains in our family.)  -Eva

      All that foreign oil controlling American soil, Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed. Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings, Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more, You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin' In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave, Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters, Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency, All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.  -Bob Dylan, natch.

      fighting evolution, one idiot at a time:   "The beach was practically deserted at North Topsail Island, North Carolina, CNN's Gary Tuchman reported. The narrow island is south of Isabel's center, so the storms powerful winds were blowing out to sea. Officials said they hoped the flood damage would be limited.  A curfew was imposed until 7 p.m. Thursday in neighboring Surf City, where police said they would arrest people who leave their homes. "  though i must admit, i can't figure out where these police will be during this curfew imposition - in hurricane-proof police cars, prowling the streets, perhaps?    my mother heard one report yesterday that officials were advising residents who refused to leave the danger zone of the storm to write their name and social security number on their arms with a permanent marker, to aid in post-storm identification of their bodies.  probably just trying to scare people into leaving, but still...

I wonder how one measures a Region.  Is it much like Risk?  If so, can we just take all of Asia and get 7 armies next turn?

And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.

      A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for "fictitious reasons," one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being "the only non-general allowed on CNN all week." He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his "policies," not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: "If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them."   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax "cut" and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the "last resort" and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade "A" rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word "liberal." Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said "No!" and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a "liberal democracy." The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to "we, the people."   Yours,   Michael Moore Lottery # 275, U.S. military draft, 1972 Conscientious Objector applicant mmflint@aol.com

      While his status as a media personality arguably changes the rules of judgment, it might still be prudent to remember that if we were all held accountable for every absolute declarative statement we made, we'd all look mighty foolish.  Kind of like he does.

      Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when  they lit a fire in the craft, it sank - proving once  and for all that you can't have your kayak and heat  it, too.   Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina. One went  to Hollywood and became a famous actor. The other  stayed behind in the cotton fields and never amounted  to much. The second one, naturally, became known as  the lesser of two weevils.   A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old  West. He sidles up to the bar and announces: "I'm  looking for the man who shot my paw."   This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the holidays.  After looking over the menu he says, "I'll just have  the eggs Benedict." His order comes a while later and  it's served on a big, shiny hubcap. He asks the  waiter, "What's with the hubcap?" The waiter sings,  "O, there's no plate like chrome for the hollandaise!"    When she told me I was average, she was just being  mean.   A neutron goes into a bar and asks the bartender, "How  much for a beer?" The bartender replies, "For you, no  charge."   Two atoms are walking down the street and they run  into each other. One says to the other, "Are you all  right?" "No, I lost an electron!" "Are you sure?"  "Yeah, I'm positive!"   Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused his  dentist's Novocain during root canal work? He wanted  transcenddental medication.   A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and  were standing in the lobby discussing their recent  tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager  came out of the office and asked them to disperse.  "But why?," they asked as they moved off. "Because,"  he said, "I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open  foyer."   A hungry lion was roaming through the jungle looking  for something to eat. He came across two men. One was  sitting under a tree and reading a book; the other was  typing away on his typewriter. The lion quickly  pounced on the man reading the book and devoured him.  Even the king of the jungle knows that readers digest  and writers cramp.   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun  contest. He sent in ten different puns, in the hope  that at least one of the puns would win.  Unfortunately, no pun in ten did.   A guy goes to a psychiatrist. "Doc, I keep having  these alternating recurring dreams. First I'm a  teepee; then I'm a wigwam; then I'm a teepee; then I'm  a wigwam. It's driving me crazy. What's wrong with  me?" The doctor replies: "It's very simple. You're two  tents."   A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One  of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named "Amal."  The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him  "Juan." Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself  to his mom. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her  husband that she wishes she also had a picture of  Amal. Her husband responds, "But they are twins -- if  you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal."

      i would suggest that you give her fake meat which can be found in the frozen food section of ukrops - they have bocca burgers, fake chicken nuggets,fake chicken patties -  i'm guessing she will like those also, there are "smart dogs" which are fake hotdogs - plenty of protein there - and actually, cheese is a really good source of protein.

      My daughter is 3 1/2 years old.  She is almost a vegetarian.  The only meat she will eat is chicken, and that is only sometimes.  She drinks lots of milk (24-30 oz a day).  For comparrison, most doctors recommend that growing teenagers get about that same amount.  She also usually will eat cheese when it is offered, and she eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Most of her calories are coming from bread, fruit, and vegetables.    My questions is this, how do vegetarians get the protein they need?  I know that soy (tofu) is a good source, but I really doubt she will eat it.  I only eat it when it is in hot & sour soup, so I also would have no idea how to offer it to her.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

      some interesting news/rumors concerning the Brothers Matrix:  "Two Wachowski scripts are floating around Hollywood. One, a fanciful retelling of the Guy Fawkes story set in a postapocalyptic Britain, is  an adaptation of V for Vendetta, the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.  The other, Plastic Man, is based on the old DC Comics character. Plastic Man has long been rumored to be the Wachowskis' next film, but, of course, there's no official word."  read the full article  urlLink here .   oddly enough, Matrix 3 premieres on November 5 - Guy Fawkes Day.

      An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of "Eyes Without a Face"...  *****  "....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you "never" see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre."

      JLS, hopefully this is not a situation you'll be in - but fair warning:   "After upgrading to Mac OS X 10.3, better known as Panther, they [Mac users] are finding external FireWire drives are no longer recognized by the host machine. In many cases, all the data the drive stores are also gone.  The glitch is particularly troubling because many Mac users backed up their files to an external FireWire drive before installing the Panther upgrade. In some cases, the glitch erased files on the main machine and the external backup. "  read the full article  urlLink here .

      For those looking for something intense:  the Scream Forest way out on Staples Mill is quite disturbing.  They really went all out.  Carnival games, bonfire, wagon ride to the trail, lots of lights and effects in the woods.  I was scared.  Recommend thinking twice about entering the house at the end -- in the middle it is pitch black in an enclosed space with no reference point, and if you're prone to claustrophobia or are afraid of buried alive, etc., take the "Chicken Trail" that goes around it.  I would not recommend the attraction to anyone under 8 years old.  Includes graphic stuff, like an automated body, bag over its head, moaning and writhing from where it is suspended by its feet in the trees.

I liked dating about 56% of the time when I was dating...I really loved the newness when it was good...I hated the awkwardness when it was bad.  Glad I met my soulmate when I did, because I was biologically getting really tired of field playing.  Nesting instincts starting to kick in and all that...

      Dating, huh? Well.... I had some spectacularly boring dates with self-involved actors earlier this summer. I was recently abandoned by a drunk first date (thank goodness). But I've also had some positive experiences. I'd say that dating is both what you make it and always an adventure. And as someone who has been on both sides of single & married, I'd have to say that I'm currently enjoying the dating gambit. If you ask me again in six months I may change my mind....

      Jesus...I'm in a bed and breakfast in Dublin and I can't sleep to save my life!  I've got a 6am flight to Edinburgh, thanks to Nick.  Ireland and Scotland have been really fucking awesome, but in the tradition of all of my vacations, I drank way too damn much.  I think I'm going to need a few weeks of detoxing after this one.  The weather has been atrocious.  While we were in Edinburgh last week, it was raining so hard that our umbrella snapped in half.  As Nick said, you kind of understand why the Scots are so surly when God personally tells you to fuck off.  It was like he was saying, "Go home Mary Poppins!"  Dublin is a fairly unattractive city, but the people here are amazing cool.  It's the first place in Europe that I've been to where the majority of people actually liked Americans, with the exception of the "fat ones who come here and wear green."  We went to the Guiness brewery and out on a pub crawl.  Nick has been doing gigs almost every night, so we've spent a lot of time hanging out with Irish comics.  The people love him here.  These are some of the best gigs that I've seen him do.  So yeah...I'm going to go back to the room and attempt to get an hour of sleep in.

Gaines: Heh. I learned that when you're poor, you don't get the legal defense you need. Look at all those poor people like me in prison, you don't see too many rich ones. I couldn't afford a lawyer. If I had those Choate, Hall & Stewart people at the beginning, I wouldn't even have gone to prison. And I learned how many people there are like me. Wouldn't hurt anybody, didn't hurt anybody, and people are spending their lives behind bars. There's no justice. But I also learned about my own strength. There are so many people who go to prison and give up, they say "you can't beat the feds." But I say "fight every day," and that's what I did. Every day, I wrote somebody about my case. Sometimes you get weary, but you never give up. After all, I wasn't there to learn how to crochet.   also go to  urlLink This American Life  and find the story under 1999 - sentencing -

      Castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal.  The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the "local group" of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.

      actually, it doesn't say there's a new strong bad email - it just says 'strong bad email', as a quick link to one of the more popular features of the site.  there  is  a new toon, though - another marshmellow cartoon that may amuse.

      i heard a bit about this story - was this kid at any point a threat to anyone?  did he have the box cutter for a reason?   does anybody really believe that the passengers/flight attendants wouldn't beat the hell out of anyone who threatened them with a box cutter?   it seems to be that safety is not insured by constant surveillance and encroachment of civil liberties and common sense but rather by public policy which promotes equality and fairness among peoples and countries.   no matter how many middle eastern countries we bomb into oblivion (iran seems next) we cannot make them agree with western philosophy, capitalism, christianity, or as the u.s. government is claiming, democracy.    and also didn't bush say during the presidential election that he did not want us to be nation-builders -i suppose he was correct - we destroy afghanistan and then we leave it to rot - we go to war against iraq and then have no follow-up plan -  we are not nation builders - we are nation destroyers - the bullies of the world.

      Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.  Miriam, hope you realize that you're hanging out with me when I get home, cause you have to meet him.  Okay.  That's all.

      ooyeah/Happy Roctober = Miriam?  Anyway, just got back from my world domination meeting.....err, company staff meeting.  The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.  Never having had back problems (knocking on every piece of wood I can find), I can't imagine the pain that people must go through to become addicted to Oxicontin.

      john, you are so funny.  :)  even though i don't completely understand what you meant about the raw data and the thermal imaging - science and such is not my thing so if someone could explain that for the scientifically illiterate, i would appreciate it. and for all of you people out there who hate the left, you'll be pleased to know that ben and i should be starting up our show again sometime in the next few months!  and one of our main objectives of this program is to get whomever is running against bush elected.  i mean we just hate bush.   anyway, not all conservatives are bad -  heck, my parents are republicans.  and i do feel very sorry for rush - it's horrible for him and his family that he would have such a awful addiction.  i do dislike al franken more after hearing reports of what he said.  if he disagrees with rush on ideas, policy, etc, that is one thing but to celebrate when another fellow human being is suffering is reprehensible.

      Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the "corporations are evil" and "corporations have the Republicans in their pockets" attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....

      The truth of the matter is, moths are not from our world:  among their kind there are tales of a faraway place of happiness and belonging -- a home to which they can return only through a legendary portal that hides deep within the center of flame.  None may know which flame holds the gateway; but that does not deter many moth-dreamers who plunge bravely into flame after flame, hoping that this light will not bring scorching heat and painful death, but instant passage to a land of eternal dusk filled with tiny flittering wings and a million joyful hearts.

      iTunes and iPod work together to make a powerful, seamless, elegant music management system.  As for the store, I've visited it only once.  However, if it occurs to me to get a song, I would rather pay .99 for it than download it for free.  I've just never felt comfortable getting free music.  Can't explain why.  Regardless, I love both the app and the device.  The store is for me only a side item.

       In other news: Apple launches iTunes for Windows. Visit apple.com for details.   ok, i'll bite - is anyone else in this group planning to buy songs from the apple site rather than just continue to download them for free from the p2p networks?  c'mon, i know all of you have stolen your share of mp3s at this point; why stop now?  the only users getting targetted by the RIAA are the ones sharing out the huge catalogs of songs.  as innovative as this apple thing may appear, i'm hoping it's just a beta test for what's to come; namely: artists over the next few years allowing their contracts with the record companies to run out, and then start selling their music directly to the net from their own sites.  now, *that's* the sort of music i would pay for - my $ would go straight to the band, not some musical megacorp that pushes us to buy overpriced crap product designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

There is a link below the news item (as of this posting it read "74 comments) -- several pages of discussion.  I use it mainly at work or connected to a stereo at home, so it's usually plugged into an outlet anyway.  So as a user I may not be comparable to the campus-roaming users who rely on the battery daily for months on end.

       All batteries eventually die. The iPod battery is quite replaceable; various vendors are available online. You can do it yourself, or Apple can do it for you. Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a "battery exchange program" for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's "iPod Protection Plan" for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:  urlLink iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the  urlLink old  and  urlLink new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

      I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.  As for my agreement regarding his take on the protest -- well, yes, I agree it was his take, since it was his protest, not mine, and those were his reasons.  They seemed valid grievances to me.  I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.

      JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    "A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis."   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   "I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    "Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head."    Also, your posts regarding different "what do i do with  this  flag?" scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!

      My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.

      Nick - I'm not ignoring your post or your points, but I need sometime to make sure that my response is a cogent as your post.  I don't agree with much of it, but it was a very good post.  Time to get back to the grindstone.

       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says "or prohibiting the free excercise thereof."  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?  Ridiculous?  Yes.  But stranger things have happened - remember the woman who spilled hot coffee on herself and won millions of dollars from McDonald's in a lawsuit?  Once the courts get involved, just about anything can happen.

      I was pretty sure that you were, but I wanted to see what was written about the subject.  I was surprised to see that we had a US Flag Code as part of the actual US Code of Laws.  Note that all of those items are  shoulds  not  musts or wills .

      Johnathan - In one of your responses concerning the Ten Commandements, you stated (correctly) that you are not a 13th century BCE Hebrew, implying to me that you did not think that something proposed 3,300 years ago has no place in today's society because we have changed over time.  I submit to you that we are not 4th century BCE Greeks, therefore the notion of the Republican form of government proposed by Plato (or at least written about by Plato) has no place in today's society.  I may have my information incorrect on Plato, as I don't remember much ancient history, but the specifics are not that important to my point.  Just because a concept is old does not mean it does not have modern relevance.  Where do you draw the line?  3,000 years - there goes the Ten Commandments 2,000 years - there goes the Republican form of government 1,000 years - there goes the Magna Carta 500 years - I can't think of anything except for the discovery the New World. 200 years - there goes the US Constitution 100 years - there go workers/consumers rights (labor unions / Sherman Anti-Trust laws)

      Does anyone know if the actor Steven Culp is the son of Robert Culp?  He currently has three recurring roles on three different shows on three different networks (Clayton Webb on JAG; the Speaker of the House on the West Wing; the MACO major on Enterprise).  I have seen him various parts over the past few years, but I am beginning to notice that he looks a little like Robert Culp.

      In somewhat of an answer to your question Johnathan (in case it was a serious question)  §176. Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.

      Self observation:  How curious, that when I am talking with my fellow citizens, I tend to doubt key elements of my government's foreign policy; yet when I encounter someone from another country who voices similar opinions, I bristle, and feel compelled to defend it.  Regardless, thanks for sharing.

      I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    " by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot ."    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, "by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot." (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.  It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clampdown on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.  It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year.  As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.  Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.  Er, I'd better go.  *or, Eva informs me, Virginia. Damn it, that's another Christmas tradition that I'll have to miss this year.

      john - i don't think the issue here is whether our laws have a judeo-christian origin or not.  nor do i think that conservatives are desperate to educate the masses regarding common law.  it is the intent, john, that is the problem. by having the ten commandments displayed, it is promoting a particular religion - that being christianity - if you saw a copy of a section of the koran everwhere, you could believe that religion was being promoted.   the u.s. government is not supposed to endorse any religion -

      One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  "These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original "Han shoots first" moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, "Archive" editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell".  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for "A New Hope", 10 for "Empire" and 14 for "Jedi". Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  "A New Hope" - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  "Empire Strikes Back" - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  "Return of the Jedi" - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, "It is finished...".  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that "Episode I" will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  "I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named "Donnie Darko" several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them"

      The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.

      Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy?  Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed?  What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another, respect their parents, don't steal, don't bear false witness against your neighbor, and don't cover your neighbor's possessions?  I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).  Of course, if people did not kill others, then the need for capital punishment would be greatly reduced.  Any, the principles expressed in the commandments sound like pretty good fundamentals to live by to me, and totally non-religious in nature if you ignore where they supposedly came from.    Eva - My point with the statues is what point was toppling a statue of Bush supposed to prove?  I really doubt that anyone in the US will be convinced not to vote for Bush because the people in another country don't like him.  Anyone who considers the actions of the protestors in deciding not to vote for Bush will probably have already decided not to based on many other factors.  As for France and Germany, why would they care if you toppled statues or burned their leaders in effigy?  I'm sure 90%+ of their citizens could care less what we in the US think of their leaders.  All I'm saying is that the reverse is true.  (P.S. Thanks for the trivia information on French Fries.  Don't blame me for someone way back thinking that Flemish Fries did not have the same ring.)  If the British don't like the way their PM is buddying up to the US/Bush, then they should do whatever is necessary under the procedures of Parliament to bring down the government.  If the British Parliament is anything like Israel's or Italy's procedurally, then it should not be difficult.  The British protesting our President accomplishes nothing productive.  We are not going to impeach our President because he is unpopular in England.  The last time I checked, we won a war 222 years ago so that we would not have to take orders from them.  Ben - I don't quite understand the difference between how you typed the one sentence (Free speech just does not apply...) compared to what I typed.  To me they say the same thing.  Then again, my degree is in engineering not english.  The point I was trying to make was regardless of the standard that is set for the definition of free speech, it must be applied universally to the socially acceptable topics (Civil rights) and the socially unacceptable topics (white supremacy).  Burning things in peoples yards (i.e. burning a cross in a black family's yard) is not freedom of speech, but a form of intimidation (and probably terrorism under the Patriot Act).  But, a bunch of guys in a farmer's field, with his permission, burning a cross and spouting their hate speech must be accepted as freedom of speech IF we are going to say that burning the flag is.  If a law is passed to make burning the flag illegal, then doing so is no longer a question social acceptability/unacceptability, but strictly legal versus illegal.  If someone, right now, were to burn a flag in front of me, I would not try to have them arrested because he has not violated any law.  What I am saying is that I think that there should be a law against it.  For my part, when I see someone burning a flag in protest, even if I might have been supportive of their cause previously, they have lost my support, and may have even pushed me to be against it depending on what their cause is.  Johnathan - Somewhere back aways, you were asking about other ways of defiling the flag, I think.  When a flag gets old or tattered, there are ceremonies to cover properly destroying the flag.  Under standard flag etiquette, the flag that was on top of the WTC should have been destroyed long ago, but it has now become a different type of symbol all together.

      Perhaps one could create a cloth flag that lacks one stripe, or several stars, and set *that* on fire.  It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a "Flag Threatening," in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.

      john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  " Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  "  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  "  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  "  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    " People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  "   assuming you meant to type " Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ", tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is "socially acceptable" is just a vague as the definition of "free speech"; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

      I will repeat the question:  What should be done *now*?  A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.

      The protest wasn't against the war.  Where the hell did you guys hear that?  It was against Bush visting England.  People here are incredibly angry at him and they didn't want the US media to have a nice photo-op moment showing how loved Bush is in England, America's best friend.  And the march slogan was simple: "Go home Bush!"  The protest was awesome!  Over 200,000 people were there.  I think that we got the point across that Bush is not welcome here.   By the way, why on Earth would you topple down statues of Chirac and Schroeder?  For not siding with the US in an illegal invasion of a country?  Were you too busy eating Freedom Fries to realize that countries have the freedom not to side with the US when it does bad things? (On a side note, "French" fries were actually invented in Belgium.)

      Does any country know how to solve complex problems?  It seems analogous to hoping that a single wave will reshape a coastline.  Change occurs over long periods of time, according to the effects of many disparate forces, each acting separately and often without any awareness of the other.  The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

      i agree with you johnathan - it does seem silly to protest a war that has happened and what exactly is the message now that we couldn't really leave without causing more chaos than before.  (ie, afghanistan)  i believe one of the major problems with protests at this point is that there is no clear message that can be chanted as you march.  like, "we didn't want this war in the first place, even though saddam was a horrible dictator, but there are horrible dictators across the globe, but now we hope for democracy, but that doesn't seem to be happening, and how can we afford this with so many domestic issues, and i need a slurpee because my throat is sore from so much chanting" it's an issue that cannot be solved by slogans or 10 second sound-bites.  which is scary - because i don't know if this country knows how to solve complex problems -

      I am not a 13th century BCE Hebrew.  Nor do I wish to be a citizen of a theocracy.  The notion that humans require a deity to identify and enforce ethical behavior is absurd.  Also, note that democracy emerged from pagans, not from Hebrews.  If one shouldn't burn the flag, can one burn a copy of the Constitution?  Or the Declaration of Independence?  Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?  Should one not discard it out the window of a car?  Should one not draw on it?  What if I draw on a painting of a flag?  Is a painting a flag?  Or is it only cloth?  Does plastic count?  Does it have to be a rectangle?  What of flag bookmarks?  Flag shot glasses?  Flag shirts, socks, hats?  What if I am angered by the discovery of something horrible that my country sanctioned, and I want to remove the flag sticker from my car -- should I wait until I've calmed down, so the act of disposing of the flag sticker won't be soiled by my mood at the time?  Here's a quandary:  All the people protesting in Great Britain today are encouraging those who committed the latest bombings in Turkey.  *Even* if they honestly don't think they're doing so!  Conundrum Corner indeed!  yelahneb:  If Iraqis feel that they can bicker amongst themselves, but if someone tells them what to do, they want none of it.  In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the "movement" to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.  What do we do *now*?  -- Nonaffiliated But Engaged in Virginia

Ben - Do you want pictures of the statue or of the nudists?  Speaking of the statue, do the protestors see how silly it is?  Bush is not being toppled, Sadaam was.   If  Bush loses the election next November, he will still be President for another 14 months.  And, he won't be a hunted man in his own country.  Hey, maybe we should hold a protest over here and topple statues of Chirac and Schroeder!  Yeah, that will show the French and Germans!

      Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal.  As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech.  Hog wash.  If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  The Ten Commandments - Given that every judge puts his hand on a bible and swears to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America to the best of their ability without reservation or purpose of evasion,  so help me God  and that all witnesses swear on a bible to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,  so help me God , I don't see where the disconnect is.  Additionally, can anyone say that if we as a nation were to live by the Ten Commandments, that the we would be worse off?

      the image created in my mind from the last bit got me:  "Home Secretary David Blunkett has refused to grant diplomatic immunity to armed American special agents and snipers travelling to Britain as part of President Bush's entourage this week.  In the case of the accidental shooting of a protester, the Americans in Bush's protection squad will face justice in a British court as would any other visitor, the Home Office has confirmed.   The issue of immunity is one of a series of extraordinary US demands turned down by Ministers and Downing Street during preparations for the Bush visit.  Demands for the US air force to patrol above London with fighter aircraft and Black Hawk helicopters have also been turned down."

      a short story to prove john's point - and in case you don't know nick, i'm a flaming liberal  (at least for virginia)and john is a staunch conservative. (in a moderate kind of way) i was out having dinner with some friends and two exchange students from india.  we were chatting about politics and i started to go on some rant about something or the other and one of the exchange students started going on about how yeah, america was such a international bully, destroying the planet, didn't know how to take care of its own people and so on - all of which i agree with  - however, hearing it from her - someone who voluntarily came to my country to take advantage of the educational opportunities just infurirated me.  i told her that if she hated the country that much then i'm sure a plane was leaving for india sometime soon and she should just go catch it.   listen, this country tries me nuts - but hell, it's my country and i don't need no mouthin' off from somebody who isn't even a citizen.   and yes, i know that is a narrow-minded point of view - but it is what i believed in that moment and what most americans believe.  i support the british protesting a president i can't stand but i seriously don't think anything will change as a result of it.  until we in this country get together and start actively protesting this man will things change.

      Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.  They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report.

      i agree with eva - the burning  of the american flag will just turn people against your cause.   i would say, the best way to protest, is to not be violent or threatening - but rather peaceful, with a good solid message.   but most of all - don't say or insinuate that americans are stupid.  even americans who say americans are stupid don't want to hear from another country.

      As I type, Mr Bush is having tea with the Queen a few miles away.  It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.  Oh, and I think most of the protestors will be from the UK, but there'll be be some from elsewhere, including plenty from the US, if experience serves.

      They are expecting between 60,000-100,000 people at the protest tomorrow in London.  Nick and I will be there.  At the end of the march, they are going to be knocking down a 6 meter statue of George Bush.  Toppling over statues seems to be symbolic in the US media as the end of a regime, so I think it is very appropriate.  I came here to get away from George.  He followed me to St. Petersburg when I was living there and now he's followed me to England.  He needs to stop sweatin' me.  I mean, I know that I'm super cool and all, but damn!

      NBC news this morning was reporting that the British were expecting 100,000 protestors during President Bush's visit.  They were a little vague leading up to that statement, talking about Bush's general unpopularity in Europe and something about a large (no percentage given) portion of the population supporting Bush.  On a sidenote, I just about fainted when an AIDS activist was complimentary of the Presidents record on AIDS - has hell started to freeze?  Anyway, my question is simple.  Are the 100,000 protestors from the UK or are they from all over western Europe?

But he also invoked both former President Ronald Reagan and the framers of the Constitution, who faced a deep crisis when they met in Philadelphia in 1787.   'The dream of a new nation was falling apart,' Schwarzenegger said. 'Events were spiraling downward. Divisions were deep -- merchant against farmer, big states against small, north against south. Our founding fathers knew that the fate of the union was in their hands, just as the fate of California is in our hands.'  But those delegates in Philadelphia produced what he called 'the miracle of Philadelphia."

      Just read  urlLink that Village Voice article . Scary - I understand that similar legislation was proposed Europe-wide.  Maybe it even went through.  The definition they give for terrorists is pretty loose, don't you think?  To whit: "any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means"-  which, pared down, could include pretty much anyone with an opinion, couldn't it?  I mean, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are a "combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity" - and I'll bet they mean to achieve their nefarious ends "through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means"... Mainly because "other means" includes absolutely everything.  I'm going to call that 800 number and report them.  Then I'm going to throw paint on some gerbils for wearing fur and send off some hate mail to Indonesian kids for using Nike products. Oh, and Eva says she'll post a picture when she oh look, a squirrel!  Sometimes I think she has some kind of attention deficimy foot is itching.

       urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0346/otis.php  excerpt - ALEC's model legislation, drawn up by its "Homeland Security Working Group," is called the Animal and Ecological Terrorist Act, and it ostensibly focuses solely on groups like Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front, which have attacked homes and development projects that threatened the habitat of several species. But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a "threat," and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines "terrorist" organizations, as "any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means." Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase "other means." The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of "eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism" would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

      From a recent USN&WR:  “Think gas is steep at $1.50 a gallon?  Look at it this way:  That $1.50 buys almost 100 tons of ancient plants, ecologist Jeffrey Dukes says in this month’s Climatic Change.  Today’s oil fields formed as microscopic plants living in ancient seas died and sank, then were buried deeply enough for heat and pressure to cook the organic matter into oil.  At each step, much of the original material decayed or escaped.  Dukes, then at the University of Utah, used published figures to calculate that every day, humanity burns up oil equivalent to nearly a year’s worth of plant growth across the entire planet."

      BTW, the toxoplasma stuff comes out in the news every few years with the intention of shocking pet owners.  "Oh, it's not my fault for being a slut...my cat has infected me with promiscuous disease."  If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They "evaluate" people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.  For now, the claims are total bollocks...   Off the subject, did anyone else think that the 'Matrices' were absolute shite?  Yuck!

      Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, "Mmmmm... My bed's comfy." Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.

      from  urlLink The Straight Dope :   Dear Cecil:  I hear Jesus wasn't really a Capricorn but that he was either a Pisces or a Leo instead--that his birthday is observed in December because the Catholic Church took over the ancient Saturnalia debauch. What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles    urlLink Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the "Birthday of the Invincible Sun" (or "ancient Saturnalia debauch," as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

      from the aforementioned bibleman series:  "After the prideful Prince zaps Bibleman with a mega-volt ego-enhancing ray, our hero finds his modesty put to its greatest test.  Stephen Phillips, the comic strip's talented young artist, is also hit with the evil ego whammy, thus feeling a bit too talented.  Could Stephen's selfishness bring about the end of the comic strip-and of Bibleman?  Or does God have a plan for Shattering the Prince of Pride?"  and  "With his scheme thwarted by the Bibleman Adventure team, Primordious Drool retires to the sewer from which he came and is replaced by another hopeful villain, The Wacky Protestor.  With plans to drench the world in a hopeless cloud of despair and darkness, the Wacky Protestor uses his Spasmodic, Meteoronic, Wacksonic Cloud of Darkness and Despair to discourage youth group member Corey Standridge and give him deep feelings of isolation and despair."   be sure to check out  urlLink images  from the "bibleman live tour", which looks for all the world like a combination of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and "Logan's Run".   if i were a christian, i'd seriously consider adopting another creed, just to distance myself as far as possible from this sort of foolishness.  what maddening, utter drivel!

      WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, "In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this."  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department "to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished." (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was  urlLink www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, "there was going to be a cost" charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, "other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'" and according to ABC News, "there is no cost."  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports "After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, "President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended," to insert the word 'Major' before combat." And the "Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site."  Read the  urlLink Mis-Lead .

      I enjoyed it, mainly because I'm a fan of the book.  I think I'll have to reserve my judgment until the longer DVD release.  It has been established now with LOTR that what appears in the theater is not the film, but a conscious abridgement.  It is not the finished work.  Take a moment and think about that:  the artist first publishes/presents a conscious abridgement of the actual work, agreed upon by all parties involved, who know and accept that what was really completed will be released in a different format in a few months.  Not a Director's Cut, not Lost Chapters, not a reassessment now that time has passed.  A conscious, fully intended abridgement.  Released first.

      from a  urlLink transcript  of the interview with Diane Sawyer that JLS mentioned earlier:   Bush also defended the intelligence that he used in citing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a main reason for going to war. Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons "programs" instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   " What's the difference? " he said. "If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with."    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, "The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations",  what you *meant* was, "The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?"  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

      Perspective:  From an MSNBC review of Return of the King....  "...In the final analysis, a purist for Tolkien's novels might do well to remember what mystery writer Raymond Chandler supposedly once said when asked if he felt his books had been mangled by Hollywood. No, he said, nothing happened to my books. There they are, up on the shelf where they've always been."

      The current administration provides the following bread and circus package for various large demographics:  wealth, a thrilling invasion, moral superiority, and fear.  There is no real connection between the two, but the general media also provides its own bread and circus package, mostly in the form of fear-sex-bling bling.  Wealth, sex, invasions, moral superiority, and constant fear.  No stump speech can beat that.  Four more years on the way.  Time will tell if it's good or bad.  For myself, I always hope for good.  I'll take being wrong and everything turning out ok over being right and it all going to hell any day.  It would be nice if the various candidates took the same attitude.

      Johnathan - I don't understand the first part of the response.  I do agree that it is totally on the fickle citizenry and not a measure of the actual politician's skill.  Really, how much skill does it take to talk out of both sides of your mouth like most politicians do?  To quote James Carville (Clinton's attack dog), "It's the economy, stupid."  If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.

      It's not hard to be Teflon if one provides bread and circuses.  If Hitler had not opened a second front and had focused a little more on atomic science, we would have had a Teflon fuehrer.  Getting through/around political trouble is not a measure of skill; it's a measure of the citizenry's contentment.  That said, the American citizenry seem very content.  As long as this doesn't change, a president can do whatever he or she wants.

It has already started this morning with Lieberman calling out Dean on Meet the Press concerning the course of action Dean wanted to take with regards to Iraq.  Does anyone else that Bush is starting to resemble Reagan with his ability to get through/around political trouble?  Remember the Teflon President?  I'm asking whether you agree with either's politics, as I know most of you don't.  Just whether you see any similarity.

      Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

      All I've got to say is this: Bush is a fucking moron!  He has just claimed Iraq as property of the US.

      Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post "war" efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target "audience" - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.

      Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.

      Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.

      Yesterday (or Tuesday), Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination.  What caught my attention was the press reporting of it.  They said that Al Gore was a centrist Democrat and that Dean was much further left of him.  Do you agree with this?  If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.  But most importantly for the internet, because we all know that Al Gore invented the internet.

      Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.

      Hmm.  I did not consider the multiple images of Neo to be the previous One.  I considered that they were merely images of what reaction the Matirx/Architect determined to be likely responses from Neo.

      Note that in the monitors, the previous Neos all look the same.  Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.

       The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.

      Two cents:  I think the machines kept Neo alive for fear that if he died, another One would appear and the cycle would repeat.  Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.

      I watched for twenty minutes, was wildly unentertained and turned it off.  Seemed like change for the sake of change.  I mentioned to Angie, I've always felt that if we don't like someone because they're unlikeable, the script is good; if we don't like someone because we're supposed to not like them, the script is bad.  A lot of "this one's supposed to be evil;" "this one's supposed to be good;" "oh, now, this one's supposed to be a rascal, look out."  I might try again some random day when it reruns.  Lower expectations might help on a second attempt.

      If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?

      What is your take on environmental issues vs. airports?  When engineering, do you design entirely in favor of the client (the owners, I assume), or do you recommend middle ground?  My dad was an engineer who sold the chemicals used to make circuit boards, but was always aware of their environmental impact, even though he had little control over the product (beyond understanding and explaining the ways how his product would be more safe than a competitor's in this instance or that, if the customer asked).

      If the [government] can misrepresent something relatively simple, [like Iraq's WMDs or its links to 9-11], how much [does it] get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Not presenting the truth, in my opinion, is the same as [lying in running a government].  It's unlikely that anyone who has entered the public forum can be taken wholly at face value.

      This is why I don't trust the press to be fair in their reporting.  At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.

      Greetings from Zagreb!  Thought it would be fun to post from a little further away than usual.  I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.  The home page of the PC in my hotel is a hardcore porn site, which maybe isn't surprising for a Catholic country still in the throes of post-Communist freedom.  Nick

I don't think so, he was caught up in the excitement of the crowd.  Give the guy a break.  He just saw his big lead disappear in a very short period of time and was pretty disappointed.

      Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that "the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft".   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, "bouncing" several times before coming to a stop, and "deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases."   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the "other-worldly" nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of "an obvious government cover-up," pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. "I seen it with my own 5 eyes" claimed Rhodo last week. "I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come."   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming "Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars."

      I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the "let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process" act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little "gotcha" moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.

      Oh, and one more thing...I don't know about emotionally traumatic experiences, but I know from experience that  physically  traumatic experiences can alter your chemistry.  Since the breast reduction, I put weight on different areas of my body than I did before.  Also, doctors have attributed the triggering of fibro to severe physical trauma.  With me, it was most likely the breaking of bones and the whiplash-inducing car accidents I had near the onset of puberty.

      God, I don't read the blog for a couple of days, and suddenly you guys are all prolific on my ass...  1)  I'm for Dean, because as a disabled person, his views on healthcare reform are compelling to me.  2)  I adored "Lost in Translation" for the same reasons Johnathan did, and a few others.  One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my "Rainbow Brite" LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've "outgrown," so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.  Much pain now.  Me go bed.  6)  Oh, and I love Johnathan!

      That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.

      I did not come up with this.  I've seen it before with different people as the subject, but here goes.  With all your honor and dignity what would you do?  This test only has one question, but it's a very important one. Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.   The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.   Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods ....... There are huge masses of water everywhere.... You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos.  There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.   Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's George W. Bush!  At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away...forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo. A unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.   And here's the question: (Please give an honest answer)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Would you select colour film, or go with the simplicity of classic black and white?

      My taste changes over time as well, though the recognition of objective quality (as I define it) remains constant.  It's probably more accurate to say what I "like" changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.  If they happen rapidly for you, perhaps it is as I initially proposed -- that your relationship with art is largely, if not exclusively, personal and emotional.  In the context of this post, the heart changes more frequently than the mind.

      johnathan - that's an interesting thought.   i had a weird thing happen to me this year, in terms of movies i like: i used to love the purple rose of cairo.  i watched it about 4 months ago and i thought it was one of the most contrived pieces of crap that i'd ever seen - what happened? can a person's taste change that much over the course of a few years?

There is nothing wrong with mass market films (baaa).  I want to go see RotK, but Julie has no desire to, and has not even seen TT yet, so she would be lost anyway (baaa).  Sorry, all this political discussion has me responding loke a politician and not answering your question (baaa).  BTW, who is this?  Johnathan or Mir?

      Miriam -- From my observation of your reactions to movies and music over the years, I think it's safe to say that content is the key for you.  If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.

      i have a question about movies. i didn't really like "lost in translation" or "american splendor" i've heard really good reviews but they didn't move me or change me or even really entertain me that much.  i have to say my favorite films of last year were in order: 1. return of the king 2. pirates of the carribean 3. terminator 3 and yes, that is kinda embarrassing to admit.  while i enjoy action/adventure films, and i realize that return of the king is more than that, it isn't normally my entire list.  i don't usually even enjoy mass-market films - so my question to anyone with an opinion about this is: why did you like lost in translation?  what was good about bill murray's performance?  -  why did you like american splendor?

      Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the "Selected, not Elected" mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the "math error" that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the "working class" that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?

      I just found a strange contraption called Beagle II on my roof.  Should I tell someone?  About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  "This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA."   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?   urlLink Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.  Hope you're all well.

      I've been for Kerry from the beginning.  I think my current state of unemployment is (for now) my own strategic choice.  I think venturing from this planet is the only thing of value that our species can do.  I remain conflicted about the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  I miss Buffy, though I realize the show had nowhere else to go.  "Lost in Translation" remains my favorite film of last year.  I am excited about the semester beginning today, though I wish I had more time for gaming.  "Comfort" on the 200(?) block of Broad is a fantastic restaurant.  And I love Angie!

      Wow.  What happened to Dean?  I guess his angry-all-the-time approach did not resonate well with Iowans.  I'm actually most scared of Edwards at this point.  He is young, energetic, and charismatic - traits similar to JFK and Clinton(shudder).  It is too early for me to get into analyzing their politics since they will change 100 times between now and the convention.  Who is the favorite amongst my Bush hating friends?

      Ben - I wasn't referring to her physical whereabouts.  I knew that she had been at FSU at some point recently.  I was merely referring to her presence on the blog (and in the e-mail ring prior to that) and therefore seeing my previous comments on the 2000 election.  As for the political differences, I guess I have never really felt that I have seen your opinions.  I have seen the links you post on the political issues, but I don't take that as necessarily that you agree 100% with them.  Much like if I was to post a link to the Weekly Standard or New Republic or whatever one of the conservative rags are, I doubt you would find that I agree with it 100%.  It also sounds like you feel like I did from the moment Clinton took office and declared me, a fresh college graduate making $29,000 a year to be rich.  From that moment on, I wanted that man out of office and would strongly argue against anything he said.  Miriam - I can't respond to most of your post without seriously offending some people personally, and I do not want to that.  Argue and attack the points, not the poster, so I won't.  The economy is a cyclical thing.  We had about 10 years of positive growth from the early 80's to early 90's, then a recession, then about 6-7 years of positive growth from 93-94 to early 2000.  It will happen again.

      john -  just on this point, i think we are no where near having a fully recovered economy, which of course, does not mean 0% unemployment, but it does mean that well-paying professional jobs are available for those who have the skills and education to acquire them.   eva - undergrad biology - unemployed.  ben - underemployed.  me - ba - contract work.   etc. etc. etc. - yes, we could all go out today and get a minumum wage job and barely scrape by and pay most of our bills.  but is that the american dream now?  get your education, work hard, and then stay around the poverty line due to a stalled economy?   what happened to all of the perks of full time employment?

      "The space program is bullshit." - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  "...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed..." - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have "Now Hiring" signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  "...our economy has continuously gone downhill ..." - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its "correction" (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  "...Bush stole the presidency..." - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  "...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt." - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  "He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. "  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.

      The space program is bullshit.  It might be a fun and cool distraction from the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed, our economy has continuously gone downhill since Bush stole the presidency, and that we are in the middle of a big screw up in Iraq, but it is a poorly thought out, and expesive, publicity stunt.  Go USA!  Since we have so few problems, let's spend time and money on messing up another planet.  The thing that I find the funniest is the way Bush plans to fund it.  He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs.   In other news, I need everyone's address so I can eventually send out wedding invitations.  It's going to be on August 14th.  The ceremony will be at Maymont and the reception will be at my parents' house.  You should all come.  We're going to have lots and lots of booze.  Oh...and if anyone likes doing hard physical labour and has free time, I've got plenty for you!  Just call me and let me know!

      Ben - If that was intended as a response to my question, it failed.  I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.

      MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST "SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY"  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, "They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons."   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that "we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different."  The panel also concluded that "given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space."  The president's focus on space exploration because it "improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit." However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, "Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth."  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, "Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new "international commons" be a key to world power in the future."    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily

      Thanks Mir, I was starting to wonder if I had fallen into an alternate reality where we agreed on things!  I am having fun watch the Democrats tear at each other in Iowa.  Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.

      john, i agree with both of your arguments.   i think raising the cigarette tax is ridiculous - it's exploiting citizens who are addicted to a legal product.  they are simply hoping they can keep raising the price but people will keep coming back for more.  i believe drug dealers use the same tactics.   and i don't think we should be going to the moon or mars.  we have a huge deficit - we're in the middle of a very expensive war - and we have alot of domestic programs which need funding -  so go john!

      When I first heard that President Bush was going to propose going back to the Moon, I will admit that I was extremely skeptical on the reasoning.  We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?

      Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the "legal" packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.

      Congratulations Miriam.  I was a little shocked to see that guy in what appears to be a serious movie.  I guess he is trying to expand beyond "That 70s Show" and "Dude, Where's My Car?"  Ben - Good article.  I did notread 100% of it (got a Cliff Notes version?) , but it reinforced my apprehension about Wal-Mart.  What I did not see it mention was what Wal-Mart has done to the smaller niche businesses.  You know, the ones like a bike shop or small fabric store or even an independent drug store (as versus CVS or Wal-Greens).  Do you recall the huge fight that Ashland put up against the Wal-Mart opening there?  It was very big news when they one, but the victory was only temporary.  The Wal-Mart is now open.  I have not heard how it has affected the small businesses in Ashland.  On the flip side, I am hypocritical for criticizing them.  With one salary and 5 mouths to feed, Julie does 80+% of our shopping at Wal-Mart, in part because of price and because of the convenence of going to one store and getting everything we need.  A recent trip included soap, diapers, an oil filter, and a gallon of milk.  There's not too many stores that have all four of those items

      a quote that john might appreciate: from the village voice: Just before I go to sleep I ask myself, Why not love your fellow man, why not peace on earth? In the morning the sun has risen over the enormous Coral Ridge shopping mall, the biggest in Iowa. And the shoppers from Iowa City and Cedar Rapids are pulling in like ants returning to a hill. I ask myself the same question, Why not peace on earth? And the answer occurs to me immediately—because the other guy wants to rape your women and kill your children.

      the reason i didn't go off about mad cow is because everyone here already knows the risks of eating meat, the opinions that the vegans/vegetarians have, and have already made up their mind.   would i love it if everyone on this blogger became a vegetarian? sure, i would. i would love it if people would just eat meat every 3 days instead of every day. but all i can really do is choose my own actions and hope those actions can help change the minds and hearts of others.

      I am impressed.  It took about a month for one of our vegetarians/vegans to post about Mad Cow.  I would have been spouting off about it the next day.  Then again, I do tend be more rabid then Ben and sometimes Miriam.  As for O'Neill, I am not saying he is lying, or making anything up.  It could all be true.  But, do you really expect him to say nice things about the President who fired him?  I can barely say nice things about the bosses of places where I quit.    Back to my earlier comment about Bush being similar to Reagan (Teflon President), it seems this controversy is already dieing.  Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.  Another similarity is in one of O'Neill's claims of the President being disengaged during Cabinet meetings.  I seem to recall people saying Reagan was a doddering old fool in his Cabinet meetings.

      RTG update:  Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge, the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.  Given the discovery made after the raid on Grieson's heavily protected auction, it is unclear if the party succeeded.  Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.  What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.

      I agree.  I also don't understand how someone's sexual preference can lead to such a drastic measure as to make it a constitutional amendment.  Of course barring pedophilia and rape.  It is like saying guys that are attracted to extremely obese women are morally wrong and we should make a constitutional amendment against such practice.  "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth a nation that will not all the procreation of fat people."  My whole family would be screwed.  Or rather we wouldn't be screwed.  Depending on how you look at it.

      jlg - Barring the religious aspect, I personally believe it comes down to two factors.  Machismo, and comfort.  Ma"cheese"mo - I think some guys are insecure and this is a way for them to be alpha of someone somewhere.  Also, in some cultures, like the Latino culture, it is almost bred into them to be gay haters.  And since that particular culture tends to be heavily Catholic....but we aren't going the religion route.  Comfort - If you are raised to believe that *all* dogs are mean killers.  You live 50 years of your life thinking that every dog you ever see is mean, and wants to kill you (versus nice and wants to kill you ;-p ).  Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.  If you believe that it is "wrong" simply because that is what has been told to you since birth, then it will be hard to accept.

      I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.

      This is not ideology.  This is the Democratic Party trying to find something that will stick when attacking Bush.  Arguing over what happened (or did not happen) 30 years ago is just personal attacks.   The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!  Now if BOTH sides will let that happen, we might get to have civil discussions about our disagreements on the issues (taxes, spending, education, defense, etc.)

      While quite a few pages still appear to be missing from the 1972 chapter of President Bush’s National Guard duty in Texas and Alabama, at least a few of them may have been accounted for on Wednesday -- though not exactly in support of the administration’s case that Bush fulfilled his service obligations. The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bush’s Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   “Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bush’s chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain ‘there’s not anything there that will embarrass the governor.’   “Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bush’s file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.”

      I recommend picking up the bootleg DVDs of the original movies at a con like Shore Leave.  I was quite pleased with Ep4, and will buy the other two this year (should the vendor return).  The only minor quibble is that it pauses briefly at four places where the laser disc has to be turned over...but a small sacrifice to enjoy the movie I actually saw.  For the record, I'll be happy to buy discs for others who provide the cash beforehand.

      I was referring to the behavior of Moderates.  As to for whom I will vote, I'd rather discuss that in another forum.  Voting here on the Blog has little meaning, and results in an endless Tastes Great / Less Filling loop.  Though I am amused at the panic inspired by the possibility that I might vote for Bush.  In fact, the panic was so delighful that now I won't say anything more about it at all, just so I can enjoy the chaos.

      Neither Conservatives nor Liberals need to be stirred up.  As ideologues, they already are.  The only people that need stirring are Moderates.  You're choosing your candidates as if you're worried about getting the readers of The Nation to vote in November.  They're not your problem.  It's those of us in the middle, who hold both extremes suspect.  There's enough discontent among us for either ideology to work with.  We're the only audience that counts.  Sell it to us, or lose.

      seem like good and legitimate questions to me - anyone disagree or agree?  Joe Conason's Journal On Sunday, NBC's Tim Russert is scheduled to interview the president. Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on "Meet the Press." That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, "A Charge to Keep," you wrote: "I continued flying with my unit for the next several years." But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous "mission accomplished" speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on "out-of-control" domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

      Before I get to my question, let me preface this by saying that I am not trying to start an argument or change anyone's mind on this issue, because I know that there is nothing that I can say to do so and there is nothing any of you can say to change my mind.  Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is "safe" to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.

      Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals "ought to have the same rights" (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now "have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay." (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, "During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation."

      INDIANAPOLIS - Prisoners sentenced to life without parole could petition a court for the death penalty under a bill filed by Sen. John Waterman, R-Shelburn.  The bill would allow inmates sentenced to more than 200 years in prison or to life without parole a one-time chance to ask a judge to allow them to die.   urlLink - Bill offers inmates death option    right-to-lifers, assisted suicide, capital punishment... i wonder if as a society we're ever going to get past our collective schizophrenia about the legality of human death; we're all over the map in regards to when it's ok, and when it's not.     mir: adbusters rocks, but you knew that.  and as far as i can tell, god loves and hates everyone unconditionally.  it's universal, effortless, and comes at no extra charge.

       doublethink:  Reality Control. The power to hold two completely contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accept both of them. An excellent example of doublethink in modern society is the  urlLink war on drugs . If you ask people their opinion on alcohol prohibition in the 1920s, most people would agree that it was a complete failure. People agree that it only caused more crime, it made gangsters rich, it corrupted politicians, and most importantly ... it didn't keep people from drinking.  Yet, we have almost the exact same situation today with war on drugs, yet most people think that our modern prohibition is a good idea ... and more than that, they believe that anybody that thinks that the war on drugs isn't a good idea must be completely out of their minds. In order for a person to be effective at doublethink, they must master the art of  crimestop .   crimestop:  (Orwell's definition) "The faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc (the philosophy of the powers that be), and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. In short... protective stupidity."  -from  urlLink the newspeak dictionary

      My take on the whole "saving people" thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is "Christ-like."  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., "the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED."  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of "The Killing Fields," director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.

      I know plenty of Christians that don't try to "save" me, and I, in most cases, think more highly of them and I do of the ones that are trying to "save" me.  Wouldn't it serve you more to target people that might actually want to be in your group rather than those that absolutely don't want to be?  I know they will receive a higher number of virgins in the kingdom of god if they convert a true nonbeliever, but at what point do you cross the line from being zealous to being a public nuisance?!

      your faith in the chair is based on past experiences of sitting in a chair and it not falling apart.  if you were to be concerned every time this event occurred, you would have serious issues.  what these ladies were suggesting you have is "blind" faith.  faith in something even though you have no evidence to support it - no previous experiences to draw from.  what you could assume, if it would make you less angry, is that these women believe with all of their heart, that their goal in life is to save you and if they don't, you will be suffering eternal torment.  hard for them to deal with, i'm sure.  they are just doing what they think is best.  i don't mind the proselytizers - as long as they don't try to change the laws of our secular government.

      On a side note about "faith"...  This past weekend, two ladies came to my door.  After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, "Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?".  My response was a prompt but polite "No.".  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that "there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell".  And their response was, "but you have to have faith in that, right?"  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word "faith" as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.

      ...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film "historically accurate", but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places "really looked", which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling "the greatest story ever told"?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.

      For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant.  What matters to me are the words and the act(s).  My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more "gritty" and "violent."  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate "veracity" with "truth," as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the "real Jesus," the "real Muhammed," the "real Whoever" -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.

      I'm mixed on this aspect of the film.  While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.

      It is quite likely that Jesus was a "white guy".  Now he probably didn't look like he was from Sweden, but rather he looked more like a modern day Middle Easterner.  Like Iraqis, Pakistanis, Israelis, etc.  And yes, they are considered Caucasians.  As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.  Now I find that almost impossible to believe that back then being that close to Africa that not a single black person was present in that city during that time.

      WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.   also:  urlLink Sept. 11 Could Not Have Been Prevented Without Accruing A Lot Of Overtime , by Condoleezza Rice

The source said he had seen Larry "in her bondage room...lying there in a dress, no panties and a blond wig."  Several "longtime friends" say Larry - who is in the middle of a divorce with his wife, Thea Bloom - is now ready for the operation, reports the Chicago Sun Times.

      Absolutely not.  Just that before we go making radical changes, that in this case seem more aimed at punishing succesful countries than remedying what may be happening, we should analyze things in a little bit more detail.  There are scientists that say global warming is happening and that we are to blame.  There are scientists saying that global warming is complete bunk.  There are scientists that say global warming may be happening but that it is part of the climatic cycle of this planet.

      for those interested in the machinations and startling power of the world's most popular search engine:  urlLink The nature of meaning in the age of Google   excerpts:   "I recently went to Silicon Valley to visit the offices of Google, the world's most popular search engine. It is a mind-bending experience. You can actually sit in front of a monitor and watch a sample of everything that everyone in the world is searching for. (Hint: sex, God, jobs and, oh my word, professional wrestling usually top the lists.)... In the past three years, Google has gone from processing 100 million searches per day to over 200 million searches per day. And get this: only one-third come from inside the U.S. The rest are in 88 other languages..."  "Search engines are constantly adding and removing pages, as well as altering the algorithms they use to rank pages. However, there's a great obsession with Google because of the large amounts of traffic it can deliver. Of the four most popular search engines—Google, Yahoo, AOL and MSN Search—Google's results are used at the first three..."  "Google's continued success depends on its ability to collect unaffected Web content, which means that it must avoid the single individual's assertion of meaning. This strategy implies that any metadata scheme for the Web that promotes the meaning assertion of a single Web author (i.e., My Web page means this) will be avoided by aggregators. The strategy of aggregation, the enlistment of Web authors as lay indexers, and the temptation of bad faith points to the importance of maintaining the ignorance of lay indexers."

      when i read things like this i don't know whether to laugh or cry: Ga. school evolution debate goes to trial    April 6, 2004  |  ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a school district's practice of posting disclaimers inside science textbooks saying evolution is "a theory, not a fact."   The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     "We're very excited about this," said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: "This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered."   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   "Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives," Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.

      I found some interesting tidbits while researching the election stuff.  Does anyone have a guess when the last time Virginia voted for a Democrat was?  It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.

      For the record, I went back and checked the official FEC results of the 2000 election.  If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for "None of these candidates" 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.

       No-Makeup Look Easier To Achieve Than Elle Claims   NEW YORK—Contrary to claims in the June issue of Elle magazine, the no-makeup look actually requires little effort, a licensed cosmetologist reported Monday.   "The article '20 Minutes To A More Natural You' suggests an application of under-eye concealer, light powder, natural lip gloss, and clear mascara to achieve the makeup-free look," said Michelle Karns-Daley, spokeswoman for the American Association of Cosmetology. "But really, a quick shower and a towel-off will do the trick just as well."   Similarly, experts say Elle's six-page article "Building Your Self-Esteem" can be more simply stated as "Stop giving a shit about what other people think."     Awkward Encounter Not Awkward At All When Masturbated About   OLYMPIA, WA—An uncomfortable exchange between Brad Leydner, 25, and Ginny, the cute redheaded waitress at Hugo's Bistro, lost all awkwardness when envisioned in Leydner's masturbation fantasy later that afternoon.   "So, would you like to grab a coffee after your shift?" a nervous Leydner asked Ginny in both the real and imagined scenarios Monday. "Oh, Brad, I can't wait four hours to see you. You should fuck me hard, right in this booth," replied the Dream Ginny moments before Leydner achieved orgasm.   In the fantasy scenario, Ginny did not hide in the kitchen to avoid speaking to Leydner while he paid for his meal.

      sad but true, john; he passed away on the morning of johnathan and angie's wedding day.  a terrible shame - angie had just contacted the theatre group he's involved with, in an attempt to get him and Jason Carter to come to VCU.  the wheel turns on...    From: Jms at B5 (jmsatb5@aol.com)   creator of Babylon 5, for those not in the know   Subject: Today We Lost Richard Biggs  Newsgroups:   urlLink rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated   Date: 2004-05-22 16:43:06 PST      I was awakened today with several phone calls from cast members and Doug to pass along the terrible news that this morning, Richard Biggs passed away.    We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.  We may try to have some kind of fund raiser to help give whatever assistance may be helpful for his kids.  We all miss him terribly.   jms     UPDATE: here's the  urlLink CNN  article concerning his passing.

Referring to his Feb. 5, 2003 appearance before the U.N.’s Security Council, when he argued that Iraq had or was close to developing WMD, including biological weapons, Powell told Russert the information he offered was not only wrong, but that in some cases the intelligence cited by the administration had been purposefully misleading.   "It turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and, in some cases, deliberately misleading," Powell said. "And for that, I am disappointed and I regret it."

      tom delay is a sick fuck who should be removed from office: ``I saw cruel, sadistic torture,'' said Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., who added that some of the images were of male prisoners masturbating. She said she saw a man hitting himself against a wall as though to knock himself unconscious.    Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said he did not see acts of violence, but what appeared to be ``results of acts of violence.''    He said he saw people in body bags and a person with a face ``virtually gone.'' He saw ``people being stitched up above the eyebrow apparently unconscious.''    Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said, ``There were people who were forced to have sex with each other.''    Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said, ``There were some pictures where it looked like a prisoner was sodomizing himself'' with an object. He said blood was visible in the photograph.    But House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said he thought ``some people are overreacting.''    ``The people who are against the war are using this to their political ends,'' he said.

      I was reading a book full of odd trivia the other day.  In it was a list of original movie endings versus what was released in the film.  The one that blew me away was "Blade Runner".  According to this book, which supposedly got its info from the producer or director (sorry, I never can keep who does what, but that is a different topic),  Decker is replicant in both the released version and the original version.  Where the hell did that come from?  I have seen the movie at least a half dozen times, but have never thought that.  Am I just way out in la-la land? [avoid the temptation on that one Mir  ;) ]  Did I miss something?

      is do we want religion as a part of secular society?  me - i personally don't.  i think religion belongs in churches and in the home and not in the public forum. and i believe this simply because we are a country of diversity - you can believe whatever you want here so there's no way you can generalize religion enough so it appeals to everyone. but do i hate the richmond "unity" tree.  damn right i do.  it's stupid not to call it a christmas tree.  what, were we just suddenly inspired to put up a tree in december to represent our city unity?  sheesh.  at least call it the "winter tree"  or the "holiday tree" or something.

      I would just as soon that the issue go away, but it won't.  So, the court just ducked an issue that will be back.  Why not just rule on it and get it over with?  Now, I heard someone speculate that the reason they kicked it back was to smack the 9th Circuit on the hand for letting it get this far "improperly".  I don't buy that.  I was surprised when I saw the breakdown of the votes.  I assumed that Scalia and Thomas would have been on the side of not hearing it (for fear of losing the case), but they (and someone else) basically said the case was without merit.

      From Ebert....  "Films like "The Chronicles of Riddick" gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think "Riddick" will make as many converts as "The Matrix." In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on "an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life." I observed that "LOTR" fans should "get a life." I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe "LOTR" has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing "The Chronicles of Riddick," I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on "Riddick," in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate."

      the whole article:  urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23373-2004Jun7.html   Memo Offered Justification for Use of Torture  Justice Dept. Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad "may be justified," and that international laws against torture "may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations" conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, "he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network," said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on "necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability" later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, "must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death."   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled "Intelligence Interrogations," sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   "It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke," said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. "It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations."   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, "The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions."

       my good friend john robinson asked me an excellent question about a month ago, on the road to ohio: 'ben, are you voting  for  john kerry, or just  against  george bush?'  i replied, 'i'm voting against bush.  i don't know kerry, but i know bush.'   john, thank you for that question; but i've changed my mind as of last night.  i'm voting  for  kerry, now, and have volunteered to work for his campaign here in virginia.    We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up "Stars and Stripes Forever."  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey – a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals – and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war – a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves – and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation – here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom – on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot – for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return – for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us – for all of you – with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans – Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead – and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me – but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities – and I do – because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn’t make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system – so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: "I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent."  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops – not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives – and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation – to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away – they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: "Honor thy father and thy mother."  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all – so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air – and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself – and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong – in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field – because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life – when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor – and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected – it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation – not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America – red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground – so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do – and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream – so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other – and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President – an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com

      from the new republic, july 8 [as previously blogged]:  ... a third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must." What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July" - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.   what happens today?  "Security forces have captured a high-level al Qaeda operative in a raid in central Pakistan, Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said."  judge for yourself.

       &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost" and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.   PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTING IN 2004.

      John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.

      Johnathan - On the healthcare issue, assuming that the two are mutually exclusive (and I certainly do not believe that are and hope they are not), which would you prefer to have - high quality or affordable healthcare?  As for absolutes, I think you (collective) have to have them to make decisions.  You either think something is right or wrong.  You believe something or you don't.  You think something is true or false.  I would bet that you (Johnathan) have more absolutes than realize, and that they help you form your outlook on life and opinion of things.  I think a strong leader has to see the world in absolutes, or else they are not strong.  Whether you agree with that leader is a reflection of your personal absolutes and how they compare with his (or hers).

      I will vote for the candidate who will bring my country closer to providing affordable health care for my wife.  As a secondary value, I am unable to accept an individual, group, or nation striking first in any scenario.  On these I am currently unbendable, though I willingly acknowledge the danger of absolutes.  I am at peace with the paradox.

      Luc -- People vote for the individual who will most likely represent what they value.  If it is impossible to imagine someone who might legitimately value a different thing than you, then most likely you perceive a universe of absolutes.  Thus, in a matter of speaking, you are a believer.  Which brings us back to your previous posting, which compared a believer to one who is drunk.  So perhaps you cannot fathom someone voting for Bush because you're drunk.

      I will ask you the similar question.  Why would anyone vote  for  John Kerry?  I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to "cool down the economy" (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the "legalize pot" argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the "Two Americas", considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.

       concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  "The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections."  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, "no timetable[s]" were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  "The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections."  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must."

Mainz - "Between January and May of this year we've registered 107 children, during 19 visits in 6 different detention locations" the representative of the International Red Cross, Florian Westphal, told the TV station SWR's Magazine "Report Mainz".

      Lots to talk about today --  Do you serve red wine or white wine with   urlLink murdered relative served to unwitting wedding guests  ?   Can you say "spin"? The   urlLink AP reports   that one of the authors of the anti-Kerry book, "Unfit for Command," posted comments on a conservative Web site calling Muslims and Catholics pedophiles and describing Pope John Paul II as "senile." So how does   urlLink The Drudge Report   characterize it? With the headline "KERRY CAMP CONDEMNS AUTHOR AS 'HATEMONGER', 'BIGOT'"  This morning while driving to work, I listen to WRVA and hear conservative talk-show host   urlLink Glenn Beck   talking about how Al Qaeda is plotting a "major assassination attempt" aimed at getting President Bush out of office, but the assassination attempt won't be against Bush (Hmmmm ...) and it will coincide with another taped statement from Bin Laden. Then the Drudge Report shows up with the exact same report. CNN, AP, etc., don't seem to be carrying this news yet but the conservative outlets are. It's almost as if someone wanted them to report this ...

       USA TODAY:    urlLink Facts disputing the Anti-Kerry Swift Vets group     "Louis Letson, a doctor who says he treated Kerry ... says Kerry didn't deserve his first Purple Heart because he "inadvertently wounded himself" and "there was no hostile fire." Medical records, however, note that Kerry was treated for shrapnel by J.C. Carreon, not Letson. Bill Zaladonis, who was on Kerry's boat at the time, says the men believed they were shooting at Viet Cong. FactCheck.org, a non-partisan group that monitors political ads, says Letson's story is "based on hearsay, and disputed hearsay at that." It concludes, "There is reason to doubt" the Swift Boat Veterans' ad because of its funding and because of the discrepancies in memory between Kerry's defenders and attackers."

      ...to convince me that he's a clueless dunce.  His  urlLink response  when asked what he thought of the final report from the 9/11 commission:   "It reads like a mystery, a novel. It's well written,"  Bush told The Associated Press in a brief interview just outside his home in Crawford. Asked what he was gleaning from the report, he said, "I'm gleaning that was a well-thought-out plot by the enemy."  yeah, is suppose it did, george.  i'm sure it was chock full of twist and turns and surprises for you concerning the events that led up to the september attacks of 2001.  must have something to do with you being on vacation for over 40% of that time period, rather than GOING TO WORK AND DOING YOUR FUCKING JOB.  and i don't want to hear any whiny, tit-for-tat crap about how Clinton should have done a better job in regards to terrorism.  HE'S NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE.  bush IS.  bush is responsible for what happened on his watch.  if he'd focused on terrorism and al-quaeda  at least  as much as his predecessor (or at all, for that matter), and the september attacks had happened anyway, maybe i would've cut him some slack.    but we'll never know, and i find his performance on this issue completely unsatisfactory.  anyone who doesn't (no matter what else we may disagree on regarding bush) is maintaining a interpretation of the facts that apparently my tiny brain can simply not manage.  or you're simply biased; whichever.

      a serious  urlLink security bungle  on the part of the US; "outing" a mole within al quaeda.  this person is a computer expert who was working with the Pakistani government, providing valuable intel for them concerning the members and movements of al quaeda.   this is the "high visibility terrorist", an individual named Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, whose capture in early july was not reported until the last day of the DNC; the information gained from him was part of the Bush admin's reasoning for last week's 'orange level' alert, but the timing was regrettable for several reasons...  from the article:  "Security experts contacted by Reuters said they were shocked by the revelations that the source whose information led to the alert was identified within days, and that U.S. officials had confirmed his name.   "The whole thing smacks of either incompetence or worse," said Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes for Jane's Defense publications. "You have to ask: what are they doing compromising a deep mole within al Qaeda, when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?   "It goes against all the rules of counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, running agents and so forth. It's not exactly cloak and dagger undercover work if it's on the front pages every time there's a development, is it?"  you can read the rest of the article  urlLink here .   oh, and the prime minister of Iraq has  urlLink shut down  Al-Jazeera in Baghdad.

      But is there a cure? From an honest-to-god, real, not-from-The-Onion   urlLink Philadelphia Inquirer article   about how the GOP are pursuing the all-important Amish vote:  "We hate that abortion issue," said Sam Stolztfus, 60, an Amish farmer and gazebo maker in Lancaster County, where an estimated 27,000 Amish live. "We're totally against it. And as far as gay issues, that's completely contrary to the Bible."  The bearded Stolztfus proudly says the Amish are "sort of swept up with Bush fever."  Democrats have all but ceded the Amish vote to Republicans.  "If I know Republicans and their grass-roots operations, they'll spend most of their time trying to phone bank the Amish," said Kerry spokesman Mark Nevins.

      'It has been months since the now-infamous  urlLink photographs  from Abu Ghraib revealed that American soldiers tortured Iraqi prisoners - yet the Bush administration has failed to get to the bottom of the abuses. "There are some serious unanswered questions," says Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon is stalling on several investigations, and congressional inquiries have ground to a halt. The foot-dragging is astonishing, given that Congress has access to classified documents detailing the abuses outlined by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in his report on Abu Ghraib. Rolling Stone obtained those files in June and offers this report on their contents.  The new classified military documents offer a chilling picture of what happened at Abu Ghraib - including detailed reports that U.S. troops and translators sodomized and raped Iraqi prisoners. The secret files - 106 "annexes" that the Defense Department withheld from the Taguba report last spring - include nearly 6,000 pages of internal Army memos and e-mails, reports on prison riots and escapes, and sworn statements by soldiers, officers, private contractors and detainees. The files depict a prison in complete chaos. Prisoners were fed bug-infested food and forced to live in squalid conditions; detainees and U.S. soldiers alike were killed and wounded in nightly mortar attacks; and loyalists of Saddam Hussein served as guards in the facility, apparently smuggling weapons to prisoners inside.'   read the rest of the article  urlLink here .  i'd warn you in advance about the graphic content, but it should hardly surprise anyone at this point.

      same feed from before, but this one was much easier to confirm; it's a far cry from her  urlLink point of view  just four years ago...    urlLink  Nancy Reagan to Bush: 'We Don't Support Your Re-Election'    The widow of former President, and Republican icon, Ronald Reagan has told the GOP she wants nothing to do with their upcoming national convention or the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the President’s re-election effort.  “Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bush’s re-election and neither to most members of the President’s family,” says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans’ split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimer’s, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  There’s more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagan’s funeral, the former First Lady “went ballistic” when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagan’s photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article  urlLink here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

      i'm still running this story down, to find out if there's truth to it (yes, i recognize that the feed is quite biased).  as it is, it sounds more like a mean-spirited 'Onion' article than anything else; but then, these are strange days.  if anyone finds something solid one way or another, please comment immediately!    urlLink  Sullen, Depressed President Retreats Into Private, Paranoid World    A sullen President George W. Bush is withdrawing more and more from aides and senior staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome.  Cabinet officials, senior White House aides and leaders on Capitol Hill complain privately about the increasing lack of 'face time' with the President and campaign advisors are worried the depressed President may not be up to the rigors of a tough re-election campaign.  'Yes, there are concerns,' a top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday. 'The George W. Bush we see today is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful and withdrawn.'  Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House physician Col. Richard J. Tubb to put the President on powerful anti-depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay, but White House insiders say the strong, prescription medications seem to increase Bush's sullen behavior towards those around him.  'This is a President known for his ability to charm people one-on-one,' says a staff member to House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert. 'Not any more.'   read the rest of this frightening article  urlLink here .
