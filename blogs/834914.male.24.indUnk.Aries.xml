       urlLink Nvidia  has released new Detonator 4.0 Drivers that they claim will increase preformance up to 25%.  However, upon installation a few games I own, namly Freedom Force, was unplayable with the new drivers, and I was forced to revert back to the old ones.  Not sure if this is Nvidia or  urlLink Electronic Arts  but consider yourself warned!!  **NOTE** Detonator 4.0 are beta drivers, so Nvidia offers little or no support.  Download them  urlLink here

      Netfirms is being really difficult today, so get used to pressing F5 to reload the page that was not found.  I may need to start looking for a new host, I'm too cheap to pay, and frankly it doesn't make sense since we have what??  9 Members?    Anyway, feel free to e-mail me  urlLink swordfish_n0x@msn.com  or post in Development Ideas on the board, if you have any idea for free hosts that are more stable than netfirms.

      Welcome to Online Gaming Squared.  As of today, we will be launching this page as a new page, for the OLG2 team to post basically whatever we feel will intrest our readers.  It may not intrest you all, it may intrest everyone...  I'd like to ask that you stop by here every now and then, and see whats up.  Post on the forums if there is specific news you think should make headlines.

        Three Time, Three Time, Three Times!!!!    Since his first win, no one has been able to " Squish the Fish " as Sw0rdfish once again took home top prize for the third consecutive race, and his 5th straight top three finish!  Nearly matching his personal best of 33.34 (attained but a mere 5 days ago) Sw0rdfish posted a strong 33.42, 33.44, 33.44, 33.60, 33.70 with all but the last being faster then second place Dark Phoenix, who himself rose from the bottom, to gain his first ever podium finish at second with a time of 33.60.  " I feel so freed " he was heard saying as he left the track  With the return of the Monkey, came the return of the podium, taking a strong third at a time of 33.70.  Stu was nowhere to be seen today, as he failed to crack the top 3 or to break the 34.00 second mark.  Since joining the league Sw0rdish has been on a tear, winning 3/5 placing in 4/5 and simply loving it.  " I can't think of anything better then driving around the track with these great guys, well.... except running around the parking lot gloating afterwards! "  October the 10th @ 10:15PM is the next race for the YGKL... BE THERE!

       Coldplay rocks the ACC   In one of the best live performances I have EVER seen,  urlLink Coldplay  took the stage tonight at the Air Canada Center.  The energy that this band brings to the stage is outstanding, and gets the entire building up and excited.  The band plays with 150% heart, and nothing less.  They put so much emotion into each and every song, and they are happier to be there, then most of the crowd.  I've never left a concert thinking...  "Man, that was the best 50 bucks I have spent... EVER"  until tonight.  If your a fan of their music, then you know what I mean when I saw they put as much passion into the songs live, as they do recorded, and if your not a fan, I strongly erge you to pick up the album  A Rush of Blood to the Head  and give it a spin in the old CD player, you will not be disappointed.  I'm curious as to what happened when mid way thru a song, they stopped it, and Chris Martin jumped down off the stage to get involved in some altercation between some fans and security.  All I saw from my 24th row seat was a bunch of badges being flashed, and someone being pushed around.  If you see anything about that, post it on my boards.  Cheers all, and thank you Coldplay

      I'd like to point out, that Stu and I both used car number 15 last night, on his 13th Lap he scored a time of 34.18 ( his car was warm, and ready.....) Later that night, I climbed into the same UN-TOUCHED car, and recoreded a time of 33.72.  Stu may have won the first race last night, but his bragging has raised a crosshair to his back!!!  Be Affraid, Mr. Gautz

       Rookie Shines as Boost Monkey Continues His Tear!!   After only 2 weeks on the circuit, and 60 Laps total driven, Sw0rdFish overcame his car choosing troubles, to run a new personal best of  33.72  second only to Boost Monkey and his  33.62 ... Sw0rdFish's rise coming only weeks into his career start surprised even the League's Creator, Stu Gaugtz..   "I didn't know how fast he actually was!!!"   For all the info on SRL, go to the OLG2 urlLink  Racing Forum .  Drivers be sure to post your bios. Increased intrest may lead to more in depth record keeping.

      Taken from  urlLink TSN.CA   MONTREAL (CP) - Paul Tracy and Patrick Carpentier are close to signing deals with Player's Forsythe that would create an all-Canadian three-car team in CART racing next season, a spokesman said Tuesday.  This would be the best thing to happen for Canada as far as CART goes, it's sad to lose the Player's team, who will have to cease sponsorship thanks to Canadian Anti-Tabaco laws following the 2003 season.  However Mr. Forseythe, the team owner, assured the drivers they would have a car to drive in in the 2004 season, possible sponsor lined up for the next all-canadian team?  Talk about it  urlLink here!

       Dark Phoenix takes the checkers   It's my personal opinion that Stu's Power Rankings are so full of it, that you gotta be carefull where you step, least you get shit on your shoes, but thats just me.  I don't have much to comment on this day, since I missed the race due to a soar lower back flexor (just made that flexor part to sound professional) and I'm hoping to be back in the seat again next week.  As for comments, hit OLG2 forums, and check it out.  Stay tuned!

       Streak Ends.  Professor Out of Retirement to Take Checkers  YGKL hit a record high 10 competitors tonight, making car selection CRUCIAL....  and once again Car 15 holds top spot, but with a new driver.      DRIVER    CAR #    AVERAGE TOP 5      The Professor  15  33.81    Talon Boy  11  34.01    Uzo  8  34.12    Brent  4  34.16    Guy in The Jetta!!  9  34.32     Sw0rdfish  12  34.57    Dark Phoenix  14  34.97    Russian Rocket (Alex)  13  35.98    Stu Gautz  7  37.15    Boost Monkey  5  37.51     Next Race is Monday October 21st @ 8:00PM  As far as standings are conserned, it's clear that tonight's race makes it unfair to the last drivers, and thus more work needs to be done to equalise the field, rather than luck dicating more than 50% of the final outcome.  Stu is clearly not 3 seconds slower than Prof.   Stay tuned to the official YGKL Blog for details soon.

        Gaming Goodness is Mobile!       urlLink HomeLanFed  today posted a pretty good review of the  urlLink Alienware  Area-51M Gaming Laptop, and I must say, I creamed myself looking at this.  P-IV 3.08GHz, ATI Radeon  9000 , and not to mention the glowing Green colour of the unit, an Alienware trademark so to speak.  I wonder if I could buy one...  I created a well-rounded gamers version by using Alienware's customising options.  My Quote ID is santiar@sympatico.ca-315686 so feel free to have a look at what I've created, along with the near 3G USD price tag.  I'll have 3 please!!!    urlLink Read HomeLanFed's review here.   Why does Alienware send them one to test... and not me? Nationalism!!  It's because I'm Canadian!  In other news, I kept my Night Guard in all night last night.  Figures after I bitch about it, it stays in, I think maybe the dentists of the world read my post, and sent their little elves, that they borrowed form the shoemaker (Naturally), and had them hold the night guard in place.  ** Bows ** Thus ends my comedy career.  So what else happened today?  Habs lost, leafs won ( Pleh ), Raptors finally ended that horrible slump in a great game in Boston, and I actually enjoyed watching more than just the finally 34 seconds.    And like a sign from above, Outlook tells me, I have mail! Thanks to Patrick for this link... urlLink Dear Penis.   As if the title wasn't enough, not suitable for work.  Swordfish accepts NO responsibility if you are fired, suspended, or jailed (If you hail from China) for watching this.  Flash 5 needed   Ok, I'm going to get a coffee, and see if I can hack into these Fragapalooza servers and show them how lucky they are that I'm poor!  ~SwordFish~

      Ok... I'm convinced that the only reason dentists exist, is to empty our pockets.  I was told that I grind my teeth when I'm sleeping, and if I didn't get a night guard ASAP, I'd be looking at 4 root canals across my front teeth.  Naturally I think to myself,  ”Self…. You NEED this thing, root canals are  NOT  fun.”   So I go out, and blow the 300 bucks for this so called  Night Guard  and every morning when I wake up, the fucking thing is lying on the floor.  How in the name of shit, am I supposed to keep this thing in my mouth, while I’m sleeping!  Do I need to set my alarm to go off every 3 hours to make sure it’s still in place?  I don’t think so.  Anyway, gaming right?  Holy shit, I went to my dad’s office today, to let in my cousin for a meeting he had, and what do I see lying on the table?  MAFIA!!  What the hell?  I still haven’t talked to my dad, but I can NOT see him playing this game!  Stay tuned for the review™.  I promise it will be better than my UT2K3 one.   Note:  Incase you missed it Stu, Lions 12 Pats 20… Your lions are AWEFUL!  Note2:  Happy Turkey Day USA

      Another Link....  An Important one to remember...   urlLink Relax...It's Just a Game   On the topic of hockey... What the hell is it with the NHL giving penatlies to players for incidental contact with the goalie?  Tonight, in the Ottawa / Islanders game, Lalime came roaring about 15 feet out of the net, and a player, who didn't really see Lalime, reached for the puck, and ran over the goalie, who put himself in the way...  And the player got the penalty!!  What the hell, are they not men??  If your gonna leave the net, prepare to get squished..wimps!

      So I was thinking...  What the hell should I post today?  At first I was going to go on about how we spent the day at work playing Blackjack, but I quickly realised that you can only post so much...   "I got 17, and then Justin got 18, but the dealer... like he got 20... and like, that means I lose"   - Cappiche?  So I'm going by way of the cop-out;   My Favorite Web-Sites   urlLink homelanfed.com  - A great site for video game information, and whats going on in the gaming world.  urlLink videogames.com  - Link to Gamespot.com, more video game stuffs.  Reviews, previews, demos and things!  urlLink slashdot.com  - Well, there isn't much I can say about this.  News for Nerds.  is exactly what it is.  urlLink blogger.com  - This is why your reading this.  Blogger is a Bloggin utility, to do what this site is.  urlLink webmonkey.com  - Computer language tips, secrets and other things that I forget.  urlLink coolerguys.com  - Pimp out your CPU case.  Supe that shit like a rice rocket!  urlLink officepools.com  - Run your office NHL and NFL pools from this site.  20 bucks gets you a league of up to 1,000 teams!  urlLink tsn.ca  - Duh!  The Sports Network.  I give you one guess!  urlLink penny-arcade.com  - All round fucked up stuff.  He's really funny, as long as you don't take stuff personally.  urlLink Pearl Jam Tabs  - Learn to play Pearl Jam Tunes.  urlLink lottolore.com  - Are YOU a millionaire?  Get your lotto results!  So thus ends my easy-way-out post.  Turns out it took longer to post this, rather than think of something creative, maybe funny, and well... that you might actually be intrested in.  So bite me! I just wanted another Superman logo, and something for Mupiel to read!  Who's reading from Montreal??  I noticed a Sherbrooke mask yesterday, and I know it isn't my family.  I wouldn't want them reading this garbage, but who are you!!!!   urlLink Email Me!   Don't forget about my  urlLink message board ,he's feeling neglected (Mostly by his master) feel free to post!  I'm so full of it, time to shut-up!   NOTE:  Don't play " Cut the Deck for the High Card " with Justin, he always wins...I think he cheats..your 200 bucks??  it's in the mail!  NOTE2:   All Links tested, and 100% guaranteed...If one doesn't work, tell  urlLink someone  who cares.  If that works.... I just don't know..  ~Swordfish~

      I rarely enjoy the drive to work, it’s early, it’s cold, and no one knows how to drive!!  However, this morning presented a much different experience.    Traveling east on Bristol rd. I approached the lights at Confederation dr.  Red.  GREAT!!!  So I’m sitting as all the tiny-boppers S-L-O-W-L-Y cross the road, and I notice this particular group of girls, about 16, (your thinking OMG he’s a pedophile…it’s better than that.)  One of the girls is pointing, and screaming at another one, and before they reach the opposite sidewalk, still in front of my car,  BAM  the gloves, purses, mittens, and toques (Eh!) go flying, and it’s Ali vs. Tyson.  They start wailing on each other, like red-necks in a bar fight, and then fall to the ground and continue to rumble.  At this point I did what any gentleman would do… Pulled up the E-Brake, and reached for the popcorn.  I couldn’t believe my eyes; they didn’t even wait till they got to the sidewalk, right in the cross-walk.  A left…a right…another!!  Then the instigator stood up, and started kicking the other while she was down.  “Brilliant” I thought to myself.  She was then pulled away by a third girl who was just standing there in shock with her jaw on the ground, a friend I assume, but only enough to get her onto the sidewalk, then they continued.  At this point, public pressure (the row of cars beeping behind me) I had to continue on, but I’ve been telling the story all day, and if you ask me about it, I’ll be glad to share it again!  I hope they are there again tomorrow, there’s  ALWAYS  a rematch!

      OK..  Unreal Tournament 2K3....  Well what can I say?  It's like walking trough an aquarium, and having your best friend jump out from behind a wall, and blowing your freakin head off - point blank - with a rocket launcher.  It's intense, non-stop action from the second the counter reaches 0, and doesn't stop till the game ends.  I'm throughly enjoying the FPS genre at the moment, between Medal of Honor, BattleField 1942, adn UT2K3, it's more than enought to take up all of my free time when it comes to gaming.    Dodging, Translocating, Wall Jumping, Double Jumping, Sniping, Exploding, and calling in the Nuclear Stirke.  Shooting, Scoring, Exploding, Capturing, and Holding your Position...  All part of UT2K3.  I can't start to explain everything in this game, but this man,  urlLink Munkee , did a damn good job at explaining most of what you can do in this game.  On a more local note  urlLink Stu's  throat is still sore, and  urlLink City TV  needs to put more movie inbetween each commercial.

I thought Montréal was gonna be the Bills of the CFL.  Thanks goes out to my lovely girlfriend for allowing me to bore the hell out of her with 3 hours of Grey Cup Radio on the drive home from Ottawa.  While I'm on the topic of Ottawa, thanks to Travis for having me down for the weekend, was awesome, good times....  I just noticed that I never published the post I made while in Ottawa, so read the next entry also.     Note:  One final thanks to Amanda Sue for telling me how to spell " Centre "  Note 2:  Blogger is gay, and doesn't recognise Centre as a HTML tag...  Anti-Canadians!!!!

I'll get into it more when I get back home because this keyboard had a  Blueberry Pepsi  bath, and the keys get stuck, and the words with Os or Hs look funny.

      While my hit-counter now confirms that I'm updating this for my own benifit, I'll give all you loyal Swordfish followers (Myself) some advise about HTML...  When creating a link that is to open a new window, use the tag  target="_blank"  rather than  target="new window" ...Reason: "_blank" will open a brand new window, no matter how many Internet Explorer windows are currently open, however "new window" will often use an already open IE window, and cause someone who is editing thier web-site, to lose everything they hadn't saved yet...  *cough*   This tip brought to you by the fine people of  urlLink McDonalds.... home of the 100% Beef Burger!

I don't think Mr. E007 was thrilled when I pulled a  urlLink Major Harry Schmidt  and hit him three times in the arm...   "Friendly Fire"    Next on the schedule is a date at Sgt. Splatters before the end of December.  I have these coupons I need to use, and they expire at the end of this year.  Admit 2 people FREE, buy 100 paintballs each, get 100 free.  So if you want to go,  urlLink email me now!!!   Tentative date is December 13th at about 10:00PM.   Quote of the day:   Sometimes your the pigeon, sometimes your the statue

The most enjoyable, informative and jaw dropping piece of video I have ever seen.  Movies, television shows, anything you can think of, nothing can compare to these 10 hours I spent over the last 7 days or so.  Appropriate, that I started watching them on November 12th, 57 years to the day that most of the men in this documentary, got to go home.  I give them all my respect, admiration, and thanks.  Best 100 bucks I ever spent.... bar none

       The World Remembers   I got this in my email at work..   Every November 11th, Canadians across the country pause in a silent moment of remembrance for the men and women who served our country during wartime. We honour those who fought for Canada - in the First World War (1914-1918), the Second World War (1939-1945) and the Korean War (1950-1953). More than 1,500,000 Canadians served overseas - more than 100,000 died. They gave their lives and their future so that we may live in peace.    Today lets remember all the soilders lost fighting for our freedom, including those who have died for Operation Freedom in Khandhar.

       Habs crown Kings   What a great game, 3 first period goals and a solid effort all round helped my Habs win another game, and improve to 6-4-4 and second in the North East.  Keep up the good work guys.  Theodore, keep it up bud, I got faith!  On a more personal front, look for me to update my Blog more often, and anyone who really wants to, can come here, and see what I'm up to.  Cheers!!

       Monday Night Racing a Success   All in all last night was an over all success, fun and entertainment was had, not to mention some food and hot racer chicks!  However, personally, I like Formula Kartways better, other than last week, simply because Prokarts just takes way too much time, for way too little racing!  As far as the night when, Stu managed to pull out on top.  He had a great second heat, great car, and it all combined to the third fastest time of the heat!  However, lets not forget that Stu was lead car in the 4th and slowest second heat.  While I duked it out in heat 3 and rinished a respectable second.  Again, the car you ahd was a huge factor, which I guess is inevitable (Stu skips that point when he's on top) while your knowledge of the track is one thing, you need to know how to get the best performace out of specific cars.  Car 8 ran well with anyone in it last night, being the winning car in almost ever heat, and car 20 and 18 made for early retirements, cars that all three of us at one point were stuck in.  We're a competitve bunch, and it's hard to be competitive when your car's engine is falling out, or the acceleration is crap.  I'd love to climb into 5 identical cars, and have some fun racing, but untill that happens, we will have to rely on the luck of the draw.  Grats Stu on your 7th place overall finish at Monday Night Racing!

       Best Buy My Ass!   I could not believe my eyes and ears this morning, as we arrived at the Best Buy at Heartland to do some early morning Boxing Day shopping.  Without exaggeration, at about 6:10 there were 200 people there, after grabbing a coffee, and coming back, there were probably 500, and we were at the back!  Knowing that there was a draw for $1000 gift card, we stood and braved the cold, only to NOT get a raffle ticket, adn then get left out in the cold, littereally, when they stopped letting people in the store for about an hour and 45 minutes, of which we waited 30 minutes, and then gave up and went home.  So... Thus begins my boycott on Heartland Best Buy, for being wimps, who couldn't walk for another 20 minutes, to hand out tickets to all the people who arrived prior to 6:45, when they were supposed to have "Random Draws."  Mr. and Mrs. Best Buy are going to hear from me aswell!  Anyway, I'm off now, I'll return on the 5th of January, to Blog on, untill then, stay safe, and Happy New Year!

      I'm gonna start off today by giving props out to myself for finishing all of my Christmas shopping in the pan of one hour, and 15 minutes.  No, thats not a typo.  I was in and out faster than a virgin on prom night! (Was that uncalled for?  Yes I think it was).  The highligh of the morning however was the present that I bought for myself.  I picked up one of those Mini-RC cars, it's about 2 inches long, and a half-inch high, but it moves and handles like a dream!  My cousin is getting one from a friend tonight, so I'm looking forward to setting up the track, and having a few one-on-one races tonight!  The cars themselves are pretty fragile, but they are worth the 20 bucks, especially if you can line em up, 4 wide or something, it's gonna be fun.  They go over almost all the flooring in my house, carpet etc...  They just get a littel dusty on the wheels and you gotta clean em now and again or the allignment goes to hell.  The best part of the whole deal... 45 second recharge time, THATS IT!  So in essence, you can have long races, with pit stops....  Now I just need to find 30 people who own these cars, and we will be good to go!  Incase I don't get a chance to come back to the site before Wednesday, which I doubt, but who know...  Just want to extend my Holiday wishes to all of you, and a great 2003!  If you need me, I'll be at the Erin Mills Town Centre driving around the parking lot, telling everyone I'm done!

      I know I'm slacking lately, but I'm sure your all as busy as I am... between familly, and shopping, I haven't played a videogame in a week!  However, I am gonna take five minutes to rant...  and today's topic?  Americans  What the freak is wrong with them?  The Metric system, get with it!!!!  You arrogant bastards have to be different from the rest of the world, not realising that all your doing is making your people look different, because they don't know how big a meter is.  What else??  Oh yeah, the new digital radio stuff.  The entire world is using a technology called "DAB" (Digital Audio Broadcasting)...  that is the entire world minus the United States, and Latvia!  What does this mean to you??  Well, once you cross over into the USA, unless your radio in your car can get anallog signals as well, you will not get ANY radio, none at all. It'll be like trying to put a North American plug, into a European outlet.  I'm sure there are plenty more of these that I just can't think of right now, but it's got me so mad, I'm gonna officially start up my new organisation.  C.S.W. - Coallition to Standardise the World.  All plugs, measurments, Television Signals, video game devices and everything, will be identical, next to th elanguage that is.  Why can't I go on vacation to England, and bring my PS2??  I should be able to, and C.S.W. will make it happen dammit!   Note:  December 27th - January 5th, I will not be making any posts, as I will be internetless in Florida.

      I had to put this out, before I went to sleep...  I went to Image Comics today, to pick up my monthly Superman, JLA and other comics.  On my way out, this kid asks me; "Dude, can you spare 2 bucks?  I need to take the bus and I'm broke."  My first reaction was Yeah Right!  He's just some punk who spent his last 12 bucks on a pack of smokes (See, he was smoking).  Since I had on my leather jacket, which I haven't worn since last winter, I figured I'd have little or no money in it, so I do the pocket search and come up with 3 things;  2 Used Movie Tickets from Last night  A Toonie (go figure)  A condom  So my first reaction was, HA!  Thats funny, till the kid goes and laughs hysterically and starts making cracks about the condom with his friends, then looks back at me for the toonie.  So I did the best thing I could think of, gave him the comdom, threw the toonie in a sewer, and told him to go have fun with his friends ( a group of guys by the way ) and I walked off.  It felt good to screw over that punk, even though it cost me a toonie, and an old condom, but no one humiliates The Fish... peace!  ~Fish Out~

      I'm back!!!    Damn that was a kick ass movie!  Mupiel n' wife, as well as my girlfriend and I  all attended the midnight showing of  The Two Towers  and it was everything I hoped it would be... and then some!  Without spoiling anything, Smeagol (Gollum) stole the show in my book.  Everything that happened, I expected to happen, except for the humor that Gollum added; rivaled only by that of Gimli.  I could go on for hours, really I could, since I work in 3 Hours, and going to sleep will just make tomorrow even worse.  I would like you all to pay attention to one thing when you go see the film, if you haven't yet...  Jackson uses a lot of fly-overs of the landscape, and some of those shots when the camera rotates 360 degrees around a character... these made me sick, to the poing I almost showed everyone my New York Fries.  Famous did a shitty job of organising things, they showed the same movie in 5 theaters, but sold out the theaters one by one, so tickets for cinema 10 came out, untill it was full, and so on...  Meaning that I showed up at 10:45, printed my tickets, and got cinema 10 (I bought the tickets online months ago) and then after awhile people start getting tickets for theater 7, but since noone has 7 yet, they get front of the line for that theater, and thus better seats...  I could be wrong, but when I showed up, I saw one line and Mupiel says when he got there he saw many, so I'm guessing and assuming, but I'm pretty sure I'm right..   NOTE:  If the above makes little sense, it's because I hardly know my own name at the moment!  Spoiler for Two Towers:  [Highlight to read] No Shelob... She is in the final Movie I guess.  Now for those famous last words...  I'm gonna lie down for a bit.

        The Mother, of all Updates!!!    OK... Got a beer? Some Chips...  maybe a potty?  You could be here awhile.  Super Mario Sunshine, while a great game as far as plot, graphics, and game play go...  I have never played a game such a frustrating game.  Most of the levels difficulties stem from falling off some thin bridge, and starting all over again.  I spent the last hour jumping to the top of some level, only to fall off at the same place every freakin time.  I mean, I love the game, and I want to play it, but then after an hour of that, the game sits there for a week till I'm ready to get frustrated again.  It's horrible  Everquest?  Still slugging it out as a newbie, trying to make ends meet and buying my spells.  Tolwyn the Bard is level 13, and I'm enjoying it again, but not as addicted to it as I was when Xott was born.  I remember being level 19 with Xott, sitting in the  Ocean of Tears  at 3am, 3 hours before I was supposed to leave for Bahamas, only to fall asleep, half packed, and my little toon sitting on a rock, in the middle of nowhere.  I woke up about 5:00, in a frantic scramble to shut down the PC, pack, and get the hell outside, only to find 5 inches of snow on the ground, and 35 minutes to pick up Jen, and get to the airport.  Somehow we made it... Anyway, where was I???  Oh right, Everquest.  On Friday, I got my DVD Disc, for the Everquest: Online Adventures Beta III for PS2.  I totally missed Beta II because I've got the DVD being shipped to Buffalo, and then to me, because they only offered the Beta to US addresses.  All in all, the game is nothing compared to the PC version, mainly because you can't type unless you spend money on a USB keyboard, and why would I do that, if I can just play a better version on my PC???  I guess it's for those who can't afford PCs, and have a PS2 and a broadband connection just lying around the house?  Fuxored!  Some other stuff to touch on...  Picked up season 1 of the South Park DVDs, and while I have enjoyed all of the South Park episodes I've seen, there are many I haven't, so for 35 bucks, a whole season of episodes I have forgotten about, it's a sweet deal!  Watching it now actually, as I type!  Ok before I go I wanna touch on the support clerk bit.  OMG she's a bitch!  You see, we have a clerk that works with us in the IT section at CCRA.  Her job consists of entering our time sheets, ordering office supplies for us, and bugging the shit out of us for donations to charities.  Now I'm all for giving extra money to charities, but I do it on my own time, to my own charities...  She pushes us way too much, to a point where many of the IT guys just auto forward her emails to the trash!  She gets involved in our shit WAY too much, and likes to complain about her son being a dickhead all the time... Which he does seem to be, needs a kick in the head or two.  Another aspect of her "job" that pisses me off is her sarcastic remarks.  You see, I'm late for work a lot, but when I say late, I'm talking 2 -3 minutes MAX, and this pisses her off, and naturally she says something.  Now before you think "She has a point" I'll agree with you...  but then she'll go and take a 2 and a half hour, to go to another CCRA site near the airport.  Thing is she went because one of our other IT person, is going back to her position as a customs inspector and she needed her uniform.  So our clerk decided she needed company, and went with her...  why?  Beats me.  I could go on forever on the stupid and hypocritical things she does, but it's bad enough if she read this in the first place.  Let me end this point saying that I love working there; even when it's slow and you want to bite your nails off.  I just can't stand people like that, who get on their high horse about making sure I do my job, when they don't even do theirs.  She's the reason we got paid a week late once...  read about that  urlLink here .  Just want to wish my co-worker, cubical-mate, and friend  urlLink | Justin, a.k.a. Mr. E 007 |  a safe trip to the Philippians and remember not to flash your passport, they don't like us much right now.  Merry Christmas bro, see ya in class.

This is gonna be the shit, with a fight sequence that will  "Knock you on your ass"   For a change, today I got nothing to rant about, school busses are still slow, and stop at the dumbest places, the government wastes way too much money, hydro companies are taking us for all we're worth, and the jackass who screwed me over on a car deal at VW in Mississauga, still has his job.  However, I'd like to take this time to touch on something that I feel is very important.  Saku Koivu, the captain of the Montreal Canadiens, was diagnosed with cancer before the start of last season...  He battled cancer, beat it, and then returned to the ice before the end of the season as the Canadiens returned to the playoffs, after a few years off.  Saku has started a foundation to raise money to buy a PET Scan machine for the Montreal General Hospital, and if you have some spare money that your looking to donate, maybe this would be a good cause to help people detect and fight cancer easier.  At least have a read...   urlLink The Saku Koivu Foundation   ~~SwordFish~~

      TGIF - Did you remember to do your co-op assignment?  I did... in fact I had started to do one part of the assignment twice, not realizing that they were two examples of the same thing...That’s why you're supposed to go to the co-op classes, I missed a few, nine of ten actually :)  Big news of the day... 11 more days an some seven-odd hours till the next chapter begins, and if you have no idea what I'm on about, then go to hell... go to hell and die!!!  Too much maybe? I think not!  In fact we spent the afternoon at work prepping, by doing some trivia...  How bout an example or two?   1: Who did Gimli ride with upon leaving Edoras?  2: What is the name of the most “hasty” Ent?(proper name)  If you know the answers, go post on the OLG2 community, and have some fun with it, first one to do it gets a kick in the ass, and 100 bucks if I ever win a million dollars or more.  Don’t be a dolt and use the internet, if you don’t know it, you don’t know it.  No one is gonna castrate anyone because of it. (Like any of you care enough about my page to go through all the trouble to find the answers)   Rant of the Day! Randy River clothing, in specific pants, has gone down the shit hole.  The last three pair of pants I bought from there have lasted no more than three months before the zipper fucks up, and slides down… making for many awkward explanations when you leave the boss’s office with you zipper down.   Highlight of the Night: My NHL2002 season continues, after a rough start, my boys have won 29 straight, and try to make it thirty tonight.  If anyone knows of a good NHL hockey simulator, where it’s all stats based, and games are simulated, please let me know… PC gamer always talks about a baseball one, I’d love to find a hockey one.  While I'm on hockey, my blackest day as a Montreal Canadiens fan... I took this from  urlLink TSN.CA ;  On December 2, 1995, Roy - now the winningest goaltender in NHL history - allowed nine goals before being replaced by Pat Jablonski in an 11-1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings.   After he was mercifully relieved, Roy skated back to the bench in disgust while being booed by the home fans, walked back to the box seat of team president Ronald Corey and told him, "This is my last game for Montreal."   It was. Five days later, Roy was dealt to Colorado along with Canadiens captain Mike Keane for goalie Jocelyn Thibault and wingers Andrei Kovalenko and Martin Rucinsky.   Now none of those players play for Montreal... sad isn't it.  Peace, I’m out! ~~Fish~~

      I know... I know.. Where the hell have I been??  Well, the answer?  Asheron's Call 2, I love it!  But alas, I will take some time and rant and rave, and the topic for today?  School Bus Stops!  HOLY SHIT!  What is going on?  Kids can't walk 30 seconds down the road anymore?  I was following a bus up Thomas street today, and it stopped about 100 feet from Bell Harbour Dr, let off a kid, and then proceeded the 100 feet to Bell Harbour, made a right ( Which I had to also ) and then stopped again, not 50 feet from the corner.  Distance travelled...150 Feet.  Ok it's cold, but thats fucking nuts!  If the kids all get out about 10 feet from Bell Harbour, then the most either of them has to walk to get back to their current stop, is like 75 feet..  And parents wonder why kids are getting fat?  Give me the millions your spending on research, and I'll give you an answer.  They're lazy punks who are babied till they are 17, at which point they buy a car and end up not being able to run from here to there without fainting.  Am I in great shape?  no.  Can I run for 5 minutes without complaining I'm gonna pass out.  YES!  For the record, the bus stopped 2 more times between Bell Harbour & Thomas and my house, about 500 meters.  **sigh**  Anyway... Nvidia has new detonator drivers.  Download them  urlLink here...  If you want  I'd like to wish luck to the Montreal Canadiens who are about to endure the worst 10 days of the year.  Dallas, Colorado, Pheonix, Boston, Tampa Bay, Boston.  4 Points would be nice.  I have faith they can get 8 if they play like they can.  Now, it's back to Dereth, to emerse myself in fantasy lands and goblins that bite!  Yeowch

      What a weekend!  Culminated with the purchase of my next endeavour...  Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings.   While I've only just scratched the surface of the game, I'm hooked to it like Crack.  When compared to my reaction to Everquest, it's equal.  I'm really impressed with this game, especially when you turn on all the effects. it's jaw dropping goodness, all the way to the waving blades of grass, and your feet disappearing into the knee high areas of it.     It uses an attack system similar to DAOC where you have simple one click attacking, in combination with special effects, attacks, and defences that you trigger by using hotkeys.   As for it's guild system, it referred to as an allegiance, and it's rather unique.  Here's a quick overview.  While your walking the world, you simply invite people to swear allegiance to you.  Once someone has sworn to you, they are in your Monarchy, in which any XP they acquire, trickles down to you, and then on to whomever you swore to, and so on, and so on.  Logging in to 7000 XP points that you acquired while you were sleeping, is common!  I'm not sure what happens when you leave the allegiance, but I'm assuming the people under you, just become Vassals to the person you had swore to.     Three races, a little low, but more than enough ways to shape your character.  Strong " Missile " skills (That's ranged attacks), a mix of Missile and Melee, etc..  It's all up to you.  Best part being that if you go up one ladder, and change your mind... NO Problem!  untrain all your skills, and get everything you spent on them back.  So go from a Melee, to a Missile in a short time, instead of having to start 2nd characters, and re-levelling them!   So I'll stop there as far as AC2 goes, but suffice it to say, it's well worth the investment if your into MMOGs in particular Fantasy based ones.   Ok time to rant...  Where should we start today?  Microsoft and their " Software Assurance ...Geeks sitting at home, making viruses, to make our lives hell?.. or the piece of trash they called Computer Fest at the International Center.  It was horrible!  But you know what.... I can't handle these morons right now, I'll take action and rant later... right now... I'm so mad, I can SPIT!    A Plus from the Computer Fest  urlLink

       Holy Shit!  There's a game in that box   I think its time I step back, look at the cornucopia of PC-CD boxes above my head, and say  "I'm gonna sit in this chair, and not move untill I beat all of those games!"   Unfortunately, school and work get in the way of spending about 50 hours with my ass stuck to this chair.  Naturally I'd have to get up to use the washroom and get food when no one is home to bring it up to me...  but meh!  Just details!  Ok, in all seriousness, I've been carrying around the list of incomplete games I own on my Palm for about 3 months now, and it's getting me nowhere, so I'm going to publicly post what they are, and then make a nice little table, and stick it where that poll is, and then it will be a constant reminder of what a game slacker I am...  Make that Slamer, (Slay-mher) Get it... Gamer... Slacker...  I kill myself!  (Just laugh you'll live longer and feel happier)   The List...   Combat Flight Simulator 3  Unreal Tournament 2003  The Sims.... Get Past the getting a job part w/o cheating  Freedom Force  Medal of Honor:Allied Assult  Medal of Honor:Spearhead  Battlefield 1942  NHL 2002 - Been in Conference Finals for 4 months...  Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers (PS2)   Lets say, 3 months...  3 months to see the credits on all these games!  I'm confident I can do it.  I just need developers to stop cranking out games, and adding to the freakin pile!  Now before I go to sleep so I can wake up and finish studying for this test...  I found a great Hockey Manager.  It plays much like NHL 2002, minus the graphics, the controlling the players, the scoring, the motion videos, the crowd, the control-pad.  Ok so al you get to do is decide who plays, who doesn't, who's making how much, who to trade, who to sign, who to bench and all the fun stuff that NHL GMs and Coaches get to do!  And it's totally free!  Mind you it's a little outdated, but the programers got signed by a company to produce an actual version of the game for Sports Interactive, the creators of Championship Manager.  urlLink http://eastside.peliplaneetta.net/ - Get the Game here  - Download the 1.16 version, then the patch. Then go to downloads and get the Rosterpak and your good to go.  If you want to read up on Sports Interactive, go  urlLink here!   ~sw0rdfish~

       You Can Upgrade That For A Small Cost   I've decided I'm going to add a title to all my posts now, don't think I'll do anything other than bold it, but I've been messing with looks so much lately, and I change my mind more than my underwear, so who knows.  Sometimes I have ‘em, other times I don't.  I'm sure you don't care either way.  Maybe I'll have to pull out my nifty little poll making thing, and ask you!  On to the post.  I’ve decided, it’s time to spend some money on a good monitor, and I mean a GREAT monitor, and the winner is,  urlLink Elumens Corp’s  VisionStation®.  Mind you the $32,000 is a slight hurdle, but come on!  Look at these stats!   Image Width:150 cm (60") Screen Radius:84 cm (33") Screen Width:163 cm (62.5") Screen Height:145 cm (57") Screen Depth:53 cm (21")   150cm width!!!  That’s freakin huge!!  For the nerds out there,  urlLink The Rest O’ da Specs!   This thing is a huge satellite dish shaped screen, that you sit in the middle of, looking around.  Naturally, a First-Person Shooter dream screen!  Be sure to order a nice LCD for word processing and work stuff, you know the other function of a computer!

      Wazzap!  Blogger was freakin on me, couldn't get in an update untill about 2 min ago (Assuming it takes 2 minutes to write this).  First off, props to  Les Habs  for being unbeaten in 5, and taking 9 of a possible 12 points.  I'm going to enjoy the second half!    Moving forward, my gaming life  hasn't  moved forward...  I'm still messing around online with Battlefield, and a bit of Medal of Honor.  Got my hands on  MoH:Spearhead , but I haven't tried the single player campaign yet, I want to finish Allied Assult first, then I'll try it out.  The new wepons are alright, the multiplayer maps are awesome though, so that alone makes it worth the money.    Some guy on Gamespot forms bought a beast of a system.  Spent $3,000USD, or $4,500 Canadian, on a it.  Now, you must be asking yourself,  what does one get for $4,500?  Well  urlLink I give you exhibit A.   Read on and see all the poor sports who can't afford it, and are just yapping to make the guy feel bad.  Some people!  Did he pay more for Alienware?  Yeah, probably...  but thats only because he probably doesn't know much about how to build a computer, and he'd get burned more if he went with IBM.  I got a comic I was gonna post, that my cousin drew, but I can't get it to look right once it's scanned in...  my hand isn't steady enough, and the fill option in Paintshop just makes a mess of things.  Maybe I'll try going over the lines with a felt pen before I scan it??  Who knows!  I'm hungry, so I'm gonna go eat!  Once I sneak out of class.

      OK... I'm so tired; I could fall asleep listening to a cat cat-a-wall, while someone drags their fingernails across a chalk board!  So the solution?  Go to bed!  Which is exactly what I plan on doing in the next 20 minutes or so.  First, remember this picture!?      Well, did you notice the two cat's sitting in the background going " What they hell is that freak doing now? "  Well, in case you still don't see them, let me introduce to you, my night vision Ellipse Tool from Photoshop, and WHAM!      Kitties appear!  if you look back in the first picture, you just see their pointy eyes, but with the night vision on, Simon and Kasey, front and center!  You’re busted!  Thanks to Amanda, for pointing this out!  I thought it was funny!  Ok, on to things you may actually care about!  Games?  I got none!  plus I've been way too tired to download any, but let me ask you this.  How many of you have played Battlefield 1942?  Now, how many of you have played the multiplayer?...  I see...  But!  Did you use MSN, or Roger Wilco and hook up mics and talk to the people your playing with?  This is a whole new game!  Variation and I had a blast hooking up the headsets, and shooting down some Japanese scum, or US scum, depending on whether we felt in the mood for war-crazy and overweight, or smart and high tech.  Don't get it?  Don't worry, its not that funny!  Well, the comments we had going back and forth were pure jokes!  Like when we hopped in a transport, and I radioed to Var;  " Plane on our 3.." "Yeah, I see it!!" -  Unloads a round of Machine gun ammo at the plane  "Did you get it?  I ask" "Don't think so" -  This is when we notice that we have water up to our heads  "Uh Var...  I think we're gonna die" "yup..  we're dead"   You gotta use your imagination, but if you have played the game, and haven't tried with the headset, I recommend you do!  It's a laugh a minute.  From transports, to scout and artillery to Pilot and read gunner, we had a blast.. . Especially when Var would try to bail out, and the exact point I'd pull up, and I'd end up killing him with the propellers...  Or when he bailed out, w/o telling me, and I'm left stuck in the rear gunner seat of the plane, wondering why the green side is up, and approaching fast.  It brought a whole new dimension to the game I had shelved for a while, and now has a permanent place back in my CD Rom drive, at least for when someone with a headset is ready to rock!   "It's all about the Jeep" "What are you talking about?"  - Var notices me driving up Omaha Beach in a jeep -  "RAMBO!!!!!!"

      Pleh!  Felt like I just closed my eyes to go to bed, and I'm up again!  There really isn't any reason for me to blog, other than the fact that I don't want to be up right now!  It's probably freezing outside, my car door wont open, and I'm hungry.  Bagel and Chedder anyone?  If you actually get up and read this before I get to class, call my cell and I'll buy you a bagel too!  Use MSN messenger, adn text message me what you want if you don't know my number, and I'll have it for you in class.  First 3 people only, just because I don't want to buy every Tom, Dick and Harry a bloddy bagel!  (Like anyone reads this page at all, let alone before 7:30AM!)

      Super… OK maybe not super, but it was alright!  One thing I gotta talk about is the fact that Shania Twain sucks!  Halftime show at both CFL and NFL championship games, and she lip syncs!!??  What the hell?  You’re a performer!  Learn to perform!  Anyway, back to the game, I said it, and it happened… “Tampa by 10!” and they came, and destroyed winning by 27 and proving everyone wrong!  Everyone I asked anyway, I’ll have fun bragging about it for the next few days!  Before I jump to my next topic, I’m just wondering why the hell we, as Canadians, go so crazy for the Superbowl… yet unless our team is in the Stanley Cup Finals… we don’t watch?  Why the hell not?  We’re a hockey country!  OK grant it hockey has 7 games, and could end at any game, so lets get together for all 7 games!!  I’m up for it!  In fact, I’m inviting everyone over this year for the Stanley Cup Finals, all 7 games (“if necessary”) and we’ll eat junk, drink beers and pop, and bet on everything we possibly can, including who is gonna dump the puck first, who’s gonna land the first big hit, and which goalie is going to take a sip of water first!  Who’s in?  Habs! Awesome game today, Montreal totally outplayed the Blackhawks today, and Sundstrom put a goal in for us.  Welcome to Montreal!  I’m going to enjoy this playoff run during the second half of the season, and I have a feeling, just a feeling, that the Habs can make the top 6 this year!  Good luck boys!  I’m sitting on my couch, at 12:42am waiting for Coldplay to come on to ABC, on the new talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live.  It’s pretty funny!  I may have to watch more often!  HA! He just dissed Celine Dion, so that’s a bonus!  12:45 and it sounds like Coldplay is going to be on at the end, so I’m gonna turn this off, and call it a night.  My Jimmy Kimmel review of the first 10 minutes!  Good stuff, Jay Leno, but funnier.  For those who don’t know Kimmel is the dude who read the questions on  Win Ben Stien’s Money  and co-host of  The Man Show .  ~Fish Out~  P.S. Shania you’re a sellout!  Not sure why I’m so mad about that, but its bullshit! P.P.S. Computer freaked on me, it's 1:00 and I'm going to bed now! Still no Coldplay!

      From MSNBC:M   Many Internet users experienced a sharp slowdown in traffic during Saturday’s early morning hours, as a fast-spreading Internet worm overwhelmed the world’s digital pipelines. The worm, which is being called both “Slammer” and “Sapphire” doesn’t attack typical home computers — instead it attacks machines running database software from Microsoft called SQL Server. The worst of the attack seems over, experts said, but groggy-eyed Internet workers were spending the day Saturday cleaning up from the effects of the outbreak. urlLink Complete Story    In more local news...  The Tim Horton's cup fiasco is solved.  Let me back up a step or two.  On Monday, I stroll into class all badass like with my new Tim Horton's travel mug.  I stopped to talk to Kelvin, then proceeded to  pour  my coffee onto his work!  The stupid lid just pops off, and you can't use the cup!  That is, untill today!!  Tim Hortons has issued a recall on all the lids for their stainless steal travel mug.  Seems they mysteriously " pop-off ."  yeah, No Shit!  Fish Out!

      Oh god!  I almost wet myself when I read the latest  urlLink PA  posts about an hour ago; have a look if you get a chance.  My girlfriend thinks I'm obsessed with them, when the fact is I just like laughing, don't want you all thinking " God, he wants to marry that web-page " cuz as we know, you can't marry a web page!  That sounded funnier in my head, but I'm gonna leave it here anyway!  Before I switch topics, the link to that song, as he said, is probably gonna be broken, so if you want that song, I finally got it after an hour of trying, just hit me on MSN, and I'll send it over.  It's way too funny!  I'd host it, but Bell sucks, and only lets me transfer 25 MB from my website!  Speaking of sucking, EA is bombing me with emails regarding crap I don't want, and I even checked off that box  I don't want to receive information about upcoming promotions, games, or sales.   If that’s the thanks I get for registering games, I'll stop.  And they complain that no one registers any more!  Due to financial constraints, I have nothing to review today.  PC Gamer has Impossible Creatures demo on its CD, but I can't get the thing to install!  So I'm out of games till I get some money, or a lot more readers and then I can get free games from companies that care what me and my readers think.  Unfortunately, the 6 of us aren't enough.  Is it even 6 yet?  OK 5.  However, I did get like 300 hits in the last 2 days or so, over the EQ love story thing.  So if i can get like one of you to come back, day in and day out, that would be cool.  I'll try and make you laugh, but I get told repeatedly...  You're not funny  But what do they know!  Let me touch on Sim City 4 for a second.  Apparently that bug that I spoke of earlier, with the My Sims, is as a direct result of the Bonus Transportation CD, and the My Sims feature together.  I found this on a page, I forget where...    The crash with MySim is related to the bonus CD. If you have installed the bonus CD and have moved a MySim into your city, crashes are likely. We will have a patch available soon that fixes this issue. Deleting the file called Plugin_007_AirForceBase.dat from the Plugins directory found in Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 4\Plugins is a quick way to avoid the crash.    So I guess they plan on fixing it, but no air force base for me!  Actually no city after Mupiel and I destroyed it today after school.  It was actually quite relaxing to sit there, and blow those whiney bastards up.  I mean, who really needs schooling, and policing, and fire...ing?  Spoiled Slobs!  ~~Later~~

        Fate, Love and Everquest    I know I've updated three times tonight, but I couldn't help this one.  If you've heard the name Everquest you probably relate it to one of two things...  The MMOG the changed the way Online Gaming is done, the computer world's version of Crack; ending marriages, spawning support groups, and even the blame of one person's death.  I've been playing now for well over 2 years, actually, I think its 3 now, but that’s not the point.  In three years I've heard lots of love stories come out of this game, and really, i thought nothing much of it...  it happens right?  However, this one instance, floored me, and it might do the same to you.  I logged in to get an hour of soloing time in, before I called it a night.  So I head to my usual spot, Lava Storm, and as usual, I'm the only one there.  After about 10 minutes I'm joined by a funny looking gnome, who sits beside me and offers to group up, and smash some baddies together.  Who can't use company right?  So the usual chatter takes place, and we got on to the subject of expensive months of the year.  When we spend the most, and he mentions that this year, June wins hands down, so naturally I joked,  Your Getting Married....  or Divorced.   He says marriage, and when I asked how they met, I got an answer I never expected.  Turns out he dated said girl in high school for about 4 years until she moved 2000 miles away for college.  After about a year and a half of the long-term deal, they mutually decided it was better to go their own ways, the distance just made it too hard, and after about another 2 months they stopped speaking to each other completely.  So feeling alone, and down he gets into Everquest, and after about a year of playing, he becomes great friends with a girl from his guild.  They did everything together, and after about 6 months of this... you guessed it he starts to really dig this chick, and decides that he's gonna say something.  Take note that this is all online, I'm thinking at this point, this guy is nuts!  So he continues...  and they have  the talk  one night out in the very spot that we were sitting, and she feels the same way, based only on playing a game and learning the person's personality game wise, they are nuts for each other.  That’s when the talk gets nuts, for the first time he asks her, feeling kinda silly that he just spilled his guts to her...   So anyway, what’s your real name?   And wouldn't you know it.  IT’S THE SAME GIRL HE WAS DATING IN SCHOOL!!!!!  Turns out she changed to another school, and all he knew about the person behind the character was that she was going to school in Florida, and that she started playing Everquest after she moved to Florida.  I asked how the hell he never knew more about her, and he says she was really reserved in the guild, never said much about real life, and just loved talking about the game, and about life, but never her own!  I mean, this guy could have been pulling my leg, but then why?  Why would you make something like that up?  It's just way too weird!    I'll chalk that one up as fate doing its thing, but man, what a weird way to work out!  The odds of this have to be astronomical, without speaking for about a year and a half, to meet up in the world of Norrath, and end up back as Junior in high school... well that’s just way to much for me.  It's a small world after all...

      Crap, i just remembered what I wanted to talk about.  American Idol!  What the hell are these tone-deaf idiots thinking when they go out there to try and make it to Hollywood for the next phase of the show?  Simon just rips them apart and its rather funny!  I suggest you watch next Tuesday, at least flip by while watching the game, and see these retards make utter fools of themselves.  It's the last day of auditions, so after that all you have left is people who can sing, and well...  thats just dull.  Fish Out... again!

      4-6, 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-4, 21-19    I know what you’re thinking...   "Those sorta look like Tennis scores, except those last 2 numbers...  What the hell is that"   Well..., it IS tennis scores!  Scores you get after a 2h:23m 5th set and a 4h:59m game that saw it's final set go 40 games.  They even let the ball boys play a few points.  You can read about it  urlLink here.   That was definitely worth mentioning.  Now, to gaming...  I woke up this morning to the sound of my doorbell ringing, and a Canada Post employee handing me my copy of  The Sims: Unleashed .  I know it's been out a really long time, but there was just so much more I wanted to try, and I was happy with   Vacation   so I was in no rush to pick up   Unleashed  .  So what’s new with Unleashed?  Quite a bit actually, they have expanded the neighbourhoods to something like 40 Lots, giving you more places to create neighbours and such.  As well as allowing you to create local commercial places such as shops, restaurants and hangouts that you can then visit and purchase from.  The usual updates are there as well, the best of thesims.com, patches, new social animations, and of course...  The newest feature, the pets!  I like it so far, other than the fact that it seems like my lot has become a haven for unwanted pets.  I swear there are like cats and dogs fighting all over my property, you know that clay-mation film of Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer?  Toy island where all the misfits go?  That’s my house!  Except it's for all the unwanted pets!  They are all over the freakin place, and if you pet them... you’re screwed!  They follow you around till you shoo them off, and then you feel bad cuz they're so damn cute!  In the end pets just take your Simolians, and boost your social aspect, which is good since I tend to get annoyed with my neighbours because they take every attempt to feel them up as a bad thing, and I lose like 50 friendship points...  but that’s another story :)  Overall I'm please with the purchase, and if you’re a Sims fan, then we have yet another must from Maxis!  Check it out at  urlLink www.thesims.com .  Before I move on, I hear   "The Sims Online"   is like Everquest minus the adventuring and the monsters...  trade skills and chatting...  believe me, after 2 years of Everquest, I hate trade skills, so I hope there is more to it.  In other news, looks like Dawson's Creek is about to kill off another character...  and I can't be more thrilled, show needs a bit of drama.  Oddly enough, Dawson wasn't even on Dawson's Creek this episode...  **shrug**    Anyone else notice I use "..." way too much?  I think I'm done for now, I was going to mention something else, but it's gone from my mind, and after staring blankly at the screen for five minutes, my eyes hurt, so I'm giving up!  ~~Fish~~

      First let me start off by saying that I feel, now more than ever that I update this site for myself.  In three days I have gotten 3 answers to my poll, which tells me of the 20 hits, only 3 people were here cuz they had something to read.....   I cried about this, a lot...  I'm not lying!  Anyway, I'll carry on like the soilder that I am...  Speaking of Soilders, I'd like to get political for a second but I'll post these cool pics of my room cleaning evening on Monday night.  Took me till 4AM, just to clean the frocking desk!   urlLink click here!!!  -  Warning Bandwidth Challenged Need Not Apply!   Now, back to being political...  I've been following the Friendly Fire incident in Kandhar very carefully, especially since the hearing started.  At first I thought, these guys should never fly again, nor should they ever be allowed to serve their country abroad anymore.  (If they want to let them kill Americans, then thats not my business) and just be removed from the USAF.  However, since then I've been given some new information, and I share   The Pilots were flying at 23,000 feet  Semi Automatic weapons were being used by the Canadians on the ground at the time  Seme Automatic weapons ricochette does not go anywhere close to 23,000 feet   It took 2 minutes to get info to the pilots that the people on the ground were friendlies  2 Minutes for that sort of information is not unusual  Pilots have to give the coordinates of where they are before dropping a bomb  No coordinates were given  All US bombs that are dropped need to have authorisation from Saudi Arabia  No Authorisation was given  So where does this leave us?  A Pilot in an F16 who could have easily left the area, and waited for authorization, before returning to drop the bomb if neccessary.  No authorisation, totally ignored all protocals for this situation and 4 dead soilders...  Now "heat of the moment" and "they were on drugs issued by the USAF" are cop-outs because the USAF has been doing this for years, and these pilots are trained for combat.  I think Schmidt should spend the rest of his life in jail, for the simple fact that he killed 4 people, while  NOT  following protocal, and claiming that machine gun ricochette was Artillary aimed at him some 20,000 feet away.  Maybe jail is too harsh, but then again...  those Canadians paid with their lives, to train...  I'm not usually this forward about these subjects, because I don't know whats it's like to be 23,000 feet up, or in an F16 for that matter...  However people who have are claiming that they should have known the differences, and there was no way they were in danger...  These guys are supposed to be the best in the world, and there is no way the best in the world should be skipping protocals and stuff like that.

      Afternoon fun with power supplies!!  I got home from school with a plan to do one thing.  Ok, well 2 things EQ and Sim City 4.  So I sit down on my comfy gaming chair when suddenly I notice this smell...  Kinda  tangy  kinda not, then POOF!  computer shuts down, and I'm wondering WTF just happened, then it hits me.  Not tang...  burning electronics!  GAaH!  My computer is FUBAR!  So like any other geek, I jump in my car, and it's off to CompuSolutionsDepot for a new power supply!  Picked up a can of compressed air while I was there, give the fans a blow job!  :o)  Upon getting everything back up and running, I decided, again like a typical geek, to do one of those "turn you keyboard upside-down and see what falls out" and OMG!!  That was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen!  Staples, dust, bleech-blond hair (Gee where did that come from) and even 2 tabs from a Pepsi Can...  Well, I wasn't satisfied, so i ripped off every damn key, and gave the keyboard a blow also!  MUaH!  Spottles, now the not so fun task of getting the keys back in the right spot!  102 out of 104, I mixed up the Scroll Lock and the Pause/Break but who uses those keys anyway!  I made my way thru the Penny Arcade archives some more, just because they are a good laugh, so I'm gonna link to a few of the funnier ones!   urlLink Duh!    urlLink Say what?  My kingdom to the person who figures out what the hell that symbol is!    urlLink I forget, but it made me laugh   Now back to terrorizing the people of Aberville, I'm about to be impeached, lets see if I can rebound!      Julien's First Win, Habs 3 Panthers 2 - Habs are actually outshooting teams!    Lets remeber Martin Luther King Jr. Today!

      Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!!    No, I'm not talking about the Leaf's win over the Habs, I've decided I'm not going to discuss this today!  We got one point, and at this part of the season, I'll take anythign we can get.  I'm looking forward to the second half of the season.  The new coach Julien seems to have a good relationship with Marcel Hossa, and Marius Czerkawski...  2 Players I know can and will step up their game, and stick around for many years in a Canadiens jersey, (I hope).  Now, back to sweetness!  Sim City 4 is the ultimate, if you don't have it, and your a Simmer like me...  then go get it!  Stop reading my non-sense, ask mommy and daddy to drive you to the mall, use that money you saved from mowin Mrs. Handready's lawn, and buy this freakin game!!  Yes it needs a patch or two to clean up some bugs (I can't import Sims from  The Sims , or it crashes.  No clue why!) but it's so much fun!  They use the same features that are available in  The Sims  where you can have Sims from one house interact with another... Well in SC4 (I'm tired of typing Sim City 4) you can interact with neighbouring cities.  Share power, water, job locations.  So in effect, you can build one city 95% residential, another one right beside it 95% industrial.  Throw in some commercial, and boom!  Your set.  The pollution will overflow, as will traffic and so on, so you can't cheat and ignore the other things in one city.  (IE If the traffic in the industrial city is crap, then the sims in the residential city will complain that their commute is too long, and move out!)  I could go on forever about the fun stuff you can do with this game, including but not limited to driving a big ass tornado right thru the house of the bitch who keeps complaining that her son has too far to go for school!  Funny story, I decided my first city was built piss poorley (don't build near edges, it sucks), and wanted to start over so instead of hitting the "Obliterate City" button, I pulled out God Mode, and started landing meteors all over the place, the people were running and screaming all over the place, that is till I pulled out the Lightning feature, and grilled them!  There is a news ticker that runs while your playing.  Tells you whats up, who's pissed off at you, who needs more money, advisors telling you what you  should  do, who wants to have your baby...  You know all that usefull information.  Well this one had me in stiches...  "Locals name child "Boody Doody Ba Da Do Do Ding"; He Sues"   I tell ya, nothing better than a game with a sense of humor!  Now, before I shut up about this, there is one more thing I want to touch on quickly.  In the near future EA is goign to let you create regions online, in which you can mayor your own city (Can I use mayor like a verb??) and collaborate with other SC4 users much in the same way you can with your own cities offline!  It's not up yet, so I can't test it out, but I'll let you know.  I also got this Transportation CD from EB when I bought it, I'm not sure exactly what it does because when I installed it, the game looked exactly the same, but I'll get back to you all on that also!  Overall, we got an 8/10 game here, with a must buy tag from me!! (Buy it from EB to get the extra CD)    My City!!      ~~Fish Out~~

      What up!  I'm so excited cuz I found my artist, and we're gonna see how my little "project" is going to turn out.  Before I get into today's post, I'm looking for musicians for my next project, anyone play drums, bass, guitar... sing? I'm looking to put together jam sessions, I'm tired of just playing for myself, I wanna get some peeps together, and we can jam like crazy!  So I just picked up Sim City 4, I haven't installed it yet, but I'll have a review of it as soon as I get a chance, but from talking to my peeps on gamespot forums, it sounds like a hardcore game!  I spent the evening at Reiley's (I think thats how you spell it ) listening to a bunch of people from my girlfriends Radio and Television Arts program at Ryerson, play live at a pre-release party for the compilation CD that they all put together, and I was impressed by all of them, great music all round.  You can actually listen to some of them at  urlLink MP3.COM .  I'll give you guys some links to the people that preformed tonight!   urlLink Erik Wenzel  is a talented musician, his music is very mellow, and on the sad side, but a great listen if that sort of stuff doesn't want to make you jump off a roof!  I'll warn you right now that G.I. Danny is a major tear jerker.   urlLink Dr Jinx a.k.a. Tyler Wade  is much more Up-Beat, on the Hippitie Hop side of the things, also a great listen. If you check out the Links section of Tyler's page, you'll find more great music that is very enjoyable to surf through, I recomend you have a listen when you get a chance.  So I'm off to play some Sim City, but like I mentioned, all that live music has got me into wanting to Jam again, something I haven't done since high school.  I love playing rock, alternative, all that fun stuff, so if you want to hook up, lets do it!

      Well, in this day and age, this is definatley something to stand back and go... WOW.  The Senators, with their team in termiol, are about to do something pretty amazing, and I for one hope it happens.   Patrick Lalime tries to become the second goaltender in the modern era of hockey to notch a fourth straight shutout when the Ottawa Senators host the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim tonight. Lalime has turned aside all 58 shots in Ottawa's last three contests for a franchise-record scoreless streak of 180 minutes since being pulled in a loss at Vancouver on January 8.   I downloaded the Demo of  urlLink Garage Games'  Marble Blast   and while it was ok, I don't see myself getting the full game.  It's actually quite frustrating at some parts.  You see, your a ball, and you just roll all over the place, over jumps, and around loop-d-loops and stuff, all the while way up in the air, and falling off into the great  unkown  should you stray a little too far.  Took me about 100 tries on the levels after the first one, and I was ready to kill someone!  But hey!  Maybe it's for you...  so check out the demo at least!    ~Fish Out~

      Hey Guys...    I found myself trying to kill time before Dawson's Creek starts... SHUT UP!!!.... and I went thru the Penny Arcade Archieve...  These are the ones I peed myself on.    urlLink Good Deal    urlLink Good Times!    urlLink Sarcasm at it's finest!      Does that break any copyright laws?  All comics taken from http://www.penny-arcare.com, Sw0rdfish had no input into the iedas, color, drawing or any other part of the above.  In fact, penny-arcade doesn't know who he is, who you are, nor do they probably care.     Ok so, onto todays rants....  well, nothing happened that pissed me off.  Mupiel and I hit CCRA to pick up my last paycheck, then Harvey's and then more school!  So unless you want to hear about  "Mini-processes"  and  "global variables"  then I have nothing intresting to say.  Oh yeah, Mupiel is starting his own blog finally, so go read damit! (I had a link here, but I took it down because it's still broken) Although it was being a bitch this afternoon, and wouldn't let him start it, some VB error or something!  Any of you good at art?  Like drawing stuff on a computer?  If you are, and you want to....   urlLink Email Me!  I got an offer you can't refuse, or I'll blow up your car.

      Class sucks...  Yeah thats where I am right now, and I'm actually considering bashing my head into my laptop.  I'm so bored it's not even funny.  I guess this is the downside to college instead of university, your to stupid to pick your own courses, so they pick for you and make three university programs, one.  Oh well, I'll be well rounded or something like that.  **YAWN!**  I'm glad to report that I was able to fix Everquest, without having to format.  I just reinstalled windows ontop of itself, and it worked.  However I lost all my updates and security patches, and picked up Nimda somewhere.  McAfee did a good job identifying it, to bad it didn't stop the damn thing in the first place!  While I'm here.  Whats with Microsoft and MSN Messenger, and Windows Messenger both installing themselves on the system?  God help you if you don't know how to stop these two from auto-signon.  There is programming smarts at its best!  Anyway, I'm going to try and burn LoTR - The Two Towers in class on this USB burner I brought in.  It's a big ass heavy thing, so I'm gonna make sure I use it.  I didn't lug it here for fun!  ~~Sw0rdFish~~

      So let me first start by explaining what happened...  I got on a roll today, and went nuts!  Spent about an hour creating the longest blog I have ever created, and then I hit the publish button...  Server Error!!   Ahhhh CRAP!!  Thanks to Netfirms, it didn't post properly, so I hit the back button and BAM!  The whole fucking thing is gone... EVERYTHING!!!  I was so fucking mad, I almost pid for a host (Look at me, I'm swearing!  I'm still mad!!) Anyway, I remembered Blogger saying somethign about hosting and so on, so I check it out, and I'm gonna run this free stuff for awhile, see how it goes, and then maybe if I can get my readership past 6 people, I'll pay for some extras that Sympatico doesn't let me have.  So... Let me hand you the coles notes version of my post today.  Sheridan College students, if you get dropped off, use the RIGHT lane only, let me by on the left so I can park my car without putting up with you car-poolers (thanks for saving the environment though) and tell your driver when they pull out, to watch for us since we have to go from left lane, to right turn in about 5 meters!  Since your stopped, it's my right of way!  Nuff-Said  Penny Arcade.... go there, read it.   urlLink Here!!!   Find the comic about Halo parties and shit, good times!  Steven Case or something like that, resigned as CEO of time warner, but I'm too pissed to go find the article about it, I think it was HomelanFed or something like that, but use Google I've typed enough tonigh (Thanks NETFIRMS!!!!)  Somethign else I talked about, would have been funny, but I forgot what is was, so just laugh... say that was funny... sigh, and get on with your day / night!  I have to go Mentor this new guide on the server now, he's a good guy, I'm sure you don't care.  ~Fish Out~   Note I just highlighted and selected all my text... incase

      Time for another SwordFish approved time waster!  While it's not the game of the year or nothing, it's a fun competition type game to play with your friends.  Aim for the highest score.   urlLink Free Lunch Design  has developed a fun game called  Icy Tower .  You a little homie, and you just jump from level to level trying to get the highest score you can, or the heighest floor that you can reach.  Currently my highest is 3797 at Floor 196.  I have been known to reach the 250 mark in floors, however, combos are the way to go.  If you jump over at least one floor you have started a combo, do this consecutivley, and the number of floors will continute to count, and your points are even higher for that jump.  Jump one floor at a time, and you'd have to reach floor 380 to beat me!  It's worth the download, the music is fun too.  You can download a modified sound file, but it's not necessary, unless you really like the music, in which case I'll keep you up to date on upcomming Soundtrack CD releases.

      Got a few things to discuss this here fine evening.  Maybe even a rant or two!  Links 2003! - MMM  Gaming goodness!  I played a demo of the game that came in last month's  urlLink PC Gamer  and man was it a bowl of fun.  They have developed a new " Real Time Swing " for the game.  What this means is the golfer is actually swinging, as you move the mouse.  You control club head speed, angle of contact, and follow thru all with the way you move the mouse!  It's awesome!!!  The conventional  Click! Click! Click!  method is still available, should you wimp out.  And you could always line your mouse up beside a straight wall or somethign to ensure you swing straight, but thats just not fun!  The demo had Sergio Garcia avatar on it.  Gives little wise cracks and what-not when you shank one, in pure Sergio Garcia accent!  It only had 9 Holes on the demo, but the game has 7 courses I think, and the Links courses always get release shortly after, if you want to play more, you can... or make you own using the included Arnold Palmer course designer (not sure how that helps you, maybe they give you his thought process while you build!  **shrugs**  Anyway, I'm gonna pick this one up, as soon as I get my last paycheck from CCRA, I mean " My Employer "  DON'T LEAVE!  There is More!!!  What more can I possibly have to say?  Besides asking why McDonalds employees translate "Only Lettuce" to "Overflow my sandwhich with lettuce so I don't taste the chicken please."   Well, I think it's time I explain my side project ( What??  A Side Project to something that has like 3 readers???  Oh well ) called  Fish Inc.   What is Fish Inc you ask?  Well it's another blog silly!  Only it's going to be multi-user and will hopefully include all of the Mississauga/Brampton bloggers that I know, and a few knew ones *cough* Mupiel *cough*.  We'll shoot the shit on the web page, talk about whatever (Not Porn, you guys can keep that on your own Blogs) and hopefully just have an all round good time and let others read it.  Who knows, we may say something smart!  Wanna write on Fish Inc, let me know!  It's just another thing to waste time.  I'm gonna prep the Blog over the next few days, and find somewhere to host it...  maybe Stu's ISP or something??  Even if he doesn't want in!  By the way, I got some bottle rockets I brought back from Florida, we'll have to get a digital cam, a lighter, and some shit to explode, and go out and get some cool pics oui?   Note:   Fish Inc. live day is planned to be January 13th

I went thru very drastic color changes, so bad in fact, I had the sunglasses out.  Then I had font so big, I could only fit 3 letters per line.  Accidently had one post opening inside the post after is, creating a very neat looking vortex thing, but making my posts totally unreadable.  In the end, we have this... but knowing my indecisivness, I'll call this BETA 1, since I'll be making changes here and there untill I'm totally satisfied.  I still think I'm the only one reading this  xx Fish xx

      School is offically back in full swing.  Not much to come out of Sheridan, except for the Linux install on the laptops, that is garbage to say the least.  I just formated the entire thing, and am installing Win XP, and Linux Mandrake 9.0 as we speak.  We shall see how this works out.  I'm becoming more and more comfortable with this Linux thing.  (Linux is another operating system such as Windows...  but it's free and stuff.  For those of you less computer literate.)  There are still some things that I don't get, because I dont use it very often.  Small things like, oh say... printing?  However, it does have the potential to be much more powerful, and more widely used on the home computing platform.  If it ever does, who knows.  I say we all band together, and creat Linux - Blue Drake, and go after Bill Gates.  Who is with me!!??!?!?!  On other news.  If you are a follower of both myself and  urlLink Stu , you'll notice that he posted a blurb about MSN today, and while I'll agree with him about most things.  I'll point out that ICQ does start up automatically, unless you disable it, and MSN starting with Outlook can be disabled, just go into outlook, and uncheck the box in the options.  Looks like the Sheridan IT disease is spreding to Stu.  Quick.. HELP HIM!!  ~~Fish Out~~

       Thats It!!!   The story of me, and my online names...  I'm tired of everyone saying that my name is from a movie... it's not!  For those of you who don't know this, my grandfather was a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force.  When I turned 7, he gave me a collection of aircraft cards.  He showed me all sorts of neat planes.  The Canadian plane, that came in the mail (The cards came every week) was  urlLink The Swordfish.  I started using that alias for video games, laser tag, and anything that they would let me use that many letters, alternatley I used JAG (His Call name in the air, since his initials were JAG, not that stupid show).  When he passed away while I was in grade 11 I lost his dog tags and I hung up the name.. I just didn't like the reminder.  Untill recently when I sold my Everquest account, I was using my EQ name, but that went away with the game, and so I ressurected the best name I've ever used, in honor of my grandfather and Canada.    The Swordfish was a two-place torpedo bomber used during the Second World War. Although seemingly antiquated in comparison to the Spitfire or Hurricane, the Swordfish gave a good account of itself in several battles, including the sinking of the German battleship Bismark and the raid on the Italian port of Taranto    For intrests sake, I'm going to recap my aliases..  Swordfish  BootLegger23  The Edge  RaVeN  Xott  Sw0rdFish (Why zero, instead of O...  That damn move made everyone take the damn name!)  So there you have it... do you care?  Proably not... but read it you shall! (Or did)  ~~So it is Written, And So Shall it Come to Pass... Maybe~~ ~~Quote the Swordfish evermore!~~  That was a signature experiment...  Prolly wont last

      Just when I thought I had heard it all from a Tim Horton's employee...  I walk into Timmies this morning, with my new travel mug, and ask for a double double, the girl makes my coffee, and then hands me the travell mug back, with the lid resting on top, not tightened, and she says "I didn't stir it...  Did you want it stirred?"  I stared back at her blankly thinking "No you dumbass, I enjoy bitter coffee...  I asked for a double double so I could enjoy a big sip of sugar when I'm done!"

As you may of may not have noticed in my last post, I got The Simpsons DVDs and decided I was going to track 3 things, and post them on a web site, for general knowledge.   The Episode's Name and Number (Number may be wrong, since it wasn't on the DVD.  I'm just assuming  What Bart writes on the chalk board  What happens when they sit on the couch at the end!  I'll update it as I watch, does anyone know if it's true the first aired Simpsons episode was the Christmas Special in 89? And does that make the Bart the Genious episode, 102, and not 101?  Someone  urlLink Ask Jeeves  I'm too lazy!  Besides I gotta go visit my grandparents, before they go back to Montreal!  Anyway, e-mail me the answers if you find them, and enjoy  urlLink Swordfish's The Simpsons Information page.   I'll make it pretty when I have time!

      OMG...WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  Update day!!    For my third update of the day, I'd like to present the DVDs I added to my collection this holiday season!  Aquired directly from the person, thru a gift card, or an exchange that I made because I already had the DVD they gave me!    While I'm on that subject, I went to Best Buy to return the DVD, not wanting to make the person who gave the gift upset (I hope they don't read this page) I never told them I already had it, and I had no reciept.  As is goes, I was given the current price of the DVD in exchange (What if they paid less?  That means I get more!) So I tried to get as close as I could, and BAM I thought I had it nailed, and then the computer forced the sales associate to give me a Best Buy Gift Card for the amount of 2 cents (Shown Below)...  Gotta love technology!  Naturally, my generosity got the best of me, and I have decided to raffle off the gift card to the person who can correctly identify the number of jelly beans sitting on my desk, that are lined up length-wise running north south.  Good luck to you all!  Send entries to my e-mail account :)       More pictures to come soon, since my step-dad got a Digital Camera, I'm going picture happy!

       Entertainment Weekly) -- 2002 was the year that the celebrity mea culpa became an art form.   In fact, Whitney Houston's recent interview with Diane Sawyer provided enough classic excuses to fill a top-10 list all by itself. However, we didn't want to shortchange the creativity, ingenuity, and chutzpah of the many worthy stars who spent so much of the year explaining away their misdeeds.   So, in that giving spirit, EW.com offers the 10 best celebrity excuses of the year:   10) ''I've killed enough of the world's trees.''   -- Stephen King, on his planned retirement from publishing   9) ''People think it's s---.''   -- Guy Ritchie, telling Oxford students why his ''Swept Away,'' starring wife Madonna, is going straight to video in England   8) ''Tom Sizemore is a popular and nice guy. An individual became unruly when asked to leave and was escorted out of Mr. Sizemore's house. Subsequently, the individual asked me, Mr. Sizemore's attorney, for money. This is a shakedown and we are confident that it will go away.''   -- Robert Barta, attorney for Tom Sizemore, on the actor's misdemeanor battery charge for allegedly assaulting a woman claiming to be his fiancee   7) ''All I needed was, like, five hours' sleep.''   -- Mariah Carey, on her hospitalization for ''exhaustion'' last year   6) ''All I know is, I woke up and I am covered in cream.''   -- R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, testifying that he couldn't remember an alleged air-rage incident in which he was accused of overturning a breakfast cart, because of a blackout he blamed on a drink and a sleeping pill taken on an empty stomach; he was ultimately acquitted   5) ''Sometimes when I'm sleeping, you know, it's, like, in the middle of the night I'm not, like, totally clear. I'm thinking I'm sleeping with my wife.... I'm not even attracted to you! I am 150 to 200 percent happy with the wife that I have.''   -- ''Survivor: Thailand'' castaway Ted Rogers Jr., apologizing to tribemate Ghandia Johnson, in response to her accusation that he was ''grinding'' against her in her sleep   4) ''It was the goal of these people to eliminate me. This business would have worked except for these five or six guys. They wanted to kill Michael Ovitz. If they could have taken my wife and kids, they would have.''   -- Former Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz, blaming his fall from grace on what he called the industry's ''gay mafia''   3) ''Crack is cheap.

      MSN is down, school is back on, and Pizza Pizza no longer accepts slice cards!  What is the world coming to?  First off, Pizza Pizza.  I went to get a slice of pizza for lunch, only to be told,  "Sorry, we don't stamp the cards any more!"    So with my natural sarcastic tone, I say  What if I had 9? .   To which she replies  "He Had 10!"  While pointing to a man sitting there, eating a slice!  This guy had bought 10 slices of pizza, and was owed a Free Slice, and they wouldn't honor the card!!!  Then the dumbass PAYS for a slice anyway!  I would have been on the phone with everyone including the president of Pizza Pizza, untill I got my free slice!  I just looked at the guy, looked at the manager of the store, and laughed!  I only had 2 stamps, so I didn't care that much, but still, pulling an HMV is NOT cool.    Sheridan's attempt to include Red Hat's Linux in the laptops has failed miserably so far, maybe they will fix it, but I doubt it.   Note: Pulling an HMV, is having higher prices, and offering free CDs after 10, to make it worth paying more, and then removing your reward program, while keeping your prices high.

      Back from the south, and man was it a blast!  While I won't go into too much detail, I will say that we watched a lot of football, NFL and NCAA.  However, these damn southerners care NOTHING for hockey,  I had to use the internet from my cell phone to get the score of the World Junior games, not even the newspapers or ESPN covered the results of the games!  Great job win or lose tonight!   Outcome: Pleased!  What the hell happened to the Dolphins last Sunday!?  What a pathetic effort in the second half, and you all deserve to be sitting at home watching the playoffs, you no good bums!   Outcome: Disgusting  Habs continue to slide, although the managed a few points off overtime losses, I think it's about time Jose decides to show up, and play to his ability, so we can win some damn games!  I'm on my way to see my Dad for Christmas (Yeah I know!!  It's the 6th!!!) and to watch the game, so I'll leave my postings, till I get into class tomorrow and I get my laptop!    ~~FiSh Out~~

       Meh!   Got my second review posted for Addict Gamers...  I think it sucks... urlLink [ you judge it ]   I just wasn't feeling it... not to mention I destroyed my screenshots when I unistalled the game!  Review with no pictures sucks ass...  I'll have to go find some!  What else can I BLaRg about?   urlLink [ Varation ]  gets here in a few days...  He actually thinks he's gonna "pwn Toronto", not only is he NOT going to Toronto but Mississauga, he's in for a rude awakening, cuz I'm gonna lay the SMACK!!! down on his rudy poo, British Columbia ass! [ SMACK!!! is like smack x 10 ]  Anyway, nothing is out in the stores worth buying, and thus there is nothing to review...  Penny Arcade has it's forums working again, if you into message boards and shit, they got some decent people, and if you're into having your artwork ripped apart by critics, post it there :o).  Lates for now!   EDIT: Ha!  I left out an HTML tag, and my entire page was a link to Var's Site...  good times!  OK I know you don't care!

       Home Sweet Home   I'm back, na na na na na na na na na!   Just under 4 hours from the Corel Centre to my front door, actually I was about 2 KM from the Corel Centre, but whatever.   After last night two things are clear...   Coldplay  fucking rocks live, and I now understand why no one goes to the Senator's games!  The staff at that place doesn't know their ass from their elbow.  Getting to the floor the first time was hard enough, but god forbid you want to use an ATM, conveniently places outside the gates, and of course none of the concession stands take interac.  So we're back outside the gates, and I figure I can just walk back down any isle, and get back onto the floor, that must be why they gave us these nifty bracelets...  WRoNg!  All the way back down the way we cam, half way around the arena, down more steps, and around another 2 corners, [past an ATM that no one apparently knew was there, or just wanted to get a kick out of my walk] simply to end up on the floor [basically on the ice] at the bottom of the aisle I was just standing at the top of before they made me do all that walking.  I know, I've confused you...  well thats how fucked up that place was!   The Music  opened for  Coldplay , and they were really loud, and outgoing.  It was ok, but it didn't jive well with  Coldplay 's sound.  Chris Martin, [the lead singer of CP] did his best to speak french to the crowd, was actually pretty funny, and the music was unreal, as was the energy.  Look at me thinking I'm a music reviewer...    No gaming to speak of, sorry.   Metroid Prime  continues to kick ass!  I installed some IE-Spell software, so if there are spelling mistakes, blame  urlLink [ Stu ]   Peace!

       Can I Return This Please?   Of course I'm talking about the 25cm of snow that fell last night!  What the hell was that?  Being a corner house we had about 30-35cm of snow on parts of our driveway!  Nutz!  Actually I was refering to three things with that title [now thats making the most of your title!].  Starting on Februrary 15th, EB Games a.k.a. Electronic Boutique, is no longer taking returns on games unless they are defective, in which case you can only change it for the same title.  This is something that every other store has been doing for a long time, and EB went on and off with it over the past 2 years.  Now thanks to some people who abuse the system, and use EB as a rental shop because they are too fucking cheap to go to Blockbuster and pay, it's gone... and frankly I'm dissapointed.  It used to let me buy games without fear and on the two occasions that I hated the game, I returned it.  I guess I'll have to look into stuff more before I buy it.  This brings me to the third meaning of the title.  I returned  Generals  yesterday, it was just too buggy and when I actually connected, it was like ever other RTS I've played, either "the rush" kills you in 3 minutes, or you run into some loser who has to use cheats and makes a HUGE army in about a minute and a half.  So I picked up  Metroid Prime  for my neglected GameCube, and I honestly love this game.  It brings back those old feelings of Metroid on the NES, only in a first-person-like perspective.  I can't get into it too much since I only finshed 5%, but the controls are great, just take time to get used to it.  I'll hit on it next time I blog, after I get more time on it.  All that being said, I'm heading to Ottawa tomorrow for the Coldplay concert, so don't expect anything new untill I get back Tuesday night.  Incase any Montreal Canadien reads this page...  WHAT HAPPENED?  You had them! :o( - Lets get some points and get them in the playoffs!

       As Promised   Well, I'm going to post those screenies from the opening of Medal of Honor: Spearhead.  This is part of the playable game, not a Full Motion Video or anything like that.  Also as promised, I completed the game.  It didn't take very long, was only about 9 levels, 3 missions.  Mind you the levels were pretty long, and the missions were great.  Not like the first set of missions, this one was an all out offensive, and your in the troops.  None of this behind enemy lines crap.  Your on the front line, taking the Krauts head on, and it hurts...  a lot!  Especially after you take a few panzer shots to the head, point blank.  If you've played the MoH series you know that Allied Assault takes a page or two out of  "Saving Private Ryan" , the expansion deffinatley takes a page out of  Band of Brothers  but does it well, and there is no way you'll catch me complaining about it.  For 30 Bucks, this expansion was awesome, and thats just the Single Player.  The Multiplayer maps, as previously mentioned, are awesome as well.    urlLink       urlLink       urlLink    Click on one of them to see super sized!    The pane getting destroyed is the one I just jumped out of...  some of my squadmates weren't so lucky.  I wanted to add, some of the monologues that go on during the mission recaps are pretty touching...  real poems by soilders on the battlefield.  ~FISH I.N.C~

       Demoralised   What a harsh way to tell somone that they're not good enough.  As you may or may not know, I consider myself the most rechable person I know.  If you can't get me on email, then MSN, or text messaging, call me, whatever.  Anyway, I go to check my email before class, and WHAMO!  6, count em, SIX rejection letters for employment at RIM Technologies.  So I think to myself,  "Ouch...  That stung, no worries, you applied for 6 others"  then after finishing reading the 6 letters, I hit F5 to download any new ones, and 2 more come thru.  So thats 8 in about 3 minutes.  I'm still licking my wounds.  I mean, I've been rejected for jobs before, but 8 in 3 miuntes just hurts...  None the less, I go on.  No one keeps me down long!   urlLink [ Mupiel ]  and I, smoked our way thru about 1/3rd of Medal of Honor: Spearhead last night after class, and the first sceen after jumping out of an airplane, we both sat there with our jaws to the desk as AA fire missed us and hit planes above us, below us and basically all around.  It was probbaly the best opening sequence I have seen in... well...  ever!

       Whhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnn  KABOOM!   Thats pretty much how my test went this morning.  While I don't think I failed it, I may have seriously altered my chances at getting above 80 in that course.  Not because I don't know C programming, just that he asked all the right questions that probably squeeked a mark out of me at every turn!  No point crying over spilt milk.  Time to face tomorrow's exam, and also the issue with assignment one.  Wonder how that will go down.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about.  It's probably a better idea.  Going to go have a slice of pizza with my friend who is in town from Ottawa.  Catch everyone on the flip side!

       Still a Bad Buy!    urlLink [This Issue]  is still unresolved.  The manager called me on the 24th of January, but I was " indisposed " [ read:I was on the can ] and decided not to answer the call, however had I know what would follow I would have.  He left a message saying he would call back, and he still hasn't.  I got sick of waiting and emailed them back, and they told me [ as if I didn't know what I have done and not done ] that he called me back, appologised, and he had given me a gift card for my inconvenience.  Since none of that had happened, I freaked!  First look at the way they write it, as if I'm making this shit up?   You were contacted and the issue was discussed with You. The store offered to provide a Gift Card to you for your inconvienience by the Manager Rudy Irish on the 24 January, 2003.  Please give us some details.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  We would like to thank you for shopping at Best Buy Canada.  Should you have further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us by phone at 1-866-237-8289 or email us at customerservice@bestbuycanada.ca.   Sincerely,   Dick Customer Care Best Buy Canada   Umm.. . No Dick, I wasn't contacted.  It just irks me the way they tell me what happened to myself?  How about if I called you tomorrow Dick and said "You woke up with a strange desire to have sex with a male, and then proceeded to give all your money to me."  You moron!  At least say that "Our records show" or something like that!  Anyway, moving on.  I called the phone number because I had enough of these idiots, and I ended up getting the Regional Manager's phone number.  So she's gonna hear from me, not about the original incident, but the incompetence of her employees and their shitty customer service skills.  Fuck the gift card, you have to give me a shopping spree to catch me back in that store.  If Futureshop / Best Buy wasn't the only major store of it's kind, I'd boycott them all, but I'll be damed if that store manager at Heartland is going to make any money from profit sharing off me!

       Oh Baby, Baby It's a Wild World   You know...  I don't sleep well.  I never claimed I did, but on days when I have very important things to do early the next morning, I cna't sleep at all!  I got a few hours in, but I woke up thinking I was late, and now I've scared myself awake.  I tried doing what my dad suggested, picked up a book... read a lot of it, didn't help, so I started to cruise the world wide web [ or is it World Wid Web? ]  None the less, I decided I was going to check out all sorts of Blogs, after linking to one from  urlLink [Mupiel's] , and I have one conclussion; the world is a big ass place, with lots of people, and they all have a lot to say!  For Example:   urlLink [World Wide Wen]  - Woman in the midst of a dissertation for school I think.  Poor girl is losing her mind    urlLink [Weekly Rant]  - It looked fresh, but his comment about Micheal Jackson vs. Joe Millionaire was pretty funny!    urlLink [What the Fuck Wrestling]  - Pure insanity!  This guy I know from Gamespot helps with it.  It's like a fake wrestling thing    urlLink [Where the Hell Did My Job Go]  - Someone looking for job!  It's pretty funny!    urlLink [Merk]  - No Clue!  Something about a strawberry    urlLink [sXe_chicana]  - Girl got dumped, guy is a dick...  She blogs about it!    urlLink [Is That Legal?]  - A law professor with way too much time on his hands.  He updated about 10 times today alone!  Grade some papers!    urlLink [Vegetarian Mouse Slayer]  - Aussie woman living in the UK I think!  Just a journal, but it caught my eye, maybe the name?    urlLink [blog of a loser]  - Another blog much like mine :o)  Except he's in England, and he's only 16.  Gives him time to become cool before he ends up like me at 22.    urlLink [Swish Cottage]  - I don't know, but the middle picture on Sunday's post killed me!  TWAT!  I guess I'll leave it at that.  I viewed about 100 blogs in the last few days, these are a few that I saved.  I do that a lot.  I see something I want to blog about, I'll just add it to my favorites, and come back to it when I have nothing to write about.  Hope you enjoy it.  I'm going to go and study a little more, and think about the size of this world.  Oh yeah, I'm going to change my template again.  This one just doens't float!  ~Out~

So I don't mess up all my tables ]    Proggie is called Windows Blinds, and I forget the website, or I'd link to it.  Everytime I tried to type in that URL off the top of my head, I got some lame page with 350 pop-ups.  Speaking of which, I stopped using that browser, it was not allowing some pictures to load, and it came with some lame Weather Cast P.O.S. software.  ~Out~

       The Dog Ate My Homework   Well...  not exactly.  You see my exam that I studied for till 3am in the morning, was cancelled by our teacher, 15 minutes after it was supposed to start.  Why you ask?  Somehow a computer science teacher, managed to corrupt a document.  Something I haven't been able to do since I stopped using floppies.  I mean, HOW?  Email it to your account at school, go to school, and print it up.  Why is it that this teacher gets away with it, but when I use to say my document got corrupted and wouldn't print, the teacher would look at me and say " Well, who's problem is that?   [Just once I wanted to say "Hewlett-Packard's apparently!"].   Not to mention waiting 15 minutes before the test to actually print it out!  Don't get me wrong, having an extra two weeks is a god-sent, but I was ready to kick some ass, and now I gotta wait two more weeks.  Such is life I guess.  Looks like I'm going to hold on to Generals.  It's still buggy as hell, and I think EA needs to have someone kick them in the teeth.  However, I learned today I have a lot to learn after getting my ass handed to me on a silver platter...  by the medium difficulty CPU controlled army!  I think I have an inability to do 500 things at once.  So I get screwed in RTSs.  While I'm on the topic of Electronic Arts, here's my idea.  The next time they come out with a big launch, I'm going to push to see if I can get people NOT to buy it on the first three days or so.  Since the first day the game is never out anyway, and then you buy it on the second, you’re only missing out on about a day and a half.  Assuming the game comes out on Tuesday, it will leave you purchasing the game Friday afternoon, right on time for a weekend game fest.  It's just to let those money hungry bastards know that YOU notice they are slacking, and that YOU will not stand for a continued string of released games that are obviously nowhere close to 100% completed.  Now all I have to do is convince a good 50% of hardcore gamers that it will make a difference.  Stay tuned!  For those of you that don't visit  urlLink [ Stu's Site ] . I recommend  urlLink [ this, for a good laugh ]   If you have Winamp,  urlLink [ this skin ] is a MUST!  Especially the cool feature where you double click it, and it compacts into a skinny bar at the top of your screen, with all the buttons still there!

      I just finished some more studying for my  Computational Method's  exam that I have tomorrow afternoon.  I took about a 45 minute break to play some Medal of Honor:Allied Assult, and I finally beat it.  Took me some time, not to mention getting my game erased 4 times, but it's finished.  First time I beat a game in a REAL long time.  I buy too many games that don't have an end...  or else I usually lose intrest before reaching the end...  yeah me!

       Books, Online Games, and a soapbox!   I'm not sure what relevance that has to anything I'm about to touch on, but you know what?  It sounded cool!    First subject today is something that all bloggers shouldn't be without...   urlLink A book on blogging   Now let’s just think about this...  how stupid does one have to be to have to be to purchase this book. I can see the first page;   You press the keys on keyboard*[see definition of keyboard below] so that what you are thinking appears on the screen.  You dumb ass!  Thanks for your twenty bucks    followed by 364 pages that when flipped fast is a picture of the author giving you the finger and stuffing your 20 bucks in his back pocket!  You can even view the first 64 pages...  this guy actually wrote more than 64 pages on blogging?  What the fuck!?  Why can't I make money like that!    Speaking of money making scams, Mupiel and I were discussing that making a million bucks was as simple as convincing a million people to give you a dollar!  He laughed, but I'm convinced I can do it.  Don't make a fool of me, send me your dollar, or give it to me, and I'll start collecting.  One dollar!  it's a coffee!  I'll just talk non-stop for about 15 minutes, same effect as caffeine, and you get to be informed.  If you think I'm joking I'm not.  Email me, and I'll give you my mail-to address, and you can send me the buck.  For my American fans, it'll cost you about 65 cents including postage, let the fund begin, I'll even start a page that list my donators! [this idea is copyrighted, if you steal it, I reserve the right to bite you]  I've been using Avant Browser, but I noticed that some pictures don't open like they are supposed to.  What gives? Oh well, time to unistall, I don't have time to debug browsers, just so I don't get flooded with pop-ups  RIGHT!  This blog is supposed to be gaming related...  well, I'm busy as shit, and I got 3 mid-terms this week, so gaming takes a back seat, and I only play once a day instead of 3... That being said, there are rumours out about trainers for C&C: Generals, which sucks ass.  Why people have to cheat is beyond me.  I'm working on a rant made for  urlLink Gamespot's Gamespotting  so after it doesn't get picked, I'll let you guys read it.    If this blog is making little sense, you can blame Mupiel, he told me to play really loud music while I write, lets you " Not Think ."  Yeah, I didn't think it was such a great idea either, I'll let you decide.  I'd ask you to email me and tell me, but apparently you're all too lazy to submit you opinion thru e-mail since every time I ask, no one fucking answers!  Useless buggers! Keep reading though... ok?  I'm on a roll tonight, one final thing.  On the topic of commenting, I'm trying to learn ASP to set up a comments section after each blog, but I really don't have the time, so if anyone wants to do it... let me know, and we can talk.  Thanks  Ok Avril is on, time to shut this crap off, good idea Mupiel, now my brain is going crazy...  some may say it's Complicated...pun intended [That was funnier in my head... should have stayed there.  Peace!

       Revenge ON the Nerds    urlLink This had me rolling!!!   In other news, EA managed to mess things up trying to patch their C&C Servers... I'm still not sure if they are working, I'll try again tomorrow.  I'm going to the hockey game tomorrow, hopefully the Sens don't put me to sleep before the second period [damn trap].  I'm going to be getting my  General's  review up on addictgamers, as soon as I can get a couple of hours of online play in.  It's rather frustrating.  I also got a PR package from some company called Oxeygen, I'll have to check that out as well.    I'm pretty sure that tomorrow I'll be stepping away from Everquest for the last time.  I don't have the time to put into guiding, and I don't have the money to put in to playing only 2 hours a week.  If anyone wants a full EQ set, including planes of power, and a few shitty characters, let me know.  I'll see if we can work something out, and make sure you don't have trouble reactiviating the account.  It'll cost you less than the EQ Gold set cost you in stores, I would just hate for it to go to waste, but then again, maybe I'll have an urge to log in one day.  None the less, email me if you're intrested, but just so you know, it's agains the rules :)

       Mornin'   What the hell am I doing up this early?  Yeah sucks!  I'm at school doing some stuff, so I'm taking 5 minutes out there to address my millions....AND millions of fans!  OK I'm exagerating, but it's my blog and I can do what I want!  Hardly touched a game in a few days.  I got C&C Generals, but my play time with it has been pretty limited... I will say however that the online menu's and lobby are the worst I have ever seen in any game.  Apparently they are addressing it this afternoon, so it's going to remain in my possesion untill after this patch.  You got 12 days EA, and then I return the game to EB.  The single player is a joke, I sat for 15 minutes and beat the first two levels no time flat... Hard [their second hardest difficulty setting] is moderate, at best.  They have a setting called Brutal, but I can't see the challenge being that high.  This is again, a multiplayer specific game, and in the RTS world... it's more rush rush rush, and I hate that.  I'll give it a try, but I can't see spending 75 bucks on this game, I got a deal on it, but still... not worth my bones.  Way to fuck up another release EA!

       GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAL   w00y!  Giving up on Database for the night, and I'm going to get some sleep soon, so I can take care of it all in the AM.  For those of you who missed it. The Azzuri [Italian National Soccer Team] took on, and smacked the Portugalo's back to Portugal!  1-0, but the game wasn't even close... not counting the shot off the "woodwork".  I got my first review done for addictgamers [I should probably link there] today after I finished my damn C program.  Next project is to be working on a review for  Command and Conquer: Generals  as it stands now the game is going back, it's way too choppy on my system, and I'm running a 1.4AMD.  I'm suspecting it's my PC acting funny, but I haven't had time to look at it much since I got it, maybe sunday! :o(   In the meantime, have a  urlLink [ PB and Jam Sammich ]   And check out the Blogs I linked to. They are all great reads!  Thanks to all of you for reading my blog.  Ezikiel man, it was awesome, and surprising to hear from you!  Drop me a line sometime between killing Sol Ro, and stuffs!

       I'm an Addict!!!   Fish in the Heezey!~  OK I just finished [read:gave up] on my C programming assignment, and I'm calling it a night, but I wanted to post an update about me before I do so.   urlLink | Addictgamers |  have decided to add me to their staff roster as a game reviewer...  one step closer to my dream job at PC Gamer [where the hell is my new issue BTW!].  Now I have excuses for buying new games, and hopefully I'll get some perks that make my writing worth the time!  Not that making people not buy a shitty game isn't worth the time.  Like Sum of All Fears...  holy shit is IT bad.  I haven't played it, but I think the highest score I've seen it get is like a 3.  Apparently a maximum of one and a half hours of gaming doesn't score high with point systems...  not to mention the god damn radar that tells you where the enemies are hiding, which one you make line of sight with them and shoot, the cool auto-aim feature makes sure you can't miss so that they can....  GASP...  kill you!  Who the hell gave the go on this crap?  Please, it's like watching a movie, only you have to keep pressing the go button to make it play!  Idiots!  ~Fish Out~

         I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules or controls, borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

       Var Does Toronto   Yes...  yes he does.  March 5th to be exact.  My buddy from BC is moving in to make my home Mississauga's  Game Central .  He's kinda like me when it comes to gaming, except I'm much better!  So when he gets here, ya'll have to be nice to him, even thought you probably wont like him!  [That was sarcasm and a pot-shot at Var]  I'm thinking once he gets here, we all need to hook up for a huge ass LAN-Party...  I'll bring the router, ya'll bring the PCs and games!  Habs took one from Washington tonight, after taking a sound ass kicking from the leafs last night.  Odd thing was Garon was in net.  I'm getting the feeling that the Habs are over confident playing infront of Theodore, they expect him to stop everything, and naturally, thats not gonna happen.  Not every night anyway!

       Party Like its Saterday February 8th   Good times, good times!  That’s all I have to say about my first ever Mario Party 4... uhh..  party!  It was awesome!  Mupiel myself and the ladies went all out on a game of MP4 [name is too long to type] and I had a blast.  Basically the game is a board game, played on the GameCube with a twist.  That twist?  An abundant of little mini-games, and battles in which the players compete in things like three throw competitions, butterfly catching, and good old fashion line tracing, [don't ask] all the while using avatars from generations of your favourite Mario games! [Wish it was all of Nintendo, Link's absence was a distraction to me all night]  As if you hadn't figure it out by now, I had a great time, and I plan on picking this game up when I can find a cheap copy, only because I'm poor though, it's worth the $70.00, although I can't see hours of enjoyment on it, unless you have a multitude of people to play it with, trash talking was the best part.  Mupiel somehow managed to win the game, and I came in dead last, I didn't even get one freakin star!  Board games will never be the same for me again [never mind that it's been 5 years since I played one], Mario Party 4 is the perfect game to play with 4 or more people, probably one of the best for a larger group[when you only have one console of course].  On top of all that gaming goodness it's got more replay value than most of your everyday board games, and most of the video games out there today, so you see, it's a win-win!  In other news, Mupiel's gerbil can rip apart a toilet paper roll in under 5 minutes!

       Remember the Good Old Days?   When I used to actually post?  Sorry it's been so long, doesn't happen often, but I should post something, keep my readers from losing intrest.  I guess you all deserve an explanation...  So here it is.  Since Wednesday evening, I have done nothing but play Battlefield 1942 on my spare time.  I love the new expansion, and also the web site that Stu pointed out to me that tracks muh progress.   urlLink http://www.bfstats.com  you don't even have to sign up, it just tracks you.  So if you have played any sort of online Battlefield, then hit the website, and type in your screen name, see how your doing.  My screen name is -=sw0rdfish=- but I'm not doing very well.  Now...  I lied...  I know it's wrong, and I'm sorry (There I go with the ... again).  I have also been spending a bit of time on this unreleased beta of an online game called  urlLink There.   Now I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about, but who cares... you can get the just of it from the website.  To me it seems like an alternate life, you have to spend money in real life to purchase money inside the game, and you can buy stuff for your online character, hoverbords, buggies, clothing and hairstyles.  Thats the extent of the game though, I don't see any indepth play time.  There is talk about adding Jobs that you can do, to earn some money, but then they would have to incorporate a monthly fee, (theres that  Reoccuring Revenue  again) or they wont make any money.  However, like I told everyone I talked to before I even played it, if they get a high enough player count, they can put up advertiesments all over the place, and make a killing on it.  Imagine my surprise last night, when I went to try on some new clothing, to see an entire "store" of Nike clothing...  I just smiled and ran my avatar to the 99 cent shirts... shit I only have a certain amount of free money that they gave me...  it's gotta last till Beta ends... no way I'm paying for fake money.  The other alternative way to make money is to design objects, or paintjobs for existing objects and then pay to have the object listed.  Everytime somone buys one, you get the money for it, in game money of course.  Stay tuned, and I'll keep you informed!  One last thing, some good new on my end.  I notice someone in the Gamespot forms, and I emailed him regarding the site, to make a long story short, you may see some "sw0rdfish originals" game reviews on the site in the near future.   urlLink addictgamers.com  I think thats the URL.  Fish Out!  Oh, and sign my damn guest book!  I waited a week, no one noticed it... Now I gotta tell you... SIGN IT...  pretty please :o)  **Bats Eyelashes**

      Ok, so I just finished a 3 hour online session of Road to Rome, and let me tell you.  I'm ready for three more, except my stomach keeps b*tching for food.  Before I eat, I want to get this down for anyone who cares.  Value on this expansion is unreal.  For 20 bucks, you can't go wrong.  New Vehicles:  First you have the tanks, while a little difficult to use a lone, with the help of a team mate, these things are lethal.  The Cannon has limited aiming, naturally, to about 90 degree straight ahead (45 each way) but with someone on the top using the 360degree high-powered gun.. not machine gun like, more power, less precision needed, brutal damage to those pesky Panserrachets(sp?) and Bazookas. They put in a few new weapons, nothing major, mostly just stuff to fill out the new armies, and they through the engineers a bone, giving them standard bayonets for close range hand-to-hand...  still wimps, but can take out a tank in seconds.  The armies are simply for fun, I didn't notice anything beneficial about them, new guns and the sort equal their counterparts.  However with the new expansions comes the new Italian Maps, and boy are they a blast.  Setting is definitely Italian in the ones I spent most of my time on...  Very neat Mountain/Hill based levels, with flags on top, and the bottom.. Sucks being on the bottom, but then that’s all part of the fun right?  Grab a plane, drop behind enemy lines, and go bock on some poor sap looking over the edge while you fire your cannon up their ass.  I don't think  I played all the new maps, I tried, but every time I got started on a server, I got smoked, and had to stick around to make up for myself...  I'm not doing to great with this game lately, doesn't help that on the one map near the beach we lost all the flags, minus one, and they surrounded us, up  on cliffs and hills, and proceeded to blank us in grenades, carpet bombing from above, and tanks from the outside...  I think I died 10 times in the span of 3 minutes...  not fun.  What else can I say about this, other than it gets sw0rdfish's approval of value, excellence, and pure gaming goodness?  If you enjoy the original, the expansion is a must.  Best part about Battlefield is bfstats.com, IMO anyway.  I love stats, and this web site tracks all sorts from various servers.  While I can't get the "play” option to work from the site, just logging in through battlefield to a server that they monitor will count stats.  This is for all of Battlefield, not just the expansion.  As far as the single player goes, I didn't even try.  Bots are probably still pretty stupid, but when it comes to Battlefield it's an Online game, with offline capabilities...  if you want offline, stick with Medal of Honor.

       Tragedy...  And I never heard about it?   I didn't do much today other than recover from whatever kicked my ass last night, and did some homework.  So I don't got much to say on that.  I'd like to touch on something that irked me today.  I don't follow the news 100%, but I read the paper daily, which is to say I skim thru and read articles that catch my eye.  I see the news now and again, but most of my info I get on those news breaks and everything.  As well as the skimming.  Now as many of you may or may not have heard, 7 Grade 10 students died in BC on Saturday in an avalanche, the same day of the shuttle incident, and I'm a little dumbfounded as to why the shuttle got on so many front pages, news bulletins, and top stories, yet the tragic loss of 7 kids is a back seat especially here in Canada.  I'm not weighing one life against another, but those Astronauts died doing their job, they knew the risk, and they have my respect, and are hero's for it...  but these students were out on a field trip, and it cost them their lives, and myself, the average news watcher, doesn't find out till 2 days later when it finally makes the front page, because they didn't find any debris from the shuttle that day.  I'll take some of the blame, because I focused in on top stories only, but I didn't get to chose the top stories.  Now that I think about it, the incident did cross my path, but I never knew it was recent, or that it happened in BC, because all it was, was 7 faces in the top 1/10th of The Star, and it said "Loss" and right under it... taking up the other 9/10th was the picture of the shuttle.  Both Tragedy, both devastating, one covered, one forgotten.  But that’s just me...

       New Games, New Patches and The Flu   All 3 things I own, or intend to own by tomorrow evening.  Starting with the Flu.  Got home from school today, and WHAMO!  I feel like one of them Mack trucks ran me over on the way home or something.  Painfull, sleepy, tired, sore.  You name it, I got it...  and it bites!  I think I'm going to bed after this!  Anyway, onto important topics.  Battlefield release patch 1.3.  A bunch of new stuff.  Hit up  urlLink Gamespot  to get all the details.  I happen to have the patch sitting on my Hard Drive, so if you want it and don't have a Gamespot account, and you don't want to wait in line at FilePlanet.  MSN me, and sw0rdfish will hook you up.  While I'm on the subject of Battlefield 1942, tomorrow is the release date for the expansion pack  Road to Rome  for $30CDN you can't go wrong...  and the best part is I'll get to wear the Italian flag, second best thing to adding in the Canadian flag, guess Diepe wasn't enough!  There are a bunch of new releases coming out in the next week or so.   Unreal II , and  Command and Conquer: Generals  to name a couple.  The former is getting complaints of weak game play, and the latter is getting what every EA Published game is getting latley...  "It's really buggy!!!!"   Again, Gamespot forums, and other places like IGN (Yucky!) have feedback, and previews posted, but I'm too wiped to read them all and fill you in.  After I hear more I'll make some noise about it, if it's worth making noise about.  One last thing, the gas companies are stringing us all along.  I doubt very much it's coincedence that every time the gas prices are high, them come down on Sunday, only to have them all go back up on Monday, except one.  One company keeps them low for that extra day, and everyone freaks cuz they are getting a great deal on gas...  71 cents instead of 80... Thats not a deal, they mess with your min and make you think your saving, when a week ago it was 65cents... See how they scam us?  Bastards.  Then again, with the 8 cent raise per liter, it only costs you 4 bucks extra, per 50 liters (my tank is about that size, if that). So why bother searching... just stop, and pay the lousy 4 bucks, and save yourself the time and trouble.  Thats what I say anyway.  ~SickFish~

        My thoughts are with those who struggle to understand why their loved ones are not coming home following today's tragic Columbia Space Shuttle disaster    "We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God" - Ronald Reagan    God Bless.     I will resume regular posts tomorrow.  This is my flag at half-mast.

       A Monthly What?!!!   Yeah that’s what I said when my friend Variation told me, about 3 years ago, about Everquest, and the fact that you had to pay a monthly fee for it!   "10 Bucks a Month, to play a video game??  Are you serious?"  He was, and so began my monthly cash drain.  Now before I go any further, you ever hear a loud noise while you're sleeping...  and then you just can't get back to sleep?  Well this is why I'm up at 3:16am on a Saturday morning.  You see, our neighborhood is on the fritz, and the power is surging about 4 times and hour.  Well, me being the brain that I am decided it was a good idea to leave the Sheridan laptop on my desk.  Kasey (my cat) decided he was going to nap on it, well, the power surged, he freaked and ended up sending the laptop flying.   BOOM!   So I jumped about 6 feet off my bed, looked around...  saw a tail leaving the room, and threw my teeth-guard at him.  Stupid animal!  Stupid Hydro!  Apparently  urlLink I'm not the only one with power issues.   Now that my heart rate is pounding, I thought I'd share some interesting information with all of you.  Especially if you own an X-Box!  Apparently Microsoft plans on releasing a new slimmer, sleeker X-Box, with the same specs as the other, only this one would cost...  $99 USD.  The catch?  You have to sign up for X-Box Live, which they plan on charging for, using a monthly cost system similar to MMOGs of today.  Now!  This is my thoughts, and I'm bias because I'm not a huge console kinda guy.  Why bother?  I mean, games on consoles aren't that great to warrant you passing up on a free online FPS on your PC, that Joe from Utah can host on is own computer.  The reason you have to pay (or will have to pay) for X-Box live, and I'll assume the PS2 soon, is because MS and Sony have to run servers for these gamers to play on, you can't host a game on your X-Box, at least not yet!  Call me old fashion, but I'll stick to my PC.  No matter how advanced consoles get, they will never beat my PC, and I love my PC!  Anyway, the fact is that if you own a console, and the online gaming is a huge part of it, then I recommend that you adjust your budget to include a monthly fee for the online service, starting next year sometime... and if they start charging per game also, you’re in a heap of trouble!

       Another Must Win   We got another must win game tonight for CST F.C.  Playing a tough team, but if we work together [ and everyone shows up ] it should be a good game.  I was looking over the hit count on my site, and found  urlLink [ this ]  referal.  What kind of a moron actually searches that info up on the internet?  Maybe I should turn in his IP address to the proper authorities...  maybe I'll just chuckle about it, and wonder why only Waldo gets hits on searches for "Milk Squirters"  My girlfriend cleaned my room on firday, she couldn't stand how messy it was.  I don't blame her, and I love her for doing it, but every time somone tidys my room, I can't find shit for the next three days.  For example, I know that my extra Cat5 cable, with the crimper, were on the floor, under my SQL Bible, and right next to the shirt I wore three weeks ago Tuesday.  I'm sure most of you know what I mean.  Gaming will go like this in the time I have this week.  Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Tenchu, Zelda, Zelda, Winning El..., Zelda, ...ven 6 [ yes thats possible, unplug the PS2 a/v cables, and plug in the GameCube ones, never turning off the power. ]  ~Fish Out~    P.S. Note to slef, never forget to close off your "a href" tag... things get ugly

       Layin' The Smack Down   You ever have those nights, where you are so tired, that you can't sleep?  Tonight is one of those nights.  I've been entertaining myself, by reading this great feature on Gamespot that covers  urlLink [ The History of Zelda ]    I've enjoyed it so far, and I plan on finishing it when I've had some sleep.  My gaming over the past three days have been pretty much limited to  Zelda: The Wind Walker  and  Pokemon: Sapphire  depending on where I am, and who's using the TV.  This Zelda is by far one of the best games I've ever played...  and that is saying a lot.  I mean, I've played a lot of games, and this one, is just eating the cake.  Obviously it wont retain the replay value of a  Battlefield 1942  or  Counterstrike , but for initial  WOW , hands down winner.  I'm going to be taking an in depth look at  Tenchu  and  Winning Eleven 6  for the PlayStation 2 when I'm not playing Zelda.  I'm sure that Shaharum is expecting some reviews for the games he hooked me up with.  Did I mention that I could get used to this PR stuff with free games?  Now about today's title, it's making reference for the " Greatest Spectacle in Sports Entertainment " that will be taking place later today.  Of course I mean Wrestlemania...  I'm going to be watching it, only because I think Hogan is gonna be in his last match, it just makes sense.  I don't think any sports oriented male my age, wasn't at one point or another a Hulkamaniac...  I've ripped countless shirts off my chest, and I've "Hulked out" on my friends after taking a pizza pan to the head more times than I can count.  He is the icon, and unless he wants to pull a Jordan, and leave when he's down...  Wrestlemania is the place to do it.  So here’s to one more ripped shirt, and one last leg drop...  maybe.  ~Fish Out~   Today's post dedicated to Mupiel and Wife.  My thoughts go out to them and their family who's grandmother is ill.  God bless

       Things Lookin' Up   Well, today's soccer game went much better, for the team anyway.  I played like shit, but in the end we came out with the 5 - 3 win, and I didn't get suspended.  I've been playing  Zelda: Wind Waker  the last two days, I got a free copy from a PR guy I know.  I was pretty stoked about that.  Then today,  Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven , and  Winning Eleven 6  show up at my door.  For free, from  urlLink [ AddictGamers ] , again free... or were they.  UPS charged me 61.00 for "Tax and Brokerage".  Ok Tax, I get.  GST, PST...  no problem.  What the fuck is brokerage though?  So I call UPS, and the bitch on the other end of the line tells me that brokerage fees are what UPS charges for having to do all the paper work on a ground shipment.  This pissed me off, but you know what, life is full of fees, and thats a battle I'm never going to win.  HOWEVER!!!!  Get this, I asked why they were higher this time, then they were the last time I got a package.  She says "because this time the value of the package was more"  Can someone explain to me how paper work for a $5 item, is any different from the paper work for a $1,000 item?  I was so pissed off, and I even asked her that, and she just kept repeating "thats the fee, for that price range of items.  I swear, any way to make a buck!  So in the end, I pay 60 bucks, for two games I hadn't planned on buying, and now I'm thinking, how the hell can I get around this bullshit, so I can review games for a website, get free games.  I mean, out of all this shit over 2 video games, the only company who makes a killing off of it, is UPS!    Whatever, I hold my view in life, that there are only 2 companies that are really worth running.  Banks and a shipping company.  Both rob you blind.  Anyway, whats a guy to do.  I need some sleep.  got a long day of Zelda tomorrow!  [ oh yeah, and school ]

       Less is More!   OR something like that.  I still don't get it, because I don't think less of anything, is ever more.  Anyway, the soccer season continues to go to hell.  7-2 we lost today, I was serving my one game suspension for "removing another players hands from aroundmy neck".  Soccer City league is going just as bad.  Maybe we'll win again before the end of the season.  I've been a pretty busy beaver over the last 2 days.  My only gaming is basically in bed before I go to sleep, with Pokemon and Zelda: Link to the Past for the Gameboy Advanced.  Both great games, I'll touch on them when I got more time.  No links, no reviews, no nothing...  just letting you all know I'm alive... incase you were worried.

       The Double Entendre!   w00y!  Starting today, until I get an ASP thing working, we can comment on my posts.   urlLink [ here ] .  I'll start topics, or else you can go and start them yourself, I'll even link there when I'm not lazy!  So, todays topic just,  came  to me...  well sorta.  Kinda like the way my new  Gameboy Advanced SP  just  came  to me.  It's the ultimate marketing ploy, the collector's dream, and the poor man's worst nightmare...  the re-release!  I'll be the first to admit that I'm a sucker for it, but then again, I can't be the only one.  Why would Sony re-release things just so I buy them...  right?  While the GBAsp isn't exactly a re-release, its a Gameboy Advance...  with... [ wait for it ] added bonuses.  Namely the light, and the rechargable batteries.  I've been lacking and missing Gameboy since Gameboy Colour came out, and I felt like a lose toting around my big ass Gameboy, with a black and white screen.  So I figured this wasn't me getting sucked into it, I resisted the first release, and they got me on the second.  It does however lead me into today's blog.  Why we must always have EVERYTHING, that the release.  DVDs, Videogames, VHS, they are all abord the re-release/special edition train... and I don't see it ending anytime soon.  Personally, I have a feeling I'm going to be owning about 4 copies of  Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring  by the end of 2004, and who knows how many re-releases they have.  After all Peter Jackson said so himself... he's all about the bonus DVD features.  This may get costly.  In the end its all a matter of opinion, self control, ego, and the size of your wallet.   Do I NEED that?, I'll just wait for the trillogy to come out!, Am I truly a fanif I don't have it on it's release day?, It's only 20 bucks!!!   There you have the biggest excuses I have given myself for buying or not buying...  but mostly buying, special editions, extended editions, and the dreaded  Box Set .  I've done it since I was able to beg my mom to buy me that G.I. Joe, and then buy me the same G.I. Joe but with a blue hat, and I'm sure I'll continue to do it for the rest of my life.  Thru the nagging kids, the logical thinking wife, and the little angel that sits on my right shoulder, the left shoulder will  ALWAYS  have the right decision, and I wouldn't have it any other way!  ~QuOtH the sw0rdfish...

       We Live In a Beautiful World...   ... yeah we do, yeah we do!  There are some nights, [ like tonight ] where I want to blog, but I just can't think of anything to blog about.  I end up walking around the house, thinking, and writing out a blog in my head, until I think of something that I think people will want to read.  After all, thats the point of it, to get you to come back and read more.  I still don't have anything relevant to blog about.  The only thing on TV and in the News is the War, and regardless of it's rightness/wrongness I'm sick of hearing about it, like it's some blockbuster movie.  I was gonna touch on the subject of cheating, but that didn't seem to smart.  Comics?  Bah, not in the mood.  Cookies!!!  Always in the mood for cookies, but alas there is only so much you can write about cookies.  So I was left with no topic, and no real reason to post anything.  However, having something here for new comers to read is important to me, so I figured, "Shit...  I'll write about not being able to write.  Thus this post is born!  Check out the newest member to "Better Blogs"  They got six blogs on one page, I thought that was pretty freakin cool!  Thanks Mupiel for showing it to me.  I just thought of something to mention.  Online Gaming Squared...  sound familiar?  Yeah it was my useless message board that never really took off.  Well I'm going to give it one more shot.  There are no "Great" communities on the net, so I figure, one with people I know and a few drifters wouldn't be a bad idea.  So, I'm going to fix it up, and link to it again, maybe we can get something going again, or maybe it'll drift off into nothing, to be swallowed into the giant black hole that is... "Outdated URLs"  [ that sounded funnier in my head ]

       Pleh   Not much going on lately, so that means, not much to blog about.  It's about halfway thru the Habs - Isles game, and it's already 3 - 0 Isles.  I guess that spells the end of the Canadien's season.  In the end they don't really deserve it this year, they haven't played at all this year.  I'll have to find somone else to root for.  With 4 Canadian teams making it, I'll just hope that the cup comes north of the border since '93.  So whats up with the world latley?  I don't even feel like talking about it.  The war in Iraq, right or wrong, sucks.  ~Fish Out~

       Can't Sleep   So I'll make an attempt to make you laugh.  Or smile.  You know. Thats what it's about.  If one person smiles, then it's worth it.  Thats how I see it.  This isn't where I was headed with the post, but anyway, when you can make one person smile, then the day is worth it!  Unless you went around making people cry the rest of the day!  Then your a dick!  I.E.  urlLink [ Texan Being a "Dick" ]   It's official, the world has stolen my idea! Stu stole my Tag board, call the authorities!!  In all honesty, I'm just messing around.  I'm still trying to get a ASP type comments section after each post, but I don't have a  fucking clue how to do it.  Apparently no one who reads my site knows how either.  Someone learn!  I'm too lazy.  This is one of those weird posts.  I'm just typing without thinking at all, so it's probably not flowing at all, and since I never re-read my posts [ for fear of selling out on something I've posted ] I don't expect it to change.  When I can't sleep I go to  urlLink [ Blogger ]  and check out the Links on the left of most recently updated Blogs...   urlLink [ This guy has worse grammar than I ].   We need to introduce him to IE Spell... I'm gonna send him an email with nothing but that in it.  See what happens.  For the love of Pete!  2:11am, and I still can't sleep.  I've been working on this blog for a good hour now, maybe thats why?  Well Winamp just pulled a Windows, and now I can't even get it to start w/o logging out.  So I'm gonna shut up now, maybe I'll count sheep...  better yet, I'll buy a Serta!  ~Peace~

       Just a Day...   ...Just an, Ordinary day!  I went to the bank this afternoon to cash in some Canadian Savings Bonds, from like 1989.  So after 14 years of interest, $100.00 given to the government was now worth, $215.00.  w00y for me, not so w00y for the person who thought it would one day be worth more.  Ten Bucks a year isn't a bad rate on a loan, where can I get an interest rate like that?    Was a bad three days as far as soccer goes.  We got routed 8-1 at Soccer City [ my last time ever playing keeper ] and then we lost 4-3 to  Box Plot Outliners  at Sheridan, I was expecting a team full of nerds with a name like that.  I don't doubt half the team was just to fill in for sick players.  I wasn't playing keeper in this one, but still managed to be responsible for a goal.  Laziness really.  I scored a couple, so I'll leave that game with a positive, and aim for a win on Friday versus,  Hydro Chronic  [ Creative names huh? ]  If  Our Lady Peace  sales suddenly jump in Norway, I'll claim direct responsibility.  I got one of my groupies [ thats you the readers ] listening to them out there.  I'm sure they are played now and then, but not as much as they should be.  Spread the word Sol, and then when they ask, tell them Xott sent ya!  What else could I talk about...  War in Iraq?  No thanks, glad Chretien is waiting on UN...  did I spell that right?  Chretien?  Right or wrong, Iraq is not gonna be a nice place to be in the next few days.  Makes me wonder though, if they know they have 48 Hours, whats stopping them form blowing something up in the US in 36?  No I don't expect them to unleash 100 Stealth bombers, but I'm sure they know a guy or two sitting in a hotel somewhere just waiting to give his life up for a better life or something insane like that.  I'm just glad my house isn't a National Landmark.  I'm gonna go do something productive now, and maybe later I'll blog again.

       Would You Like to Biggie Size That?   I say no, and then I still end up with " Biggie Fries ."  You know what the problem is?  Naming conventions.  They make no fucking sense!  Primary example, Starbucks [ I'm too lazy to link there ].  They have 3 sizes,  Grande, Tall, Venti .  Which one is the small?  Beat me!  You see, it makes no damn sense, unless your a Starbucks' regular, then there is no way to know.  how do you even pronounce them?  Tall is easy, but after that, fuck it.  I still use Large, Small and Medium when I go there.  Anyway, this came from my journey to the car wash.  The attendant said "Ultra, Supreme, or Total," all I wanted to do was wash the salt off my car, so I wanted a basic wash, but which one was it?  Assuming he went smallest to largest, I said "Ultra...  I guess."  Turns out that was the works, and my car is cleaner than I am, but thats not the point.  I mean, what one person thinks of Ultra, another thinks of Supreme.  Mind you Total makes me think, the total package...  but that would make life too easy!  In the end it's just a ploy to get us to spend money, but wouldn't naming the lesser car washes "Useless", and "Light Cleaning" make most people choose, "Supreme Clean".  Again, too simple.  It's bad enough McDonald's no longer has Large fries, they go from Medium to Supersize.  [ I give up! ]  So in the end, I was please with my car wash, and Sunoco got an extra buck or two from me, I'll have to use 1-800-CALL-ATT next time to save a buck or two :o)    I'd like to take this moment to thank you all for stopping by on a regular basis.  I enjoy yammering to the world, and it's easier when I know a some point, someone is on the other end listening.  Feel free to post your thoughts in my Tag, I'll answer questions or join the chat!  Now I have to get back to my assignment, it's due in 8 hours, and I have yet to get deep into it.  Lets get a topic of discussion going, whats your favourite movie of all time, and why?  Tag it, we'll see if a blog comes of it :o)  ~Fish Out of Water~

       Your it!   w00y!  I increased the coolness factor of my site to negative 5.5 on the coolness scale [ up from negative 9 ] by adding the cool tag window on the right.  What that allows anyone and everyone to do is to leave a message,  WITH  smilies for me and anyone else who wanders by.  Basically this give you lazy bastards less of a reason to not responding to my requests.  I expect to see them to pop up on everyone else's blogs soon, but I have the distinct privilege of being the first of my circle of friends to hook-it-up.  Ok on to things that really matter.  T.A.T.U's song  All the things she said  is about lesbians... it's catchy, and the video is hot.  So why isn't this song #1 worldwide?  Personally I think it's got a pretty decent message, but the video kinda takes that message and throws it out the window, because all the guys watching it are drooling, and all the girls are smacking their drooling boyfriends.  It does pretty much the same thing  Dirrty  did to Aguilara's [ who cares if I spelt it wrong ] entire album.  I wanted to touch on something, and I really have no idea how much sense it's actually going to make.  It's about the world latley, and the bullshit, as far as I'm concerned anyway.  Here let me grab my box of  Sunshine Washing Detergent  and get comfortable. [ thats a play on soapbox, for my slower audience ]  Ever since I read the article in Chart Magazine [ see yesterday ], I've been thinking about CNN, Dub-ya! and the United Nations.  I've come to a few conclusions.  I don't think I'm ever going to watch CNN again.  It's just a bunch of rich people feeding humanity's morbid curiosity of death, and destruction and they'll feed us all the same food, until ratings go down, and no matter how important it is to get us that information, they don't care.  Iraq:Showdown, NASA Disaster, Operation Freedom.  The latter which is still going on in Afghanistan, they just don't care about it anymore.  I didn't realize how little I knew about Iraq post-gulf-war until Raine suggested I look around.  I mean, Saddam is rebuilding palaces, an army, and his defences and weapons, and not caring one bit for the people just letting them die.  CNN doesn't tell you that.  Is dropping more bombs on these people really going to solve anything?  What are the chances that your actually going to kill Saddam this time?  Not that he doesn't deserve to be hung by his testicles, but not at the expense of the innocent.  This brings me to this weekend's bullshit.  The United Nations was built to protect world peace, the US signed on, and now Bush thinks he's above the UN?  That he can do as he pleases?  Doesn't take a wake-up call to realize how fucking stupid that is.  They make rules, impose them, but the second it comes to them following them.  The rule book is gone.  I think Bush needs to be hung beside Saddam.  Then again, war makes money right?  And it's in Iraq, so no one gets hurt right.  At least thats what Bush wants us to believe.  I just hope Jean has the balls to stand beside France and say you can't do this... not without our support, and not without doing it the right way.  Disarm Iraq, I'm all for it.  Just don't fool us into thinking the only person that gets hurt is Saddam.

I'm sure she's up, wherever turtles go, chilling with Ernie, Burt, Ernie II, Hitman and Anvil...  May they all be happy!!!  I read an article today, in  urlLink [ Chart Magasine ]   It was written by Raine Maida from  Our Lady Peace .  Made me think of a few things.  Namley the media, and the bullshit that CNN feeds us.  Anyway, I suggest hitting a Chapters and reading it, or picking up the magasine at your local 7/11 or gas station or whatever.

       Who Said the Twins Would Wait Till 19!??   Yes, I am referring to the Olsen Twins, and Yes... I am referring to them becoming whores.  Ok, so the only thing they are whoring is their name, but it's still pathetic.  I was in Walmart the other day, and I saw Mary Kate, and Ashley in four, count them FOUR different departments.  Electronics [ video games and movies... yes I said video games ]     WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT????     Clothing [ Their own clothing line?  What the fuck!!! ]  Toy Department [ Yes I went in there!  And it was to look for the dolls I suspected existed ]  Bedding [ OMG! Bed Sheets?  I can just see the 40 year old putz, leaving with him mom, using these ]  Anyway, I don't blame them, I mean, I wouldn't turn down all that money either.  I do blame the marketing schmucks who came up with the idea, and Acclaim, for releasing such a fruity game.  On to my next rant...  www.stopmessenger.com .  Now if you'll notice, I didn't make that a Hyper-Link...  because I don't want you to go there.  I just want it to show up on search engines.  These are the assholes who think they can go and use the Windows Messenger Service [ I don't mean messenger as in the instant messenger, I mean the windows service...  I'll get to that in a second ] as a form of advertising.  First my e-mail, and now this?  Well fear not, I'm going to show you a quick and easy way to take care of these losers.  Follow the Fish, and all will be well.  First let me state that this will not interfere with MSN Messenger, so don't be afraid, it'll just stop ads like this;        Click on Start  Select Control Panel  Performance and Maintenance [ skip for Win 98/95/2000 ]  Administrative Tools  Double Click Services  Scroll down to Messenger - Double Click It  Change "Startup Type" to Disabled  Click "STOP"  Click "APPLY"  Close all the windows.  Done  That should do the trick.  No more messages interrupting you, and kicking you out of games while your trying to play.  I wish they would make Internet Advertising TOTALLY illegal.  I don't want to read advertisements, if I did, I'd go to an advertisement site.  Feel my anger!  Best $20 you can spend...   Worms Battle Pack  for the PC.  Hours of fun.  If you can't find the battle pack, [ Best Buy has them in Mississauga ] then get Worms Armageddon.  Blog ya Lata!

       What to do...   So here's the thing.  Variation is here from BC, and until he finds himself a job, we have to find him things to do.  Yes thats right, I said WE, meaning you and I.  I've lived here for so long that I can't think of what would be cool to see, apart from the CN Tower, which I hope we can make it to this weekend.  What should we do?  Where should we go.   urlLink [ E-mail me at swordfish_n0x@msn.com ]   I'm begging for help, every time I post here, I get no replies, which is fine.  However this time I need answers.  Even if you have never been to this page before, e-mail me with things YOU would do, if you came to Toronto / Mississauga.  We're going racing next week with the SRL [ if it's still a go ] so Go-Karting is not a good response, but anything else, hit me with it.    One last thing before I go, I got some work to do so I can't chat long.  I need someone who knows ASP to help me set up a comments section for these posts.  I don't have the knowledge, nor the time to learn it right now, but I've been told its a simple job.  If you want to help, email me, hopefully there will be something in it for you.  ~QuoTh tHe FiSh~

       An Inability to Grab the Balls Between My Legs!   Blarg!   What a shitty game we played yesterday.  Before I get into that, I'll apologize for the lack of blogging.  Var got here on Wednesday, and we've been playing video games ever since!  I'll touch on all that after I explain the rude title.  Last night, after a horrible first half, our team was down 4-1.  I was playing keeper, and I'll take responibility for one goal, while at the same time, it's hard to stop a shot from 6 feet out.  Anyway, after the team battled all the way back to eaven it up at 5 all, an innocent slow roller came tumbling toward me, I looked up to make a quick outlet pass...  the next thing I knew the ball was rolling into the net behind me.  If I could I would have dug a hole in the turf, and crawled inside it.  I know understand how Bill Buckner felt, then again, his was for the World Series.  Our team took it pretty hard and fell apart, they never recovered, and we lost by two, [ the last goal was a 3 on none, I seriously thought about just letting them score by walking away ].  Life goes on, and I'll get em next week.  Best Buy finally decided to get their act in gear, and call me back.  The store manager offered me a $50.00 discount/gift card, so I went in and bought Mario Party 4 for 17 bucks.  I'm addicted.  I've already reviewed it, so you can go and look thru my archieves if you want to hear about it.  It's much fun, even single player.   urlLink [ Read it here just scroll down to February 15th. ]   I'm back kicking it with Sim City 4.  With a little help from PC Gamer [ No Cheats ] I was able to hit 10,000 population, I'm going to work on it tonight once I get Jen's Uncle's computer...  It's in need of severe CPU CPR.  We'll have to see what time it is when all that is finished.    More work to do to get Var settled in, really tought with me going to school, and him having no car.  So tomorrow's lunch, for those of you at Sheridan, we're hitting Erin Mills Town Centre, wanna come?  Fish Out!

       Rampage   I used to spend countless quarters at the arcade when I was a kid, trying to beat the game rampage, and no matter how much money I had, I always ran out before the end.  Then I got the Nintendo version played it all day, night, and the next day, and if memory serves me right, I never did hit the end, maybe there isn't one.  Anyway, now we can find out thanks to Shockwave.  With it's version of  urlLink [ Midway's Rampage ]   Complete with Lizzy, George and Ralph and the sexy helpless lady who can someone how survive 15 story falls...  I've yet to figure that one out.  Anyway, you'll need Shockwave installed to play it, and the controls were the easiest with a joystick.  It's not as good, but it does bring back some good times!   urlLink [ Stu ]  likes to trash talk a lot.  Go see what he had to say about me fearing him, I remember him breathing my fumes most of the nights we went out there.  Unfortunately when the moon aligned with Venus, and the earth's 14 millionth star lined up with the 15 millionth, and Stu grabbed a car with NoS in it...  he posted ONE fast lap time that I haven't been able to get more than 0.20 seconds from, but whats 1/5th of a second between friends?  Truth be known I don't like being treated like a nobody when I'm giving your company [ Formula Kartways ] 100 bucks a month, so I refuse to go back to Formula, I'd like to hit another track, so we'll have to talk about it.    ~Fish Out~

       Oh Say Can You See?   Hey Hey!  Whats going on Fish Inc. back in effect!  w00y!  Got home from New York City about 4 hours ago or so, and between fixing  urlLink [ My Dad's ]  website, which somehow broke...  i don't know how.  Nor do I know how I fixed it, it just worked...  I'll blame the host.  Anyway, back to New York.  I stayed at the Roosevelt, and the room was built for little people.  I kid you not.  The room was supposed to fit 4 comfortably, but every night my feet hung off the end of my bed, and staying on " my side of the bed " was impossible unless you have no shoulders...  Anyway, on top of that, it had no internet connection.  $150.00 US a night, and it doesn't come with an internet connection, and the business centre was down, so my  Fish Inc Live from New York  was a no go, as was my e-mail, and all the things that help me be the most reachable guy in the world!    Moving forward, we did most of the things that we set out to do in New York, including those tasty beer nuts.. . mmmm, hot sweet beer nuts **insert Homer Simpson drool here**  Damn those things were good, and you get a shit load for a buck!  I miss them already!  We hit up NBC studios for their tour, was pretty cool, learnt a lot.  Did the Empire State Building, the subways, taxis and all that other stuff that is synonymous with New York, including Time Square!  That was one awesome place, I don't think things ever closed in Time Square, and the beer-nut guy never went home, he just sat there and sold... sold... sold...  and I am thankful!  Virgin Records was open at 1AM on a Sunday Morning, allowing us to grab some Coldplay imports, and this huge Music Store had every tab book in the world, picked up the Parachutes Album's tab book.  We also went to Canal St. which is where all the illegal stuff happens.  Stolen and knock-off purses, watches, jewelry, and DVDs galore.  I picked up  Catch Me If You Can  and  Jackass  for $10 US, the quality isn't that great, but I won't complain, I hadn't planned on buying those DVDs anyway, so now I get to laugh my ass off at Jackass for 5 bucks!  Who needs quality on that movie anyway, it's good, it's just not DVD or nothing and the chapters don't work, they send you like 20 minutes ahead, instead of the next chapter, I wouldn't buy a DVD off the streets of New York unless you just want to see it, in which case it's just like renting it...  Someone had to test them right?  Moving on, we visited ground zero, very tough at times...  Nothing much left, but it does bring back the memories, as well as a realization that this did happen, and that 3000+ people died, just going to work.  I didn't appreciate all the bastards making money off this tragedy, including bobble-head FDNY and NYPD.  I can just see the poor kid, who's dad was a fireman and he died in the WTC, walking down the street and see this little toy head bobbling around wearing the uniform his dad wore honourably, being disgraced for a few bucks.  There is a lot of stuff for sale about 911, and none of it mentions any widow's funds, or relief...  just greedy people making money.  I don't know, that really irked me.  Keeping with the sombre mood, Sunday afternoon we went to Strawberry Fields.  It's a part of Central Park dedicated to John Lennon, [ my musical idol ] right across the street from the  urlLink [ Dakota ]  where he lived.  It was another tough one.  I don't know about you, but when you hear stories or news about some tragic incident, it doesn't matter if its a year later, or 22 years later, but when you see the place, and actually stand on the place where it happened, it just makes it that much more real, and that much more tragic...  I am glad to say that there was no one selling John Lennon bobble-heads here.  I'll post some pictures of the place and New York, as soon as I get them.  Games...  I just got into the  urlLink [ Shadowbane ]  beta.  It's the new but much delayed [ at least two years in fact ] MMOG coming out from Ubi Soft.  It's primarily PVP [ Player vs. Player] so I don't think I'll be spending too much time in it, but you never know, all depends how good I am at it.  I've got some PR stuff here from AddictGamers that I need to go through, and review.  However with the two midterms I have this week, I doubt I'll get much time with anything other than the one Oxygen PR CD. Shadowbane will have to wait.  While I'm on the topic of school, I got offered a position with CCRA again, no clue if it's going to still be available since they sent the email Friday, and asked for a response " TODAY " but thanks to the hotel, I only checked my email when I got home.  I'll let you know, if you care that is.  Not much else to tell you, I'm gonna call it a night, roll over, and get some sleep.  Var gets here in a few days, and we got a lot of shit to do to get his space ready.  Fish Out!  This post dedicated to the memory of John Lennon, died December 8th 1980

       Rumors of my Death, Greatly Exaggerated   Well it's been a crazy week.  Not to the extant that I've been busy that I couldn't blog.  I just didn't have the computer to do it.  Let me explain.  Sunday night I sat down to build my step-dad's PC, only to realize that his old Video card, wasn't going to fit in the new Motherboard, like I thought it would.  After a trip to the computer store, and a killer deal an an ATI Sapphire Radeon 9100, I decided there was no point wasting that much power in a non-gaming PC.  So I did what anyone in my position would do.  Took my GeForce 3 out, popped in the Radeon, and then my computer went to hell in a handbasket!  I don't really know what the hell happened, but when I took it in to get looked at, [ I thought the card was defective ] it worked, but we noticed that the fan on my Northbridge died!  Not good!  10 minutes of my PC being on, and the MoBo would have burned up like Bacon...  mmmm  crispy!  So i dabble in some creative engineering to get a fan to fit on the Northbridge, and it seems to be working ok, I'll have to check on it in a few days.  None the less, that took a day to sort out, not to mention that I was rebuilding the only other Internet ready PC in the house, since laptops went back to Sheridan.  So you see, I had no way of contacting the outside world.  I was closed off from existence, no one knew where I was.  The rumors started swirling, and thus everyone feared sw0rdfish was no more!  But alas!  I'm here! [ sorry ]  Of course, a lack of communication didn't stop me from adding a new member to the household.  I call her, Telly!...   Toshiba 34-Inch TheaterWide® Television  16:9 HD Compatible monitor, 34" direct view TV. 1000 lines of resolution and 2 Tuner PIP. Exclusive microfilter CRT with lavendar mask.   Key Product Features and Options    Features    Microfilter Advanced CRT Colour Technology provides extremely accurate colour purity by assigning individual colour filters to each phosphor array on the surface of the CRT.  FST Pure™ CRT features a flat-glass viewing surface, which lets you see more picture from a greater ranger of angles, with less light reflection compared to a traditional radius CRT.  Lavender Shadow Mask prevents internal light deflection, heightens contrast, and improves focus and brightness.

As long as nothing bad happens to my government job, I should be ok [ **knocks on wood ]  Well I guess this is long enough for now, I smell bacon and eggs, and I'm going to go eat them, I don't care who's they are or who made them.  I'mma go claim em!  Peace!

       C'est le But!!!!   Kick ass game of street hockey today.  About 10 people showed up by the time is was all said and done, and I must say I had a killer time!  Not including the slap shot I took right in the marbles...  I thought they were in my throat.  I can honestly say I've never been squared that bad, as it continues to hurt almost 12 hours later.  I'm not really sure why I'm talking about this, in public no less, but I have to complain somewhere.  Anyway, the nausea and the light-headed feeling only lasted about 15 minutes, after that it was just pain...  but it seemed to elevate my game.  I stopped missing passes, and started putting the ball home.  Although I got robber a few times also.  We'll have to get more out next time, maybe have three or four teams so that we can rest in between games and play more.  Who knows!  I had a blast, and that is all that really matters.  Tomorrow I'll be building my step-dad's new PC.  Upgraded from a PII 450, to a AMD 2700+.  not a bad jump if you ask me.  512MB of DDR ram for only $99.  What are you waiting for?  Go!  I'm Done!

       Spring Cleaning   Indeed it was.  I spent most of last night reformatting my PC.  It had been acting slow recently, and Internet Explorer kept freezing up.  So instead of troubleshooting, I just wiped it clean.  Running much better now.  As long as I keep the amount of games I install limited to those I'm going to play.  I have a nasty habit of installing stuff.  Never knew that every time you install something, even if you un-install, it ads to your load times etc...  More useless geek news from Fish Inc.  Also got my crap from Lik-Sang finally.  Stupid government taxed my ass. Anyway, the case is ok...  I think I'll pick one up like Yan has, only for the SP.  The screen cover, after some install issues, is great, and same goes for the headset adapter.  I can play with sound at work now!  whooo!  Peace!

       Alice, Dorthy, and Strawberry Shortcake   As many of you know, I love  urlLink [ Penny-Arcade ]  and I read it regularly...  mainly because the comic is great, sometimes just to see what they have to say about new games...  but mostly the comic.  On Friday last week, they posted this;       And yesterday, American Greetings, American McGee's people, and Strawberry Shortcake herself forced them to take it down to avoid legal action.  Now if you ask me, the comic is hilarious, and it's satirical, which as far as I know isn't illegal, but hey, I'm no Judy Brown.  Anyway, doing this just raises more awareness of who Penny-Arcade is, and I'm sure they don't mind one bit.  In the end the comic gets posted all over the place [ like here ] and more people see it than would have, if they just shut up about it.  They being American Greetings.  My work is done!

       From the Outside, Something Looks Wrong   It's weird.  I was born in Montreal, lived there for almost 9 years, and every year I watched the Habs on TV.  Most of the time, they made the playoffs, and even won a cup.  However, for the last 5 years, last year excluded, playoff hockey for the Canadiens has been, well...  a first round sweep, and 4 no-shows.  Now, living in Toronto, that means that my April, May, and June [ although not often ] hockey, is comprised of watching the Leafs.  I used to think that being a Habs fan meant I had to hate the leafs, but then I never wanted to see them lose.  I used to tease my friends when they did lose, because...  thats what I thought a Habs fan was supposed to do.  Maybe it's the lack of meaningful games between the two of them, and the non-existence of a playoff series since 1967 but I don't hate them, in fact, as Green scored last night I found myself shouting " SCORES!!! " and I sat back down, and though...   What would my grandpa think?    He was arguably the biggest Habs fan, and that has definitely rubber off on me.  Stories of Dryden, Richard, and all the greats used to fill my head as a child.  Thats when it hit me, maybe 15 minutes ago, or maybe yesterday...  it's a big league now, 30 teams, and a whole lot of rivalries.  If I was a Senators fan, I think I would hat ethe leafs...  Why?  because they have eliminated the Senators in the past 3 playoffs...  thats why!  I'm still waiting for this huge Montreal-Toronto series, been waiting for it since I was about three [ thats the earliest I can remember liking hockey, probably the earliest I can remember period].  As I was saying...  it hit me, if Montreal is out golfing, what better team is there to take the cup then the leafs?  My friends would all be happy.  We could go out, and they may even buy me a drink they're so happy.  I still consider myself a huge Habs fan, and there is no way I would even question who I want to win a leafs-Habs game.  My heart is  Red, White & Blue  and there is no doubting that...  but when the red gets the kibosh, and they're out golfing...  I think the Blue and White gets a little stronger each year, but only until October.  I think my dad would be proud of that.  I either need a Montreal-Toronto playoff series soon, or never.  I haven't decided yet.  Go Habs Go...  [ and the leafs too... for now ]

       Tis Today!   Well, I didn't get too much hate mail from people.  Just one from a white guy that works at McDonald's, complaining about the White Trash who can't order properly in drive through.  I don't even know the guy!  I digress [I don't know if thats appropriate, I just like saying it ].  Well, I called Tim's head office today, and after about 5 minutes on the phone, the lady on the other end tells me to take it in to Tim Horton's [ any store ] and tell them it's defective, and to refund it.  What the fuck do you think I did the first 5 times?  Then I asked, why when the store calls in, can they not get an answer in 5 minutes, and it takes them 3 weeks.  She said she didn't know, and apologized for the inconvinence...  apologize?  Give me free shit!  I don't complain to get free stuff, don't get me wrong.  Nor do I complain unless something is REALLY pissing me off.  However, when a customer has to do all this work just to get a 15 dollar mug refunded, and the solutions ends up being this simple...  well fuck you!  Make it up to me!  My time is worth more than 15 dollars, and it's your fault I'm wasting it!  Companies do this sort of thing mainly because out of 10 cases, 7 probably give up, and don't get their money back.  Same philosophy as the "Mail-In Rebate."  Why isn't it an instant rebate, and let the store deal with the manufacture?  Simple, because I'd say 40% at least probably don't bother, forget, or "lose" their information required for the rebate.  I have 2 sitting on my desk as I type, one for $50 for a MS Sidewinder, and one for $10 for the Friends DVDs.  If I keep forgetting, there is $60 that two companies will make off me.  I wont let that happen, cuz I'm a cheap bastard, but I'm sure many do.  Still nothing new in gaming, but I did get the first three seasons of Friends, my all-time favourite sitcom... so I'll be busy this week!  One final thing, I have a  request.  Save EVERY A.O.L. disk you have, and save every "Prepaid Postage" envelope that you have.  I'm on a mission.  I'll pick them up from you, if you live in the neighbourhood.  Otherwise, forget about it!  Peace~

       Tim Horton's Service   Fuck it!  Why?  Because they don't have any.  Now no disrespect to minorities, nor to the ones who I'm refering to in this post.  If you know me, you know that I don't look at skin color for a second.  Nor do I care about it!  Here's my beef with Tim Horton's.  They hire imigrants, "fresh off the boat" so to speak, yet they can't speak english.  This becomes a problem when you are ordering at the drive through.  It's hard enough to understand somone who speaks perfect english through them, when you throw in a heavy accent, and a very bad understanding of the english language, you get 5 minute waits trying to explain that you want a bagel with cheese, and a double double!  It gets down right aggravating when the person taking your order messes up, and then you have to sit there and explain what happened.  Furthermore, I went in to Tim Horton's, 5 of them actually, complaining that my Stainless Steel Travel Mug that I bought off of them was broken.  It took untll the 5th one when I got someone who actually understood my problem, and that was three weeks ago.  I left my number, and I'm still waiting to hear back from the manager.  I've been back 2 times to no avail.  Head office is getting a call from me tomorrow, and if you work at Tim Horton's head office, don't answer the phone because I'm going to let you have it!  Not about the inability of your employees to speak english, only about the cup.  Let me clear something up, before you all start commenting about how I'm a prick.  I have absolutly no problem with imigration, nor with any race of people who choose to move to our country.  My issue comes from the companies who hire these people, probably because they will work for minimum wage the longest, and throw them on the floor where they have to interact with people in order to do their job, yet they can't speak english, or they can, they just don't do it well.

       And So It Begins   Life after semester 5.  Test are done, job starting date is nowhere in sight, I have no clue what the hell CCRA is doing, but they never have their act in gear.  Which is stupid since they are the god damn government.  I got into the Planetside beta last week, I'm just waiting for my CDs to get here in the mail.  I'll let you guys know what I think about it, but Penny-Arcade did a pretty good job if it.  Head over there if you want to check it out. [ use my link ]  I'm looking forward to weeknights again, where I can sit back and game, and not have to worry about homework or shit like that.  No matter how bad work is, it's better than school.  I mean, you get paid to work, and at 5 o'clock [ unless you don't let it ] work ends, and you go home and do whatever you want!  Of course this means that you don't get to decide for yourself if you want to go in or not, but those are minor details.  My birthday was fun, apart from the " Hair Scare " with one plate of pasta, and my ice cream.  Who knows if it was mine, or the cooks, so I just tossed it aside, and went on with the festivities.    For my birthday, Variation hooked me up with  Mario Kart: Super Circuit  for my GBA:SP.  Good times there.  I love that game, can't wait for the GC version to come out.  If anyone wants to donate to the "Help Randy Buy Some Video Games" fund, I'm accepting donations.    On the subject of gifts, my mom is getting me SOCOM, or S-O-C-O-M, as she calls it.  So I'll be online with that shortly.  Mainly to kick Mupiel's ass, and his brother too!  Enjoy the holiday all, and have a great easter.  Peace~

You know how people say you get old, and start to hate your birthday??  Not this pony! No Sir! Uh Hu!  So what have I got planned you ask?  A fucking exam!  C'est la vie!  I could bomb, and I'll still have a great day!  Anyway, I leave you for now...  I'm gonna go sing Happy Birthday to myself, while I enjoy a nice bowl of Lucky Charms!

       The Fat Lady Has Sung   In a valiant fight, and never giving up.  CST FC played their last game today, for the Winter/Spring '03 Season anyway.  We went down 4-1, due to 4 first half goals, guess no one wanted it bad enough.  Stu had a great year playing keeper for us.  Don't let the bad games get ya!  I think the entire team lacked the will to win, in the end it was fun, I just wanted the exercise anyway.  Moving on to other topics, maybe something to think about.  I was looking through my newspaper last night, and saw a picture that made me think...  Tiger Woods, putting " The Green Jacket " on Mike Weir.  Why did this make me think?  Simply because the most desired trophy in golf is to win the Masters, and with all this controversy about women in Augusta, a black man [ last 2 years champion ] is putting the Jacket on a Canadian...  wonder if the old "set in their ways" Americans ever thought that would happen at Augusta.  Ah well, Weir is without question the best player in the PGA right now, and he's earned it.  Good luck Mike, you've got my cheers!  In other news, Stopmessenger continues to be a popular hit to my page.  Maybe I should make a post and link to it, it really is very annoying!  However, no one posts that they found it useful, so maybe they realise it's some idiot talking to himself, and they leave.  Anyway, I'll go do homework now.  Expect posts all night since I plan on being up working on my math algorithms.  Then again, this is Doug, the same man who put the O/S final on a public server.  Not only that, but it's a public server that the students were using last night to get notes and slides from.  I don't know how he became program head, he's a nice guy...  I don't doubt that, but lately he's a little...   flaky   Peace!

       Keep Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'   2 down, 3 to go.  Of course I'm talking about school exams.  60 hours from now or so, I'll be worry free, and on the road to bigger and better things.  Well, not really.  I still have to go back in September for 4 more months, but a guy can dream right?  I really feel like going off about Sheridan College right now, but I'll hold back. At least till I get really fucking mad.  Speaking of pissed off, Tim Horton's is yet to answer me about my cup.  I'll have to stop by AGAIN in the morning.  Actually, I'll probably just call head office tomorrow.  3 weeks to get a response on a broken cup is stupid.  Not to mention you can't email them, at least not from what I can find on the site.  Same as McDonald's, what the hell is wrong with email complaints?  Makes it to easy for us probably!  Dicks!   Well, now that I got that out of my system, there isn't much going on in the world of gaming lately.  I've been really impressed with  Winning Eleven 6,  a soccer game from Konami.  Its fun to play, but the commentator is a freakin moron!  Not to mention they didn't take much time in recording lines for him to say.  Normally you have to play a game for a long time to know EVERY line that he's gonna say.  Well after a handful of games, its always the same damn lines, most notably " This will be trouble if it gets through ."  Yeah thanks for giving away the fact that it's a through ball!  Like the guy sitting next to me isn't going to notice my player making a run for it after you blurt that out?    In the end though, it's about gameplay.  Mute the retard, and the game is really fun.  Takes time to get used to the controls, and the power shots, but all in all I love it, and I'm glad it found me.  Now I need to write a review of it for AG.  I'm surprised they haven't yelled at me yet.  I'm slacking bad, but with just cause, exams are a bitch!  Well until next time!  Peace!

       Oh Canada!   Well it has certainly been an intresting day!  Especially as far as Canadian sports go.  First off, congratulations go out from Fish Inc. to Mr. Mike Weir who today became the first Canadian to win a PGA major, and only the second southpaw [ left-hander].  Huzzahh to you!  Also!  Mr. Paul Tracy, who I'm a huge fan of, won his third consecutive CART race, the first time ever that a driver has started a season with three wins.  Not much else to say, I've got to get this math assignment done, and then get some sleep so I can study for the exam I have tomorrow afternoon.  Pardon the spelling, I'm in Linux, and no IE Spell.

       Pfft.. Beat That   To call the Exam I had today an " Exam " would be a joke.  In fact it didn't even belong in a post-secondary institute.  We sat down, the teacher handed me the test, and not two minutes in Robb says " I'm done .  My first reaction was ...  WHAT?  then I got past the 2 questions I was stuck on, and was done within a minute.  4 minutes, thats all it took me to write an exam, 5 semesters into a 6 semester program.  Fucked up!

       Not Much...    What's up?   This is Jeopardy...  Ok that was dumb, but it's 3AM and I'm tired.  My streak ended at 53 hours of being awake, and damn it felt good.  I don't have much to talk about, we lost in soccer, a meaningless game though.  Thanks to Mupiel and wife for dinner!  Always a pleasure!  Too bad we have an exam, or we could have partied all night.  Also, love goes out to the two of them on the loss of their beloved " Sunny Day ", who passed away this afternoon.  Loosing a pet is hard...  God bless you, Sunny.  Be at peace!  ~With Sympathies, Fish~

       The Art of The  All Nighter    It's been awhile grant you, but I can still pull these all nighters no problem.  The last time I think was for Joe Sant's final assignment last year.  While we do have until midnight tomorrow [ which actually means 8am Thursday since he wont pick them up till then ] I'm working on getting it finished up tonight, so I don't have to sit in the school for another 12 hour session.  I was there ALL day today, from 9:00am until 10:30pm, and i didn't like it!  During those 13 hours, there were a few events worth noting, and while I enjoy my coffee break, I'll share them.  We played the second place team today for Sheridan Intramural Indoor-Soccer, after falling behind early 2 - 0, we battled back in the second half to tie it with a little over 2 minutes left.  I played keeper again, and I enjoyed it.  Was seeing the ball well [ until the punk ran through the crease and knocked my hands out of the way... Ref thought otherwise ].  Turns out it's meaningless, the highest we could have finished is 4th, and 4th plays 5th, so our fate is written and these last two games are tune-ups for the playoffs.  We're ready! Bring it!  Next came dinner.  At around 8:30pm or so, Yan and I began getting a  "Wee bit peckish ".  So we rang up Pizza Pizza, explained to them about 5 times that we needed the pizza delivered to the "Front Door of the School, NOT the Rez!!!"  Sure enough, at 9:15 we get the call saying he's here...  only he's not...  he's at [ you guessed it ] the residence!  Fast Food incompetence has irked me lately, so I took the receipt, was it said "Free if delivered after 9:18pm" ... it was 9:20, I smiled at the driver, felt bad, and explained that if he was going to get in shit for it, to tell his boss that it was the order takers fault for not writing clear instructions, although had the driver understood english, I could have reminded him to come to the school not the rez...  but all he kept saying was "I leave now!" and then he ended up at the rez...  Free Pizza always tastes better!  Just when I thought the day was ending, and all I had left in my future was C assignment, I sat down to some Pokémon.  Plan was to just get some levels for Pikachu or something, but instead I decided to see how hard the  Elite Four  actually were...  27 Revives, and 41 Hyper Potions later, I hit the final Poké with a critical hit, and it was all over, I was the new Pokémon League Champion... with a level 58, 49, 43, 42, 14 [ who levelled 3 times on one kill to 17 ] and a 12.  So now, I just get to basically wonder the lands, and train and collect as much as I can.  A perfect time waster.  It actually put a huge dent in my magazine reading time as well as Zelda...  on that note, congrats to my brother in gaming and school Mupiel, on finishing Zelda:TWW... you are the hero my friend, I bow to you  Captain   ~Back to Work~   Wouldn't you know it... the spell checker recognizes "Pokémon

       I'm What?  Late?  No No No...  I'm Early For Tomorrow!   Seems like I've fallen into the same trap that many of my colleagues [ read: The slackers who's sites I linked to on the left ] and took a day or two off from my last post...  reason?  I didn't want to bore you.  I seriously have very little going on right now in terms of gaming, fun, or living for that matter.  I got to school, come home, and do homework, and occasionally I get to pick up my GBA: SP, and pound out a few hours of Pokémon.  Which is still awesome fun, more so because I want to catch them all, and then smoke anyone I can get my hands on.  Zelda has been shelved for the past week, only because I need a solid 4-5 hour block to sit down, and pick up all those damn treasure maps and other stuff, that I don't want to spoil for you.  I can hear the wind howling outside, April 7th, and we're getting another 5-10cm of snow.  Hey winter, summer called and he wants you to open the door and let spring in!  This ultimately proves that the Groundhog knows dick, and that winter leaves, when winter wants to leave.  So much for that whole global warming thingy.  As you may or may not know, when it comes to my tech stuff, I'm pretty anal about it.  Scratches on CDs, DVDs, Gameboys and DVD boxes are just some of the things that drive me crazy!  I mean if I'm spending 50 bucks on a new game, I want the whole thing, right down the the instruction manual, to stay in perfect condition.  " Be careful while your reading the manual, bend it an I'll kill you!  - Common phrase uttered by me, I kid you not.  Anyway, needless to say that a week and half of my GBA:SP running around without a case is driving me mad.  So I turned to the one place I knew would have it all...  Hong Kong!  urlLink [ http://www.lik-sang.com ]  is a great site for ordering accessories, and what not, for your gaming needs.  For only $20US, I picked up a case, the headphone adaptor [ third party version ], and some screen covers, because the first scratch on a screen, always hurts more. I don't know how well they are going to end up working, but I'll let you know.  Besides, they only cost 2 bucks.  If you haven't done so already, go buy some Super 7 tickets for this Friday, $30,000,000 tax free dollars... what are you waiting for?  Go Go Go! [ by the way, if you buy them because of this post, and then win...  I have a very costly Video Game hobby that could use sponsoring...]  Well, hope the wait was worth it, maybe I even got you to smile...  Thanks for continuing to read, as I enjoy writing.  ~Fisheezy Outtie~   Hmm, its adaptor, not adapter?  Thank you IESpell

       So Like...  This Bites   Ahhh Crap!    I never thought the day would come when i have to spend the majority of a Saturday at school.  Voluntarily too!  No detention, no extra class, just working... it took getting used to.  Anyway, the past few days have been rather odd.  It's April 5th, and the ground is covered in snow...  no make that ice.  Here's a rundown of my last two days, grouped by activity...  4 Hours Shoveling Snow  2 Hours Clearing Ice Off Cars [ mainly mine ]  2 Hours Digging Cars Out of Snow [ mainly mine ]  15 Minutes Pushing a Car Down My Street [ not mine ]  3 Hours Playing Video Games  10 Hours Doing Homework  Something is wrong when the majority of my time is spent outside, let alone due to snow...  in April!  I'm willing to bet half the city stayed home yesterday, and the ones who went out are probably workaholics or lived close to work or something, because it was pretty crazy!  I continue to move forward in Pokémon.  I reached the Safari.  You can go in there, and for 500 bucks you keep all the Pokémon you can catch!  It's like a Mandarin, only the serve Pokémon.  I gotta pee...

       Dilemma Solved   The responsible side of me took over, and I did homework.  A little of all of them.  I took a bit of time to put together a new tag that I'm going to use on message boards.  It's the first one I've ever made myself, so be nice on the comments...    urlLink   Click for actual size    I have nothing more exciting to talk about, since all I've done was homework, and eat a Joe Louis... and of course cookies.  I think cookies are the greatest thing ever invented.  It goes well with anything! Cookies and Cream Ice Cream, Milk and Cookies... Tea and Cookies... McDonalds Happy Meal, with cookies instead of toy... Spaghetti and cookies!!  See it's perfect!

       Meh    urlLink [ Start off the post with a good Flash Song. NSFW! ]   NSFW means Not Safe For Work.  Sucks to be you if you clicked it, and got fired for it.    Not much of anything going on right now.  I'm pretty much buried in on computer or another, doing homework for one class or another.  I love the end of the term, where teachers realize all the shit they forgot to teach, and cram it all in.  However, I got one teacher this semester, who hasn't taught us anything in Math, in over a month!  Doing the final assignment for this class is going to be fun!  Same goes for the final.  Que Cera Cera!  Watched  Apt Pupil , interesting movie.  That kid has some serious issues though, thats for damn sure!    I had this awesome post ready to go up yesterday, but Blogger fucked up again, and I lost the whole thing, and I didn't feel like writing it out again, so those thoughts will be lost for ever in the world of " Pages lost Forever because of Internal Server Errors   I think thats enough for now, I've got to get those reviews written for AddictGamers... as much as I want to get them done, school work and Zelda keep distracting me.  I guess since I ended up paying for them anyway, I should be entitled to taking my time.  I need a shower!  ~out~

       Back To My Roots!   Shit it's been way too long.  Thanks to those who are still reading, I know it's only been like 4 days, but when you used to update daily, 4 days is a long time.  Work just takes the excitement out of your life!  So anyway, I've decided I'm going to update 3 times a week, guaranteed, on Monday, Thursday, and Sunday nights.  I'll try and do more, but I'll be sure to post on those nights so you, my loyal readers, don't come here expecting something, and find nothing.  On the gaming front, I picked up  Wario Ware, Inc.  for my GBA.  Out of ten, I'd have to give it an 8.  There is a lot of fun in this game, especially if you're like me and you really enjoy Mario Party type games.  Basically the game consists of completing little "microgames" one after another.  The Catch?  The games only last about 5 seconds, and they give you very little instruction on what you have to do.  For example it says "Catch" and then this ball flies at the screen while you control a little guy with a huge ass baseball glove.  That's one of the easier ones.  It's fun, maybe you can borrow it when I'm done :P  In other gaming news, over the past 3 months or so, I've been invited into this  Gamer Advisory Panel  [ G.A.P. heh! ] by Sony.  According to them I have the ability to shape the future of gaming...  They're pretty hardcore about it too, I got a little card, and a Certificate [ similar to the one a doctor gets ] that proves my involvement.  I'm not sure of the benefits of it, or exactly how many people got in, and what the criteria was for it.  However when the card and certificate say I'm an "elite member" and I never had to apply, I wonder how they know what kind of gamer I am.  None the less, I'll keep you informed.  Movies.....  I saw  The Italian Job  last night.  Great movie, not as good as the Matrix, but that goes without saying.  Other than the fact that a few of the scenes had some pretty bad continuity errors, [ I.E. a car with supposedly 1000 Lbs of weight in the back...  tilts forward in the air.  Then again, it's a movie ] it was a movie worth paying for.

       Enough About SARS Already   Ok, with all due respect to those who lost the ones they love...  I've had enough with this SARS bullshit.  YES, it is a very contagious and potentially fatal illness.  YES you need to be clean, and stay away from hospitals unless absolutely necessary. YES you have a 1 in 1,350,000 chance of dieing from SARS in Toronto.  To put that in perspective, you have almost 3 times greater odds of dieing in a plane crash.  5 times greater of being killed driving home from work.  So to all you bands and tourists who are using SARS as an excuse.  Here's a big Fuck Off! I don't want your album anyway.  [ *cough* Stained *cough* ]  Furthermore, in the Washington D.C. area, someone is shot every 55 minutes.  I don't see the World Health Organization [ WHO ] telling you not to go there.  Yet 27 out of 4 million people die from a virus, and Toronto [ and Area ] are the worst place to travel!  Next to China of course, because SARS is there waiting to attack you as you get off the plane.  Don't get me wrong, it's a problem that needs the attention of the people of Toronto. We need to be aware of the disease, it's causes, preventive measures, it's symptoms and potential effect on us.  However to cause the hysteria the world is causing over it is stupid.  I've been living my life the same way I have been the past 15 years I've lived here, I've had the flu during that time, and I'm still here!  Get with it!  Unless you plan on visiting your friend who has SARS, or you don't wash your hands before every meal, and after every piss, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Unless you make the local hospitals your stomping grounds!  Anyway, this is probably directed at the people who will never read this, but I figure I put this site here to gripe, and dammit I'm gonna gripe!  Peace!

       Where Does the Time Go?   Sorry Blog, don't take it personally.  I've been totally removed from the Internet this past week.  Even with the extra day off, I couldn't do anything all week, other than lie on my couch and veg!  Not really sure why, other than late bed times a few too many times.  Senators lost, Anika lost, Jays... umm.. who cares.  On a  good note though our soccer team, Blue Machine F.C. [ don't ask ] won it's first ever game today, and we're looking forward to a good first season.  We got game 2 tomorrow, which leaves little time to rest, but I think we'll be ready!  Its funny too, because I had so much I wanted to bark about this week.  Like morons who turn right in front of you, as you enter the intersection.  Or the dick-heads who go on to on-ramps, to pass cars.  What the fuck do you expect to get out of that?  4 or 5 cars ahead, save 30 seconds?  In the end, all you do is create more traffic.  Traffic is cause by merging cars, when you do that, you have to merge AGAIN!  Morons!  If you do that ... consider that aimed at you.  I missed all of E3.  Way too busy!  I'll have to go back and read it all, I don't really care about it either though right now.  The internet is way too busy these days!  I haven't posted since the 22nd?  But it seems so damn long, prolly because my last meaningful post was the 18th.  I haven't read any blogs either, I got catching up to do.    After my nap!  Peace!

I've had very little time.  I'm into Hot Shots Golf 3 at the moment, 30 bucks at any videogame store [ Greatest Hit ] I'll touch on it as soon as I get 5 minutes to myself with my computer.

       Shizzle muh' nizzle   Damn cats just woke me up, now I can't get back to sleep so I figured I'd blog.  It has been a pretty busy week, especially in the video game world [ hello E3 ] and I haven't had any time to touch any of it.  An entire Gamespot Complete site awaits me, yet I haven't had more than 5 minutes to scan the info on E3.  I'll have to get to that soon!  I might pick up  Hot Shots 3 [ PS2 ]   or  Enter the Matrix [ PC ]  tomorrow, I haven't really decided yet.  I have to go to Best Buy because they lowered the price of my TV by $100.00, and they are giving a free TV Stand with it now.  Seeing as it's been less than 30 days, I'm gonna go claim what's rightfully mine!  BooYah!  I'm pondering staying up, it's 5AM and I've got a pretty busy day.  Well The Ducks have moved on to their first ever Stanley Cup finals.  I think it's great for the team, as long as they don't pull a Carolina and not show up next year.  Here's the funniest thing.  In the four major sports, a Californian team has been to the last finals, in each sport [ Lakers, Raiders, Angels, Ducks ] and should Anaheim win, that city would hold two of the four championships.  It's a good thing we have Lacrosse here, or Toronto sports fans would be in big trouble.  Guess it helps that each sport has like 3 or 4 Californian teams.  Anyway, I'm off to do something, hopefully sleep.  Otherwise GBA or reading can be done.  Oh yeah, and I have a cat to kick in the head for waking me up. [ Don't worry, I don't have Steal Toe on... ]  TTFT!

Incase you're oblivious to the world, I'm talking about " The Matrix: Reloaded ".  It's everything you've hoped for.  Hope you had a chance to catch my tribute to "Opening Day" even thought it's actually tomorrow, I saw it today, so thats all that matters.  Now it's time for bed, I'm tired as hell, and I got work in 5 Hours.  Grats to the Ducks who won yet again...  Anyone Take JS Giguere in their pool?  Peace!

       Witt and Wisdom   I love this guy's blog!  urlLink [ Read It ]   Google posted that they were going to remove Blogs from their normal search engines.  That means my hits will probably die right off.  You'll have to go to a special  "Blog Only"  search.  You can read about it  urlLink [ here ] . Thanks to http://www.slashdot.com and http://www.theregister.co.uk.  I'm too lazy to link to it.  Anyway, I kinda find this sucks because you can get some great info from blogs, like my "how to stop pop-ups" tutorial.  [ **points to top left corner** ] anyway, I'm happy with my 5 - 6 readers a day and anyone else who wants to stop by.  I'm gonna go make a pizza for the hockey game tonight!

       O Canada!   While not as big as the olympics, the World Championships are just as important to most Canadian hockey fans...  I am no exception.  Congrats to the team on a great tournament, and the gold medals.  My house is different tonight...  Variation has decided the SARS infested lands of Toronto, are no match when compared to Rain-all-day west coast, and decided to return home.  [ His girlfriend waiting for him in BC may have swayed things a little. ]  It was cool to have a roommate, especially to have someone else around who enjoys gaming as much as I do.  However, when you don't know many people, it's tough to live in that place, and I'm not the most entertaining person.  As he leaned my nights consist often of sitting in front of the TV watching hockey, or maybe doing some home work.  None the less it was a cool couple of months, hope home didn't fall apart without you there!  Now I gotta start losing all the weight I put on during the evening runs!  Peace!  I gotta be at work in the morning!

       General Stupidity   Hockey Night in Canada...  Sitting here watching game seven.  Great game so far.  It's probably going to take me awhile to type this out.  Anyway, I been really busy this week, getting used to this 7:30 - 3:30 shift. [ Wild just tied the game ]  I heard a few things on the radio this week that I wanted to mention.  The worst was this stupid school trustee who thinks that the Don Cherry Molson Bubba commercials should be pulled from the air because he's a role model for children, and is promoting under age drinking or some crap like that.    I'm not sure how, but apparently she's one of those parent's who's kids get hammered week in and week out, just because it's cool.  Her actual excuse was that her 12 year old was walking around singing the song...  so WHAT?  Where in that song does it say "Drink Beer even if you are under 19"?  I just think it's fucking stupid to make a huff about that.  Kids, especially boys, are gonna grow up, get hammered at a friend's house and they are going to do it regardless of who is singing!  Be it Don Cheery or Ru Paul.    Moving forward...  A Utah man was rock climbing in a canyon when he fell, and had a 1,000 lbs boulder roll on top of his arm.  After five days af lying there with no help, he decided to take out his pocket knife and remove his own arm above the elbow.  It gets better.  He ties a tourniquet and then repels [ with one arm ] down to the bottom of the canyon, where he then proceeds to hike 8 KMs to get help.  Now I don't know about you, but I know I don't have the balls to cut off my own arm, never mind the repelling and the hiking [ Wild Take the Lead ].  Anyway, I'm gonna finish watching the game.

       Ba Ba Garbage Man, Three Bags Full   I was standing outside today, and saw my neighbour putting the stickers on his extra garbage bags...  for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, in Mississauga, you are only allowed to put out 3 garbage bags, anything after three needs a special sticker on it.  These stickers cost $0.10 each.  The idea being they can make more money off you, on top of taxes.  Here is why I think this is stupid...  fine charge us, because after all the world does make too much garbage, but charge us more for the bags...  don't be stupid and limit the number of bags you can put out.  Here is where that idea is flawed.  Neighbour A has 4 bags of garbage this week, and neighbour B has 2...  Neighbour A drops one bag of garbage off at neighbour B's and then no one pays a thing, and all he had to do was walk across the lawn to his neighbour's.  I mean, unless your entire neighbourhood has a hard-on to making you pay an extra dime, someone is bound to not give a shit if you put a bag of garbage on their curb, beside theirs...  after all it's gone the next morning anyway!  The entire idea makes no sense, I'd be interested to see how much money the program is making.  There must be a lot of stupid people in Mississauga, I mean how often do you have 3+ bags of garbage a week anyway?  The odd time you do, fuck the sticker, just take a look at your closest neighbours, one of them is bound to have some vacancy on the curb for your outcast garbage bag!  Anyway,,,  peace!

       Duck Season!   Well, I tried to go to bed about 2 hours ago, but something woke me up...  something wouldn't let me sleep.  That something?  Playoff hockey.  Vancouver quickly ended the excitement going 4-1 down early in the second.  However the Anaheim / Dallas game was a treat, and with a little over a minute left Ozolinsh, who was acquired at mid-season, popped home the winner and sent Dallas to join the Leafs [ and Habs :( ] on the links.  Ok I got work in 5 hours.  Later!

       GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLLLLL   Today was probably the most exciting sporting moment I've ever been involved in!  Left [ my indoor soccer team ] played our first playoff game today, against the cockiest bunch of guys, with the LOUDEST group of screeching women.  As it went, the women got to screech early as the put a goal in, about 7 minutes into the game.  Defencive breakdown on our part [ I wasn't on the floor :) ].  Anyway, nothing changed until about 5 minutes left in the game...  1 - 0 in indoor soccer is pretty crazy, we weren't getting the shots through.  Anyway, with about 5 minutes left, it looked as though we had tied it up when all of a sudden one of their players jumped toward the ball rolling into the net, and literally picked it up, and threw it out of the net...  no call!  I was livid!  About a minute after that, Clive called for a line change, I hopped on to find the ball heading right at me.  I knocked it down, carried it in, dished it off, and went for the net, but I wasn't needed.  The forward I passed it to faked a shot, and passed it off to the left winger who calmly put it home...  tie game!  Now 1:37 left in regulation and my worst nightmare happened.  They scored again! I thought for sure it was over.  I was wrong.  With about 25 seconds left, we tied it up, and headed for Overtime.  Golden Goal rules...  first goal wins!  They were all over us, but our defence held strong, and when the opportunity came, off a free kick, the same player who tied it with 25 seconds left, ripped home a rebound for the win, and we went nuts!  It was pretty exciting, and all this with a fever close to 100!  I'm not sure what it was, but once the game started, I had nothing.  I couldn't stay on more than a minute, and it hurt to run.    My grandma joked about SARS, but it's like a normal fever, no cough, no headaches, no muscle aches, no breathing issues.  We'll see how I feel tomorrow morning, and if it's still pretty bad, I'll have no choice but to take the day off work, I don't want to risk if there is a small chance that it is.  I'll be all over the news as the kid who infected a government office with SARS.  On a final note, I send my apologies to my friends who I haven't been able to hang with in some time.  I never realised how busy I've been getting this past month, committing to too much I suppose.  Anyway, I look forward to a beer or two, and some video game playing soon.  I'll buy!  Peace!

       Damn Computers!   Still freaking out over these computers here.  I'm not sure I could own a business putting these things together, what a pig!  Anyway, I apologize for the lack of updates, just been one of those weeks, busy as hell and making no money!  Today however, was a great way to wrap up the week.  Hockey Day on Ridgeway: Part II  I called everyone I knew, and everyone who asked why they didn't hear about the last one, and those that I got through to showed up, and showed up they did.  With the addition of a shit-load of Stu's friends, we ended up playing 5 vs 5 with 2 subs, and I donned the goal tending equipment.  I did a lot better than I thought I would, and enjoyed the fact that I didn't take a slap-shot to the marbles this week.  One of the schmoes on the other team was just that...  a moron.  After we won the first game 3-2, and were switching nets he says "You guys will be back at that net fast...  5 minutes" with this gay smile on his face.  You see we now had the smaller net to score on, and they had the bigger one.  We promptly beat them in about 10 minutes, 3-0.  So as we were switching back, one of my teammates asked me the time, and in earshots range of the moron, I said "About 10 minutes after we headed down to the other net."  I think he deserved a comment like that.  He started being a jackass, slashing, pushing, and calling me a fag just because he looked stupid for opening his mouth in the first place.  When we play again, I'm pretty sure he wont be invited, I can't stand whiners!  Anyway, all that out of the way, I did have a great time, and I'm drained, 4 Hours of hockey is a killer. A few guys on the other team were really good, and at the same time, nice guys.  My philosophy is we're all out there to have fun, and we all gotta work on Monday, so chill out!  Right?  Maybe I'm just a wimp!  Saw  X2 : X-Men United  yesterday, great movie.  It makes a lot more sense if you know the X-Men story, otherwise you'll be left with the wrong impression.  I'd have to say it's similar to Spiderman, enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.  If you're into those movies.  Go see it, otherwise save your money, the action isn't worth $13.50.  I'll leave it at that, I'm tired, sore, and my TV is calling me names for neglecting it!  ~out~

       We Were Soilders   I just finished watching this movie...  and it was one of the hardest movies I've ever watched.  The truth about war is painful, it's sad, and it's very real.  This movie reminds us of that, and a lot more.  The brotherhood, the patriotism, and the extream loss, but leaves you asking one thing...  What is it all for?  To anyone who has fought for whats right...  Thank you!

       Here's the Pitch.....  They're Outta Here!   Of course I'm talking about the most exciting play in baseball...  The streaker!  Only these guys wore clothing [ thank god ].  I went to the Jay's game last night, and it was a stinker until the bottom of 9 when up to 6 fans each took turns trying to cross the outfield on three different occasions.  It was rather entertaining, and I must admit while it's dangerous for the players, it's pretty funny to see!  Apart from that, I'm going to be switching to Primus DSL in the next little while, they apparently run on Sympatico's backbone, only there is no download cap... and it's 10 bucks cheaper a month.  I'll let you know how that goes!  I'm also grabbing a DVD player to replace my PS2 which has been uncooperative lately, it's lucky I don't replace it with an X-Box!  Aight, I'm outta here!  Things and people to do! [ well... maybe just things ]

       Finally   Well, with less than 5 minutes left in our 7th game of the year, I finally got on the score sheet.  That's not to say I haven't been playing well, it's just you have to get used to playing mid-field, and not cracking home the goals, but instead just putting them up there for someone else to put home... which if I do say so myself, I've done pretty well!  If they counted assists, I'd have at least 6 or 7 by now.  Anyway, enough gloating...  I haven't done much in the past few days, hit Canada's Wonderland yesterday for the first time in about 5 years, had a good time, but damn was it hot!    Oh yeah, and Best Buy still hasn't called about my TV Stand.  I don't meant to gripe on and on about this, but when you're system can't process simple things like ordering a TV stand, there is a problem.  As the customer I shouldn't have to go in 5 times to check on the status of something that is sitting in a warehouse in Brampton. [ which I offered to go pick it up at! ]  My friends, you can get just as good a deal on your TVs and whatnot at other stores, without the clueless Best Buy employees.  If they give me something for my troubles, then I'll probably continue shopping there, because when they screw up again, I know I'll have something coming, otherwise I'll take my business somewhere else [ including the TV I already have, if I can get them to take it back...  why should they get my hard earned money? ].  Blogging is beginning to feel natural again, perhaps I should do this more often?  TTFN TTFT!

       A Bowl of Lucky Charms and some Time   It's been a long ass time.  So much for constant updates.  To be totally honest, the last thing I want to do after a long day on a computer, is come home and use... the computer.  Anyone I had reading this is probably gone now, but thats cool, I'll work at getting this back up, and then get the readers back.    I'm in another fight with Best Buy.  Taking them over a month to get a TV Stand from Brampton to Oakville... don't ask!  On top of that, I actually thought about working there, till the stupid manager gave me attitude.  We sat down to start the interview, and she starts asking all these dumb DOS / BIOS questions that the PC does automatically 90% of the time.  If you're messing with that shit, then you don't bring your PC to Best Buy!  Anyway, she asks me;   "What are IRQ 3 and 4 used for"  "Heh...  Sound Card?  I don't know the BIOS does that for me...  people actually have these problems here?"   [ cue the bitch's attitude ]  In the most stuck up, snobby voice she looks up from the book that these questions are in and says...   "It's general PC knowledge"  "Yeah...  when you have a book with the answers in front of you"   She laughed it off, but I could tell that was it...She asked a few more questions, like what is used to create a boot disk in DOS, and how do I partition a disk.  Then she asks me what I can do for Best Buy.  Remember I'm pissed at these morons about my TV Stand, so I told her that I had better Customer Service skills than 90% of her employees, and that it was the weakest part of Best Buy.  Then she thanked me and said I'd hear from her in the next few days...  funny the phone never rang.  Ah well, such is life.  Anyway, CCRA is keeping me busy, then soccer, and of course "my Jenny!"  Among other plans I have, once again I'll pledge to write more often, but who knows if I can keep up with it.  You need the will to sit down and type, and my new HD Terminal, HD TV, and DVDs keep my ass pretty glued to the couch!  Peace!

       Soccer "City"   Well, after playing 4 games in the past 8 days I'm pretty sore.  Sad thing is I'm 23, so I can just imagine how the older folk are doing.  We won the first and last games we played, and we probably should have won the other two, since we had more players for both of them, but such is life.  Our goal differential total is 0, so thats not too bad.  I've decided to change my guaranteed updates to TUESDAY, Thursday, and Sunday instead of Mondays, since nothing exciting would probably happen during the days on Monday.  This weekend was physically draining, I was out last night until 2:30am, and again tonight until 1:00am for friend's birthdays! [ Happy Happy Stacey!!! ] so I'll have to find some corner to fall asleep in sometime tomorrow!  For now I'm off, I'll get back to you when I have something you may want to hear!  Ciao!

       SARS Stock?   What a stupid thing to call the concert.  Caught a little of it on TV, but all and all I have very little interest.  Been keeping busy the last few days, TJs one night, a friend's the next, leaving little time to blog for my now 1 reader...  since the other one left when I said I was finished blogging.  Time to spread the word again I guess.  Planing on seeing Bad Boyz II tomorrow, and then Friday [ or Saturday ] Jen [ my g/f ] is coming home from a three week internship in NYC.  I miss her :S  Welcome back, and I hope to start ranting again soon, rather than these sissy updates.  Peace~

After some tweaking, and fixing...  I'll be happy with yet another template.  Now, lets get to something that I've been dying to tell someone.  The Fish will be making his return to the track tomorrow.  I am, as of this exact moment confirming my attendance tomorrow night for the SRL Summer Showdown.  Hopefully I can shake off the rust, and come out with a little dignity, at the very least, I'll have a slice of pizza and a some rubber wall for dinner!    See ya Tomorrow~

       Router Land is Hell   Well as we all know, the world is going mobile, and the Internet is no different.  So this week my girlfriend as well as one of my mom's friends decided to go wireless around their house.  So I looked around and found what  I thought was a sweet deal on a D-Link wireless G router, only 80 bucks!  Well thats where all hell broke loose!  This was possibly the worst router I've ever tried to work with!  I consider myself above average with these things, but I couldn't get to the router's config page.  I brought the router to my house, to see if maybe it was a windows 98 issue, but nope!  Both Win2K and XP couldn't connect!  Anyway, to make a  long story short, I went through 3 D-Link Routers, and decided to go with my original idea.  Linksys!  I'll let you know how that goes.  For now...  it's off to see PT try to come back from 9th in todays CART Denver G.P.    Exprerience counts my friend.  Age and wisdom comes later....  -  Unknown

       28 is Better Than 20!   Just got in from Collingwood / Wasauga Beach [ sp? ].  It was really damn windy yesterday at the beach, only stayed for like a few hours then we gave up and went to dinner and then to the hotel.    Blue Machine F.C. won their final game of the season to secure a 5th place finish in the season, which isn't bad in our first year.  It's off to the playoffs now where I'm hoping we can make the semi-finals at least, although I won't complain with a spot in the finals.  As for the title, grats to PT.  Extended his lead over Junqy by 28 points, even though he ran out of gas on the last corner and lost two positions.  At least you made the line Paul!  I'm off to another summer BBQ.  I'll catch ya'll later!~  Peace!  "Look at me, I'm Chandler, could I  be  wearing anymore clothes?"   - Joey

       Way Cool Bust   I find myself privileged sometimes with my job, which is over in a week, but I got to see some really sweet pictures of drug busts, and weapons busts at the airport and stuff.  Some of them make you wonder why these bad guys don't use their brains on legal stuff....  probably make enough money, and not have to worry about Jail House Ray.  They just made  urlLink [ a huge bust ] yesterday...  300 Kilos of drugs worth like 32 Million.  Not a bad day if you ask me.  Well I'm going to go and finish setting up my PHP server.  Thanks to MS Update I've reinstalled Windows XP three times this week on the PC I'm using as a server.  Their update servers have been fucked.

       Apparently I am Essential!   It was essential that I come in to work today to sit and do nothing.  I don't get it!  Half the world is off, and here I am doing nothing...  OMG, I'm sounding like the spoiled Government worker!  In all honesty I don't mind being here, but I fail to see any reason why half the people that are off in this building, need to be...  Then again, that’s not my job!  So I decided to take the last 15 minutes of my day to blog, and see if I could write about anything interesting!  Perhaps the new look of what is now officially "sw0rdfish 2.0 Beta II", or mayhap the potential  urlLink [buyout of CART]  by one of the leagues best owners Gerald Forsythe, there is always the  urlLink [Pharmacy Blunder]  or the more about  urlLink [boring, unoriginal people] .  Ok that last one was stretching, I do feel bad for the families, so don't spam me with hate mail!  Well, back to being essential!  "BAM!"    -Emril

       In Small Doses, No Electricity is Nice   Ok, put aside the fact that I couldn't use my computer for over 24 hours.  Then put aside that I couldn't use my PS2 / GameCube for that exact same time.  There were still a lot of benifits.   1 Paid Day-Off.  1 Computer in a new case.  1 New hole in above mentioned new case.  2 Lights installed on above mentioned new case.  2 Cold showers.  2 Family Guy Episodes on 1 Hour of Laptop Battery  Learned to cook a grilled cheese on a BBQ.  Saw Mars from my bed room window.  34 New emails when I finally got back online.  All and all though, it was a pretty enjoyable weekend.  Soccer team even won again!

       Good Times   SWAT was a pretty good movie.  I'm not entirely sure if it was because of my fascination with Police or if the action was really that good.  Lots of extra things made it drag on at times, and there was way too much unnecessary foreshadowing to the point where I knew what was going to happen 5 minutes before it did.  I know you're thinking...  isn't that the point?  However, really it should just leave you with an uneasy feeling, letting you "feel" like something isn't right...  not come right out and make it obvious.  Apart from that it's still a good movie  Next on my plate...  Case Modification.  That’s right, I'm gonna  "Rice-Out"  my computer case.  A little boredom, and a little interest has finally pushed me over the edge, and I'm gonna mess around with the new case I bought.  My MoBo doesn't fit well inside my old case, so I bought a new one for 45 bucks...  and then bought some Lucite-Tuff [Plexi Glass] and some Chrome coloured paint, and I'm going to have some "N00bish" modding fun.  LEDs and Cathode Tubes are in the future!  For now...  back to work!  Thanks to CCRA for breaking the Internet Proxy so I can post at work

       Ebert and sw0rdfish?   Movies keep rolling out of my " Must See " list and into me " Seen it " list.  Add to it American Wedding, and in another 5 hours, S.W.A.T.    American Wedding was worth the money, but nowhere as good as the first two...  don't expect a lot and you'll enjoy it more than I did.  Not that I didn't enjoy it.  Getting back in the swing of things this week, after a hectic week last week.  With yet another Speeding Ticket, I'm ready to burst...  time to take the bus more.    Tobacco laws still pissing me off.  Just cost Montreal the F1 race, and 80 million dollars in revenue...  if I had the time, I'd start up some website to try and make noise against this.  Player's Motor Sports involvement, the Fire Works show, and F1 race are three important things to our economy, and it's such a waste to see them go, just because they seem to think we're going to smoke because a car says we should.  If you're that stupid then all you need is a friend telling you're bound to end up winning a Darwin Award anyway, so who cares if cancer gets you first...  it's your choice to light up no matter who tells you that you should.

       T.G.I.F.   Indeed!  It's even better of a Friday because tomorrow is " Jen Comes Home " day!  Sweet indeed!  I've been watching a lot of cartoons lately...  but not your every day Snoopy, Bugs Bunny or He-Man...  no no...  I'm watching loads of Family Guy, and Undergrads.  If you haven't seen Undergrads, you should check it out.  Plays on Teletoon everynight at 10:00PM and 2:00AM, and I really reccomend you all give it a whirl.  In other news, I'm really tempted to start bitching about Canada's extreamly gay Tobacco laws.   Cost us  Benson and Hedges Syphony of Fire  and now  Team Player's Racing  becasue as we all know, Canadians are so simple minded that they'll start to smoke if we have to watch another year of the name Player's on a car.  Racing fans been watching Tobacco sponsored race cars for years, I'm one of them, and you don't see me smoking!  Peace~

       Keep on, Keeping On   It's been a few days, but I've been a pretty busy guy.  On my own accord, but busy none the less.  On the initially planned release day of arguably the biggest game of the year, Half Life 2, I've got some gaming stuff to touch on today, so here I go!  I've managed to get my hands on a few new games over the past week or so, and I'm glad i did.   F-Zero GX, NHL 2004 [PC], Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced  all of which are solid games but the online features of NHL 2004 has earned it more playtime than the other 2.  EA has provided a match-making service, that tracks wins and losses, rankings, etc.  Lets face it, stats are the reason we like these games.  I don't care much if I'm winning or losing all the time, but that fact that is a plus for me none the less.  As for offline, the game has improved 10-fold on 2003.  With Dynasty mode which lets you take a team through a 20 year period, and raise the team from a garbage basement dwelling team, to the Stanley Cup as the team's GM.  Easier to do it on Easy difficulty, but I'm sure Difficult is gonna kick my ass.   urlLink [ GunBound.net ]  was just brought to my attention, I'm not exactly sure what it is, or how it works... but it's worth checking out, I'll let you know how it goes when I know!  I'm out!  Good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person.   -  Mark Twain

       4 Home Runs, and A Shitty Ad Campaing   Carlos Delgado did something special last night...  The Toronto Blue Jay's slugger hit not 1.... not 2 ... not 3 but 4,  COUNT 'EM FOUR!!  home runs in 4 consecutive at-bats.  His only 4 of the game.  Wouldn't it be something if he smokes one in his first at bat today?  I'm not a huge baseball fan, but I've seen enough to know that Delgado is a serious contender for MVP.  On to hockey!  Monday, ACC, Maple Laughs... er Leafs vs. Canadiens...  7:30... the Fish will be in the heezeh!  Thats right, I'll be there sporting the Bleu, Blanc et Rouge, and hopefully they can pull out a W!   Go Habs Go!  Finally, a repost from the gamespot forums.  I don't feel like writing up a second rant about PC Gamer, and their stupid ad campaings, so I'll post what I did there;  Well I've had it up to hear, and I think I'm going to complain....   But sw0rdfish... whatever has gotten you in a huff this time?   Well let me tell you!  Today I get my new PC Gamer [ better than "Nudy Magazine Day" ] so i rip open the plastic, and put the CD on my desk to be tested later, when what do I see .....  not the cover NOOOOOO  a half cover with the word "Advertisement" on the top....  Immediately I think...  "new CPU chip?, HL2, Doom 3??  ATI 9800 Super Duper Deluxe with Bells and 3 Whistles!!!?? [ I mean common ... this is the COVER or PC Gamer.. this has to be HUGE!!!! ]  what is it......  N-Gage......  well **bleep** you!  I don't buy PC gamer to be inundated with BS handheld that aren't worth 1/6th the money they want for it, let alone the fact that it has nothing to do with my PC Games... I fully understand the concept of advertising = money, however who in their right mind gave the go ahead at Nokia to pay for this?  PC gamers don't care about Overpriced Phones w/ sub 8Bit graphics, when I can get a GBA:SP, and a brand new Samsung for half the price!  I think PC gamer should do some thinking before 1 selling out for money, and 2, giving something of this nature that much exposer....  no it's not a review, but if you advertise something, you should believe in it... at least just a little, everyone knows this phone isn't worth it's weight in sperm donations, so why the hell put it on the front so that your readers think it's a good idea to buy.  They did an injustice to their readers, and dammit!  they're going to hear about it from me!

       Weird Shit!    urlLink Canada.com Network - More on the Father Killer   I still think the guy needs to be killed.  Yeah he's mental, but talking about killing your own kids, and the act of doing it alone would make anyone mental, even if they weren't at the time of the act.  In other news...    urlLink [ Nintendo Gamer's Summit ] .  I think it takes a special, " rare but great " taste to enjoy Nintendo this much.  I can honestly say that if you gave everyone one choice in systems, most would pick PS2, then some X-Box, and a small few over 12 would pick NGC.  However, I'd take it...   no question!  The NGC only games are far better, in my opinion, than the other systems...  I like to think the rest of the gaming industry just doesn't get it.   You're all mainstream followers, and you just don't get it!  Better not post this on GameSpot, they'll eat me alive.   urlLink Penny Arcade  has an interesting view on the whole GameSpot vs. S2Games issue.  Basically a developer is bitching about their low score and according to them, the reviewer only put in a couple of hours.  Well, they're getting the marketing they wanted now.  Everyone at GS is talking about it.  Before that, I didn't even know what the hell Savage was...  maybe that was their goal?

       Piracy Hurts Me Too!   Here's the problem, and I've had to deal with it TWICE in the past 3 days...  No I'm not going to yap about how Microsoft only gets 10 Million a year and loses 5 Million to piracy...  because I don't care!  Let me explain.  On Saturday I visited Wal-Mart and picked up EA Sport's  Madden 2004.   For some reason, I picked up the notion that I knew what they hell was going on in football, other than the fact that a field-goal is 3, and a touchdown is 7... Well 6, but whatever!  After about halfway thru the 1st game, I was down 52 - 0, and I was thinking. " You Fucking Idiot! " and herein lies the problem.  I'm stuck with a product that I don't like...  mind you it's my fault, but I don't like it.  I should be able to go back, and spend my 60 bucks on something I like!  If I buy a TV, and I don't like it...  I can take it back.  Radio?  Take it back!  PC!!!  Take it back!  However, Video games and underwear... tough shit!  This is of course because people are buying games, copying them, and then returning them.  Thanks to all you moron's who treated EB and Gamestop like a Blockbuster!  So...  I happen to be very persistent when I'm not satisfied with something.  I marched back into Wal-Mart, and told them my situation [ less than 24 Hours later ] and that there was no way I could play this game.  It took a bit of talking, waiting, and a meeting with the district manager, but he agreed to let me exchange the game.  So, I walked out with NHL 2004, all for the Cube BTW.  Get home, played NHL for about 6 hours, and scored on average 9 goals in a 5 Minute game.  Unfortunately, the other teams averaged about 15.  I don't know if this is a trend in all the versions of NHL 2004, but the goaltenders are freakin useless!  My defence men were taking pucks off the line more than my goalie.  It was sad!  Scoring from center, scoring from behind the net, scoring off back passes!  Well, I did it again.  Sorry but I refuse to spend that much money, on a shitty product.  Almost any product, if you aren't satisfied with it... you're going to return in.  Gaming industry has the advantage of, once you buy it... it's yours, unless you go through hell and high water to get it returned.  I had to fib this time, but I got them to take it back, and walked out with F-Zero GX.  Now I know what is in your head.   "Why didn't you rent the games?"  and the answer is simple.  By the time the game is available to be rented, something new will be out, and I'll have missed the boat.  New video games are one of the hardest things to get your hands on at Blockbuster, so as much as it sounds like an option, it really isn't!  With the no-return clause, and the ability to patch.  I think we, as gamers, are getting duped into buying an unfinished product.  Sure maybe after 4 patches it's a great game, but the fact that this hyped game is gonna sell a TON, and we know they can't return it... it doesn't have to be completely ready, lets just get it out in time for the next big day, and we'll worry about it after.  Sad thing is, lots of gamers are ok with that.  They take it in stride, they accept and know that "The patch will get it" and they continue to do it!  I don't really know what can be done about this, but if I was the owner of a video game store, I'd say "Want the ability to return it?  No problem, sign up for our card, and we'll let you do it... until we notice you're doing it too much, then you can go somewhere else!"    Of course EB sells their games already open because they are too cheap to buy door sensors, but that’s another story.  Pre-opening the boxes so you can display them.  Meh.  I'm done!

Now all they need to do is sign Vlad, and the team will have a bright future.  ... and thats all I have to say about that!

       Isabel        She's Heeere!...  and I think she forgot to bring that "storm" everyone was talking about.  There is something wrong with Torontonians, and storms.  I think we have an extreme fear of them or something.  50KM/Hr winds, 50mm of wather...  What the hell are you all scared about.    The media around here was all hyped on "The Ruminants" of Isable...  give me a break.  It was a rain, and it fell...  oh yeah, and there was some wind.  When we get something in comparison to Carolina, or Washington then I'll worry, otherwise spare me the 15 minutes of hype on the news broadcast, and give me more sports.  This is why I watch and read  urlLink [ Canada.com / CH Network ] .  They tell it like it is more than most.  Out of the 5 channels I caught news, they were the only channel I heard the meteorologist say "I don't know what all this fuss is about"  I'm getting really sick of the media hyping everything like this.  Hype hypable stuff.  You know storms that will rip my roof off.  The USA getting ready to bomb Canada.  John Lennon comes back to life for one more show.  Speaking of hype, gamespy is up to their stupidity once again.  Putting games like Mario Sunshine, Donkey Kong Country, and Halo on a list of 25 most overrated games.  DONKEY KONG COUNTRY?  Idiots.  Read  urlLink [ Penny-Arcade ]  to hear more about it.  He pretty much said what I'm thinking, only better.  Don't bother going to adspy to read about it, you'll just get bogged down looking at all those awesome advertisements, you'll forget why you were there in the first place.  ...and thats all I have to say about that! -Fish   "w00y"  -  sw0rdfish

       You Don't Know Joe!   Not since Survivor one, have I been this immersed in a "Reality Show"...  then again, this isn't really a reality. urlLink [ Joe Schmo ]  is a show on Spike TV, that mixes  Big Brother  with  The Truman Show  to create a fantasy world for one guy, who has no idea he's being played.  As of now, the show is three episodes in, and I've loved every minute of it.  It's something new, and it works. Basically they took this guy, told him he was going to be a reality show, and then they put him in this house with 9 actors he thinks are other contestants, and they film his every waking second.  Tuesday's at 9:00PM EST if you're interested.  It then re-runs that week's episode a few more times during the week, so you can still catch episode 3 [ the best so far ] sometime this week!  And that’s all I have to say about that!   The proof is the proof!  -  Jean Chretien

       With Respect...   I decided to blog later tonight, just to show my respects to Ritter.   urlLink [ Penny Arcade ]  has had some interesting insight into the bullshit the RIAA has been up to, I can't help but agree with them.  I'd link to some of the anonymous methods of file sharing, but if you want to do it bad enough, and you don't happen to be lucky like myself, and live in Canada, you can use  urlLink [ Google ] , and find it yourself.  Ok, next thing I want to ramble about...  urlLink [ EA's Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII ] .  I picked up this expansion pack from Futureshop the other day, and I haven't been able to put it down.  If I'm gaming, I'm playing it! [ Except for tonight's Mario Party 4 ....uh... Party.  Thanks Mupiel and wife ]  the new maps alone make it worth the money.  Throw in the planes, tanks, motorcycles, and guns and you've got yourself a winner!  Same old Battlefield gameplay, more fun!  The MoDs and stuff make the game probably the longest lasting game I've ever played [ not counting Everquest ].  I'm in the mood to talk more, but no one is interested THIS much in what I have to say.  Thanks! - Fish   Holding!  66 Offence!

       Three's Company...  Two Just isn't the Same   I must say, when I first heard about the passing of John Ritter, I took it like just another celebrity death.  However, the more I read about it the more I realised what a loss this truely is.  John Ritter was truely a funny comic with a love for his job, a love for his life, and above all, still had a lot of living to do.  I grew up watching Three's Company with John playing Jack Tripper and if I'm not mistaken he did the voice of Clifford the Big Red Dog!  Personally I loved his new show, I don't get to watch much TV, but when I got a chance to, I'd watch.  Thanks for the laughs John.  Godspeed.     1948 - 2003    "It’s like there is a big tear in the world’s heart.  He was extraordinary in every aspect of his life, especially as a father.

       Good Times!   I must admit...  I like this school stuff.  The only shitty part is we don't get paid to be there, but shit...  being home at noon everyday is something I can't complain about.  Outdoor soccer season came to a close on Sunday, I forgot to mention our 2 - 0 loss, in the first round of the playoffs.  I'm sure we'll be better in future seasons I'm sure.  We were pretty successful for an expansion team.  We'll be playing indoors in Woodbridge this winter, Soccer City sucked, and I'm glad we're out of there.  What else is new?  Not a hell of a lot.  I'm going to try and set up an SQL, ColdFusion server on my PC and mess around with it.   urlLink [ Mupiel ]  is already way ahead of me in that department.

       Now You Can Help Fight Cancer!   I'm sure you've all heard of Seti @ Home.  The program that helps to find Extra Terestrials using your CPU when you're not using it...  Well, Stanford University has done a simillar thing, only they're helping to fight cancer.   urlLink Folding @ Home  is a program that simulates the folding of protein in an attempt to figure out what causes "misfolding" in protein which have a hand in the cause of cancer, parkinsons, Alzheimer's etc...  The idea is that this type of information would take forever on one or two machines.  However the program spreads the work over millions of home machines and uses CPU down time to simluate this data.  You can read more about it on the site, it's obviously more accurate.  If you download it, you can join team "33686" and work on protein folding as a team.  It tracks your status, and how much work you've done, as well as how much work your team has done...

       Sheridan College Thinks 40    So I'm in class the other day and our teacher makes the offer that if we'd like to switch to the other campus, Trafalgar, that we could talk to him.  My initial thought was " Whoa!!  Lots of people failed out in Trafalgar!!!  and then the teacher said something that struck me as odd.  He said that the other classes in Trafalgar were left as 15 people in each class because thats enough for 2 classes, but we don't have enough...  Ummm, there are like 40 people in our class!!!     Keeping in mind, that at the begginging of August, I wasn't even registered for school [ Sheridan's fault, not mine ], and I know I wasn't the only one.  Then today when I was switching to the Trafalgar class, Mupiel made a crack about being registered so late, and the receptionist's comments were " Don't even go there!" ... And thats when it hit me!  They didn't expect this many students at Brampton...  because they fucked up and didn't register us!  Being the lazy slob that Regina Persad is... she probably saw 15 people registered, said " We only need one CST class at Brampton this semester "  Not even wondering why a bunch of people weren't comming back.  So Sheridan hires enough staff for one CST class, and then the calls start comming in, and they go "oh oh!"  but can't do anything to fix it, because they couldn't offer the teachers full times jobs in July, they probably all went somewhere else!  So there you have it...  We'll call it the  Sw0rded Theory  and I'd be willing to put money down on this is what happened!  I should be a detective!~  Lieutenant sw0rdfish.

      I'm wondering when WWII became popular again.  I know for the longest time in the 80's and early 90's WWII games were limited compared to other kinds.  The movies focused on war in Vietnam and little WWII stuff (the holocaust in particular was a major story background) but the actual battles themselves were the stuff of high school history class.  It seems strange that as video games become more realistic the popularity of WWII grows.  Is there some secret longing to be a part of this gruesome war or is it the balanced battles and complex strategic gameplay that the limited technology of the weapons allows for.   Next in the Mix:  urlLink Call of Duty . I'm still a major  urlLink PlanetSide  fan, more than even BF1942.  Oh well.  I guess its more like I'm looking forward to the wars we'll be battling in the future. Good WWII movies and TV (in my opinion): Life is Beautiful, Band of Brothers, The Thin Red Line, The Longest Day, and The Bridge on the River Kwai (and The Geat Escape -- added @ 4:49pm). I saw  urlLink 28 Days Later  yesterday.  Not so much scary as the previews make it out to be, but very intense and thrilling. I highly recommend it.

      Who really wants to watch shakey copies of amazing films on crappy DVD's? I was reading  urlLink this  article on  urlLink CNN.com  and was thinking it would be a waste of my money and time to buy this crap.  Though I do understand why people would watch it given that in China they will not see it for months after its North American release.  What I really don't get is people who are impressed with themselves for downloading the movie off the net a couple days after its release.  Worse than the quality of the pirated discs, why would I want to watch the movie on my 17" (or 19" or whatever you have) monitor when I could see it on a 25 FOOT big screen for 12 bucks (or IMAX for  urlLink The Matrix:Revolutions )? Speaking of  urlLink CNN.com , I am horribly annoyed that I cannot watch clips of their news programs on the web.  I pay for cable TV at home and watch all their damn commercials, ISN'T THAT ENOUGH FOR THE MONEY SUCKING LEECHES!?!?!? Its like the idea of paying for radio.  Free things that people feel they could make more money on. Why not charge a fee for me to ride my elevator at home and then stick adds up on the wall I'm required to read before exiting?  Why not bill me on the amount of air I breathe?  And while you're at it, make sure that ads are being pumped into my dreams while I sleep.    YAWN!  I slept well, now I need some tasty Tim Hortons Coffee to start my day off right, cuz I always have time for Tim Hortons.

Unless is comes to making money, then I'm up at 6AM!  My Habs, yes that's right  MY  Habs, continue on their winning ways!  Shutting out the Islanders, like I said they would, proving once again that at this particular moment in time, they are the better team compared to Toronto.  I still expect Toronto to wake up though, hopefully Quinn will get canned.  The irony of the man he hired, firing him, would just be a hoot!  It's time he moves on anyway.  Well I'm off to fix my server downstairs, and see if I can get some ASP, JSP, and PHP shit working down there.  Peace!~

      After the Leafs got a lucky win Saturday, Montreal returned to it's winning ways last night, soundly defeating the Detroit Red Wings, while those "Awesome" Leafs took an ass kicking to the ....  New York Islanders...  I'm looking forward to Thursday when Montreal shows the Leafs how kicking a team's ass is done!  About Saturday, biases aside, Montreal deserved that game.  Toronto needs to desperately step up that Power-Play, 1 for 7 is NOT good.  Belfour stole the game, which is what he's paid to do, then again Theo had to be sharp at spurts to keep Montreal in it.  All in all though, it was an awesome game, until the Leaf fan's started acting like they won the cup...  Guess winning your first game of the season is a lot to cheer for when you've been waiting 36... No 37 years.  HeHe!~  Fish Out

      The day drivers in this country figure that out, the faster we'll all get home.    Driving home from Ottawa today, I encountered every type of driver imaginable...   The List      The Speed Demon  - This driver goes crazy at speeds faster than 120KM, which is fine with me, it's the erratic driving at that speed that I find stupid.  Pull up within 2 feet of my bumper, at over 130KM/Hr, I'm not going to pleasantly move...  come up behind me, I'll see you're faster... then I'll move.    WannaBe Speed Demon  - This driver thinks he's the fastest person on the road, drives 120 in the fast lane and doesn't move!!!    The Confused Sunday Driver  - This Driver drives 80 - 100KM/Hr in the passing lane... all the time!    Cloud 9 Driver  - Forget's he's driving, maybe eating, singing, or thinking.... sometimes putting on make-up... going 120.../shrug    The Driver's Driver  - [Yes I made that word up ] This Driver knows driver Etiquette... left lane I pass, right lane to drive.  Tailgating does no one any good.  Quick High-Bean flashes from well back should do well.  Still not moving?  Pass on the right, shake your head, and move on    The Moron  - No matter what, you're in his way, and he's right.  This driver doesn't move for faster traffic, and if you give him the "Please move high beam" he simply replies with the Bird.  Usually a Road Rage committee, don't piss him off or his engine may be in your back seat.  There  are more, and I tend to wonder from Driver's Driver to Cloud 9 Driver, but on the highway, I think I'm a great driver.  Stick to the Right, pass in left lane... is that a hard concept?  I'll talk about the game in Montreal later today, but it was a great game, very loud... too bad Toronto won, but they deserved the win, they took less penalties.

Don't expect me to cry because you haven't won a world series in 95... no wait...  96 years.  I blame them for the abuse this kid is taking.  Not one Cubs player has come out and said "He's not the reason we lost.  We lost because the Florida Marlins played relentlessly and they kicked our ass when it counted."  Yes they've made side comments, but none of them have come and flat out excused the fan.  ESPN and Fox had to do that for them.  Whatever, baseball sucks lately.

      Now its been on the news repeatedly for the last two days: the kid who screwed up the chances of the Cubs to go to the World Series.  I don't follow baseball, honestly, I actually only enjoy going to a game to eat peanuts and toss the shells on the ground ( its the slob in me ), but this news piece caught my attention.  I'm not going to reply to the thought that the Cubs were unable to win because they just weren't good enough ( they did have seven games to try ) because  urlLink Wil Wheaton  already did a good job of that.  My blog is for the unrelenting news media.  Its most likely that the team wasn't going to blame their ENTIRE loss on this kid as no sane individual could hold a moronic grudge like that for long but the media keeps dragging it out.  Since they lost game seven maybe we won't hear about it anymore but I doubt that will stop them.  It will likely be a topic throughout the World Series.  It just bugs me to hear the same news topic over and over again blown completely out of proportion. Maybe I just need more sleep.  I'm whiny. As an added note today, since I'm always pissed at the news, especially CNN, I thought I would include the news stories that annoy me on a daily basis ( according to CNN.com ) --  Today : Europe is a big place with millions upon millions of people living there and this is their number one story for the continent:  urlLink English fans sent home after fight

      So, as some faithful readers may know, my wife is pregnant with our first child.  I've been listening to a large amount of pop music lately as well.  The reason these two things collide is a third ... uh... thing -- my soon to be purchased Mini-DV camcorder.  I have these plans for home movies: complex directorial scene design, composition, editing, effects and most importantly, sound editing.  I really like to add soundtracks to the work I do... it has always driven my writing (plays and things) and has infiltrated my cinegraphic desires as well. Now this blogging has actually nothing to do with my DV desires (except for that last paragraph).  More so, all these movie ideas have me feeling excited, yet, anxious about fatherhood.  Imagine, me, a dad.  I mean, I will love being a Dad... but I always thought my dad was so  " Cool ".  Of course he wasn't cool (what dad is?) but he liked the coolest things.  Now some little youngster, my little one, is going to look up to me (hopefully).   Whats my point?   I just think it seems weird, I mean I can barely tie my OWN shoelaces.

       urlLink This  is some pretty cool stuff.  Go to the site and click gameday under the scoreboard for a game currently being played.   The site tells you EVERYTHING, down to the location of the last pitch.  Hovering over a player's name on the screen tells you their stats for the day, and you get a little box for the batter and pitcher's stats for the season / series.  Thats pretty damn cool if you ask me.  Of course you could just tune in to fox, but where's the Geek in that?

      I'm kinda worried, seeing as we are using our company's host to host the pictures and they broke this morning!  [ That's the Login / Password box you got if you visited this morning ].  I just finished a business exam that I pulled out of my ass.  I haven't slept much, so I'm going to do that now.  I'll get back to blogging sometime after exams, until then expect a blog here and there, but no regularity.  The icons I'll have back up once they fix our site.  I have a feeling I'm going to be doing some host bashing!  However they did call Mupiel right back, so Customer Service is great, which is important!  How many hosting sites do you know that will call you RIGHT back?  Stay Tuned!~  Fish Out!  P.S.  I find it funny that the Spell Checker include with Blogger, doesn't recognise the words "blog" and "blogging"

      I can't believe that  urlLink Bell Mobility  charges 10 cents for every   RECIEVED   message.  Text messaging is so much easier than actually calling and saves on long distance charges.  Plus you can never control who sends you messages.  I understand how it should cost to   SEND   but you should be able to get anything you want.   I am, fortunately, on  urlLink Rogers Wireless  Pay-As-You-Go Service and I can recieve any messages I like.  But I always want to send to sw0rdfish and I have no option but to phone to save  HIM  money. Damn Bell is screwing everyone. Maybe I can set this page to message to my phone... that would be cool. And yes, I do realize this violates my " will not post until I get an icon " blog made a little while ago, you don't need to point it out.

I'd love to get into it, but I'm in too much of a good mood, since Montreal vs. Ottawa is but 20 miuntes away, and another hockey season is apon us.  Here are the players I drafted for my the hockey draft I run;   Kariya P  Sakic J  Yzerman S  Jokinen O   Spezza J  Elias P  Sulliva S  Daze E  Chistov S    I'm comfident I can make a run for it...  as long as Chistov and Spezza take off.  I got Dallas as my team, we'll see where this all goes.

I have no DSL until my modem arrives, and I am in yet another battle with a major corporation.  I expect more out of this one then BestBuy!  Stay tuned!

       Sleep Is Your Friend   I've had trouble sleeping laley.  I'm not sure why I'm starting with that today, not like it makes a difference in your daily lives.  I think my issue is a product of three factors;  Afternoon Naps  Coffee After 9:00pm  Thinking of scary stuff as I try to sleep  That probably makes me sounds like a little bitch, but it's pretty much whats happening, and it's really fucking with my life.  Mupiel is constantly waiting for me, and I'm never bringing the god damn coffee.  I'm pretty sure I can cut out 1 and 2...  and that should help the overall situation.  Number 3 is a part of life, and I'm sure we all deal with that now and again, and I think it happens more often when you're sleepy.  Halo is all the buzz once again as the PC version shipped this week.  Personally I don't see the value in buying the game for $70.00CDN, no First-Person-Shooter has that much value to it, let alone a 2 year old port!  My luck seems to be changing on the eve of the Super Seven's big $25,000,000 draw!  I won a GameCube Wavebird Wireless controller from the local rental place.  So with that good luck in mind, I'm going to cash in my $10 from last week as well as all the free tickets I have lying around.  I don't know what I would do with that much money, even 1/10th of it, but I do know it would be fun.  Lots of fun!  I'm tired, and I want to go home!   Doh!  -  Homer J. Simpson

      As it seems to sit right now, there was a total of seven votes (where does the hit counter get its numbers from???) and the majority were leaning towards: LINK Now, I'm wondering if those who voted for Link picked it because they thought it was cool and they would NEVER in a million years actually name any of their children Link or if they felt it was the perfect name for a really white boy (both parents are pale skinned) from Burlington. My wife likes the name but I figure we'll end up going more mainstream then a video game character or operator handle.

      As some of you may know, the third member of the Warren Family is on its way.  February 23 is the current due date.  After the Ultrasound we have  NO IDEA  what the gender will be which is quite funny.  At first I didn't want to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl, the surprise seemed like the way you should do it.  But then my wife got me excited about buying gendered clothing for our first born.  So we were all ready to find out what it was going to be and then.... nothing.  The ultrasound girl (or whatever her job title is) couldn't tell.  So now I'm all upset because I won't know til February when my wife gives birth. This also leads into today's topic:   Baby Names  We have the girl name picked out already now we can't settle on anything for a boy.  Therefore, I have decided to have a Poll on which names other people think are good.  This is a short list, if you have more just post it on the Tagboard to your left

      Shit it's been awhile.  You have Final Fantasy Online to partially blame for that.  Furthermore, our inability to stay regular can be blamed on S.I.T.H.L [ Sheridan College ], Football [ Soccer ], and Work [  urlLink Adaptive I.T.   ] and something about a lack of bran and fiber or something!  McDonalds has finally realized that the majority of the world likes white meat more than dark meat, and they have converted their Nuggets to the wholesome tenderness that is a chicken's breast.  After eating 10 today, I can safely say that it taste the exact same as it always has, regardless of the manager's claim that "they taste better"  Sympatico continues to be burdened by Virii [ is that really the word? ] that are clogging up it's POP and SMTP servers, which makes getting emails sometimes a challenge.  I've even heard that some emails to me are being bounced back.  If I can prove this... Heads are going to roll!  That is all... You may proceed with your day!

      What is up?    Yes Final Fantasy Online is awesome!  I'm almost as hooked to it as I was to  urlLink Everquest  the first time I played it.  I've still got a lot to learn, but the gameplay and value are already showing themselves...  I can see this one lasting awhile!  You're probably wondering why I'm posting before 7:00AM on a Monday morning, and the answer is quite simple...  I can't sleep.  I was out for a bit, however I woke up, and I've been unable to fall asleep because I need to be at  urlLink C.C.R.A.  at 9:30AM for the C.I.T. that I need to write.  The C.I.T. or Customs Inspector Test, is to test your general skills like attention to detail, memory, recognition etc...  bah, do you really want to hear this?  So, as a product of not being able to sleep, I played some Super Mario Advance 4 on my GBA:SP.  It's the classic Super Mario Brothers 3 from the NES.  Took me about an hour, but I cleared levels 6 - 8 and killed Bowser [ hurrah for me! ].  I went through and cleared every zone.  I don't know if this was for beating the game, or for beating every zone, but I can go to any world I want now, and beat any zone I want over and over...  I don't get the point of that... but the fact is I can do it, if I so choose.  I'll have to check  urlLink Gamefaqs  later today to see if I'm missing any cool bonuses.  Well, I'm off.  In case you didn't notice, I stopped opening a new window for links... I'm too damn lazy to type it each time.  If you want to open a new window to see a link, hold SHIFT and Internet Explorer will do it for you... well for me.. but thats too deep.  Netscape may also be as helpful, I don't know.  Peace!

      I have now accepted that the game is actually ONLINE.  I have already started to understand how this game can  urlLink steal your life away . It has been ages since I played an online RPG, or almost any RPG for that matter, and so it takes some getting used to.  I feel like a  urlLink Lost Dog  following Fish and Kawika about the map listening to what they tell me to do, who I need to talk talk to to get what.  Fun but I think I'm up for some solo time on this too. Speaking of online game play,  urlLink Roger Wilco  sucks.  Fish and I seem to be able to voice chat fine but add Kawika to the mix from way down in Arnold's State and the whole thing screws up.  I've been running Roger on the laptop and then playing off my kickass desktop (well not AS kick ass anymore) freeing up more resources for the graphics, which look gorgeous. Anyways, I'm off to read the manual for the game... what?  ... pay attention in class??? What kind of  CRAZY  idea is that?  The don't give us these laptops so we'll pay attention and learn.... do they? By the way, the new comics are a wicked idea.... good one fish.

       IN FLANDERS FIELDS the poppies blow  Between the crosses, row on row,  That mark our place, and in the sky  The larks, still bravely singing, fly  Scarce heard amid the guns below.   We are the Dead. Short days ago  We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  Loved and were loved, and now we lie  In Flanders fields.   Take up our quarrel with the foe:  To you from failing hands we throw  The torch; be yours to hold it high.  If ye break faith with us who die  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  In Flanders fields.  -Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, MD - Canadian Army 1915    Thank you goes out from Fish, Inc., to anyone who ever helped protect what is right!

      I just purchased the  urlLink TV Wonder VE  card from ATI for my PC.     Here's my VERY summarized review:  Nice picture quality with a ton of features.  Being able to search through upcoming programs easily by Genre, or Name and even by Actor is really cool.  Recording seems to be a simple procedure but requires a fair bit of troubleshooting on my system.  I have to wait to see how the output will look when returning the image to my television or buring it to VCD & DVD.  Other than that, its real handy have TV in the bedroom though I need a better coax cable.  So much noise on my signal, especially on  urlLink Spike TV .

           With some pay-pal money that I stored away for just such an occasion, I picked up Super Mario Advance 4 for 25 Bones!  Pretty sweet deal if you ask me!  Anyway, I started playing it, and decided I'd first go through it level by level, and skip the flutes and stuff....  so off I went.  I was amazed at how many of the little tricks and secrets I actually remembered [ hidden mushrooms, and 1UPS, as well as the card flipping game trick ] and I haven't played this game in well over 10 years.  Crazy if you ask me...  why can't I remember algebra and physics like that?  My hunt for a NES and SNES continues.  If you have either, and don't mind parting with it.  Let me know.  Included in that list of "What Fish Wants" is an E-Reader to borrow, so I can scan some cards in to my GBA:SP... again, if you have.. tell me!  I'm out!  Oh and Mupiel...  you complain more than I do... well maybe not.    I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come  here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.  I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world....without you. A world without rules and controls. Without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.  - If I have to tell you...  you're dumb!

      Quick stint of bitching here: I was reading reviews as a preview to The Matrix: Revolutions on  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  and was really annoyed.  I don't know why I read reviews anymore but I am always surprised how many reviewers HATE sequels.  I only read reviews to get an idea of content now not to get the reviewers impressions.   I don't mind if people use this as a means to decide whether or not to go see a film but I'm annoyed when people tell you how they didn't like a movie cuz a review said this and that and then they agreed with them.  Go see the film and then tell me what YOU think.  I say skip the reviews, go to the film (or download it or whatever) and then bitch about what sucked and then read reviews. I just despise mass media more every day.  By the way I'm going to see The Matrix tomorrow (if you couldn't tell).

      Many of you know....  or don't know....  I love Cookies!!  I can eat cookies forever! Lunch, Dinner.... maybe breakfast!  If they're hot!  So today I hit the cupboard, and I see a bunch of cookies....  but one catches my eye!    urlLink      Imagine my surprise when I opened up the bag, to find a cookie exactly as depicted on the bag!.....   NOT!     urlLink      Mr Christie... you cheap bastard!  Where is my damn Peanut Butter chips?  If you have to cut back on budget, and save some money, put a new fucking picture on the bag!  I'm annoyed enough at this that I'm going to email or call Mr. Christie and his associates and tell them how disappointed I am with their false advertising.  Am I really that annoyed that I didn't get my fair shake of chips or that they're ripping me off?  No...  not really.  It's just another example of stupid corporate decisions that "save money" and they think "the stupid consumer won't notice".  Well guess what!  Fish noticed bitch!  I'm going to have to find a word for my attacks on these big daddy companies...  First Bell, then Best Buy, and then Bell again, and now Nabisco!  On the topic of Best Buy...  I found out how to get even.  You know those flyers that come to your door?  That advertise really cheap DVDs.  If you walk into a Best Buy, and buy nothing but those DVDs on sale...  They LOSE money.  It's called the Loss Leader.  They sell those DVDs at less than cost to get people into the store and hope that they then go and buy other products which they make a profit on.  So it's my new ritual to shop at Best Buy for DVDs on their first few days, and then get anything else I want at another store!  'Nuff Said!

(DNS are the computers that tell your computer what number to go to when you put in a name.) The fix has been pushed, but it could take a while to refresh everywhere. Meanwhile, if you're geeky, you can change your host file to get to Blogger (point new.blogger.com to 66.102.15.100).   So basically you can't read this, which means that since it's been like this since before 7AM, Mupiel's updates never went through and dind't appear, which means I wasn't kicked off the front page, which means that I've still always been on the front page...  Besides, this three day thing may need to get extended since we now have 4 bloggers...

      I have some serious stuff I want to blog about soon but not today, I'll leave it for the new year.  Instead I would like to wish everyone good luck in this upcoming year and I hope you finally get everything you wanted in life, love and happiness. And I would like to point out that this is the first time in the history of this blog that the Fish has not had anything posted on the most recent page.

      I have been busy this holiday season and I wasn't able to wish all you Fish Incer's a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanaka, and the end of Eid (oh I almost forgot Quanza). I got some fancy gifts and I am sure some of you did too. Now I look forward to insane credit card debt and being broke for a few months to make up for what I lost this season. The girlfriend and I are planning an escape this week we don't know where we are going to go but it should be fun. I think we will pack and just drive and see where it takes us.   As some of you know Mupiel, Sw0rdfish and I all play FFXI together. I also have my best friend playing the game. I came up with the idiot idea of leaving fenrir when we were low level to play on another server and we signed up for the world transfer (this is a bad subject with fish and mup). Once we got there it was what Fish said....Terrible. So we all left and went back to our old home. My friend Nappynix stayed there and has leveled his character to level 30 now. We visited over Christmas and he begged me to go back here and there to play so we could hang out online. I said I don't like Asura and I don't think I will be coming back ever. I thought about it  last night while playing on fenrir. I couldn't find a group on fenrir so I said what the hell and I signed onto asura. I was in a group in 3 minutes of signing on. This guy said we were going to go kill the Treeants (a Holiday bonus quest) and I was into it. So he tells me we are going to join a huge alliance and take this thing on.  I don't want to go into it but lets say a hour and a half later we  didn't find his alliance, see trees, or do anything but run like &@#$ing morons for almost two hours.  I have come to the conclusion that Asura is a server filled with retards, idiots, 12-year-olds, and other lowly beings of this nature. On a side note, I went back to Fenrir after that 2 hour waste of time and unlocked all my sub job quest items and I am only level 16.  Surf looks good, I am out.

      Another Christmas has come and gone.  The driving all done, the food all eaten and the gifts unwrapped I settle in to a relaxing evening at home.  As my wife was working I spent the last few hours alone, waiting for her shift to end but I did fill some of that time with a little FFXI and several glasses of cranberry juice. The time continues to tick down on the year and on my time before becoming a father.  Christmas next year will have a completely new set of circumstances but at least I can cut out all the driving. As a note, my odometer hit 100,000 last night!  Woo... do I get a cookie? Merry Christmas to all who read this and enjoy the holiday celebration.

      Wasn't my fault...  Blame the surfer dude!  I have total plans of playing a long side ya again!  Tonight however, I finally got to go see Lord of The Rings.  I had to wait for the girlfriend to get back into town.  I'll share my feelings on it tomorrow.  I'm just way too damn tired today.

      Alright.  So a friend suggested I play this online game with him because it will be great fun to adventure and kill beasts and whatnot.  Sure, I'm playing Planetside at the time and loving it though I wish I had more time to play.  But... usually this guy is an awesome source of information about video games so I figured he'd know.  Well he does, the game is really fun... problem is, the guy who said I should play never does when I do and his friend keeps switching characters and servers so I can never keep up to the same level.  This leaves me playing a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER computer game ALONE (I sound like such a loser, which I am).  Of course I could always "party up" with some Japanese hardcore gamers...  DAMN, forgot my translator...

      So...  As is customary the Saturday before every NHL Christmas break, Montreal Canadiens will take on the Toronto Maple Leafs in what is easily hockey's greatest and longest going rivalry...  or is it?  Without a doubt I love the 7 times a year these teams play, and it's because I've grown up being told to hate the Toronto Maple Leafs, and because I live in Toronto, where all my friends are told to hate the Montreal Canadiens.  Now, he's my question...  why?  The last time Montreal and Toronto played a game that meant anything more than 2 points and bragging rights was 1967, since then it's been countless regular season meetings and thats about it.  I have no doubt though, that when Montreal faces Toronto in a playoff series it'll all come to a head, and the fierce rivalry that we've all read and heard about will be reborn...  and then the Habs will promptly show the Leafs the golf course ;)

      A fine cinematic experience.  The audience was a tad restless nearing the end, but they still managed to piece together an applause (why do audiences do this now?  The movie makers can't hear you!!!)  I actually felt like crap going into the movie (damn cough) and was drinking so much liquid to feel better that I had to step out to use the facilities 3 times in the 3 hours.  I know, nobody actually needed to read that. Coming up after Christmas:   urlLink Big Fish  and  urlLink Paycheck .  I am not a fan of Ben Affleck but I am a HUGE reader of the excellent works of  urlLink Phillip K. Dick  and the news is that my favorite book by him,  urlLink A Scanner Darkly , is being produced as well.  Its an amazing story about drugs and multiple personalities, full of dark and edgy humour.  As for Big Fish, you can rarely go wrong with anything by Tim Burton (I would link to his official site but apparently the " account has surpassed its bandwidth allocation ").  Add to this the fact that one of the songs was done by  urlLink Pearl Jam  and I'm sold. For me, its like an anime (my favorite genre of film media) with angels (just cool factor for me here) --  urlLink Haibane Renmei .   The media is finally catering to my needs and desires.   It's about damn time too.

      What a freakin game!  Tonight's Habs vs. Predators game was probably one of the most exciting hockey games I've seen in ages!  Scoring, hits, excitment... just needed a few fights.  Ribeiro got 4 assists, and the Habs scored 4 powerplay goals...  it's too bad Theo got hurt, hopefully not too serious.  Some bad funks were ended by Montreal also...  Souray had his first ever NHL hat-trick, and his 11th goal of the year [ tied for team lead ].  Oddly enough, entering this season, Souray only had 13 career goals.  This was Montreal's first come from behind win when trailing after 2 in over 2 years.  Next up, your Toronto Maple Leafs!  *blarg*  My car is fucked, freakin thing stalls all the time.  we'll see what this is gonna cost me tomorrow.  Peace out!  I'm tired!

      Firstly:  Welcome to Kawika!  Moving on... Today marks the last time I hope to mention my wasted days at college.  I returned the spyware ridden, spam machine to Sheridan, and finished up my final report and mailed it off to the Fish; thusly completing my obligation to those bastards at that fine educational institute.  I salute you F***ers.  Of course they weren't all bad, mostly the useless Co-op department for never finding me a stupid placement (98% PLACEMENT RATIO MY ASS!). Since I am normally a news person I must comment on the finding of Saddam... uh no wait... I'll comment on what I usual comment... the media.  In an attempt to draw in readership with obvious tactlessness my worst enemy CNN.com has posted this latest news bulletin:   urlLink Bush: Saddam should face death penalty   Now the prez is from Texas so are we really surprised by this comment?  The dictator tried to kill his dad... wouldn't you want the death penalty for that too?  Is this really news?  Isn't there something going on elsewhere with some significance?  He's the president, he talks ALL THE TIME.  Cover something important for once.  By the way, the second story on the main page right now is:  urlLink Bin Laden will be caught, U.S. vows . Why don't they finish looking for the Weapons of Mass Destruction first?

      Oh I guess that's me?  Yes it's true... Fish, Inc. has grown once again.  And this time, it's a Yankee! [ we need to expand our American audience ]  Like he said, we been chillin' on  urlLink Gamespot  for over a year now, and Mupiel, Kawika and I are hookin' in up in Fenrir Server for Final Fantasy XI.    We'll call him our X-Box advisor since neither Mupiel or myself have an X-Box, so that'll be his job for the X-Boys out there, as Fish, Inc gets back to it's gaming roots.  It's nice to see my original goal of a team of posters is coming thru, send your applications to me! Clicky my name down there!  Don't forget to read Kawika's First post!  Peace!

      Ok, lets get the California boy stereotypes out of the way...   Yes, I say dude.  Yes, I do surf.  No, I don't look and act like Jeff Spicoli circa 1983 (Fast Times at Ridgemont High).  No, I am not in a gang.  No, I don't own a gun. No, my hair isn't blonde.  No, girls in California don't look like the girls on Baywatch.  Yes, I can wear shorts almost every day of the year.  Yes, everyone in California has a cell phone (they issue them when you get your social security card now).  No, I don't own a huge SUV.   I am sure I forgot some of the stereotypes but I think you get the picture.   A little back ground on me. I live near Anaheim (I am sure you Canucks know where that is since that is where Disneyland is and its home to a little known hockey team). I am a surfer. I used to race imports (I don't care what you saw on Fast and the Furious, its not like that). I met Sw0rdfish (AKA Pescado de espada) through Gamespot. He also tricked me into getting FFXI. Its ok, cause I love the game; I just get mad at all the time I waste playing it. Other then having a year round tan I am just like you guys (well that, and I don't say "eh..." at the end of my sentences; I say "Dude" instead).   I think I have said enough so I will see you guys soon...

      ... but it's ok, because it's just a virtual world!  urlLink The Alphaville Herald  is a mock newspaper website that reports on issues going on in Alphaville, which is the virtual world that " The Sims Online " takes place in.  Now apparently there are some naughty little girls, which might otherwise be of no surprise, however rumor has it that these "women" are under age.  This, obviously, is where the problem lies...  Personally I think its just some horny, lonely 50 year old fat guy, but even if it's not...  I don't think it's up to Maxis to figure that out.  If it is some little girl, or boy for that matter, isn't it up to that kid's parents to know what they're kid is doing?  Sure you can say Maxis is providing the means, but how do you stop anyone from sending words to another person?  After all thats all it is, two consenting people, sharing words.  Who's footing the bill?  Probably the kid's parents...  I'd want to know what I was buying my kids.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again.  The only problem with video games is bad parenting!!!

      The fish spent all night at the college.  Myself, I slept in my warm bed because I have not yet studied my  urlLink Visual Basic Tutorial For Beginners .  The culmination of 2 years worth of education and they decided to use a program I have never had experience with.  Direct-entry into second year and they start teaching Java (which I already knew).  First year:  All VB.  So I was of no use last night.  Having completed my end of the bargain I feel as if I should have taken on more in this project.   Ah well.  Nothing to be done now. 'Cept help the fish get home to sleep. Special thanks to Lundie as well for his brilliant ass-saving effort.

      Well, the dream of becoming Sheridan Intermural Indoor-Soccer champs ended today, at the hands of  Metro United , the best team in the league...  We did manage to keep it close, trailing 3 - 2 at half, but in the end our stamina gave out, and with our best player de-spirited and out of the line-up, we fell 7 - 3.  I'll tell you one thing, I heard intensity and trash talking from  urlLink Stugautz  the likes I've never seen from him... Nor anyone on our team for that matter.  Even with a score of 7 - 2 against us with three minutes to play, calls of " Oh YEAH!! Now WHAT?"  and  "Is that the best you can do"  came from our keeper...  Maybe it was the shots he was stopping with his head?  Let me tell you...  They hurt!  I took one of the head, AFTER it hit the wall, and it still hurt!  So props to Stu!  To the rest of you guys, it was the best game we've ever had...  We wanted it more...  Just couldn't find the strenght.   urlLink Yan  and Clive...  urlLink Waldo ...

      No... Well Yes.... But No....  Ok?  Holy crap it's crunch time, and unlike Mupiel, I'm feeling the crunch.  Basically I have one week to decide the rest of my life!!  Ok, not really, just the next three months.  Pass 2 tests, and an assignment, and that's it.  No more school forever!  Fail anyone of those, and find yourself back here!   I'm confident the "I don't give a hoot" attitude that some Sheridan teachers seem to have, will help me get past this final educational hurdle, and I'll be a free man come December 12th at 11PM...  At which point I plan to get smashed.  Alone if necessary, with friends would be ideal!  No even though I'm stressing out, I haven't given up on games.  I can't stay away from them, I'll probably play Sunday night, the day before " The Big Presentation " and then come in, and calmly walk my way through the presentation...  I don't get nervous talking in front of people anymore...  Especially not class mates I've had for the past 3 years.   urlLink Final Fantasy XI  continues to take up most of my time as far as gaming goes.  However, on a trip to my local gaming store with Jen and her brother, I grabbed Ratchet & Clank [ the first one ] off the Greatest Hits rack...  I still haven't played it  On the topic of gaming,  urlLink Penny Arcade  has gone out and used the voice they have for some extreme good.  They have started Child's Play, a program to buy gaming gear / systems / games, for sick children at a local Seattle Hospital.  I can't help but commend this, and hope that I can somehow get involved.  I'm going to try to help anyway I can, bring the program to the Toronto area...  Because we need it here...  Too bad we only have 2 readers...  So now that I've pushed Mupiel's posts down, I'll say... Don't forget to go read it!  It's rather Enlightening today!  I'm Out!   H!  - Mupiel

      I played Rockstar's newest creation for the Playstation 2:  urlLink M A N H U N T .  Firstly, I must admit to actually being somewhat disturbed by the violence.  Secondly, I must admit to wanting to play more than I did.  The subtlety in sound recognition is everything  urlLink Splinter Cell  SHOULD have been.  Plus, with the USB headset this game is scary as hell.  A dark voice barking you on to commit henious acts while you try not to say anything as the enemy will hear you.  Sneaking up with a plastic bag in hand, holding down the X-Button long enough for the targeting to go red (the most vicious "execution") and then letting go to watch the over the top violent murder.  Now, I am not normally the violent type but the game puts you in a situation where the character has to kill or be killed, so in some PSYCHO SERIAL KILLER sort of way, the mentality you get into from the peril and the ever present voice in your head makes the violence seem justifiable*. All in all it is a very well made game whether or not you agree with the mature content.  The AI is strong, the characters actually talk to themselves when they think no one is around (and say some wierd "Rockstar Games" sort of stuff), learn from your skills, and become consistently more difficult to surprise.  The sound is the key to the game though.  You must sneak your way from shadowy corrider to shadowy corridor to make it through without engaging too many enemies at once.   If I were a reviewer I would give it a number of stars out of like a bunch of stars. In other news, I saw  urlLink The Lion King  musical with my wife.  I hate musicals, but the music was okay.  And I had a Hagen Daaz ice cream bar on the break.  MMMMMmmmmm..... I recognize the irony of this next comment but... Is  urlLink this  for real?  Do people really think they need to support AMMO?  There are people starving in America but more importantly AMMO Day is November 19.  Where is America going?  There is a suspiciously large number of self declared " right-wing " weblogs. * Disclaimer: Real violence is very rarely justifiable .

      That snow just rocks!  Of course is also owned my car.  Proved once again that bald tires and snow are not a good match.  I'm pretty sure we got about two or three feet of snow, which is really nuts when you think about it...  That's enough to cover a toddler!  I haven't much time to blog tonight, we have a deadline to meet tomorrow for our current project.  Have I spoken of this yet?  I'll have to re-read my past blogs.    ...  After reading my last blog quickly, it doesn't seem like I have, so I'll touch on it quickly.  We got hired by a friend of my father to make a web application as well as a desktop application.  I wont get into the specifics yet, because blogger and google are good friends, and I can't let any info get into the wrong hands.  I know... I'm paranoid.  Anyway, this application must interface with a database and store information [ duh! ] and retrieval blah blah...  So!  We decided to use ASP.NET for the web application and C#.NET for the desktop application, and I must say, I'm learning a lot, and I'm pleased with my new found skills.  I've never been that into coding, although I do consider myself a pretty good one, if I apply myself.  I'll provide more information when it becomes available, but I think I can get used to coding for a living.  Now you're wondering... Who is we?  Well, we is myself and Ryan, who is pretty good with this shit!  Mupiel was involved as well, however he had himself a baby, and I guess he's a little busy.  More should be coming on Adaptive IT soon...  The future is looking pretty exciting, however some security would be nice.  Fish OUT!  By the way...  The title... They were the birthday boys.

      I've been playing a lot of GCN these past few days and would like to update you on my progress.  Not that anybody cares, but I have nothing better to do than to blog this up... so ya.  Let's start with Animal Crossing ('cause you know you love it :P):  My town is still perfect (but improvements still can be made - according to the wishing well)... and Animals from my cousins memory card are moving over to my town rapidly... it's quite funny to see my cousin get mad that they are all moving away from his town and into mine :)  I've got all kinds of fruits growing...coconuts, oranges, apples, pears, cherrys... I need peaches.... guess i'll just steal them from the fish when we have that LAN party...I messed up on the job the mayor gave me though - to turn on the lighthouse every day for 9 days... I mean.. wtf. I do have a life... i'm not gonna make this game a responsibility..GAH!  Next up... Prince of Persia:  I am into this game.. and am loving it!... I had to stop at one point cause I had other stuff to do, so i'm not stuck... just havn't really got back to it... I think i'm close to an hour into the game... I love the puzzles.. that one with that guy yelling at you to match up the cylinders on that rotating platform was annoying though... easy, but the guy yelling all the time made me want to kick him in the teeth.  Viewtiful Joe:  fun fun!... I'm stuck at the shark boss at the end of Act 3... that guy is tough shit... I'll beat him though.. oh yes.. I will.  MK:DD!!:  My cousin and I played the baby track (the plain oval) over and over in vs. mode for like 2.5 hours... that track is wicked fun!.. I'm still waiting for that LAN party to happen.. I know Yan will kick my ass, but I want to see if I can shut him up..haha.  I have to get gold for the star and special cups in 150cc so that I can get the All Cup mode.... but havnt really been trying 'cause I like the multiplayer games and races better... and i'm nearing the staff ghost record for the baby track... I just need to shed like 1.5 seconds off my time.  um.. that's it I guess ...  oh wait... theres something else I wanted to rant about..   urlLink Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles for 39.99, When you buy a link cable    This offer's valid at Futureshop and Best Buy It works out to be cheaper than the EB deal because you get a link cable which is 17.99+tax and then the game at 39.99+tax  Why must these deals come out when I don't have the money to buy them?.. why?!  ok.. im done.  peace out.

      Shit...  I even slipped off the front page.  I was hoping adding people to my blog, would take the pressure off me to post more than once a week.  In all honesty I mean to post daily, but I got busy last week, and all went to hell.  I haven't touched a game in a week, so don't ask.  Hit a reading craze...  Picked up urlLink [ Stephen King's: Wolves of Calla ]  which is Part 5 of the Dark Tower Series...  First 4 kicked ass.    I also started reading  urlLink [ Douglas Coupland's: Microserfs ]  which is a sweet book.  I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  It's especially good for my fellow geeks and nerds. [ read Programmers and Techs  ].    Capping off my book purchase craze was  urlLink [ Sams Teach Yourself Visual Studio .net In 21 Days ]  not that I plan to do the 21 day cycle, however I do fancy myself a good ASP.NET programmer.  I'll dabble into that a little more later, but I must say I'm doing quite well, and the technology is fascinating.  Who knows... Maybe I'll make some money with it.  I even got one of them Chapters/Indigo/Coles/SmithBooks [ WTF??  Pick a name ]  urlLink [ cards... ]   So if you need to save 10% on a book, let me know.  I got a laptop too...  Should help with mobility.  I've been lugging my PC all over the damn place, it got to me.  I got a Centrino platformed laptop, the battery goes forever, with 1.7 Pentium M chip... Which is supposed to act close to a P4 3.0...  For what I'm using it for, it's faster than my desktop, it's just lacking an ATI 9700, which allows me to justify not selling my PC.  What would I game on?  fish... OUT!   Random Words Will Now Appear Here.  Quotes Take Too Long    P.S. I find it funny that Blogger.com's spell checker doesn't know the word "blog"

      Firstly,  Congratulations to Mupiel!  In approximately 13 years you will ponder the fact how a few seconds of pleasure can amount to so many grey hairs. Good luck! (Bonus points for not naming her Link)  Then, how to host a murder. Take eight people, preferably with imagination or the balls to make fools out of themselves. Add dinner, costumes, a plot, and Voila! An evening filled with accusations and... puking. I was so drunk I can't believe myself, given the situation and people around me. The setting of the game was "western" so we were all cowboys and triggerhappies in true Bush style, I even had a southern twang to it, until the alcohol took it away. Then it was just a slur, I believe. That blasted Southern Comfort (yeah yeah) and cheap whiskey, if the host of the evening hadn't told me to help him get rid of it... I did it for the team!  I remember someone, near the end, telling us all what a great bunch we all were, so I believe myself to not have been the only one drunk there. Actually, I know this for a fact, as I had to wait for my turn by the toilet.   Enough of this, onwards and upward!

      With the help of some person I met online (lives in Barrie), I set up Warp Pipe with my GCN/BBA/PC and we played a short, but working game.  It lagged out after a period of time because of the connection, but still.. it worked :)  Then today I helped Yan set up Warp Pipe and we started to test it out when my router got all fubared and started to go berzerk when it detected my GCN.  An hour of troubleshooting and a firmware upgrade later, we were up and running!  We raced a few races (Yan kicked my ass) and battled a few battles (we broke even there)... fun fun.  What sucks about it though is that you cant select your own characters.  In LAN mode, the game selects the characters and car for you... booo!  So when it comes time (it better be soon... *cough*Sw0rdfish*cough*) to have our GCN LAN party, whomever is playing better be good with all characters 'cause you never know what you're gonna get :P  I can't wait!  Other than playing GCN all night, I downloaded a slew of N64 roms and was playing them all afternoon... I like how the PC monitor enhances the graphics:     ...oh.. and I don't understand how people like MarioKart 64 more than MK:DD!!.. i mean.. wtf?  I was playing it and was... um.. this sucks.  I like the snes version better!  ok... back to playing with the roms :)  gah!... i have to pay attention to PoP!... i guess i'll do that instead :P  pacs

      So far, being a father is filled with WAY to much excitement.  I am overwhelmed with all the good feelings.  You just have this new little person in your life and loving them is automatic.  You don't think " I have to love her because she's my daughter  you just see her and you heart melts.  There is a lot of nervousness as well though.  She was born early at 34 weeks and 3 days and if my wife had gone to term she would have been over 10 pounds.  Because she was early we have to leave her in the hospital nursery constantly and just visit occasionally.  I find it hard to cope with being away even though I just met her. As for my video gaming:  NBA Street Volume 2 is now 2 days overdue from Rogers Video. Think they'll understand?  urlLink Talim (6mb .WMV)

      First off, I'd like to congratulate Mupiel on the new addition to his family.  Cheers dude! I wish you only the best.  I just spent more money that I don't have. Why? I dunno.  Boredom maybe? BAH!  I've got 2 games and a broadband adapter sitting in a bag on my bed waiting for me to make use of them.  Yup.  I finally picked up the PoP/Splinter Cell package (last one at the BB @ heartland btw ;) ) AND I picked up a broadband adapter from EB.  So I guess that'll keep me busy for some time to come...or at least tide me over until the interviews start coming in :( .  I think I'll concentrate on PoP first... and at night i'll play around with the bba - on a side note... Yan and the fish also have MK:DD!! and a bba, so watch out for our impressions on the whole online/LAN party racing experience!!! - then later on ('cause it just doesn't interest me) i'll start on Splinter Cell.  It was free... so it can wait.  What else...I'm still playing Animal Crossing. Every morning I play for at least 30 mins and i'm quite pleased with how my town is developing :)  To further help the fish, I installed ASP.NET Forums on my computer..which is getting pretty annoying because I can't use my mySql server (the one I use with my php board)... I was forced to install MS Sql Server. boo i say!... boo to that! Anyway, I spent the majority of today playing around with it.  It's going on hold tonight though as noted above... I have other stuff to do now :)  But as soon as tomorrow comes, i'll probably work on the .net boards 'cause I can't leave something undone.... it just doesn't feel right. ya know?  So there.  That's what i'll be doing for the next little bit.  GCN is taking over my life... well how about that.  pacs

      Hey all...  I'm working on setting up some ASP.NET based forms for my dad's company, so I set up a BETA section.  Basically how it's working is I do changes on the Beta forums first.. and if I like them, I upload them to the "yet to be launched" live forums.  I'd appreciate it if anyone and everyone registered, posted, had fun, whatever....  help me find some bugs and stuff.    Here's the link... urlLink Fish,Inc. Beta Testing Forums  Bookmark it and come back often, so that I constantly have traffic and users to test stuff on.    Peace~ I'm out!

      Well, I was hoping that by adding some more people, I wouldn't have to post as much... boy was I wrong!  In all honesty the only thing keeping me away lately has been the amount of work I'm getting.  Can't really complain about that, because work = money!  Like everyone else, I've had time for game.   Prince of Persia , which I got in the Splinter Cell / PoP deal, is possibly one of the best games I've played on my console in a long time.  It beats the hell out of Halo, thats for sure. [ Eat that XBoys ]  I got my Nintendo Broadband Adapter, so expect to hear about a Fish, Inc. LAN / Mario Kart Party in the next couple of weeks.  I'm anxiously awaiting to hear news from Mupiel regarding his better half...  seems like he's a couple of weeks from becoming a daddy!  For now I'm going back to my ASP .NET self-study weekend.  Peace I'm Out!   Montreal 8 - Pittsburgh 0

      From 7:30am until about 7:30pm today I sat in front of my computer and worked on updating  urlLink my messageboard .  Yeah.  That's right, around 12 hours of php, css, mysql and html.  Needless to say, I am happy with the result :)  After that marathon of tweaking, my cousin came over and wanted to play some MK:DD!!  That game has been taking up a lot of my time, but recently I've put it on hold 'cause unlocking everything is a mighty task and it gets very frustrating when you come so close to getting something, but lose at the finish line.  However, without even noticing that I was winning, I was able to unlock Luigi's Mansion for battle mode (gold in the mushroom cup 150cc).  Now all I have to do is get gold in flower, star and special (all 150cc) - That will give me The All Cup Tour... and then after that who knows...well, I do, but i'm not going to bore you with it.  After MK:DD!!, he wanted to play Animal Crossing (it's his game, but I have it :P ).  He hasn't played in 11 months - according to his townfolk.  Now that game took up A LOT of my time... so I put it on hold and havn't touched it for a week now; but watching him play made me miss it and I'm probably going to play tomorrow.  Why do I get suckered into these things?!  I was kinda peeved that the animals had a New Years party without me.  They didn't even tell me the location of the party! and by the time I found them (in a big group btw) the huge, colourful countdown sign had already hit 00:00 and all the animals were dancing and drunk.  Don't worry... i'll be back tomorrow to clean up them weeds :)  Alright.  Enough already... I know.  But I'll be back soon!.. oh yes I will.  pacs

      Whooo...  I love the holidays!  Add in 3 days in Montreal and getting used to not being able to relax till after 5PM, but at least I'm making money!  Thanks dad!  Montreal was...  Well...  Cold.  I did however get to go to the Habs / Thrashers game on Saturday.  It was a pretty good game. 5 - 1 Habs!  So I'm just working, chillin and trying to get things rolling with Adaptive IT.ca.  If you need web hosting, give me a call, I got tons of room!  Gaming!  Right!  I did well over the past few days;  Viewtiful Joe  Mario Party 5  Prince of Persia  Splinter Cell  Mario and Luigi: Supersaga  Zelda Collectors Disc  Thats right, I finally picked up the deal... Let me rephrase,  The Deal[tm] .  On my way home I checked out Best Buy, and after some hagling, they hooked me up with the games...  $64.99 [Best Buy has Price Matching Pacs] and that will complete my purchases for the next month or so...  The first two I got for Christmas, along with  Supersaga , and the other two I purchased using some Christmas funds.   Viewtiful Joe  is pretty good, although I've only played it for about an hour...  I'll class it as a button masher, with a bit of technique while you're in slow-mo.   Mario Party 5  is what every Mario Party before it was...  great in a group, fun enough by yourself, and all round great purchase!  Played it on New Years half wasted!  Loved it!  Peace~ I'm out!

      I would like to extend my welcome to those new to Fish Inc.  Readers & Bloggers alike. As for a first blog in the tank yours was good  ed , except you slammed my place of employment.  Its not that I'm upset about it, I just feel I'm the only one here who who should be bitching about this major electronics retailer ...just kidding.  I get the staff purchase so I'm happy with it for that, at least.   Speaking of staff purchase I bought an open box  urlLink Sony Clie T665c  for $50.  It had no accessories but I was able to pick up the charger/USB cradle for $10 and a stylus for next to nothing.  All the software I pulled from  urlLink www.cliesource.com  and I already have memory sticks for my  urlLink MiniDV Sony TRV33  which I picked up on staff purchase as well. Its likely I'll provide a review for both in the upcoming week or so.  S , its been ages since I played any D&D.  I played mostly when I was in University and I was alot more fond of  urlLink Vampire  (always a  urlLink Malkavian ) and especially  urlLink Hunter: The Reckoning  from  urlLink White Wolf . In other news, the doctor says the baby will likely arrive in the next few days but we're hoping for a couple weeks so the lungs are fully developed.  I'll post pics when the big day gets here. One final note: Prince Of Persia is possibly the best game of the year.  On the other hand, Splinter Cell I rented one day and returned 4 hours later and asked for an exchange to another game.  I already have a job, I don't need to spend my off time working another one, which is how it feels when you're playing. Sorry for the long blog.  I'm done now.   You can go.

      Hello everybody!...i'm here! weeeeeeeeeee!  My name is eddiepacs.... that's pretty much all you need to know ;)  Like my av?... I made it just for here!... seeing as mupiel and sw0rdfish as a cartoon made me jealous and so I created ...me!  Anyway, enough with the chit chat.. lets get down to the gamage(is that even a word?)  Today the fish and I ventured to sq1 in search of  urlLink this  deal:  Buy the title "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" and receive "Splinter Cell" for free for the same platform. Platforms include PC, XBox, PS2 AND GCN.  Notice the 'AND'?  We went to Wal-Mart. They have PoP and Splinter Cell for GCN, but not as the package...yet they have the package available for PS2 and Xbox...ughhh... to quote the CSR: "We havnt received a shipment for gamecube yet"...ughhh to that.... so we had him call the Queensway location and the Meadowvale location...the result was the same... only for Xbox and PS2....boo!  We then went to Zellers - they dont have ANY games let alone those 2... I guess they got slammed during boxing week.  EB?...they have the deal, but sold out...BAH!  Microplay? - they dont have the deal.  Compu Center? - we went there only to find out that they are gone!  Found out they have it at FS..and therefore BB, but for $69.99 gah!  well... I guess i'll wait until Wal-Mart gets their "shipment" of labelled GCN games... or closer to the end of January to get this deal...last resort is FS and BB... boo to that!  how's that for a first post?  pacs

      Ahahaha!                        ...    Last evening went well. We got started around 6pm, only one hour behind schedule. It was Pete's first go as a DM, so I'm glad Linn could suppress her migraine (my ass) and come get in the fuckin car so she could make up the third not-yet party member. I was anxious to get started, I've decided to really give it my best this time, my air genasi albino rogue shall rule supreme! I did reach a low of minus 7 hitpoints, but I'm writing it down as a life-changing experience, so move on, nothing to see here folks.  And if you like Agatha Christie's Poirot, food, and dressing up; check out the "how to host a murder" series of games. Just bring enough alcohol and no worries.

      So when is this LAN party thing going down? ... and someone needs to figure out how this ladder thing is gonna work.  gah! and what games are gonna be played?!  I can think of a few:  PC -CS -UT 2004 (i downloaded the demo.. fun fun) .....i dunno any others... im not really a PC kinda guy  GCN - ok heres the fun :) -Mario Kart DD!! (1-16 players!) -Naruto 2(up to 4 players)  and just to throw in some others: -Super Smash Bros Melee(up to 4 player) -Super Monkey Ball 2(up to 4 player) -Soul Caliber 2 (2 player)  and not for competition, but fun: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (4 players)  XBox and PS2... im not avid fans of these games, but of course, they'll probably make an appearance. so ya... what other games will there be?...are we going to include GBA?!... nutz!  pacs.

      We'll call it abandoned this time ;)  7 days with no posts... that's a long time.  OK... So it's time to release the best worst kept secret in Fish, Inc...  Tomorrow morning, I'll be trading in Miss J [ My Jetta ] for a Mazda 3 GT.  It's been somethign I've been toying with for over a year now...  and frankly I think it's time.  There were a few reasons that influenced my decision.  First off, the Jetta gets real expensive to fix, and in my opinion it's at the perfect age where I can still get a decent amount of cash for it, and it's a few months away from costing a great deal to fix up...  on a regular basis.  This way the dealer will fix her up a bit, sell her, and she'll make some punk happy till he smashes her up or something.  Next reason...  It's a damn pretty car!!!  Final reason...  I was getting a little too finacially comfortable and stable, so I need another $20,000 debt!  There are a few more, but I'm sure you don't care...  I'm a little saddened that I wont be in the Jetta anymore, she was a good car...  my first.  I'm not usually much of a car guy, but everyone gets attached to their first car [ the Volvo that lost it's wheel was really my first, but it was only 6 days so it doesn't count! ].  In other news...  we'll call it the sw0rdTicker...  Playing FFXI again:::March 1st Cometh REAL soon:::Girlfriend Birthday:::Gym Membership:::No Money:::Happy!!!:::  Check out  urlLink Adaptive IT ... Mupiel continues to make new and impressive updates.  Fish....  z00m z00m...  Out!   Friends, Team work, 4 points, 2 days, 1 week, 5 stars, The aeroplane flies high...  Turns Left...

That being said, if you don't like me posting funny "old" shit, post it when it's new...  Or get out of the tank ;) [ /rant ]  Now to avoid this becoming an avenue for us to verbally abuse each other...  "The Ladder" is definitely on!  We'll have to work on some system, where we can report wins and stuff easily.  I'll do it when I get a chance, till then we can do it manually.  Lets make the LAN party the official launch date.  Good job Mupiel.  Talim is most definitely the youngest person to have a website ;)  Makes me want to register my .com name...  I just don't have any use for it.

      My cousin took his copy of FF:CC home with him just as I was about to enter the 4th year (single player ... weeeee!)... and so I was stuck playing MK:DD!! for the past 4 hours.  I made progress though.  I've unlocked everything but the trophy kart.  That can wait until another day.  I'm in for this ladder thing although I don't play PC games except for the occasional CS match (which btw I suck terribly at).  And now since Yan got his copy of Naruto 2, all I have to do is wait for my cousins copy to arrive and I can practice and play that against him too! ... holy! the GCN LAN party is going to be wicked fun!... 4 player Final Fantasy, 8+ player MK:DD!! and 4 player Naruto 2!... omg.... I can hardly wait!... ok.  I think that was too much excitment in such a small time span... alright... im calm.  Welcome to the Tank Yan....i'm sure we'll here many GCN and the like stories from you.  Mupiel, nice job on your daughters site.  I like the chalkboard theme you've got going on there.  [rant]Sw0rdFish, visit  urlLink william hung's official site  ... all the mp3's and vids and stuff you are posting can be found there.... so ya... stop posting that garbage :P If I wanted to visit old links like that, i'd pay more attention to my own board ...hahaha...[/rant]  Any other multiplayer games for GCN coming out or worth mentioning?  hmmmm...

      So after numerous atempts (at my life) i have finally dove into the tank.  For those of you who don't know who i am, i don't care...go to hell, and for those of you that do...same goes to you.  I make alot of spelling mistakes, deal with it if you want my posts to be perfect, i'll be happy to send them over to you so you can edit them.  So yeah, i decided to join up with this blog, because i don't have any friends and i wanted to feel like i had a family.  In other words, i didn't want to talk about video games in my own blog cause no one else gives a shit, but i figured everyone here would!  This weekend is a perfect thing to have my blog about...what did i do you ask?  For one, i had a 12 hour session of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals!  And unlike ed, who is a chump, i played it multiplayer with 4 people!  Umm the game is pretty good, it's definitly fun with four people, the battle system is easy and you can get back and forth from your spells and attacks with little trouble, which is key for a game like this.  I also like how everyone has a different map on their screen.  IE: one person gets the dungeon map, one guy gets the monster map, one the teasure map and the other guy gets scout..which gives you info on the enemy you are fighting.  Another cool thing, all the artifacts you find in the dungeon you don't get to keep..which you might think is stupid, but at the start of each dungeon you have a bonus IE: don't use focus attack or Defeat enemies with spells.  So you go through the dungeon trying to do that, and at the end of the dungeon everyones bonus is added up and whoever gets the most, gets first pick and one of the artifacts you found.  So you do get to keep one.  Another thing i liked...in single player you can fuse spells, (single player only...took me 4 hours to figure this out) but in multi player, you and other team member have to put you cross hairs together and then cast at the same time to fuse the spell, very good idea in my opinon.  Anyways...there are somethings wrong with this game, they could have made it so much better.  For one, the story is crap.  Like i'm in the fourth year, playing for 12 hours and the story is the same...i'm still doing the same thing, talking to anyone is pointless and all the cut scenes so far have been pointless.  They also didn't do a very good job of diversifying everyone.  Pretty much every character is the same, you all pretty much get the same equpiment, everyone has the same spells and abilitys....shit making your character is one of the main things in and rpg...i don't know why they didn't put more effort into this.  Oh well...seems like very game these days for gamecube has an awesome idea but they leave out so much that could have made the game perfect.  Overall this is a good game, but if you want to play an awesome multiplayer rpg that does everything right, get Tales of Destiny for psx....remember though, DON'T PUT THE CHANNELING RING ON LEON!  Anyways, other than that, i spent most of my time playing gunbound.  I'm up to double steel axe now, i think i can join guilds at this rank...not sure.  All aduka only shot 2 games are sweet, you make gold and gp super fast.  Oh yeah...after almost 2 months..guess what finally showed up at my door?!?  That's right Naruto 2!!  Picked up my free loader today and i'm going to play it right after i finished writing this!  which is now.

      You are SO going down Mupiel...  I'm down with the ladder idea also, for all games...  When you want to move up you challenge someone above you, if you win you leap over the person directly in front of you.  We can work on details like you fall one spot if you decline three challenges or something like that.  I'll be fun.  Of course that all depends on work, and what not.  LAN party tentatively set for late March, I'll be in Montreal the weekend of the 13th [ hopefully ] but one of the two weekends after that, we'll have it.  Someone make a Logo or graphic or something for this site.  A graffiti one or lightning or something would be cool...  Winner gets a McCombo on me...  I don't' have to know you, even if you're just browsing through.  I'm gonna do a little experiment, so the following is to be ignored by our regular readers;  sex, porn, britney, naked, hot, Paris Hilton, video, free, smut  For the record.. The counter reads 10463.  I'm Out~   Thanks Miss J, I'll miss you

      Its time for this blogger to put his money where his mouth is.  I am offically challenging the Fish to the Showdown to End All Showdowns.  Not just one game of CS, not an afternoon of Battlefield, but rather a year long challenge to determine the best of the best.  Now, not every game we play will be counted, but all those designated as challenge matches will be tallied.  As a suggestion for a final prize:  On January 2, 2005 the loser buys the winner a video game of the winner's choosing. All stats will be logged (blogged?) here for all our faithful readers to gauk at.  Giving you guys something to tune in to.  I'll post screenshots and in-game comments, and even video, if its possible. All that remains is for the Fish to take the bait. What do you say?  Or are you just going to keep smack talkin', Pansy?  What are you, a noob?  Any suggestions for games would be welcomed.  Oh and you know Mario Party 1 through 5 is on that list.

       urlLink Sad day  for -Mike- [ on of our Tag Board regulars ], his Clog, and in particular his 93 Protege.  For you to start a site dedicated to your car... You gotta love it.  Sad to see someone like that lose their car.  Look at it this way, you can get a new Mazda 3 now!  More on that at a later date.  Valentine's Day has once again come and gone, and I enjoyed mine.  February is always a killer month for me, 3 birthdays, valentine's day and reading week...  Means my pockets are empty.  This years will be even more expensive...  Some 22,000$ more expensive...  More on that at a later date.  I finally re-installed Battlefield 1942, the best PC game out there right now.  Was good to get back at it, it's just that damn fun.  When urlLink  Tech TV  announced that  urlLink Dessert Combat  was this week's LAN Game, the "fan boy" had to sign up again.  It's my meat and potatoes, I challenge anyone who thinks they can beat me at it to try...  Once I'm done taking Mupiel to school, I'll take you out too when I have a second ;)  Conan.... Oh Conan...  That was some funny shit.  I think the francophone politicians need to calm the fuck down and learn to take a god damn joke.  Being born in Quebec, and having francophone relatives, I can say this...  Lighten up!  That's not to say that the rest of us don't need to, but they always seem to take jokes like we actually mean these things.  Yes, the US thinks all French speaking Canadians are gay...  The Americans that know what a Canadian is anyway.  Fish Out   Bullocks; English; England; France; French; British

      What an AMAZING game!... if I had the money i'd pick it up right away... but for now, I'll just play my cousins copy (we picked it up yesterday).  I'm sure if you read any review on it you'll find that the graphics are amazing, the story is amazing, etc... and all of it is true... so i'll just talk about what I feel the game lacks in since there are more ups than downs...  First off, there's this circle around you that protects you from the environment you play in.  It gets quite annoying that you cant venture off away from the circle, and sometimes the circle messes up the graphics (because its there), but what can you do... oh well.  You're also constantly running.. theres no sensitivity in the analog stick... so no walking/running... just running.  um... the c-stick is useless in this game... so the views are automatically made for you...that sucks...  but enough of the down falls... everything else is SICK! .. the music, the graphics, the Action RPG gameplay... sweet :)  My cousins only complaint is that there are no ninjas in the game... this coming from a die hard RPG player.. go figure.  I can't wait to try out the Multiplayer... actually... i'm going to go do that right now :P   urlLink Kupo!    Pacs... ALWAYS link the word  urlLink Kupo!  to the comic!!!  Fish, Inc.

      Its surprising what will keep your interest when you get little to no sleep. I have been playing  urlLink Karaoke Revolution  for the PS2 with my wife in those times between naps.  Its kind of addictive and I've never been that great a singer.  So far, we're doing pretty good, we're better at this then we are at  urlLink Dance Dance Revolution  (yes, I do own the dance pads).  You sing Karaoke using the PS2 headset for that Brittney Spears appearance and the games rates your ability to hit the right notes at the right time.  My best luck has been with " Everything You Want " while my wife has dominated the game singing " Are You Happy Now? " and " Addicted ". If no one will challenge me at CS maybe I can get a Karaoke Deathmatch arranged for any daring enough to bring their pipes and an ounce of courage. You up for it  urlLink Fish ?  Or do you just want to lose at Counter Strike?

      A few people I know are braving the lines.  Personally, I'd rather catch it on TV.  Must mention as I'm watching it now, the impression it shows of us Canadians....  Holding hands out to catch a free pack of Preparation H or Nupercanal...  Are people that excited to get free stuff...  Even if it's hemorrhoid cream?  Crazy.  Things slowed down today...  Guess the Quizno's fad is over.  Maybe I'll have to start talking about the Mazda 3 possibilities.  Zoom Zoom ;)  Out!   The Good Old Hockey Game

      I'm getting into this Syndication shit...  However I really have no god damn clue about what is going on.  I've managed to register at  urlLink http://www.bloglines.com  which is a web-based aggregator to track RSS and ATOM feeds from the internet.  You can get programs that download RSS and ATOM feeds, like  urlLink THIS ONE  onto your PC, and it saves you from having to surf to the site every day, you can just read it from the program. [ wonder if that still makes the hit counter ding? ]  Next thing I'm trying to do is to publish "headlines" from some of these sites and display them somewhere on this cluttered mess.  For now, bloglines allows me to publish the RSS/ATOM feeds I'm subscribed to on the site, and thus allow everyone to see what I'm reading.  Why that would intrest anyone, I don't know... but hey, there's my list.  Check out these links for more information:  urlLink Bloglines - Web Based RSS program   urlLink Sharing Your Site using RSS   urlLink Amphetadesk - Program to download RSS feeds   Anyway, I'm out.

      I was playing Hunter The Reckoning 2 Redeemer last night with some buddies on the Xbox. We were addicted to the first release - Hunter The Reckoning - and are addicted to this one as well. 4 player action shoot 'em up games are always fun to play :) ... one of the memorable moments in part one of this series is the teddy bear that becomes possessed, grows to a monster-like size and spews barf all over you as his weapon... along with jumping in the air and stomping... In part 2, he makes his return as Santa Claus' helper...yup... Santa becomes possessed and becomes monster-like... and we were surprised when he sent Teddy after us.. haha fun fun .   I was wondering if anybody has played Hunter The Reckoning for the GCN. I've seen various screen shots online and it looks like they toned down the graphics... but I was wondering about the game play. Its going for like $20 new now since it was released in 2002 and I would like to pick it up, but I don't want to buy it and then be all disappointed when I find out by playing it that the graphics and game play got raped.   Aside from Hunter; Friday and Saturday were spent playing Super Monkey Ball 2... fun party game, but the only game we played was Monkey Target 2 (glide your Monkey Ball to a target and land) .... Party games are a blast... but only if you have 3 or more people to play.   There's a gaming trade-in, etc store like 2 mins from my house that we rented SMB2 from and I'm going to pick up a membership sometime this week 'cause it's only 2.99 to rent. They have a copy of Phantasy Star Online that I want to borrow so that I can configure my bba settings on the GCN and then test out the dev. tools people have created to hack the cube....   bah.

      I see no one accepted my challenge for CS.  Apparently, I AM that scary.  I must admit my skills aren't what they used to be but I guess winning by default is just as good.  If you'd like to shut me up... just bring it.  Look for Mupiel on  urlLink Steam ... you pansies.

      I got back into the swing of things with my GCN ... a little :)  Went for lunch with a buddy of mine and then trekked back to my house for a day of GCN.  On our way to my place, we decided to pick up another of our buddies....We played some PoP and Animal Crossing... but mostly we played MK:DD.  We were doing fine and they were getting used to the controls so we decided to unlock some things....  Another of my buddies came over which made a cool 4 players and we started to play....We took turns obviously 'cause you can't unlock shit with 3 or more players playing.  We beat star cup 150cc and unlocked the bullet train... then special cup 150cc which unlocked the All Cup Tour.... then Allcup tour at 50cc (so boring cause it was too easy)...and you get NOTHING from it...ughhhh... so after 16 tracks in a row... 16 first place finishes... I got tired of the game and we decided to rent one.  So another of our buddies came over to make an odd 5.... we rented Super Monkey Ball 2... fun game, but we spent most of the night playing only ONE of the minigames.... target practice or whatever its called... fun fun!... they are telling me to buy that game just for that mionigame.. ughhhh...  so thats my progress report for MK:DD!!... and my first rental for GCN.  Tomorrow is another day... and we decided to spend it playing video games again... Hunter is the game of choice ... and of course since we have Super Monkey Ball 2 until Sunday.. we will be playing that as well.... and not to forget MK:DD!! ... weeeee... GCN has taken over my weekend!  that's all.  March 1st Sw0rdfish?.. so far far away?.. :(  oh well.

Mr. Mupiel, I'd love to take time out of my dad to hand your ass to you in Counterstrike, but unfortunately it's only fun if there is some chance I may lose... ;)  In all honesty, it sounds like a good idea, I'll have to download Steam, and what not...  Ed...  I meant PC and GCN LAN party...  Time and date still to come. I need sleep...  March 1st cometh...  And she cometh soon.  Out   Hog? Founder! Money? QWAN! Briefs? Boxers!

      Bah! I've been pushed off the page!  It's all good. As long as it wasn't the spotlight hog fish that did it. Good to hear that the baby and family is doing well Mr. Mupiel.  I've had the Stem client installed on my machine for about a week and a bit now and it's pretty cool that you can add buddies to your list and find them in any game that they are in and join.  I personally suck at CS so I won't be chanllenging anybody, although I would like to join in on some games.... just don't expect much from me :P  My nickname is  urlLink eddiepacs  btw for anybody who would like to add me :)  When the fish was talking about a LAN party in his blog the other day, I thought to myself: "Alright! LAN party here we come!" but alas... it was for a PC LAN party. Not a GCN LAN party.  Oh well... the time will come EVENTUALLY i guess.  My dad and I re-arranged the living room last week and the TV isn't in an awkward place stuck in a corner anymore :)  It is now in the perfect place for anybody on any couch/chair to see... and for me to play my GCN comfortably :P  So on to my GCN life...there hasn't been much of a GCN life lately i'm sad to say.  I guess i've been busy with other things...like applying for jobs, helping friends move, etc, etc... but I do get the odd MK:DD!! game in whenever I have the time.  I still have yet to complete 150cc to get the All Cup Tour.  Star and Special are the cups I need to complete for that.. same as before.  As for Viewtiful Joe, I'm still stuck at the shark boss at the end of Act 3... and for Prince of Persia, I'm still not stuck, but havn't had a chance to play much.. so where ever I saved last is where I am.. I have no clue.. an hour and a bit into the game?  Animal Crossing hasn't been touched so i'm guessing I have weeds growing everywhere and my townsfolk are pissed.. but oh well...  I need new games damnit!... but in order for me to get new games, I need money and in order for me to get money, I need a job...hence the lack of gameplay and more concentration on the job hunt.  However... February 9th marks the release date of FF:CC....wonderful... shall I endulge in buying it, or wait.... hmmm... we'll see ;P  ... Rogers has increased their up and download bandwidth to keep up with DSL and cogeco....weeeeeeeeeeeeee ... no wonder I downloaded Naruto yesterday at an amazing speed :D... haha... the Fish isn't the only one :P  I guess that's it on my side for now.  Also.. welcome to Fish Inc. Yan.... where ever you are... lets get that LAN party going maaaaaaaan!... and also.. no.. that's it.  ciao.

      Talim Rei is now three weeks old.  She likes to stay up VERY late.  So, I have been getting no sleep since her birthday.  However, in better news, today is my last day of work at the big electronics retailer for a month.  I'm taking some parental leave to be home with my family and visit those who can't visit me.  I have not had this much time off in over 3 years.  It will be sweet.   Also planned for this month: Getting  urlLink Adaptive I.T.  up and ready to go.  I intend to keep very busy with the work that will get me out of my lousy job... In gaming, I finally installed the  urlLink Steam  client for my computer because I had some friends who wanted to play some CS.  It runs really nice so far but I haven't really put it to the test.  So, as an open challenge I'll leave my Steam client running starting tomorrow and if I'm online I'd love to have a game with any readers... I'll keep track of my wins/loss ratio with any players I face-off with and post it for you. ...and Fish, its time for us to finish our CS feud.  You're going down TechTV Fanboy!

      So I'm sitting at home last week, watching Tech TV and they're talking about this LAN party...  So I figure...  What the heck!  Lets sign up!  Welp, today in my email I find the invitation to join them on the LAN party during the show!  Long story short, I was killed by my team more than anything [ learn to play a game before you sign up for something this big!!! ] and I killed more enemies than they killed me.  We played the UT2K3 Mod Universal Troopers or something like that...  It was Star Wars based.  Being a Storm Trooper was kinda neat, but other than that, it's nothing special!  Sounds like the snow is coming again!  5-10CMs tonight, some rain and then another 5 or so tomorrow night!  Good thing I still don't have winter tires!!!  Yan!  Get an avatar and join the ranks!  Some people aren't pulling their weight around here!  Me included!  And it's time we get some more posts!  So in short!!!!  Welcome Yan to Fish, Inc.  Do I need a message board?  Fish!

       urlLink Bell Sympatico  is getting faster!!!  Here's an excerp;    We will be doubling the download speed of Sympatico High Speed service and improving upload performance by five times. Our customers will enjoy speeds up to 3 Mbps download and up to 800 Kbps upload.   This is pretty kickin' news if you ask me!  Basically, I'm calling it Lag-Be-Gone!  And all for 30 bucks a month thanks to my contract!  Yay Bell!  [ you're still a bunch of thieving bastards though ;0) ]  In other news, here's a site I've been working on...   urlLink http://www.extrememinichoppers.ca .  It's nothing spectacular, then again it's kinda neat...  The product is neat anyway.  Thanks to Ryan for letting my get my hands dirty in this one, little free advertisement for  Adaptive IT.  I'm mostly just posting this here to get the link in Google's webcrawlers.  I FINALLY got Mario Kart: Double Dash, and I finally played it three days later, and I'm finally posting about it 3 days after that [ can you tell I'm busy? ]  So basically what this means is that you can expect the first ever Fish, Inc PC/GCN LAN Party in the near future.  Of course you're all invited!  We currently have 3 GCNs w/ Broadband adapters...  So one more would be awesome... I'm hoping for this to go down next week [ 7th - 14th ] however with V-day on Saturday, it may need to be pushed to the following week, or even into March.  Yan is supposed to be joining the Fish, Inc. Team, but he hasn't accepted the invitation, so that leads me to believe he never got it.  Kawika is a slacker, and the rest of you are a close second...  I can do it, cuz it's my Inc!!!  Post or be replaced!  Wax on...  Wax off!  Fish Out~   Flight to Australia = 24Hours Coding Session

      I'm inspired, and when I do...  Sometimes something worth reading comes out.  So here I go.  I'll call it...  10 Things Sw0rdfish Hates About You .  Ok well not YOU, but You the Internet...  Call it an FAQ if you wish.   EDIT: I got interrupted 100 times writing this, who knows how good it turned out.  I never re-read my posts before submitting.  Sorry if you don't like it...  Blame FarCry and my MSN list     MSN etiquette    Call it  They MSN Myth  cause frankly there is none.  If I'm talking to you, and my doorbell rings, or my Toaster Stroodels start burning, and I'm suddenly gone...  That doesn't mean I hate you, it doesn't mean that you're not important...  It just means something came up, and I had to go...  You don't need a reason, just go!  So if I don't apologize for not responding, or if I never message you, don't be offended, I'm probably on my computer to do something else, and MSN is just there.  I rarely start a conversation unless I want to bug someone, and I'm sure many other's are like me.    TKers, Flamebait, and more    TKers are TeamKillers in multiplayer games...  They kill their own team.  Flamebait are people on message boards who are there to post something that pisses half the users off.  They're are the children of the net.  Fact is they are there for one reason...  To get a rise out of you, and spoil your fun.  While you might think this is a huge problem, if you ignore it...  It vanishes.  If they're killing you, and you say nothing and just keep playing...  Chances are they will leave and go find someone who does scream back.  Everyone knows this, but no one seems to use this method.  Instead we are often treated to an hour of whining for an admin, or moderator to ban the person, and usually you don't find one, and the culprit gets called to bed by his mommy laughing at you.    The Net Broke My computer...    The Interent did NOT break your computer.  Neither did Microsoft.  You just don't know what you agreed to when you clicked I agree, or clicked Yes 100 times to get through the install.  Visiting Porn sites is NOT healthy for your computer.  Neither is Kazaa.  If you answered yes to any of the above statements.  YOU broke the computer.  The internet just built the bulldozer, you're the one who put it in drive.    SPAM vs. Chain Letters    Arguably one in the same.  While that's not necessarily true, one often leads to the other.  There is always a monetary reason behind everything that is done in the world.   The " Chain Letter " is no different.  Every time someone forwards an email, there is one thing that is usually attached to it...  100 other emails.  To think each of those persons probably sent the email to on average 10 other people, so no we're at about 1,000.  Now some Joe blow gets a hold of this email, runs a script on it, and now has 1,000 email addresses that he can sell to the highest bidder.  Highest bidder now sends 1,000 emails explaining how you can get 3 inches in 3 weeks and stay hard for 2 straight nights.  This cost highest bidder practically nothing, and as long as he gets a .001% response rate, his costs are covered.  This leads me to the chain letter forwardee.  [ The person who forwards the email ].  Obviously their intention isn't to get you spammed, but they don't know... And that's the point.  So don't yell at them, just ask them to stop, and usually they will...  Plus not all emails get back to the jerk who's going to sell them.  The BCC, or Blind Carbon Copy, method is picking up, so eventually you wont have the slightest clue who else saw the email, and you can always remove all the other junk from an email before forwarding it on.  Hotmail accounts are the best option for these, since you can always stop checking the account when it gets full.  If you use the same account for personal and business use, than you're fucked, and it's your fault :D     Bill Gates Gave You Money???    No...  No he didn't.  Microsoft doesn't email you to tell you to delete files, and Walt Disney doesn't care how many times your forward an email...  You can't stay in Florida for free.  Unfortunately not everyone of these stories can easily be picked out.  Use  urlLink www.snopes.com  to check a story before you email it to 50 people who are going to read it and do the same.  Then you have to spend 4 hours resintalling Windows because you destroyed your registry...  What's a Registry?  Exactly my point.   If I called you and told you to cut off a lung because there is a virus going around that attacks lungs, would you do it?  Maybe if I was a Doctor... So why do it when your 13 year old nephew tells you to do it through an email to your computer????    USA America    News flash, Canada is it's own country.  I hate games, sites, and whatever else that wants my Country, or language of preference, or region...  And then only put U.S.A, or English [ USA ]  What the fuck is wrong with "North America" or adding another line of code that says "Canada".  Holy Lazy!  I'm not American!  No offense to our honoUred, favoUrite, multi-coloUred, neighboUrs to the south Eh?    The Internet Geek    They exists...  I may even be one of them.  Mind you I don't dress up to stand in line for a movie, but if I wanted to, who the fuck are you to make fun of me?  The world is getting so quick to judge people now a days it's kinda pissing me off.  Doesn't matter if someone wants to line up dressed as Yoda, or they want to marry your gay partner...  How does that affect you?  It doesn't.  Your wait is just as long, your wedding will be just as nice, and the movie is still going to be as good [ or shitty ] as it is, the only difference is Yoda and Elton just had that much of a better time, and it didn't hurt anyone.  Lay off the bashing, cause frankly it pisses me off.  Sites dedicated to the destruction of people who are only out to have a good time???  WTF?  Maybe I went off on a tangent on this one, but I'm sure you catch my drift.  You don't have to agree with any of that, but it's right...  I know...  'cause I wrote it ;)  There was more, but frankly I have better things to do then educate the internet on how to act like a human being.  Of course the ones reading this probably don't need this stuff to apply to them, cause I know you're all good people, but what the hell...  Maybe you'll leave it open at an internet cafe, and the next person who sits down will start reading it.  Maybe Google will help me out by throwing a few hits my way.  I wrote this without anyone in mind, I don't think I really know anyone who does any of this stuff personally, so don't take offence, I was really just trying to be funny, but make some sort of point.  Before I go, I'd like to pass on my sympathies to the world at the loss of a great talented young girl Cecilia Zhang who's body was found today.  The world is a worse place to live because of it.  You're where no one can hurt you now.  Whether you put a C or X in your MSN name, or signed  urlLink this , or in your own way showed your feelings of this barbaric, and in-human act.  I'm sure you share my feelings.  We'll miss you and all who are taken from us way too young.  Rest in Peace    only the good die young

      I don't have too much time right now, so let me jott out a quick couple of things...  Battlefield 1942, and Vietnam are must haves...  But 1942 for sure!  Get the Expansions too!  I'm almost positive that you can burn this game, but I don't have the time to try it.  Just go buy the damn thing, but since it's on a LAN, it shouldn't matter if it's not a unique CD Key...  Whatever you do... GET IT!  Make sure you Download and install Desert Combat also...  It's the BF1942 Mod  I've got a Win 2003 Server box that I'll host the games off of, but my CPU is faster, so that may make more sense.  Add to the list  UT2K3 - it's cheap now... go buy it  Medal of Honor - The Battleset is like next to nothing  Some form of Neverwinter  Talk about it on the Tag Board, if we're all missing some of these, lets decide on at least one to get.  I personally think BF Vietnam or 1942 is a must, but Medal of Honor is pretty cheap, and would be fun.  Lets not forget Mario Kart will take up a huge chunk of time.  I'll have some chips and pop, but if you're going to want a lot of shit, bring it with you, I'm a poor...  poor guy.  Lundie...  we need to get him a nick name...  should be making an appearnce as well.  If he doesn't we'll all go to his house and drag him here.  Please invite anyone you want, feel free, 16 spots available MAX.  Peace out!   TankFest approaches...  why the name?  Can you think of a better one?

      I think we need to finalize the list of PC games that we're going to play.  I want to make sure I have everything registered and updated that I need.  So for TankFest (why the name fish?) I'm thinking of a few titles already, some of which I still need to get.  Battlefield 1942 (Expansions?) CounterStike/TeamFortress/Day of Defeat Call Of Duty UT2K4 (don't have) Battlefield Vietnam (don't have)  Others?  And Fish, obviously add me to the list.  And add  dandelion junk .  She's ready to kick some Cube Ass.

       April 10th 7:00PM - Whenever My Place   There it is, it's official, and it's in pen! [ sorta ].  Clear your schedules, and head on over...  Mario Kart, Battlefield, UT2K4, Counter-Strike, and TONS more...  While I don't really care who comes, I don't want too many people I don't know there, so you're all welcome to come, just get in touch with me if you plan on brining a friend or cousin or something.  My switch has room for 16, so let's start adding!  I know it's Easter weekend, but you'll be home in time for any dinners or stuff you need to make it to.  Unfortunatley, that was the only weekend I can get my parents out of the house.  We need people to bring GameCubes w/ Broadband adapters, and PowerBars... Lots of them!  Oh yeah.  LAN cables too :)  Under the comics will be "The List" email me to confirm, or post on the TagBoard.  Fish Out   Movies, Pixar, Jobs, Steve, Apple, Orange, Fruit, Of a Loom

      Word!  Well I must apologize once again for a lack of posting activity, but the fact is that nothing too exciting is going on...  I do however have to make some comments on the " Bertuzzi Fallout " as  urlLink TSN  has decided to nickname the incident.  Let me give the readers digest version as I see it.  Did Bertuzzi intend to hit Moore - Yes  Did Bertuzzi intend to hurt Moore - Maybe  Did Bertuzzi intend to fracture Moore's Neck, and nearly end his career - Absolutley Not  Was Bertuzzi in the right frame of mind when he took the swing - No.  9 - 2 = Frustration, and not being able to defend your captain = more frustration.  Did he intend to drive Moore head first into the Ice - Doubtful  Does he deserve the suspension for the rest of the season - Yes  Does he deserve to play hockey again next year - Yes  Basically, I'm getting at the fact that the  urlLink NHL  can't get carried away and try to "set an example" because when you're frustrated and angry, you don't think about the consequences... You just start swinging.  Personally I feel Bertuzzi shouldn't play again until Moore does, so if Moore is out longer than the season, then Bertuzzi should wait as well, but we definitely shouldn't ban him from the game.  Let me tell you...  The world of  urlLink NET  and ASP in particular is rather exciting.  I know I just make myself sound like the biggest geek in the world, but shit!!!  You can do some pretty cool stuff with ASP.NET and C# and I'm having a blast being paid to do it.  When I get some time, I'll share my findings.   urlLink Microsoft  isn't all evil though... Are they? ;o)  And Finally...  I started editing the Heritage Classic from November of this year...  Need to get the sucker down to 4.7GB so I can burn it on to a DVD...  Wonder how much time that is??   Peace out!

      You like my copying styles don't you Fish!  First I copy your MSN nick, and now the format of your blogger subject titles. weeeee! fun.  Anyway, like I stated in  urlLink my blog , I went around with my buddies in search of the best deal for  urlLink Unreal Tournament 2004 ..  urlLink EB  apparantly has this deal where if you pre-order the game, you get the special edition game (DVD format), a $20 voucher for use with EB and a logitech headset.  We went to the 2 EB stores (heartland and sq1) and both told us that they've heard a lot of variations on that deal, like it was only for the online pre-orders, or, it was only available in the states, or the voucher is only for online credit or vice versa, etc... but we pre-ordered it none the less 'cause we can always cancel it and get out $5 back if the deal doesnt come through.  The EB guys said that they probably wont know until they get their shippment what the deal is here in Canada.  They also said to phone in and check once in a while as they may find out at any time... blah blah.  Ya, I know about the Wifi access in select McDonalds Fish.  The company I was interviewing for (3 interviews, 3 drives to Aurora, only to get rejected over some guy with more work experience than me...ughgh.. so pissed at that, but ya, thats another story :P) so ya,  If I were to get that job, I would have been the one that sets up and troubleshoots the various networks.  McDonalds is one of their biggest clients. They were explaining that they hope to have all the major McDonalds locations wired (or not wired - wireless joke :P) with their system by the end of 2005.. fun stuff.. too bad they didn't hire me.  Also, why are there only 3 posts shown on the page now as opposed to the 5 or 6 you had before?  I don't care really, just wondering.  pacs

      Wup-a-do-pa-do! [  urlLink Icy Tower  Anyone? ]  I've been neglecting my desktop lately, and sure enough I finally sit down to use it, and I've been  urlLink Gaobotted .  Now worries though, I know how to kill em.  I'm getting pretty damn good at this virus removal crap.  Missed out on an opportunity to get Adaptive some work last week because we haven't handed out or created our "leave behind" brochure.  That's the plan for this afternoon.  Before that though, I'm messing around with my new LG 8X Triple-Format DVD burner.  147$ at  urlLink Logic Computer House .  While you're there, maybe you can tell me why computer stores, usually run by nerds, can't maintain a better looking website, and get their images working...  Anyway, being one of the biggest DVD collectors out of anyone I know, I waited a while to get a DVD burner.  To me, the movie isn't the same without the box, and all that cool shit.  I don't intend to let this purchase slow down my DVD purchases, but some movies are just utter crap!  Also, I'd rather burn a copy of a movie for someone, then lend them my DVD... [ Read: I'm an anal bastard and like everything in great shape ]  One last thing...  On my way home from Brampton the other night, I decided to stop in for a BigMac, Large fries, and a Diet Pepsi [ that's a joke for those who don't know me ] and on the door, was a notice saying that "This McDonalds is now equipped with Wireless Broadband Access"...  a Geek's dream!  Holy shit!  Unlimited Access to Fastfood, high speed internet, and a washroom...  All 15 feet away!  I wonder if I can make a booth into an office  Out!

      Its been a little while since I was here but I've got a cool update to make up for it. I traded in a bunch of my old video game stuff to make more room in my apartment and I got some awesome credit at EB for them.  Here's the list:  N64 + 4 Controllers Playstation + 1 Controller 2 Game Boy Colours Pokemon Saphirre & Ruby (GBA) Twisted Metal Black Online (PS2) Harry Potter (PS) Myst 3 Exile (PC) Pokemon Stadium (N64) Dance Dance Revolution Konamix (PS) Mario Kart (N64) Final Fantasy X (PS2) Animal Crossing (NGC) WWF No Mercy (N64) Super Mario 64 (N64) Conker's Bad Fur Day (N64) 2 N64 GB Cartridge Adapters Fire Pro Wrestling (GBA) Pokemon Silver & Gold (GBC) Pokemon Yellow (GB) Mario Tennis (GBC) GB Link Cable  I got enough money to buy Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, a GBA Link Cable, Mario Adavnce 4 and still have a big credit left over.  I think I'm saving for Harvest Moon for the NGC (like Animal Crossing) or maybe Resident Evil: OutBreak for the Playstation 2. Whoever can guess which thing on that list got me the most credit I'll give my GameBoy Colour light (which EB wouldn't buy). FF:CC is really awesome by the way.

      I got a flat tire on the QEW.  Not a really relaxing experience.  I was on the outside lane and to make matters worse I had both my wife and my  urlLink daughter  in the car.  Luckily it was a rear tire and I still had decent control of the car afterwards. Special thanks to  urlLink CAA  for a job well done.  And special FUCK YOUs to  urlLink Autopark Mitsubishi  for doing absolutely nothing despite the fact that I bought the car there two weeks ago and trying to charge me $162.70 to put on a new tire ( the tire wasn't punctured when I brought it to you, it somehow magically got a hole in it after you had it ).   Fuck you, fuck you very much.   Please don't ever buy a car from these people.  Thankfully there is only 3 more days of work until I leave for Myrtle Beach....  ahhh... vacation.... sweet sweet vacation.

      For starters, Happy Birthday to the Fish!  I'll give you a call an dole out congratulations verbally later. In the ongoing saga which is my horrendous job, I actually decided to start trying at work.  As it turns out, apparently hard work DOES pay off and I was making some decent (albeit not great) coin last week.  I figured I needed some good money to take away on vacation and I got some. I also played Resident Evil: Outbreak this weekend and since I only had time to play for an hour I'll give you a review worthy of one hour of play.  Holy crap there is a lot of zombies.  I can't believe they get to walk between rooms now.  When do I get to stop running?  Oh I see, I get a break during the load times.  - 4 out of 5 really small stars   I did enjoy it and I am looking forward to playing longer and not dying. For now, I'm out.  I'll be back later with more.  I gotta keep this blog alive and interesting.   ...plus I have nothing better to do before the store opens....

      Well...  Actually me :D  Yesterday was my 24th, and it was an all round great birthday.  Boston Pizza, a Habs win, and great friends!  Normally I watch Habs games from my basement...  But they surprised me by all getting together, so we watched from Boston Pizza...  Which was pretty fun!  Thanks guys!  Now where have all the posts gone?   Well that's primarily my fault.  Been pretty busy doing work for my dad, buying a new car [ which I still haven't talked about ] and most importantly, playoff hockey.  I'm going to try to post more often, seeing as it's hard to build a following when you post every 3 weeks.  So if anyone is still reading...  Enjoy :D

       I am so fucking tired today.   I know.  I haven't posted in ages.  I don't really have anything of value to say usually.  Today is no different.  The LAN Party was enjoyable, if not a little small.  All seemed to be a little sick from the blipping screens and the influx of junk food, pop and pizza.  However, I feel I emerged victorious as I was able to drive home and not actually crash into anything despite the above noted sickness combined with a tiredness that had to be seen to be believed (I didn't fall asleep when I got home, I passed out, even though I wasn't drinking).  Now I'm at work, too early, but am fortunate that the morning manager is just as tired as me and is willing to schedule nap time prior to the store opening.  Time to catch up on some missed sleep.  Ta ta for.... zzzzzzzzz......

      For those of you who have never seen it, and I doubt there is many who read this site, there used to be a crappy video game show on called Video & Arcade Top 10.  On this show kids would face off against each other to win a copy of the game they were playing.  Horrible production values and hosts who looked like they were just reading cue-cards made the show a waste of television time.  However, the host of this show/radio DJ purchased a digital cam from me earlier this week.  Only two people in the store recognized him, myself and our software associate (equal in his geek-ness). AS for which one he bought, let me just say its amazing how much "famous" people still want to buy the cheapest product they can get.

      Shit!  Sorry again for not posting regularly...  I think my readership has gone down to only me.  I do intend to pick things back up, so if you're stopping by...  Continue to do so.  Maybe we'll get some more bloggers.  I've got some more photo's of the car, have a look;     Freshly Cleaned...  My new addiction...  Cleaning cars.    Her good side...    Nice Ass Eh?  I see you baby... Shaking that ass!   Next up for her is a little tinting...  Tint King seems to be the front runner right now, only 150.00$ but I need to check on the details.  I'm a little worried about where I go, I'll die if it turns purple or bubbles...  Need reputable places with life time warranties.  Other than that, I'm still watching TONS of hockey, and working a lot.  Need to put some work into new clients, I just don't' have the time to find them.  I've been putting a brochure together to pass out around the office, but everything else seems to take precedence.    Ball hockey is definitely not going well...  We're 0 - 4, and show very little signs of life.  We;ve got a hard working bunch, and we're missing some key players so who knows.  I'm still getting used to this defense shit, I'm used to scoring [ trying to at least ] doing the opposite is a little confusing.  Having the name "The Decepticons" has peaked my interest in transformers again, although 90$ for a season of an 80's cartoon is a little stupid if you ask me.  I'm off camping for the long weekend, expect feedback on Monday!

      Yeah, so seeing randy updated this bitch, i figured i'd write up a blog for ya.  Man i haven't blogged in so long, i think the last one on my page is like march 8th or something.  It's not even like i'm busy or anything, i come home and sit on my computer doing nothing other than looking at pr0n or watch tv.  Hell of a life i lead.  So anyway, have you guys been following E3 this year?  Well if you haven't all i can say is OH SHIT SON!  Nintendo and Sony are pulling out all stops and microsoft is left looking like a bunch of chumps.  Sony tried to come in and bite on mintendos handheld market with the PSP.  But nintendo came right back and spanked those bastards with the DS.  Have you seen this thing...jesus, i don't know what the video game world is going to do when Miyamoto dies.  Zelda just looks sick, link is a teenager now so they strayed away from the cel shading and matured it up abit for all you whiners.  And if you watched that trailer.....yeah that's real time bitches.  Mario tennis looks like it is going to be super fun, they have special attacks now, which look like it will add alot of fun to the game play.  Pikmin 2 i only saw a short clip, but it looks like it's based in our world, since they were carrying around bottle caps and oranges.  Also looks like you can pla two player and there are new pikmin.  And one game that really suprised me and again shows nintendo is the only people thinking up anything new.  DK jungle beats! A side scroller where you control your guy with bongo drums!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  I'm going to shit my pants.  On the other fronts, halo 2 looks sick.  Bungie is one of the best developers of all time and it looks like they came through again with this game.  Not sure if it's on xbox live or not though...but i will buy an x-box for this game.  EA announced they are going xbox live, which will be kinda cool. Even though i don't play sports games that much.  PS2 has some alright stuff coming out, i liked the look of Fable although the graphics looked pretty lousy...but whatever they got alot of time to fix that.  Damn it i wish i went again this year...stupid job.  Anyway, i'll probably blog on my site sometime soon so check it out.  Other than that...get ready for halo 2 cause i'm going to rape you all when it comes out.

      Did you ever want to take a dump while still being able to enjoy the hockey game?  Do you ever need to go but don't want to break up a conversation?  Well we have the solution.  Open concept bathrooms.  Take a look at this one from the home of Jason Warren:   Or this gorgeous view from the living room:   Guess you'll all want to come over and experience it now eh?  By the way, I just took these images 5 minutes ago.

      I am started to get really impressed with the new G4 tackover of techTV.  I was up late cleaning baby bottles and I decided to tune in to see if they have any new content... and to my astonishment they have G4 Live @ E3.  Its a  DAILY  update from the floor of E3 and all the individual company presentations.  They demonstrated the Nintendo DS, the PSP and showed a bunch of the new games from Square/Enix, EA and others. Its like a membership to a game website without paying for it.  Watch for it at 10 again tonight and tomorrow.

      The sport of choice this summer is ball hockey...  And the season kicks off tonight!  More on that later tonight...  It's been a really long time since I've sat down and hammered out a blog, so the reader following we built up, probably needs to be started over again...  Most of the reason for my abscence was just that I've been so damn busy.  The big project,  urlLink B2B Credit Chex  is going great, and I'm learning more and more about  urlLink ASP.NET  daily, and trying to pick up some of the c# Windows application programming a long the way...  most of it is the same anyway.  Aside from programming my head off, I'm trying to get things going on the small business side of things, but between work, and everyone else's schedule...  that is also at a standstill.  Biggest event in the past few months has been the subtraction of Jetta and the addition of z00m z00m!  I picked myself up a brand new Mazda 3 GT w/ GFX and I've loved every KM I've put on it...  stay away from Erin Mills Mazda though... Customer service is just shit!     I'll get better pictures soon    Other than that...  I've just been trying to get organized.  Life is a little messy and out of whack at the moment, but nothing serious...  just need to observe, plan and then attack it...  I'll be ok.  Check this out...   urlLink Best Linux Distro...  EVER!  .  Very easy to install, and easy to use.  Wireless internet is a bitch with the Penguin though...  use caution.  Fish Out!

      I can not understand how humans can perpetrate such evil.  I agree the Americans were not right in making a one-sided decision to invade Iraq and I understand that many of their tactics are digusting and unethical.  I can not however understand how one man can, on live video, in front of many others coldly take the life of an innocent (ie. not promotiong or involved in confilct) man.  Having read the article on CNN.com of  urlLink Nicholas Berg  being beheaded I was about ready to vomit.  It is a cowardly act to take an unarmed man's life espescially when he is being held prisoner. It shows no regard for human life and does nothing to eschew the religious views of these groups.  It only makes it obvious that they have no faith, believing that any all-mighty power would grant you access to an afterlife after perpetrating such a malicious and destructive act with no concious.  If anything, this event only demonstrates their desire for death, destruction and chaos. If this is what humanity is capable of I am disgusted to be a part of it.

      I am really impressed with the new look.  Its pretty spiff.  I would like to see the counter and the postboard, or some kind of comment system return.  Though access to eaerlier articles and the profile thing is kinda cool.  I'm just going to assume that you'll make some changes to personalize it Fish. In other news, in an attempt to stave off heart disease it has been recommended by my doctor/heart specialist that I lose weight to lower my cholesterol.  So I have taken it into my own hands to do so.  Starting today I am on a "diet".   Jason's Weight Loss Goals -------------------------  Current Weight: 235 lbs Target Weight: 175 lbs ------------------- Total Loss: 60 lbs I expect that everyone here will help me stick to it and in return I promise to let you know where I'm at. Good luck to me.

      Yeah that's what I said.  This shit was way too fancy to pass up.  I'll be fiddling with the new layout over the next couple of days, as well as trying to catch you all up on where the hell I've been.  Welcome back Mupiel!!!  Peace! Fish~

      As has probobly been blogged about a million times already it seems like its  urlLink curtains for techTV .  I guess it remains to be seen how this will effect Canada's version of the network.  However, I wish I could recieve the  urlLink G4 network  it is being merged with.  Sounds like the station for me.  I think thats why I already saw one of their shows:  urlLink Filter .  New content is always good (especially game content). In other news, it seems blogger has updated their layout as well.  Slick new design to the interfaces and overall look.  Though the actual content seems exactly the same.  Good for  urlLink Blogger , cosmetic changes are always the only real changes needed.

      I found this on a health message board... and yes I do have problem with drooling in my sleep.  The  urlLink first post  was the question seeking help: ----------------------------------   Posted by Alexa on November 17, 2000 at 00:06:04:    My boyfriend has been drooling for a while know, while he sleeps this is getting to be annoying because this is messing up my sheets. It is also annoying to him. Is there anything out there to stop this? What is causing this to happen to him?  ----------------------------------  And  urlLink here  was the useless, yet sadly funny response: ----------------------------------   Posted by chuck on December 15, 2000 at 13:14:36:  In Reply to: Drooling while sleeping posted by Alexa on November 17, 2000 at 00:06:04:     Get married if you're going to sleep together. Ask any married guy, he'll tell you that marriage solves a lot of fluid loss problems. Here's a clue sweetie: Most men drool, belch, fart, smell bad, whiz on the floor next to the commode, whiz outside anywhere they want, don't wipe as well as women so always have "skid marks" in their briefs/boxers, hog the remote, and will never marry you if they can sleep w/ you w/out any responsibility for the consequences, especially since when you get pregnant he's gone. Note that I said when, not if. ( 99% effective birth control (the pill) means everybody gets pregnant after 100 times; 50% effective birth control (condoms) means there's a 50/50 chance you'll get pregnant every single time you do it and a guaranteed pregnancy on the 51st time). And you're worried about drool? Grow up. By the way, if you find a potential boyfriend who doesn't have most of the bad habits listed above, he probably already has a boyfriend.  -------------------------------- I pretty much pissed myself laughing (condoms 50% effective???  99% means your guaranteed to get pregnant on the hundredth time????)   Is the general population getting stupider or do they just want me to think that?

      I thought I might blog since  Fishinc  has been slowing down as of late.  I may have some comments later this week politcally motivated and full of angst.  Should be fun. The new  urlLink Van Helsing  movie comes out this week and while the  urlLink reviews  seem spotty at best there is a good thing to come out of this movie's release.  The classic  urlLink Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman  movies are available on DVD (more than one on each disc too).  Of particular note in the set is the best actor to ever play Dracula,  urlLink Bela Lugosi .  This collection seems like a must have to me. I have also become addicted to  urlLink Party Poker.com  but I am luckily staying away from the real money games.  I almost always manage to finish out a single table tournament of 10 people in first or second and I would love to find out how a real game would feel since I've never played for cash before.  I get the feeling I would be bled dry (and then some). I've also noticed that this site began with a  video game/sports  slant but has sinced moved away from any cohesion.  I was wondering what people actual would come here to read.  Post what you think would be worthwhile to blog. In any case, since I'm at work I should probobly get back to it.

      Needless to say, no one is going to read this.  I blame myself, it was foolish to think the addition of others would keep the blog going while I'm off busy.  I've decided to bring it back to just myself, if others are interested in a blog-orgy, then let me know...  We can start another blog.  Happenings all over as far as The Fish goes.   urlLink zip  has a new member...  Two if you count the  Lundie/Shabits team!  Frankly I'm impressed, we'll see how many DVDs I can get in a month, to see if it's worth the $30 a month.  I'm now gmail-ified!  Seems to be the new "Uber Class" on the cyber-social scale!  Unfortunately someone else grabbed sw0rdfish, so I ended up just taking something else, but shortly I'll have a better solution for FishMail...  You'll just have to wait and see [ if I continue to blog that long, which once again, I intend to ].   urlLink GMail  is pretty damn cool.  It blows the doors off Hotmail...  I wonder what Bill's response will be to the 1GB of space, and the kick ass label/search/storage options that GMail offers.  Anyway, hopefully they'll be open for everyone soon so you can all enjoy the bonuses.  Anyway, I'm at work, so I should get back to it.  Stay tuned...  I'll blog tonight and explain what the hell I've been up to lately!  Peace!

      On a day that started out with the promise of greatness, we sure ended up with a regular day of nothing!  The Calgary Flames  urlLink couldn't put away Tampa Bay  and Smarty Jones blew a 4 lengths lead with one furlong to go, and  urlLink lost the triple crown .  Now I really don't know how long a length, or a furlong is...  But judging from  urlLink the video  it's not much.  At least De La Hoya  urlLink did his part...    But barley!  I wonder if the Flames remembered to put a Looney on the ice somewhere?  So this is attempt number 54 to get this blog back to what it once was...  Or at least what I thought it was.  Major problem keeping me from posting, is that I'm not even sure if anyone is reading.  I'll have to start talking about it again, maybe try something to rival the 2.0 publicity stunt I pulled way back when.  Oddly enough, adding more bloggers hasn't seemed to help.  Not much else in the world of the fish.  UPS tried to charge me 40 dollars brokerage and tax...  On an item that only cost $40.00.  I've said it once, I've said it 100 times!  DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS!!!!!!  They're crooks!   urlLink City of Heroes  was fun, I just don't have the time for MMOGs anymore...  Heck I don't have time for gaming anymore!  However I have already said I'd play World of Warcraft and Everquest 2 when they come out...  So we'll have to make time damn it!  Decepticons [ my ball hockey team ] finally came up with a win!  5 - 2!  If only we can play like that more often, we'll have nothing to worry about.  Thanks for reading! ~Fish Out!~   That John Denver is Full of Shit Man!

      I swear, if I ever lose my job (which I expect I will) I will have so many stories to tell.  Trust me, working here has its stresses.   Of course it does offer me time to blog in the morning... :P

       urlLink Creativity is Born!!! ... Not bloody likely! I'm still confused as to how people still pay real money to see these movies... And then I'm even more amazed how after they sit through the 2+ hours of crap, they continue to worship Star Wars as the best thing since porn and strip clubs. Lets face it, episode I was the worst thing they could have done to the Star Wars franchise... I loved the series, until that crap! I haven't even seen the entire second movie because frankly... Why bother? It's a little better than the first, and nowhere close to the 4th,5th, and 6th... But who cares about Star Wars right?   Camping kicked ass!! Not including the major burn on my fingers... ( Don't grab hot pot handles with bare hands! Oven mitts are your friend! ). I was equally pleased with the drive home! 2.5 Hours from Orillia on a Sunday afternoon is a blessing!   I wish I had more interesting things to talk about, but frankly like is pretty much centered around work lately... So when I can get away, I try to keep my PC more than 50 yards away! I did however manage to compile a list of MOST of my DVDs... I still need to polish it up, but here is the beta release!    urlLink sw0rdfish's DVD Collection List. Beta 1.1.0007 Build 1265     urlLink Pretty cool stuff from Google ... I'm back into the Folding @ Home thing again with the Google Toolbar!   While I'm talking about Google, check this out!  urlLink interesting Stuff if you ask me!  Shares of Google... Hmmm... I may have to scrounge some money up... This could be big!! Or probably just plateau for 3 years then crash!

      Out for the weekend, work still eating up all my time...  guess I shouldn't complain too much.  At least I can put some money in the bank.  Bell Mobility can officially lick my left testical!  After arguing with them for over 3 weeks that a 4 month old shouldn't break, and that regardless of the manufacture, they're responsible...  I managed to sucked $150 credit out of them ( that they technically already owed me for a rebate on the previous mentioned phone ) as well as a $70 dollar credit to cover hardware upgrade costs...  I'm gonna turn around and give it all back and get out of my contract.  I bought a Mike( Telus ) phone on Wednesday, and I'm more than satisfied...  call my old number if you want my new number, I'll have it forwarded for a month or so.  Jokes on them in the end, becuase our plan and my dad's phone gives them a combined $500 a month, and they've pretty much thrown that away ( or given it to Telus )...    I'm out!  Packing needs to be finished!
