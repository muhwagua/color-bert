      "I love her," I told God in confidence, not sure whether it was the love of Peter or the love of Christ. Both being unwavering but only one unconditional, "and I need your help now more than ever before..." I was to be found in a room of silent mourning, full of questions, devoid of answers. The focus shifted and the scene changed.  "What makes you so certain?" He replied. After hours of staring at the computer screen, wallowing in self pity, I considered all she means to me.  "Because when I think of her, noone else matters." I replied. "Is that your only reason?" The Lord gested. After that, I began to think hard and long.  "Because, when the sun rises on the horizon, and we're still talking on the phone, I can see her smile reflecting back at me." The Lord was silent for a while, possibly waiting for me to finish expressing myself. "Because...even though i've never met her, I would give my life so that she might live. I love her because she is everything a man of good virtue and integrity could ever dream of. But most importantly Lord, I love her because I know you sent her to me. She is my equal, she is my friend, she is my inspiration..."  I soon after turned the computer off and made my way to the bed, feeling worse & worse. Heart drowning in a sea of sorrow and remorse. I said my prayers to the Lord then lay my head down to sleep. The Lord had yet to respond to any of my earlier expressions, it made me wonder what He knew that I did not.  "My son, did you  prove  your affections by your actions? Spoke the voice of the Lord.  "I did not sir," I replied as a tear began to fall from my eye. I had yet to unconditionally prove that she means more to me than any female in the existence of humanity. I would sometimes play games, change clothes, go watch tv, get something to eat...and wouldn't say a word about leaving momentarily. That's not how you prove that you care about someones' feelings. Its rude and irresponsible. I had been having strange dreams lately...not exactly nightmares, but strange. I often experience precursors to a pending situation in my dreams, a la Ebenezer Scrooge. So when I awoke the next morning, I thought, maybe it was all a dream! Perhaps my unharmonic dissonance was nothing more than an unspoken spirit of dissent that had the potential to rear its head if I was not careful...  "I would like to tell you that this is all a dream," said the Lord early in the morning, "but it is the minds reality also known as mankind, and you will have to deal with your past if there is to be any likeness of a future."  I stayed in the bed a little longer than usual. Get up? Why get up? Why... "If she is my friend, why do I keep hurting her..." "The man worth a womans' tears would never make her cry...save tears of joy..."  The Lord said in His word, Lo I am with you always, even to the ends of the earth. Well Lord God, i'm putting this broken vessel in your hands because you are the only one capable of keeping me from falling. The only wise God, true & living God. So before it is too late, I surrender all....

      Well, today is Christmas Eve night...really Christmas morning now....  Its been a long...long...long..........LONG past three weeks. I know this is a blog, and the details r supposed to be posted liberally, but got darnit!! i'd be here thru next Christmas. One of the only true bright spots is my newly acquired friendship with Mellanie. She's my equal in every social aspect, well...no, she's way sharper than I am. If I didn't know any better, I would think her to be a fellow Scorpio. Real peoples know, a Scorpio is not to be messed with. We run the game & expect nothing less than perfection. She would be perfect if she were closer to SC, and I wasn't about to train for overseas duty, and if we didn't clash so much.   Last nite was also the big Christmas program at my church...the annual star-studded gala where friends both young & old gather on one special night to join in harmonius celebration of the birth of our Lord & savior Jesus Christ. *sigh* What fun...colors r still the same, message is still clear, but its just nto as good as it used to be. I don't feel the true nostalgia anymore when I walk through the doors...I don't feel compelled to generate tears as I remember the days of old, when i was a young 4 year old torn untimely from his native land of Norfolk, VA to a lil country town in the middle of nowhere...I don't feel the rush of excitement & anticipation as i remember my friends & classmates as we dreamed of becoming positive influences in the community & the world. These were dreams I hoped to pass down to the next generation, but their ears as closed to much reason. Minds fixated on pipe dreams, many of them. But one thing about kids...no matter how bad most of them turn up, there is always one. In my generation, there are two...me & my recently wed boy J.R. I look at the new faces of the Sunshine band, and of the current condition of the administration of Churches of God Holiness...and I see a people that are gonna have to fight with everything they are and have in order to be truly productive Christians. They will perhaps not find it here, lest there is one to resurrect the praise. Save a soul that is more than willing to pull some MLK Jr./ Malcom X type social uprising...because to black people, sometiems thats all we listen to. One great mind, surrounded by a bunch of Jesse Jacksons...   Well, time to play war games. By the way, Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising on the Gameboy Advance is a fantastic game of strategy that I recommend for kids of all ages :-) Its even better when you have an emulator on your PC that lets you play any rom u can find on the net or wherever! hehehehehehe...*ahem* That's the end of my creative rope for tonite...

      "Just try that man...where is your faith?"  I was born the son of a reluctant king, whose bravado often outshined his ability. Birthed to a mother who had never known a man before Ronald senior. First born son to a couple that got engaged to each other six weeks into their courtship...a seamstress and a cab driver. Two devoted Christians serving one god. Three years into their marriage, the gifted prince of the tidewater was born. A son encouraged to throw caution to circumstance, yet grown to tell the world about vigilance & trust  My brother, sister & I were all born a year & three months apart from each other...penal twist of irony, if you ask me. The mindset of a typical Stevenson child...if you're not the oldest, you're just alive. The eldest in age...it is my burden...it is my curse.  "Sometimes I wish the ring had never come to me..."  Four years in the valley, my father passed due to heart failure. As my mother was more comfortable around her own sisters & brothers, she took the big leap & moved from VA to SC, relocating to a town names Calhoun Falls. A land forgotten by time, secluded in a lakeland wilderness, disguising the scars of time past....arriving to a new age where new scars had yet to be revealed. A noble prince, from his native reality once removed, now sought only one goal: To return to the land that his father governed, erase the shortcomings, instill hope, renew the creativity & restore peace to the land of lovers. Unfortunately, the kingdom was soon toppled by the imperfect ventures of time...the suttle thief of youth. Gone, gone from the land of men was the noble dilligence of a trying few. Now a far more luminous & ardent task looms on the horizon. The heir of a forgotten kingdom, this  vagrant prince , must  rebuild the kingdom of hope..from once a mighty reign, so must it be born again.  The days of adversity strike me deeply. Multiple family disorders, a call of duty in a land of ancient mystery and a faith desperately searching & waiting on God now befall me. I can see the healing process beginning to take shape, however. God has given me a special friend that is more than willing to help me regain my fallen homeland. Included with a close friend from the proving grounds, I believe that the time has come for the fulfillment of my destiny.  But first I must cross this desert...

       *yawn* Day 4   Uummm...what happened on day 4? Let's see...Tuesday. Wednesday, Thursday...I guess that was that Friday. Okay, well what happened Friday? Hmmm...oh yea...that was the day of the big SRP thingy. That's where we did the gist of our administrative paperwork & such.  That's where pieces of D-company had us held up because the computers went down & they weren't able to finish processing all their people. That's where I was the absolute last guy from HHC in line to obtain the new ID card. Oh I loved Friday...  I was too exahusted to even consider going back out like the night b4. I wish so bad that lil mama could have been there. A number of us went out to the bowling alley to chill out...the big PX was conveniently located right next door, conveniently equipped with outrageous prices. Only thing was, she would have driven two hrs just to see me for 1. Not to mention she had to work so it was just a blown opportunity that neither of us could have controlled :-(  Yep, so that was Friday in a nutshell...not much else to report of note. In unrelated news, I just finished creating two love song compilations for my baby...every track special to our relationship in some way. I think of it as the soundtrack of our affections :-) Arite, i'm tired of typing...

       VERITAS ET VIRTUE   Day 2 1/2 - 3: I began to remember what we did after lunch on the 2nd day...many of us got together to go to the gym & shoot some ball, but not before checking out the regional px/ shoppette to see what they had going on. Seems like a pretty descent chill site...game room...standard military storefront type outlets...the lil internet machine (that uses dialup) so best you can/ should do is check your email cause for a dollar for 5 mins, you don't have much time to lolligag. I didn't really get anything that day. Thought about getting a haircut but one of my homeboys cut it the next day as part of a favor for me fixing up his computer. I ended up giving him my last 64 meg stick to speed his joint up....only ended up charging him 20 bones. Normally I charge more for my services, especially for a reformat/ clean install but my man is essentially broke so I tried to work with him. Plus he cool anyway...when he wants to be. After all that, changed clothes & went to the gym to get right on some boys. I was running pretty descently the first two games, rebounding, shooting arite, playing solid defense...but not having played since middle of last began to show the 3rd game. Brother was stuggling to make plays lol. I think I played in 4 or 5 games overall. I know the last two games combined, I only had 1 basket  (elected to play defense & rebound...let somebody else run up n down the court!)  So all that was day two in a nutshell.  Day three opened up the flood gates of anguish!!! Our whole purpose for being there was to get all the paperwork outta the way so when we return in Feb, all we have to do is train. Well, today was the big MEDICAL EVAL!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGGGGGGGH!!!!!!!!! SHOTS!!! SHOTS!!! SHOTS!!!!! My man had me scared outta my shoes for a while (NCOIC)...the way he put it pretty blunt when he was like if they found anything wrong with us, we'd basically be no-go's & sent back home, released from duty. I tell you this...I did not get this far just to be turned around! And thank God I wasn't. Everything was arite...except the fact that I needed  SIX  shots! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH HHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I was sore, so it was like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGG GGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Also met this kat who was a medical alibi & victim of a crappy company commander. Apparently, he was hurt and the military has basically crapped on his every attempt to get the treatment he needs. He is a prime example of why I hate this country sometimes. To uncle sam, if you're not healthy, you're a liability. You're a number, in a sea of many, and that's not the way it should be. I wish the best for him & his wife. I hope they weather this storm and come thru alright. Later that night, I was also able to send my baby Nikki an email letting her know that I was okay. Couldn't stay in that room too long tho. Its hot & cramped...far from what I understand a true 'internet cafe' to be.  More adventures to come! Stay tuned!!

       PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE...   Day 1: The early morning air was full of crap. Our leadership is full of crap. Everything I loved about the guard has been singed somewhat and it makes me sick to think that i'll be spending a year n a half around these people. Convoy was terrible, not surprisingly. We departed in two basic increments...16 minimum vehicles a piece. Cats got separated...vehicles broek downon the side of the road...including a BRAND NEW WRECKER!!! What kinda stuff is that??? One guy even ran out of fuel...I thought that was...special. Then one guy turned off on an exit believing he was following the rest of the crew ahead, only to find that he was seeing things. Yep, you guessed it...it was your nerdy neighborhood Spiderman lol. I was sleepy shoot...I dont care. I got down there okay, that's all that was important. Another vehicle had transmission issues so it was only travelling bout 30 miles an hour before it gave out. Man we did a great job of PMCS (preventive maintenance, checks & services...standard military stuff). When we got there...well, to back up a little bit...I was in the 2nd increment and we left not long before 9:00..and we were supposed to be out around 8:30. Anyways, when we got there, it was a little before 7:00...had just enough time to eat chow n get unwined. My main bag and my laptop were both on the back of one of the hummers that broke down so I had to wait to get my locker joint organized properly. It just sucked all the way around...  My particular train of folks...we were the last ones to arrive...of ALL the companies in our battalion. 5 companies and we were the absolute last people to arrive. *sigh* Anyways, the barracks were basically just like basic training...except hotter & in a far more remote area (I trained @ Ft. Jackson conveniently located beside Columbia) It is an interesting Fort I will say. Incredible land mass...home of the infantry...hoooah!!! I'm so freakin' tired of that word...we say it 3 million times a day.  Well folks, that's basically day one. Day two was a blur...all I remember is we were thru by lunch. But Day three....

      I have a girlfriend...............  Sometimes I have trouble believing that i've seen this day. It has escaped me for most of my adult life. She loves me and I love her...and i'm not sure what else a man could ever ask for. She's perfect in every way...beautiful, smart, intelligent, funny, thoughtful, honest...also she can cook and believe me when I say...that is VERY important lol! Perhaps even a prince with a vagrant heart can set his feet upon solid ground after all. Still with no home, save the one that resides in her heart. I have a girlfriend.........  I'm in love, and i'm headed to a land of controversy & despair.....so many emotions, so many thoughts, so many possibilities, but I cannot move. My fate is sealed and my hands are tied behind my back. All I can do is watch the world go by & pray that I do not add to its downfall. I certainly don't want to add to her downfall... I don't want her to suffer emotional grief because of me. I have no desire to be her best friend & her worst enemy at the same time.  A prison, then. Such as iron bars could create, but this metal does not the prison make. Trapped in insurrection, yet furthered by the sands of time. She is my future...everything that is good...everything that has promise. Everything that shines...everything that is precious to life. I can consider no soul more worthy to create a new life...  I LOVE YOU NICOLE...BABY, I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART & SOUL!!!  And so it begins...

      Your vaunted superhero took a trip to Ft. Benning this past week with every intention of being able to communicate solidly during off hours but it didn't work out that way. We actually have average-at-best barracks with one internet "cafe" filled with 7 systems...that must be shared amongst like 600+ people. They have a few open hub slots so when we go back down in February, I should be able to use my own cat 5 line. Acomodations arent all that overall. The rooms are hot, and not to mention, all the way up on the 3rd floor...two elements that would make it bout some bs if it was summertime. I virtually only had time to send one email a day when I finally got the chance. They have a 15 minute limit on internet usage. Not much in the way of privacy either...can't check your bank account unless u want the rest of the world to know your biz also. Well, we're back now, gonna spend most of tomorrow working on some systems, most of which have mid to minor issues. Go back to the unit Tuesday n continue this 8-5 joint til the 22nd of February. Isn't that sweet???? We're getting paid to do next to nothing!!! Man, only if I could say that when we cross those frigid waters...  My baby wrote the most touching poem i've ever read in her blogger. You guys should really check it out...this girl is talented! I can think of only one person who comes close to rivaling her ability to express the feelings in her heart...i'll give u two guesses but u only need one :-) To expound tho, it talked about us..our relationship and its future. I was touched to the point that it made me feel bad about myself and how i've always been doing other things while talking to her. All we really have right now is our communication. We lose that, we lose everything. I can't afford to let that happen. God gave her to me and its my responsibility to treat her like the queen she is! To fight the "ambient distraction syndrome", that is, doing anything that keeps me from talking to Ms Triplett is the key. And I can do that...its just that i'm not used to it. I've always had a multitask-oriented personality...even if I didn't mt well.   I will end for now but only because i'm tired of typing. I almost wish they had voice journals...apparently Nikki thinks its a good idea but she wouldn't buy it. She would be missing out lol. Its a fantastic concept that just needs a little support & ingenuity to work out. I meant truth be told, you don't expect the service to blow up into a billion dollar internet biz..its just a tool to help further communication online. I'll start posting my Ft. Benning adventures tomorrow...stay tuned!

       Life, Or Something Like It   Arite..where do I begin tonite... Well for starters, I talked to my baby Nikki on the phone last nite and left the convo with mixed emotions. For once, I didn't say or do anything completely absurd but I did bring something up to my own attention: I THINK TOO MUCH!!! Okay, show of hands...how many of you were surprised? Two people? Kool, two more than I expected. Anyways to express my point, over the past week, i've expressed some feelings I have about...well mostly our limits. Limits in terms of what we'd do when we get together, restricting what is at liberty to be...um...*ahem* As I was saying, I think too much. The most important detail was left out...we haven't  met  yet! Even though i'm certain it is my destiny to be with her, I sometimes find myself missing signals & far more obvious jabs of interest. This has never happened to me before so i'm not sure what the deal is. Its no secret that she exists on a plane unknownst to most of mankind, conceptualized by the heavens & made reality by the King of kings. And even tho i'm caught in her mystical web of electric pleasure, i've always had/ kept a level head...which makes it all the more odd that sometimes I keep skipping a rail or two on the track. I lose my focus perhaps because i'm so looking forward to the future that I don't see what's right in front of me. Getting closer tho...learning her style more & more and that is essential.  In deployment news, I got some new information today... We're headed for Ft. Benning next week for bout 4-5 days. During this time, we'll be doing our SRP's over again, other logistics work, etc., etc. A slew of representatives from Benning have been here since the beginning and one of them told me they don't even know what our billeting situation will be like next week. I've gone as far as to look up the place where we're supposed to be training at on  urlLink Yahoooo! . Don't have any pictures of the buildings tho...don't know what the living situation wil be like. Either way it adds to the intrugue of the events of the days to come.

      Implicit Heroics:  As the day draws nearer toward our departure, I look back over some of the things i've gone thru these past few years and I wonder what lies on the horizon. One thing about the future however, I don't want to know what happens. I'm thoroughly content to live each day at a time, see naturally what the Lord has planned in our lives. We leave Wednesday for Ft. Benning. Everyone is pretty upbeat & encouraged it would appear. The circumstances that have lead us to stick around one extra day may pay off in the long run. We get that much more time to get used to each other b4 we depart together.   I've been so sleepy lately tho...so drowsy, but it will pass in time. My hours b4 mobilization were significantly different than the ones we're keeping now. I have yet to talk to my lil mama Nikki tonite. For the 1st time in a minute, I logged on and she wasn't here. That girl is so sexy tho...yal just have no idea. She has this naturally entrancing expression on her face...just makes u wanna eat her alive lol! Awwwwwww :-) well, I guess I can fantasize all I want 'cause there's a strong chance I won't get to see her even when my unit marches near her backyard. There's a lot of talk circulating around that we'll be training, packing & sleeping the whole time so we won't have the chance to leave post or have visitation...dirty rumors...  Anyways, i've got some work to handle so i'll holla!

      The superhero begins his march to the last Zion... Fully aware of the impending dangers lurking in the shadows, but prepared to go down with the ship. That is, unless that cocksucker Bush shows up to give another of his famous "pep talks". I already can't stand the military under his leadership...wasn't too excited about it before then, but at least everything was kosher. Rabid prick has done everything I figured he would do at this point in his term...the economy is in the crapper, we're at war in Iraq, and everythings on fire. Usually I could say "oh well, blah blah blah...whatever" but its not that kinda party. I'm going to the land of the lost with a bunch of misfit drill mates that, for 98% of them, I wouldnt trust to wash my invisible car!  I'm going to miss all of you's guys, especially, my mom, my nephews, my best friend Jon, and my other homeboys Laurence & Dewitt...but I think the person I will miss the most is a woman that i've never met. A woman that for all inclusive purposes only lives in theory. A living dream that breathes and walks among the living...ill miss you miss Nikki...you're my dream come true, and I pray that God will continue to bless you always. He loves you & so do I!!! YEAY NIKKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Now for the 6:51 news...  In local news, vagrant son Ronald Stevenson, Jr. finalizes preparations to join with his unit tomorrow as they complete preparations for their stint in Iraq. When asked about his feelings on the matter, he could not be reached for comment because he's packing...sheesh...  In economic news, a powerful conglomerate has seized hold of evercare industries, which explains why nobody cares about each other anymore...  In domestic news, most of America is still broke...  In international news, we still have Saddam Hussein...  In entertainment news, Kelly Clarkson finished second place in the World Idol competition. Much to her delight, current American champion Ruben Studdard ate the rest of the contestants shortly after the proceedings...  That's the news for now, tune in later for Dave Attels Confessions of a Backyard Wimp!

      This life I lead has steered me in several different directions. I've been so many things to many different people (speaking in reference to one who wears many hats, thus, carries different titles / associations). The latest transition has seen my development into a soldier capable of providing a difference in service to his country in Iraq. To those who are somewhat behind, I leave tomorrow. The irony of the whole situation is this whole thing still hasn't hit me yet. I still don't believe that this day has come, and to these terms, and at of all times in my life...now!  But such is what it is...so be it.  I'm convinced that God gives his people what they need at the times when they need it the most. I'm convinced I believe there is a God that works behind the shadows, doing work that no man has considered, and perhaps never will. In so saying, it has become apparent in my life that God has given me what I needed, carefully placing individuals that provide for my common welfare & self preservation & encouragement that may find themselves either permanent fixtures in the world of Ron or merely "war buddies", such as exist in the military consideration. I anticipate finding out a lot about myself in these coming days & weeks...praying that most of it will be good, but in all things, according to God's divine will.  To all who may read...keep me in your prayers.

      Its surprisingly easy to get to ATL. Only problem was, there was a bridge out on hwy 28 so I had to take a detour. Ended up wasting some minutes & travel time like that but it worked out. If I was a tourist tho, i'd have been seriously SOL cause SC backwoods r nothing to mess with. lol, you liable to mess around n have some indians jump out on you n rain your vehicle with arrows n crap. As soon as I got to Anderson then hooked up on I 85, the rest was a piece of cake. I wasn't even drowsy on the drive there either...had all my rap albums on near full blast to thank for that. Usually I get sleepy during long journeys, but my adrenaline was pumping and I was ready for the events ahead. A brotha couldn't get to ATL fast enough. A few hours later, I did however. Despite a traffic jam & some white kid jumping out of the back of an SUV doing jumping jacks...naked...all the transitions went well. The reservations at the Holiday Inn went smoothly. I thought they overcharged my card tho. Man at the front desk asked for my card again, which, theoretically, defeated the purpose of me using it online. Room looked nice...equipped with a king sized bed with good springs. Enough cable channels to keep me occupied, a wonderful looking restaurant in the lobby. Bathroom was stacked pretty well...even took a picture of it. Be nice if it had a spa lol. man that would have opened up some interesting possibilities :-) It was a weekend of optimism...the fulfillment of dreams that have bubbled in my mind for going on two months. It was time for the truth to be told.   urlLink My Baby's blog  tells essentially every key detail of how that weekend turned out. Ladybird was so thoroughly able to capture the look n feel of the events as they progressed that it seemed like she was taking notes from rolling video. I used to have a memory like that... I guess they all died from thinking too much. As you can tell, it wasn't my best work...that weekend. Not much went the way I expected it to, and apparently, I was the main one responsible for that. Speechless....I have never truly been speechless!! ME??? Not THIS homeboy!!! Maybe it wasn't always intelligent, eloquent or thought out, but I always expressed what was going on inside. Speechless tho, that's what I was. Fully unable to find words to express how I felt inside...only partially able to explain my reasoning. It was something I could see...something I could feel...yet found myself unable to express.  I wanted her to know how special she was in my life, to show her what the meaning of true love is. I wanted to make love to every aspect of her being...still want to, and still planning on it. And I wanted to go some places, maybe ride around downtown Atlanta, see some sites, take some pictures, just enjoy each others' company. But there was always somewhere hidden in the back of my mind, this resilient moral compass that spoke at sundry times. It reminded me of how & why I made that promise I made that night, that I would not grace her gates without a ring involved. It reminded me of how I felt at the very thought of looking into her eyes & seeing forever, which resolved in my heart then & there that I wanted to wait for my woman. That's my baby...my personal playtoy...but more importantly, my best friend & everything that has meaning in my life.  My willpower, as she found out, is legendary. How I was able to be in the position I was in & not slither my anxious rod inside her dripping wet cavern of ecstasy is beyond my knowledge. Her body is just..............................................................................................wow! But to a point, it should never have gotten that far. If it was my desire to save her precious gift, I should have never led her to believe that she would lose it...twice. Heaven knows I want to be inside of her, to feel her heat contract around my throbbing manpole. So many times i've dreamed of watching her luscious breasts jump up & down as she straddles me, leaking juices all over my crotch area. In my mind, i've spilled my release on every part of her body...especially down her crack, so I could watch my juice roll down her kitty lips then drip onto the sheets. We talked about sex a lot since the promise. Even came to a point where we left it at a place of open possibility if the occasion ever presented itself. But a promise means everything to me, even if it was created by the person in question who desires to rescind on it. So that's why I would have been content to let her get hers & me not even whip it out. If I ended up tasting her sweetness as my tongue was dying to do, that promise was all but ended.  I keep searching all life & reality to see if I did the right thing, to validate if my abstaining from full copulation had any merit. In all reality............perhaps this is emotions talking....but I don't think I did. To get that far & not finish what was started...that should be a federal offense, punishable by the slicing of the penis/ clit respectively! If I was truly concerned about the consequences, they would have paled in comparison to the significance of the moment. Two young lovebirds, actively expressing their love for each other...one for the first time...  *sigh*  I thought I had been in love before...but then I met Mellanie...and my whole world changed.  Late Sunday morning, I left the city of Atlanta, amid a rainstorm and a sea of unfulfilled wishes....but I still had my babys' heart, and she still had mine. And she always will.

      I slept pretty good last night...no real complaints. Typically, however, I don't do well on long road trips. Its easy for me to start dozing off because a brother just can't be....still...for too long. My brain needs activity or I just start losing it. Sucks, I know, but hey. I'm fairly certain this is a trait of my mother. She has that same habit from time to time. But here I sit, in a computer lab waiting for a ride to Enterprise so I can pick up a car that wasn't what I ordered...all because their crappy clientele haven't returned their smaller vehicles. WHAT JOY!!!!! All this reinforces why I don't make plans. My plans never work....EVER. EVVERR!!!!! So while i'd rather be back on my way home, packing the temp with my get right-weekend gear, i'm here, talking to my friend from Church Erica, who happens to work in the lab i'm occupying. She showed me pictures of my homeboy J.R.'s wedding...pictures apparently posted to the website of the people that did their wedding photos. Cute girl...good guy...hope everything works out for them. They both used to live in SC but are NC kids now...living it up in Charlotte. He sent me an email going on two months ago...I responded but he has yet to. Well, a little while longer to stay here waiting. It is the calm b4 the storm. I'm on the road to ATL baby, just a while to stay here, then i'm out!  Pray for me...

       Set some time before the events previously posted...   I probably should have figured in my share of the rent this month before buying those freaking basketball shorts. Now i'll have to budget my feeble finances for another week til I get paid again. God help me if I come up short though. Anything would be better than hearing mom gripe over how i'm not using my talents to their fullest extent, that is, talent that transfers into profit. Well boo hoo momma! Maybe i'm not the doctor that some saw, or the electrical engineer that uncle Maron predicted when I was 14. Maybe i'm just the lowly carpenter that works out of his ex-step fathers' corner shop. Maybe i'm just the eclectic result of circumstance...  ...and speaking of a man whose true soul is forever cloaked behind that stern, incisive persona... I've got my suspicions about him...always have. And if anyone can recognize a man with secrets, its me. He's hiding something...just don't know what it is yet. He hasn't been the same person after the big fire. When the police asked him of the events as they approached him, he told them virtually nothing! He claims "I was so shocked by--I mean oh God, please help those poor people!" With that the inquiries began to dissipate, wrote him off as a distraught witness. Whatever works, guy. Personally I hope they brainwash him, see what other nuggets of knowledge he has saved in that big head of his.  "I hope you know that Chase is coming by tonite to check on the water heater..." Begins mom. "Why? I don't even see why you still let him in the house! What has he ever done for you?" I respond. She puts her head back down and continues sweeping the floor. "Its true mama," I continue, "but whatever. Hey the heater isn't even broke!" "Have some sympathy Kole, the guy is just trying help us out...there's nothing wrong with that." Guilt can go a long way in changing a persons' daily habits. I think I liked him better when he was just a roving snitch who instigated fights & farted when surrounded by large crowds. But after that incident two years ago, he feels the weight of the world on his shoulders. Actually if I was in his position, I would probably be doing the same thing. Its a lot to swallow, a heck of a lot to accept. My battle in itself is...its war. A constant war raging in my soul. Honestly i've tried everything but therapy, not my cup of tea as they say. But I pray about it everyday, and often times it drives me to use the pen. I never even touched a poetry club til my moms' accident. Now there's so much on my mind words can't stop flowing. Its how my mind has come to sift the theory from the reality of the emotions lurking in my heart. Its how the laziness of one sin has transferred concensual ownership over to another, and my mind is a blazing warfield of confusion. I feel like i'm about to explode from another mans burden! Another womans....   TO BE CONTINUED

      -- An excerpt from the drama  The Last Sin   I promised I would never go down this road again, but here I am....once more. Traveling the powerful roads of adversity that within its own soul brings unique challenges to my competitive psyche. At one time, it was different, the whole game was different. I was virtually a whole other person until one day...sometimes, you just can't help but feel it. Its sweet melody pulsates through your mind like a Bach cantata, or perhaps a Brahms lullaby. The pure innocence of the mood masks the dirty, foul, rancid truth buried under years of assumed intelligence. After all this time, I thought I realized this...but life was soon to prove me wrong.  Foreshadowing? Naah, it hasn't happened yet, but it will. Call it a sixth sense, if you will, but after all this time, a man knows how it will all end. Even now I sit here waiting for her. How ironic to abide in the drivers seat when my world is out of control. Even now she dresses in warm clothing, fancying up for what is supposed to be a romantic night on the town. It would be nice, this romantic fling into the city... Even now there is a fore under my shadow, a precursor to the revelation of our legacy, proven only by action, denied not by foolish creedence or petty undulance...BE STILL MY RAGING SOUL!  "I thought you had bigger breasts than those!"  Verona shrugs me off, "You always think too much nigga."  "Hey where's that shirt I bought you? I thought you were wearing it tonite?" I inquire. She made no attempt to respond right away as she covered her half-exposed upper form with her scarf while promplty sliding her miniskirt back close to her knees as she gets in the car.  "Hey playboy, I thought I was driving tonite," she begins.  Feeling instantly insulted that she ignored my question my next thought was to say nothing, even thought her amazing physique made me reconsider. "Playa when you help pay this car note, you can go anywhere you want." Money. Something she didn't have, something she wasn't in a rush to obtain. Something she very rarely got from me, which begged the obvious question...who was giving it to her. Parents? Naah...stingy & tight-lipped. Ex boyfriend/ sugar daddy/ splackavelli on the low? Drug pusher? Street whore??? Who knows. It worries me though, and I think about it all the time. Fortunately, she's not my girl...never has been, never will be. But one day I need to tell her that, instead of leading her on.   By this time, I had eliminated nearly all of my sins, the latest being my willful desire to fornicate. Before that, I gave up...well, I can't say that I no longer lie because...well, i'm living a lie. As the ministers say, the truth is not in me. Some have even come to question the very term...what is truth? I don't quite know what it is but I know what it is not. My life does not reflect the spiritual integrity of my intended virtue, which makes me shallow & inconsiderate. However shallow, i'm far from indecisive. But I spent that time with her. Now I sit with someone new, someone with a similar aura...whose future could very nearly mirror my own. Mirror me then, don't mock me. Don't play me for a fool. Never sell me short! I stand 5' 11 not 1' 5. Mirror me...  Once all these things passed me there was but one remaining sin...my last sin. Quote the good servant, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." Of all sins that face mankind, I dare not face this one alone...     TO BE CONTINUED

      There's been a heavy sea of crap goin down lately here @ Ron J. central. Seems like most of my upper-level cadre have agendas contrary to the unit mission. Politics exist in every unit...every situation, but the latest revelation has me stunned.  Popular word is, the reason why we don't have 4 day passes is because the battalion commander, his trusty sidekick CSM Norman & some other soldier went to get haircuts @ a civilian barbershop, left their kevlars in the vehicle (which happened to be military) and after this revelation reached mob commander general guy, we no longer have that impending luxury. This news startled, and further, shocked most of us...well...pretty much everybody. It wasn't even so much them takiNG away our two extra days, it was liek so many things in life, the principal! DON'T PUT IT OUT THERE IF YOU NOT SURE YOU CAN OWN UP TO IT!!!  Blessed God we are so different that typical units that get deployed. Plus, we STILL don't have a mission, which means that if we don't find one here, our next command would come from Kuwait. 10 men to a tent in 140 degree weather...  Well, i'm growing agitated again, think its best to sign off for now. Oh yeah I do have some good news... On the weekend of the 3rd, I have some plans for me & lil mama. Somn...seriously entertaining & a genuine display of my love & adoration for my boo. *sigh* i'm sooo in love... There's also the possibility that I could meet the parents. That would be...interesting...in itself. Arite, sign off time, u cats go watch some TV or something...

      We're in prison dawg, and thats REAL!  THey got us moving around like puppets on strings, locked down like friggin' inmates in prison cells. All I know is I want my got dern handcuffs...  If they gonna treat us like inmates, we may as well walk around in the pinstripes. We not here because we wanna be, we're here because our country called us to duty. We never asked for much...never did, and in my case, never will, but this recent development is....BUULLL!!!!  I'm gonna need to talk to the chaplain & get some spiritual counseling cause a brother is tore up right now lol.

      Been gone for far too long, the scene has changed. The guide posts that used to light the way aren't as visible as they used to be. Its all good tho, just gotta keep movin', that's the key. Just gotta keep movin' brother. Naah, I haven't seen my peoples in quite some time...haven't really heard from them much either. Poverty has a way of touching across miles, ya know? Yea I used to be poor...but never on that welfare stuff tho', naah not me. We had a little more pride than that when I was growin' up. But we weren't against handouts tho. Naah, you never turn down free stuff ya know? Didn't have much of a choice half the time...father wasn't there, granted he did die. Left my mom all by her lonesome, yup. He's prolly turnin' over in his grave, realizing that i'm headed off the Iraq tho. Man was afraid to die, much less for his country. Hey that's the irony of life you know? The very thing you try to avoid is what gets you. Well lemme tell you what's been goin' down these past few weeks. Before I get started, I would like to send a personal shoutout to my one & only sweetheart, ladies & gentlemen, a round of applause for LADYBIRD aka Mell Tripple Cosey (Stevenson :-) )!!!! Tripple Cosey ladies & gentlemen!! (Take a bow baby!!!!)  These past few weeks we've been training, as you all know. Some of this training has been really interesting, culminating with the town raid we did a few days ago. Before that, we've been training up to that event...doing a myriad of different training stuffs, taking a bunch of friggin classes...having my behind dozing off hard. But nothing in life has ever moved me the way yesterdays' events moved me.... Yesterday I saw The Passion of the Christ. That movie is the single greatest..... wow.  ...I don't look at it like a movie... I see...a man who willingly came to earth to be the propitiation for the sins of all mankind...I spent the majority of the second half of that movie in pure tears, sobbing like nothing I had ever....EVER felt before. Feeling more worthless in my so-called pursuit of true Godliness. Still feeling worthless...undeserving... God put this beautiful, incredibly talented woman in my life...blessed me wiht a sound mind and a decent heart...blessed me with strength in my limbs...blessed me with another day, which means, another chance. What have I done to deserve any of this??? I'm just a guy, in a world that hates me, one which...hated him first, and even moreso than me...  Mankind in itself is not deserving, if you ask me. Corrupt from the beginning, abhoring from his delegated purpose. I hate to be so negative but that's what a blog is for. It can't always be pretty.   Thank you God for sending your son Jesus, who was sent to earth to die so that we unworthy parishioners might live. We realize that it is through you that all our blessings come into fruition, so we praise you in the firmament of Holiness, praise you from the rooftops, praise your name across the mountains because we know that all of our help comes from you! THANK YOU JESUS FOR SAVING US FROM SIN!!!  Your brother, Ron J.

      Over & Over & Over Again Jesus you kept me from harm Satan he's trying to tempt me from God but oh Jesus Holy you are! Faith is the substance of things unseen So glad the Lord will stand right beside me Your loving kindness to all living things Oh Jesus Holy you are! Oh Jesus Holy you are!  I wrote this chorus while I was in Church, I believe. It will be the last track to my first gospel album I will call Truth & Virtue. Once I get the rest of the verses together, maybe i'll add an audio snippet so yous guys can hear how it sounds. Its very much a praise & worship song, very dear to my heart in word, content & deed.  I hope to keep in better contact during this deployment. I know i've been slacking but its all been for reasonable excuse (you try getting up @ 3:45 in the morning & working all day long and see if you feel like sitting in a hot computer room sending emails). There is so much to discuss tho, so much that has transpired...not to mention, i've released my first rough draft of the first 3+ chapters of French Kiss, my new poetry volume, to select audiences! Well, right now just one person but...still...  Arite, heat is getting to me, i'm out!

      What does a man need to consider himself succesful? A great job, a beautiful wife, maybe even some kids and a big house...Nice car(s), a yacht on the ocean...real estate ventures...  What is man without his dreams? A withered flower awaiting mandates of time, and as such flutter away all signs of the previous life. If all man were kin to his end, meaning, aware that eventually, there would no longer be a John or a Jane Doe, would their frugal pursuits of a more pristine lifestyle mean as much? Everyone wants nice things...does that mean everyone should HAVE nice things? A man gets to reevaluating his external environment after he has been put thru some things. God said He would never put more on his children than they could bear. That's the only thing that keeps my soul with the desire to stay above the water and not drown. I know that somehow all this malevolent foolishness will one day be over The Lord has blessed me beyond measure, and it isn't in my better interests to ever take his mercy for granted.  Well, i'm sleepy, and somewhat frustrated....and electrically torn down physically. Make it so bad, the worst part is yet to come. But i'm keeping my hopes up because I clearly see past the moment. I see past the here n now...its the post uncle sam drama i'm concerned with. To all the also-rans that haven't heard from me in a while...keep your short on (Unless you're baby girl, then by all means take them off :D).

        A lot of people have been asking me "what's the deal with Superhero, Inc? Are those silhouettes in the background a bunch of mini-Ron's?" Well this is an explanation that is far past due so here we go.  The Inc. in compendium is a collection of heroes that fight respective adversaries in all our lives, whether it be depression, anger, slothfulness, rage, etc. and works to better our lives through teamwork & spirit building. Comprising of over 200 different heroes, Superhero Inc. seeks to fight evil works wherever they may surface. All these forces, good & evil come together in my world to face off against each other daily, the good forces being led by the daunting champion Onijah Rowen whose strength & determination always lead the way. Erstwhile forces are headed by a three-headed conglomerate called the Dark Trinity. So you see...you have to stay tuned to the journal because you neva know how the forces of good & evil will manifest themselves in my life!  Now that that is done... Me & Nicole had the most wonderful conversation yesterday! :o) We didn't fuss, argue, gripe, complain...we just talked! We talked like we used to, sharing our creative thought & musings, reminiscing on our short past & speaking about things to come. It made me want to cry for real!! Whole thing about that, earlier in the day, we were going at it again. She left a lengthy trail of offline messages on yahoo telling me how she felt about our altercation and...without going into detail, she was p'oed. Arguments like those....it makes me wonder about the strength of our relationship...the ties that bond...the glue that holds us kindred... She constantly says that things I say upset her/ come off sounding rude/ take your pick...but if that was my true intent, what would be the basis? Why intentionally hurt the one you LOVE? *sigh* I've never had discussions like these with anyone else...not to this extent. We argue over things that deserve no breath, that should never be an issue. Everyday I rack my brain to figure out how to make things right between us yet the same thing she tends to be offended/ insulted by in me I see the same in her!! Let me say this also, we are two different people, mind you. Two completely different upcomings & outlooks on life. Our respective environments are crazy different, so much of what we clash on I try to put into perspective. Some of the goals I had are in essence goals she's still climbing to reach...Let me clarify. I graduated from college already, she's finishing next year...I'm a virtually free spirit & have the freedom to do whatever & go wherever I want...Nicole...not so much. Arite please don't get me wrong, there's NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT!!! Nothing at all. These factors, among others not listed but mildly related, tend to make us clash on several issues & viewpoints and that ust shouldn't be! Once you understand your woman and your woman understands you, there should be a mutual braintrust established that recognizes status quo & safeguards against breaches in that emotional dwelling...  *SIGH* There is so much more to the story...don't have time to tell it all. I didn't mean to write all of this...and I know i'll hear about it later which is fine. All I know is there is something that keeps us coming back from every argument, every obstacle, every situation...but no verbal makeup can compete with actually spending time. If I had to choose, I would want my baby in the same town as me or close as possible so I wouldn't have to drive across states to come see her.  Beautiful you are, Nicole, and wonderful together we someday shall be. I love you...anyhow :o).

        Whoa    There have been a lot of things on my mind lately and my whole thing...I tend to write when my mind is cloudy & the situation calls for free expression. Anyone who has some free time on their hands, I need yal to feel me on this. I just need to get some things off my mind.   Sometimes I'm right when I'm wrong Sometimes I can hear when no one is talking Sometimes I can make music without striking a single chord Sometimes I'm white when I'm black Sometimes I may seem innocent when in fact i'm guilty...  Sometimes I see all men as one Sometimes I see one man as meaning the world Sometimes I'm hurting when I really feel good Sometimes I'm rushing when I don't have any place to go Sometimes I'm cool on the outside but green with envy on the inside...  Sometimes I feel like Superman when I really look like Shiznitt Sometimes I can fly without wings Sometimes bigamy is having too many women but sometimes monogamy is the same  So many thoughts, so many options Life can sometimes be viewed as this big game that everybody plays but rarely produces any winners. Sometimes we spend a lifetime just keeping our head above water, waiting for that lifeboat to save us & sail us away to safety. I guess the true winners are those that meet God halfway, giving their full effort to help themselves become at peace with the world around them, giving into no temptation but focusing on the goal  Sometimes its not that deep  Sometimes I'm going so fast the world isn't even moving Sometimes its not going to be arite Sometimes one can change their clothes & still sport the same colors Sometimes I'm wrong when i'm right  Whoa...

      WE'RE LEAVING!!! AHHAHAHAHAHAA!!  In truth, i'm not really happy...though I do miss my nephews. The unit is going home for the weekend, and i'm reluctantly going with them. Reason I don't wanna go home is because i'll end up spending madd money in a short amount of time, I just know it. I know me & I know my family. Second reason is because people will ask me  questions...   DON'T ASK ME ABOUT JACK!! YEA, I'M HERE, AND I'M STILL ON ORDERS TO GET SENT SOMEPLACE!!! AAAAAAAAUGH!! WHO GIVES A RATS ANUS ABOUT THE YOUTH CHOIR??? IT WASN'T MY BABY FROM THE START AND I'M DARN SURE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS DOWNFALL SINCE I'VE BEEN AWAY!!! aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!!  Yea we've also received some interesting news in relation to where we may be going (quite rumor talk) but at least this rumor is stateside. Some are saying that we may be spending our days @ Camp Shelby in Mississippi....doing what exactly is beyond me. Well i'm out now. I was expecting this big email from Nik but I guess something came up. It was kinda deflating, cause I was prepared to dig thru the emotional well again & see how she further feels about the relationship. Ah well. Speaking of which, she called me last nite...which isn't unusual...but it is @ 1:15 in the morning. I thought something was wrong but apparently she was just missing me. Awwwwwwwww poor thing... Well...more to say...as I do many times, but i'm headed back to the barracks to watch Mace Windu kick some sith butt again lol. I downloaded some Clone Wars cartoons and from what I can tell, the second season is far better than the first. Sweet! I'm...wait...I sound awful white when I say 'sweet'...aight, screw that. To speak blackly, i'm a Star Wars fan again. Got inspiration to continue my ultimate Jedi storyline again. Its gonna be a party in my brain and NOBODY'S INVITED UNTIL ITS FINISHED! HAA!!!  *Editors note* As one can clearly tell from this exegesis of this entry, the author was very excited. Please take all of his mistakes for love. If you choose not to do so then u can...(insert expletive here lol)

       Ron J., The Prince of Justice  First son of three children Two years removed from college Three years before a possible leave from the military Four years away from age 30  ...2 minutes before a nervous breakdown...  1 second away from complete inner chaos  Complicatedly uncomplicated Devotedly loyal, unquestionably noble  Far from being so sold on myself that i'd consider myself the quintessential picture of perfection or even the dedicated result of a work in progress... I'm not the gallant knight i've dreamed of becoming by this point in my life. No big white stallion, no immaculate armor, no impenetrable will. Nothing about my life runs the course of a fairy tale...its actually quite tainted with loss & regret. My life reads more like the flawed star of a comic book rather than the exploits of a man who's lived in reality all this time... I've never consistently lived fortunately...fortunate to be alive, hanging by a string. The apparent plague of a man whose life dangles by a string of invisible design.  The key to confusion is proportion to where two do not agree in one. How can they grow unless they be as one?  One lord, one faith, one baptism.  One hope...but turned back upon a ray to him whose eyes are cast, I cannot be Michael J or J.R. Reid....Daphne Maxwell or Vernon...I'm not the rogue spear of justice nor the controlled fury of Hitler.  I AM Ron J., the prince of justice...the verbose, electric, intelligent, spirited, fiery voice of triumph thru adversity. A blessed survivor of years of psychlogical chaos & more than anything on earth...I KNOW WHO I AM! I know who and I know why! I know what exists and what does not. I'm aware of where I lack and where I flourish. Tho my mindset & my life story differ like night from day, and fully realizing that my methods can be complicated to understand, I am NOT hard to figure out! My life is, even in its present state, proof of my virtue, a testament to things I can not prove, a voice to an existence that had no birth! My attitude is...  1. Loyal 2. Compatible 3. Open 4. Forgiving 5. Residual 6. Enduring 7. Determined 8. Harmless or  9. Harmful 10. Not my biggest problem  I'm not the next man or the next woman. I have no children & therefore have no context to either raise children nor tolerate childish inquisition. I am the accomplished result of a man who has failed, and got back up. I don't have to give excuses for myself, when one knows...I don't listen like other people listen, comprehend like others may, see the world in the same light that perhaps complacent also-rans have their vision, but I love just the same. I show my affection in the like-same manner. I'm just as capable of loving, showing love & being loved as anyone in existence.  I'm complicatedly uncomplicated verbosely simply humble  ...but PISSED  I know whose side i'm on, and each & every friend i've ever had knew whose side I was on. Men may accuse me, some may scorn, some may not appreciate what I put out but all know whose side i'm on. Even my associates get the same form of compassion. Shoot, even my  enemies  get the same face. You may question my attention span or my conversation, or lack of, but never question my dedication or my heart. Once I have made you my friend, you are a friend for life. Your place in my heart is forever solidified. And when I make the decision to give you this heart...understand that the core of this phantom heartbeat, that has endured for centuries & speaks in many tongues, that knows no fear but takes precaution, that lives lively and has been since the beginning of understanding, the essential duties, honor & virtue of love & life are in your hands...  Don't lose it...don't let it go...

         I waited til I saw the sun I don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun I don't know why I didn't come, Dont know why I didn't come  My heart is drenched in wine but you'll be on my mind forever  Something has to make you run I don't know why I didn't come I feel empty as a drum Don't know why I didn't come...   --Jesse Harris   (don't know why - norah jones)  Words....can say what the heart expresses, limited maybe, so if men are not privy, it can get confusing. Therefore I won't try to put into words the emotions of the heart. I'm also not going to sit here & say that everything is all real but life is like a river that flows where we know not. Sometimes you have to fall in order to get back up. Right now i'm down....waaay down.

         Got a story to tell you 'Bout some things that I been through But I'm healed, oh I'm healed!  Had some ups and some downs Leveled to the ground But I'm healed, oh I'm healed  Had to wrestle all night long Wondered what went wrong But I'm healed, oh I'm healed  Had some sunshine, some rain Heartache and some pain I'm healed, oh I'm healed  My God has touched me Delivered, He set my soul free My heart is mended, I'm whole again No chains are holding me Got my liberty, I am healed I'm healed today!   -- urlLink Jonathan Nelson & Purose: I'm Healed   I feel pretty good...purposeful in spite of the lack of things i've done since being back. The past two days i've been working on beautifying the yard. I've chopped down bamboo chutes, clipped down bushes, small trees, etc. Everything short of cutting the grass, which will prolly end up being a Wednesday job. Grass looks really green tho....healthy too. The only regret I have about the work i've done is I accidentally killed an unhatched bird :-(. I was clipping the bushes in the front yard yesterday and, truth be told, there are nests all over the place...but most of them are abandoned! Make it so bad, this nest only had one egg in it...well, to other news, i've submitted my resume for some positions at some Army bases (civil service) that could work out far better than i'd planned in the past. If one goes thru, i'd be able to stay in the NG or Reserves and still get quality work in my field. I'll be praying about the outcome, hoping that thru all things God will bless.  I've decided to create another hero on the Justice server on  urlLink City of Heroes  because my current mutant scrapper Rowen isn't the destructive badbutt I hoped he'd be by his level. He can't fly, has no long range attacks and I gave him a ponytail 'n glasses. This new one, Nyghtrage still can't fly but he has excellent long range attacks (all electrical), a solid hand to hand melee game and a fantastic look! Check him out,  urlLink Nyghtrage is hot!  It was a trip too...these chicks invited me to fight on their team...3 women and a dude! They had their pink & purple colors...and they were lily white. Me with my whole dark thing goin on...we were kicking butt tho. I recommend this game to video game lovers & novices because it is truly engrossing! U can spend hours playing & not even realizing it! Speak of the devil, time to play some more :p

        Wednesday is supposed to be an off-the-chain day. Today is youth choir practice night, and a possible meeting before to get admin things out the way, its the day when Abbevile memorial finally called & showed inteerst in hiring me for some dp work, and the day that I call the car people to set up an appointment for service. But, can't call them yet 'cause I dont know when I may need the car for other things later this week...certainly next. And I didn't talk to the hospital people, my sister did...so I tried calling back but the line has been busy all day. I got to thinking and now realize, the Smallville season finale is tonight! Tonight at 8:00. Practice is at 7:00 I believe.  WOW!  When you get some creative adversity like that in your life, let me know! We may have somn in common lol.  In better news, I finally got my game working (city of heroes). Turns out I was using the wrong password all along....figures. I've successfully created a version of my superhuman alter ego, Onijah Rowen. At his peak strength, Rowen has more Jedi-like sword wielding, uber agility, super speed, enhanced strength & choice psionic powers than anybody in the game. An expert martial artist...and he looks fantastic too. I wish it were possible to make a screen capture so I could show u guys. Maybe i'll take one with that crappy dv cam I got. Still need to get it fixed, can't playback video at all. Some have expressed that it seems i've been cloaking myself around the fantasy of the unreal, around the whimsical world of heroism. Hiding from the real world & seeking peace in an alternate reality.  NAAH! Yal read too many comic books!

      ...It's out in the open, several posts ago about what happened between us.  It is your right to drill it in and bring it home to all of your readers, BUT....  You did, however leave out some key information in your quest to call me a liar.  The IM conversation we had the night that you "were officially dumped"...you know, the conversation that finalized my feelings...what pushed me over the edge....what made me fed up.  You don't have to toss sugar on a sour situation or distort it until it's your imitation of innocense gone bad.  Tell it like it is.  Your fans will love you for it.  Tell your readers about how you fronted me last night when I was emotional by acting like everything was all good.  Tell them about how you told me I could count on you whenever I needed you and not even 24 hours later, you're telling me to wait until you finish your thoughts before you "could be there for me" and all the while you were writing this entry accusing me of lying.  DEFINE LIAR while you're painting your images of desecrated innocense.  What did I tell you that was not true?  Nothing.  Did I tell you something last night that I had not told you the night I broke up with you?  Sure I did!  But LIE, I did not.  Like I told you, you can sit on your bum and say a million times that it should have this and it should have that.  I told you the night all was lost, that we had a choice.  Our relationship was not neccesarily destined to end the way it did.  We CHOSE the path and followed one another to the end of the road, only, somewhere amongst it all, I stopped and asked for directions.  And now that I know what I need to do as a person, before I'm ready for another relationship you wanna crap on me?  Isn't it messed up how your entries contradict themselves?  Isn't is curious to your readers how everything you once said I WAS, you just said the complete opposite in this entry?  Your equal...you said I was...Someone who was on the same page as you...you said that too.  Who's truth is the truth? And if you "saw it in the beginning," why would you knowingly waste my time?  The truth is, you didnt know ANYTHING.  The only thing you knew was that I was out of a bumpy relationship and you wanted me.  You had NO idea of how our relationship would be.  If you did, you wouldn't BS me and keep telling me you know we'll work thru this.  Do you really believe half of the things that you try to make yourself believe?  What's the real truth, Ronald?  Truth be told, for all you know, I am what you need, needed, or what have u...but honestly, after reading this entry, I have a totally different look on who you are and your "feelings."

        I guess I was around 10 years old when I gave a girl my first love letter. Her name was Latasha B. and for a lil' young kat that was already infatuated with red bones, she was the total package. Cute, pretty & quiet (I tend to be attracted to quiet types). I figure I must have been in maybe the 5th or 6th grade because I definitely wasn't in high school by then. My older cousin Stacy was actually the one that gave it to her. On this particular day, the object of my premature affection happened to be first on the bus. She dropped it off to Tasha then we both went to the back seats and hid. The following moments are ones I will never forget. Shortly after reading a few lines, she began tearing up the paper! To myself I was thinking..."why is she doing that???" It took so long to write, and it had so many of my innocent pre-teen feelings in it and....WHY IS SHE TEARING IT UP??? :(( My other cousin Freda B. was sitting on her same seat. A combination of curiosity and a desire to have Tasha respect the good intentions of the guy who wrote it helped her read the rest of the letter. It was the first time I ever saw a girl cry! Sigh if only they were only tears of joy.... After my crappy attempt at love was literally destroyed, I began to think of what I did wrong. First, and most importantly, you never say something like "you so fyne, you fyner than your mama!!" Instant turn off...I learned the hard way. Much of the letter was like that, and I believe somewhere in that offensive letter was a little boy trying to express his emotions the best way he could...I just couldn't prove it.  That's where I learned what was apropriate to tell a woman and what not to. It was the beginning of a long, painful journey, one that for a while, shyed me away from trynna holla at females.  Its kinda funny when I think back on it. My thinking was so linear. There was but one purpose in my early going and that was to get the heck outta Calhoun Falls. Prestige, cliques, sports...all that meant nada to me. Well, until senior year. That was a coming out year of sorts. I tried out and made the football team for the first time, even tried out for basketball (didn't make the squad). Made records in track and only got one at bat in baseball. In the end, during my entire elementary & high school career, I never had a true girlfriend. I used to think that was a magnificent drawback but looking back on my short past, every defeat ended up benefiting me in some way later in life.  There is a picture being painted and i'm not exactly sure what the final product will be. What I know is that i've had a really non-typical dating life. By the grace of God, i've been thru many situations. I've dealt with pregnant women, needy women, an endless stream of shady women...confronted a sea of personalities head on and in every circumstance, for good or for ill, I came out stronger. It all prepared me for the next adventure in my life. To have and to pursue such a prophecy as was given when I met Nicole...it reminds me of what it takes for prophetic blessings to pass: all parties must be willing. I believe in the power of the works of God in our lives. All my method and general intuition has been led by a power that I cannot fathom. This saying the old people use, about "if God brings you to it, he'll bring u through it", it applies unconditionally. If by some stroke of misfortune Nicole and I happen to not fully be able to reconcile our differences, i'm confident that God will bless anyhow.  ...and let's be clear on one thing, i'm not looking for a replacement at this time! Love is a serious word with me and I feel in my heart of hearts that the story of Nikki & Ron isn't over yet. There is a book filled with pages that beg to be filled. Even tonite, we've taken some steps to strengthen the friendship. How the future will fare is anyone's guess. Of course i'm a realist (I can be, seriously!) and I realize there's a chance we may never hook back up again. But such is the risk that you take. You have to let people go, experience their own thing. Cause its only by letting something free that you can tell if they truly love you or not. Its kinda backwards tho...cause if anybody needed time, it really wasn't me. I admittedly wasn't prepared at first, what with the well documented obstacles we've dealt with but I got that way. So forgive me if I feel kinda naked. :p I been standing out on this ledge by myself for a minute now...  I had some more rants to post but its already 2:43 and i'm sure this stuff needs editing but crap i'll fix it next post or so. *yawn* i'll holla.

      Somebody once told me that the end was the beginning. That for all places and in all things was a point of origin. Life did not begin where we found it so its that much less logical to believe that one can always change the world to our liking. Such reasoning defines why a mans home is his castle...its the only realm where change moves at his speed. Where the inherent denizens skip melodically to the beat of his authoritative drum. Life did not begin for me 10,000 feet off the ground, but to such a place have I been lifted. To have flown so high and to now experience undetermined turbulence...  I've always considered my life & future to be a symbol of purpose from the divine. Too much knowledge and too much intuition to merely sit still, stay black and wait for death. I asked God for wisdom, asked him for purpose. Asked him for a sound mind, and asked that he would meet me halfway on everything. In time I started climbing that ethereal ladder of progress and my wings began to grow & sprout proudly from my evolved form. Some would say that I am the model of human progress, that I have lived the ideal existence, given the circumstances before me. But at the end of the day i'm just not as complete as I planned. Seemed like a drawback at first until I realized...God is in control. I've tried it my way and I failed. Now i'm certain that its my duty to follow the Lord's lead. So fly I have, even with the turbulence. You can look left, you can look right. You can even look up above but never ever look down.

        The first lady passed her judgment down last night. During another heated...u know what, scratch the noise.  Mellanie Nicole Triplett has made up in her mind that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore!!!   The love is there, emotions were never in question. There was no infidelity or questionable company being kept by either party. So what was the true cause? People can only bump heads only so often. The love that bound us could not supersede the stubborn logic that consumed both our mindsets. Maybe my mentality was too streamlined to be the complete man that not just Mellanie but any woman I spent time with could appreciate. What makes it so bad, after all that time of trying and toiling, I almost got there! I'm nearer to being there now than I may have ever been at any point in my life!!! Almost doesn't count however, especially when it takes two to make a thing go right.  Guess its best to just let it burn... See if love is enough to bring her back my way, and if by then both our lives will be fully prepared to take that journey together. We'll see if i'm destined to become another statistic in her life or the man that will usher her into eternity. I'm still in love and I know that she is too.....but for now...

      B: 0210  I have taken an especially long time deep in thought on many issues concerning us lately.  I purposely did not respond to the "Union Address" for fear of damaging the bond between the two of us.  We are so divided by our logical reasoning...and joined by the reasoning of our emotions that I wanted to be sure of what I wanted to say before I said it.  As of today, I am still not ready to make that address and am in the process of meeting with the council to ensure that we reach a fair and firm decision.  To be continued.....

        To be clear, I have no intentions of writing a long blog this time. If it works out that way, so be it.  Additionally, normally the response by the other party is given...by the other party. Seeing as tho they have been reluctant to post their thoughts I thought i'd do my best to give an unbiased window into their feelings on the matter.  We agree. Thank you & goodnight.  Well, that was quick... Their other thoughts are too personal to post and are not available to the general public at this time.  In other news, finally caught up with web site maintenance. Posted updates to the  urlLink main site  and am now in search of something to do. I need to call some paint people and get some estimates on paint work for the "new" Wagoneer I bought yesterday. For those who don't know, I used to own a model that is nearly identical to this one. Only things different are the color (white) and tape deck instead of the cd player that was in the old one. It brings to closure a week of looking for a descent ride and ultimately i'm excited about it. In time I hope to get some better wheels put on it to complement the windows xp blue paint job its gonna get. Arite, that's my time. More updates to be posted as they becoem available.

        Greetings in the name of our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. Son of the only true god, wise & living god. To the powers that give us strength to perform our daily tasks and the resilient, undying American mindset that so fuels our ambitions, and to all who shall hear these tidings, greetings. On December second, two thousand & four, my whole life was forever changed when I was blessed to cross paths with an emotionally wrought young woman named Mellanie Nicole Triplett. I was immediately fascinated by her obvious quirkiness & open-toed feistiness. It was rare that I could go online and come across a decent chatter to spend quality minutes conversating with that wasnt already on my buddy list. I happened upon a yahoo chat room and there she was. My first comment to her wasnt hello or hior even yo ma wassup? To my recollection, it was a borderline insult! We talked for sometime that night, and from that point, grew to establish a very close internet friendship. There was nothing I looked more forward to than conversing with the velvet peach from ATL. I met her during a period of her life where she was very unhappy with the way things were going and was in desperate need of a change. She met me during the greatest moment of uncertainty & transition I have yet to experience in my twenty six years of existence. Through our respective personal quests to make our lives more complete, preferably on our own, we found each other.  On January of two thousand & four, I asked Nicole to be my girlfriend. I asked her on my knees in front of the computer where I had previously confessed my love for her, the vehicle by which our kinship was founded. We were on the phone together, musing about sweet nothings. In all the world, there was only one place I would have rather been, and that was directly in front of her, holding her hand & looking into her eyes as I spoke those words. Twenty six years of living and I had never felt so alive I never had a girlfriend that was such an attractive package, such an unpolished gem with so much potential. It had been almost two years since Id been with someone I truly felt this deeply about. So many avenues of opportunity began to open for I could feel in my soulin my very spirit that it was meant for us to be together. The lord God gives unto His children visions, prophecies of what could be if we trust in Him, and the Lord showed me my wife one night. One night when I was continuing preparations for training at Ft. Benning, hardening my mindset to deal with the inherent dangers before me. I care about her sooo much. To say that I love her with all my heart would be an understatement. Nothing on earth makes me happier than to know that my baby was taken care of & content. The question was would I truly be able to do so, finding myself in the position I was in.  Conversations before & after this night escalated heavily on the subject of sex and its inherent pleasures. At one point, we had come to the mutual decision not to have intercourse for fear that it may in time ruin the relationship. From this point, the relationship itself began growing really complicated. It began with the well documented Valentines Day excursion and has now festered to the point where it appears that the ties that bind have been severed.  Jesus, upon being questioned by Pontius Pilate, responded to one of his queries with the famous verse I am the way, the truth & the light? Pilate responded, What is truth?? To this the scripture documents no response from Jesus. It took me quite some time before I realized what the truth was. Simply put, it wasnt about the manger or the depth of dreams. It was about an individual, superhuman, yet uninterrupted, charged with a mission that was either the most important of all time or just a run-of-the-mill taste of box office candy at your local theater depending on ones beliefs. There is a spirit inside of myself that would like to be called a prince but there is only one son in the monarchy and Im proud to know of him. Elated for his example & cognizant of the inherent disciplines necessary to be a complete Christian. One day Jesus was born in a lowly manger, captured & beaten by his captors, head drooped low as He carried his cross. Hung so high and because of which, mankind has a right to the tree of life. I am not the light and have never claimed to be. All I could ever be is what I was raised to pursue. Anyone that I end up with in the near future will be dealing with a work in progress, who has never claimed perfection yet seeks daily to find & nurture strength. One day I hope to be Nicoles perfect man.  It is with this knowledge that I leave the fate of this relationship, its potential and every pertinent aspect of its possibilities to the woman who would have to deal with my ups and my downs, my victories & my defeats. God has blessed thus far to an extent that I have never known with another human being. I have felt things that I did not know existed. Furthermore, I believe that our greatest strength lies in the stillness of the fiesta, nestled somewhere between the raging silence and the boisterous lauding as the band plays.  I love you Nicole, with every fiber of my being. Every corner of my heart speaks your name. Presented to you this day are a series of words that in time shall be proven. Perhaps we could survive a breakup but such is a life that would have no meaning for me. You are my meaning and my motivation. You are my greatest triumph and my best friend.  As I leave you tonight, I would like to remind the world of the situation in Iraq once more as the 111th signal battalion has nearly completed sending their troops overseas. They are mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, next of kin & someones best friend. Please pray for them and their safe return as surely we are living in the last days. Thank you & goodnight.

        May this blank slate reflect my mindstate. Giving revenerce to states that once were great but now feared. In the midst of confusion I am finding redemption.  ...and in the most unlikely of places. Genesis 4:17 states "Cain knew his wife; and she conceived". During YMCL tonight, it was once again brought to my attention that maybe Adam & Eve weren't the first people on earth. Maybe what they spoke on in English Lit II was correct, that there was a civilization that predates the Bible by 2,000 years (see the story of Gilgamesh). The obvious speculation that the average reader would draw from the passage is that originally, inbreeding from the seeds of Adam & Eve bore the children of the world. Well, one step i've taken in the learning process is i've finally determined that there were people on earth before them, a civilization created that mingled then with this man that God created. These are words i've heard from men of the gospel themselves. What i'm also, and have been aware of from the beginning, aware of is that it takes a strong man of God whose revelations in the word has been directly granted him by the spirit to truly be able to explain this passage to me. I have yet to meet this individual but my spiritual eyes are open and watching. Everyone has questions, yet I dispute not the word. I dare not defy the Word, the works & the will of God but to seek a firmer understanding so that for myself I might know, and for others who may desire similar info...  They talked about the first chapter of proverbs, and of its author King Solomon. Son of David, deemed the wisest man on earth according to the Bible. But this man Solomon, he created according to the word, thousands of proverbs, most of which were gathered together and completely presented in its current form circa 200 B.C. We discussed towards the end the roles of women in the home...a subject that branched out to all persons of duty. Examined a parallel between whom the word was given to and how modern society has fooled itself into a religious liberal freefall that, governed by the mandate of men, has strayed far away from the Word of God!  Whoa...  So post dream trauma talking, perhaps, but i'm truly not afraid to die. I'm aware that the only thing that could live on forever is my legacy. Once I die, what will be left behind? Will there be a world after my exit from this place? Would my passing be one of the last such that, the days of mankind are not long that they should have time to pass my revelations & knowledge down to their sons & daughters? One thing i've definitely learned so far this year is that I cannot control anything but my own fate. Despite the movements of other people, I have to run my own race. Move according to the will & testament that God emparts upon my heart. My love for research has often led me down numerous paths. Lately, it has revealed to me that both Bush & Kerry are members of the  urlLink Skulls organization , infamous secret society / death cult. Great knowledge, I guess...just what I was looking to hear for a man who's desperate to believe there's still some good in the American society...  Last thing I will say before I go is on one of my  urlLink yahoo profiles, I have a quote that says "Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards". Ron J is by no means a finished product but I am striving daily to defeat temptation and be a suitable instrument for the Lord! Not just any instrument, but a great instrument...one that is set apart from the rest and viewed as the standard of godly perfection!  What are your goals?

      I had another dream.......  This one deeper & darker & more prophetic than anything I had cared to feel. I dreamt that at this tender age I died, that there was no tomorrow for me. I dreamt that everything I had left to accomplish was forever left in limbo. I saw the world from the heavens with a deluxe skybox view...feeling empty for all that I could do no longer. Elated that i'd made it but sad that there was nothing else for me. Nothing but eternity. I remember asking God to please give me another chance...there was so much left to do. I have to help my nephews learn about life, love & everything in between. I have to teach them not to make my same mistakes. I have to help God's people here on earth be stronger powers for good in society. Its imperative that I do a good Christian mission before i'm gone! I have to live out my true destiny here, and having escaped death's grasp so many times, it couldn't end that way! No Shakespeare tonight, just fear! So I prayed about it, then I woke up.  Now here I sit. After a monstrous thunderstorm that knocked out power for a time and kept me from literally leaving the yard to go anywhere much less to Calhoun Falls, here I sit. Thankful, but fearful. Cautious to keep my head to the sky where my help permeates.  I don't know where my life is leading. I don't exactly know my purpose. I have prayed for myself, please I ask that you guys pray for me also, as I will for you. When my head gets settled back down & my heart stops racing tonight the world will hopefully then hear of the week past.

        Peace to all the powers that be, and to all who shall read these presents greetings.  I would like to take this time to reflect upon the friends i've made in times past that have in some way shaped the way my life has turned out. This I do partly to remind myself of where I come from, but also to let the world know who has helped form the man i've become. If I leave some people out, look at it this way...yal prolly don't read this journal in the first place lol so...   Kevin, my first real hs friend, thanks for being my partner in benevolence. Tho our paths have led in different directions, i'll never forget the good times. Yea U prolly don't know the first thing about computers so I know u don't read this but hey.  Panora, my first real g/f. Our relationship might have been short but i'm thankful for the good times that we did have.  Cade aka Cackelo, I hated the thought of being around you from day one and now @ day 280 something & counting of separation I still can't stand you. But somewhere between the fights, the disagreements & the standoffs I learned a lot about life and about people. May God watch over you always is my prayer.  J, my partner in crime. You always have my back no matter how retarded my stuff sounds. You're a genuine friend and I need to start mentioning more women cause this complimenting dudes stuff starting to sound gay. Which brings me to,  Tricia...can words describe what your presence meant in my life? Yea...it was a joyride thru the gates of hell. It was pleasure and it was torture. You were the most perfect symbol of what a man needs yet the quintessential demon every man loathes. Thru it all I thank you for putting up with me. Like Cackelo, your legacy is written in the stars.  Laurence, man I wish people could buy common sense. I'd buy you some every month lol until you literally started making sense. You my homie dawg, and i'm thankful to know you. Now about that Tamika thing...  Chad, you've been the missing link, the brother when I didn't have one, the shoulder that I needed to lean on when I couldn't stand on my own. May God bless you and your ever growing family!  To the rest of my college homies including Merleathia, Big Mike, Mrs. Wade, Ryan, Shizzle, Mrs. Blansing, Mrs. Bates, Quanna, Medina, Mr. D to the Izzard, Dr. High, Mrs. Knightner & soooo many others, thank you all for being part of my life and part of my education.   To my host of online cadre, a lengthy list that seems to grow daily, including the good friend Sudie G of Clemson, Jewel of Louisiana, Leafia also of LA, Melissa...also...of LA (all no relation), the chinky homie Martina of Seattle, Diamond Princess of the AUG and to whomeva else i've left out, you're all important and i'm thankful.  Finally to my military friends and my church fam, thanks go out to you also and a big "what's up"! I know that I could not be the person I am without the help of all of you...so thank you all once again & God bless!!!  P.S. Stay tuned to  urlLink  PoJ Online   for all things relative to the life of Ron J.

        I wrote this nice, consice, to the point blog entry only to have my computer freeze on me and now I find myself having to type my content over! Sigh...  But today was a great day. It was of course Father's Day, and for a guy who has no kids, I ended up with 20 bones & a gift bag :-) Altho the money was for services rendered on some computer projects, I was still happy to be a dude on this day.  I also played a selection on piano on program during night service. I wasn't far from the end, which isn't an unfamiliar position cuase in times past, I was often the last performer...but my skills are not even what they were then (& thats bad). But for a song i've neva played b4, it worked out great. I need to watch my speeches tho. Crowds tend to make me nervous, tho ironically I could care less what they think or say bout my whole thing lol. But when i'm in the midst of my craft, I strive to be a perfectionist. Try to be as non-derelect as possible   derelict:   Neglectful of duty or obligation; remiss.   Well look at the time. We'll get up peoples, time to roll.

        ...deeply rooted in a pristine premise, tho the environment was suspect. But I saw her...  I tasted her...I felt her. I kissed her soft, sweet, fully clothed bosom. We laughed, we joked. She was here and we were happy! We were having fun! Apparently defying the odds seeing as tho she stayed here over night. It all felt so real and so meant to be! Was it meant to be? Why couldn't it all just be beautiful and then there would be life? Two persons swimming thru the intangibles of a life flawed, together. Two persons dealing with the stain of loss while holding out waiting on a change to come. Two persons rebelling against a system of pagan economics, dealing with and dealing blows to. And so as not to confuse, I speak of her who was once regarded so highly, whose name resounded throughout the heavens and illuminated an army of dark hearts. I speak of her to whose destiny mine was so inclusively linked...  I also speak of she of whom nothing could have been farther from the truth, whose resolve rested on the shoulders of a man that never stood a chance of giving her what she really needed, but kept trying. Relying on a blind faith in an intuition that spoke words clear as daylight. This thing that I divorced, and didn't look back upon, it has come to me in a dream. Perhaps it was meant to be closure...a lasting vision to quell the bitter taste of a bitter breakup. All I know for certain is,  I had a dream

        disconnected::  I'm young, black, single & ready for the world. I declare divorce over the forces that bind, which makes themselves a confusion unto those of knowledge. With a spiritual mind that seeks fulfillment and a heavenly presence that provides patience, such that experience writes ryhmes with reason for being...and not because I can. Within this frame work of a previously tattered mind I find a consolance. Where men fail with lack of depth & disbelief, my mind transcends in stages and before long, the book of my life is filled with content. I've spent all my time on reason without examining divine will. But as the Lord himself says...   "It is finished," spoke the Lord Jesus Christ some 2000+ years ago, after which he bowed his head and gave up His spirit. (Plz reference John 19:30)  There was war between the goodness of Jesus and the evil one, But Jesus endured all things for us; It is finished; It is done, He fasted forty days and nights, Satan tempting Him with things, But Jesus said do not tempt the Lord God, lest evil it brings.  He is the Son of God, He was here for our souls to save, But Satan was fighting to the end, til all were in their grave, Im so glad I had Jesus on my side, truth and goodness won, It is finished; We shall go now to the Father, through the Son.  All who believe in His Holy Name and accept with the mouth and heart, This Son of the Father will never from your side part, He said it was finished as He gave up the ghost on that old hill, Just as it will be finished for us, if we go to the Father, through the Son, His will.  He was on the old cross upon a hill that day, praying, possibly again, I do so thank Him, as He said it is finished, He paid for my sin, I can now safely go through life knowing I am hid in He, Who said it is finished, when on that old Cross, He died for me.  While He was in the world, all the Father gave Him, He did keep, None lost but Satan, Jesus was safely keeping His sheep, He was the Blessed Shepherd, going against the mighty foe, Even to the bottomless pit, for it to be finished, our Lord did go.  --William Hallmark  reconnected::

        I haven't updated in a while so I figured i'd just drop some text to keep this blog thing in the loop. Its been an interesting past 7 days. On my part, as far as actually  doing  anything, i've done very little. Outside of cutting the grass, catching up with old schoolmates & going to church, its been blah. But its been truly emotional.  The life & times of Nikki & Ron have changed, changed back then changed again & now transformed into something very visceral,   \Vis"cer*al\, a. [Cf. F. visc['e]ral, LL. visceralis.]  2. Fig.: Having deep sensibility. very tentative yet...very binding. There isn't enough time in the day for me to cover all the bases but here are the basics.   The Good, The Bad & The Ugly   The Good She's still in love...i'm still in love... To my knowledge I haven't been replaced yet and this fire that has burned in my heart almost since day one burns brighter than eva now. I've never experienced anything so sensual and so daring & full of promise in my life! Its good to be alive, good to be in a loving, committed relationship....good to have loved & been loved in return...and truly it is better to have loved than never to have loved at all. That being said,  The Bad As all those who can read already know, Nikki & I are no longer together, citing personal development issues as being the core ruse for a split.  \Ruse\, n. [F., fr. OF. re["u]ser, rehuser, to turn aside, to shuffle, retreat It was fine with me, after a moment or twenty of meditation. It felt like all my feelings & all my soul was hung out on the clothesline to dry out completely. No reprieve, no nothing just the end of a journey that was supposed to last a lifetime but ended well short. It was foreign to me how two people who loved each other and had so much in common could not possibly find a way to stay together. Blah blah blah, more of the same on to  The Ugly I'm not going too hard into detail here. Just know that on this day app a week ago, something boiled over inside of meand I had to express it. Express it or live with it and I had to choose the right option. Too much was going by the wayside...too much was spilling away of our relationship, transformed into a friendship, that in its capacity may never work because my love is entirely too strong and I could never bear to see someone else.....take my place...which is in essence a whole other issue. Crap I feel like screaming....  Uglier Its about to throw down outside which is great I guess, if you're into southern humidity. We're not too far from the lake which doesn't help. I have plans to go to Tuesday night mens service @ church...a revelation that doesn't belong in the ugly column yet sits here because my revamped Jeep hasn't been rain tested since I sealed the sunroof leaks. I was drenched the last time it rained, good thing I had on work-type clothes.  Time to downloand movies while playing City of Heroes (again). Look i'm addicted arite! I admit there's a problem. At least I can say thaaat much :-p

        I've been hesitant to post anything from a truly personal perspective online because I know how my emotions get & I don't wish to say anything out of the way. God knows i've done enough emotional damage to peeps these past few weeks, and I know that many of my friends & fam read these postings. But one day I hope to return to expressing myself in my more familiar view, but differently. As time goes on, I have to adjust to the changing world, times, people & events as all men do, and i'm sure my future writing will reflect those changes.  Well on to the latest...  Fantasia Burrino was a guest on The View this morning, she also brought her daughter on stage with her. They look so mch alike! I wasn't a true fan of hers at first...at least, not over Latoya London who in my opinion would have made an equally prominent AI champ. But Fantasia is infectious, has a really gleeful, upbeat, sassy yet classy persona about her. Granted, she has nothing on my girl Tamyra Gray from season 1!!! Then again, i'm biased cause she's the hottest thing since Whitney first came out... I was supposed to go to Columbia Tuesday on a two fold mission: take a family friend back to BC for summer school & meet up with an old music professor friend before he goes off for the summer to teach abroad...but all that fell thru. This previous weekend, after the headlight smashing incident (which I may or may not have posted) on his mothers' Bonneville, they possibly think differently of me now. Estimates on the replacement, even for a used part is around $125. Yeay me...  Speaking of Tuesday, the church went to Royston, Ga. to join the saints at the sister church there in fellowship week. The choir went & our deacons led service, which I guess went well. Wouldn't know 'cause I didn't end up going...so what was supposed to be a bustling Tuesday ended up a bust. They haven't even started showing reruns of Smallville season 3 yet. Guess they're wait until...actually, I don't know what they're waiting on.   I just called Dr. High & he was on his way out so i'm getting back to my long awaited game of City of Heroes. Nyghtrage is level 11 now. Hopefully I can make him 12 within the next 2 hrs!! Peace out & God bless!!!

       I'm just about tired of writing abstract, wordy, visceral posts in this or any blog from now on. Granted these are words i'm saying right now and don't know 'bout the future, yet i've read so many journals that just rant & rant &amp; rant about garbage! This journal is not just about the personal troubles I go through (anymore), its about progression & progressive thought. This journal is my voice to persons who know me not and to those who only thought they knew. It will become the simplicity that explains where sometimes my conversation may seem erratically deep.    &nbsp;  ...is it just me or is it time for some college football lol? 40 more days until Clemson starts the 2004 campaign. I predict a 2nd place finish behind a overachieving Miami squad, third for FSU who for the 2nd year in a row won't be able to stop the roar of the Tigers.    &nbsp;  The YMCL @ church is hosting a Madden 2004 championship tournament this Saturday. I considered myself an early favorite until Earl W. confirmed he would be there. Him & his boy Greg have been up on sports games since the days of NBA Jam. I'm pretty solid in Madden and can safely say that nobody in the church outside of Earl (aka Easy, who very rarely even comes to Mt. Olive as it is) can lay a finger on me. so the real game will be between me &amp; him for the championship. Be nice if I could beat him on my own system...be even nicer if I could win period.    &nbsp;  My CD The Singletons - Pour Out Your Holy Spirit arrived today. I bought it used off Ebay for only 7+ bones...great deal! This album will be getting plenty of spins in my cd player! One of the undermarketed gems of the gospel music fare in 2002, its filled with beautiful, spiritually enriching tracks from the production of Fred Hammond. I give it a high recommendation!    I place the soles of my feet

       My relationship with Nicole broke up or tore open communication holes with several female counterparts. It hindered the potential to see what was really on the minds of a sea of different females during my time at Ft. Benning. It caused me to be on different terms with my most platonic of friends. Even to this day, at least two of them never knew a thing. One tried to holla back in the day and her efforts resurged near the end of last year and&nbsp;but when it was all said &amp; done, I knew sacrifices had to be made and I felt it was worth it in the end.     &nbsp;   Now I find that the sacrifice for love has taken an intriguing turn for the worst. Not so much because of the breakup and the sarifices that were made but because i've received news today that my X is going thru some really rough times. On the one mind, I had half a mind to say "who cares, she dug her own ditch" but that's not in my nature. Well...it is to an extent, but not in cases like these. I CAN'T HELP IT! To think of all the things&nbsp;I said in truth &amp; honesty, and all the things I gave up to be one with the woman I loved. In 6 months, I learned and have applied more about love &amp; relationships than I have in the past six years. There has to be a justice...a method to quench the madness that on occasion rages but every day brings a new opportunity, a new chance. According to her words tho, she might not be so lucky. She says she's really sick. She also says her great grandmother is very sick also. Also says she's losing her job. Apparently a lot of things were lost since the breakup and life for neither of us has been the same.     &nbsp;   I have a problem. I have a problem with someone lying to me. I have a problem with dishonest works in general, be it in love, politics, administrations or wherever. I have a problem with giving someone my heart and watch a deterioration process slowly bubble to a screeching explosion. Such is what happened between me &amp; Nicole and the shadow of a failed union haunts me everyday.     &nbsp;   I have another problem. I hate the thought of being with a woman that smokes (does not apply to Nicole, just saying). I hate the very essence of cigars/ cigarettes and hope they will one day be wiped from the face of the earth.     &nbsp;   I have more problems. I'm often full of crap! I'm conscientious. I'm eclectically inconsistent, often non chalant and sometimes overly judgmental! I'm not in shape! I'm not the musician I planned on being by this age! I'm currently not in my own home yet! I'm 26 and I still live with my mom!!     &nbsp;   They say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well life threw me vegetables so I have to make V8. Most people don't drink V8 and i'm one of them. All the sugar in the world couldn't make me chug that stuff down my throat yet every day brings another opportunity. God willing I will have another chance tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. This same air I breathe, I still hope to share it with Nicole, despite what has transpired...despite how I feel.     &nbsp;   Happy 22nd birthday Nicole. You &amp; yours are still in my prayers.     &nbsp;   .: disconnected

       Now Playing - You Saved Me     &nbsp;   So its official...I was&nbsp;being tabbed.     &nbsp;   Lately i've been doing more sitting around than anything. I need to be working out...used to have washboard abs now my stuff is kinda rounding out. There's a PT test in August and if it were to be taken this weekend, I would fail 2 out of 3 events. City of heroes breaks up families folks, seriously. Its expensive too if you're a college student, which is a significant portion of the target audience. And for those wondering, no i'm not back in college...just saying.    &nbsp;   In other news, drama drama, drama. I'm taking serious consideration into leaving the youth choir for good. Noone's dedication to spiritual, artistic perfection is as strong as mine in Mt. Olive. Outside of my former piano teacher Sis. Diana, nobody comes close. All a guy like me asks for is the freedom to try. To do things differently than how they've been done...to create...dare&nbsp;I say it....CHANGE for the better. Nobody listens to me though, its all political. I hesitate to compare myself to Jesus on  any  level but I remember that even he had trouble ministering to people in his own town. Sometimes (like now), I need someone to minister to me, to keep my spirits strong. To keep me level &amp; spiritual-minded. Perhaps I don't deserve my own choir right now...maybe that is why I don't have one. On a number of different scales I am far from prepared. My grasp of even general music concepts fade more &amp; more each day, i'm becoming disenchanted by the futility of a doomed world, and even worse...well that's bad enough.     &nbsp;   In improving news, I got my Logitech digital camera last week. It captures surprisingly crappy pictures indoors but with adequate lighting outside, it takes pretty decent snaps. Also this weekend is drill weekend and i'll finally be able to get the paperwork rolling on a transfer or otherwise. I'll get to see my worthless drillmates again, my clueless&nbsp;leadership, and...surprise...deal with more politics!! YAY RON!!&nbsp; But seriously, this belongs in the "improving" news column    &nbsp;   In good news, the new website is in the works. To those who have no idea what i'm talking about yet, good. I'm not fully launching and advertising it until its fully operational. But...the url&nbsp;is apparently "hidden" somewhere in this post. Can you find it?

         HMMMMM....  Not sure if I should speak on this or not. Heck with it, it needs addressing. I find it strange that lately, a sea of females w/ ATL ties have contacted me thru yahoo, asking me random things but much of the same. Never before has this observation really irked me as suspicious until a few days ago after I wrote my last entry. A number of people contacted me, apparently from different walks of life but all tied somehow to the ATL, all (most) pursuing business-related ventures, all black women whose ages range from early 20's to 40. All single. All have read my blog or have shown interest in particular aspects of my life. To say that I suspect something would be like saying air is essential and we should all breathe it.  I even ended up blocking one chick whose profile looked like it was thrown together in a matter of seconds. Her conversation was very centralized and all too familiar. Far too familiar. So I took the time to nicely converse with whomeva wanted to talk until/ unless I determine that the individual in question has a secret agenda or until I found something better to do with my time. Like I said in my  urlLink editorial  everything that happens over the internet is suspect. A brother like myself is madd suspicious, that's just how it is. If I don't know you, you are a suspect. The spy organization you may represent? I know not...but I have the tools to find out, so don't push me...  SIGH.... In other news, i've been working on getting my new linux OS SUsE 9.1 amped up. Everything basically works, even the functionality of the THREE network cards I have on my system right now. But guess how many actually  work  w/ SUsE? NONE!!! Guess how many works on windows? ONE!!!!! ONE FREAKING CARD!!! And its a cheapo...well...actually free. Its a pull from a compaq but it works over this Linksys card I bought from Walmart today. I don't fault the cards @ all, its my cable connection. It only properly transmits through certain cards/ devices. Won't even work on my laptop, and it has 3COM architecture. I've heard that 3COM has a 950c card that works great w/ linux but the whole thing, this linksys card prolly works great too, but its just the broadband connection.  Blah blah blah blah blah...if anything, I should have bought a new cable modem. not that it would probably solve my problems but at least i'd be paying less for internet in the long run.

        To forfeit, my ego so she'd know I'd never  But she did  It is with the wake of carnal bludgeonings, filled with an unworldly grief that haunts in times where men have other plans. Where demons flourish & swim the seas of the dead that the world notices a grave, empty.  But from this grave speaks a voice calmly, proudly, with haste. In life, a celebration. In death, a conspiracy. In reality, a mockery, yet not for its knowledge but for its conviction. Convicted of a fervor that was pursued but lost.  Oh Lady Liberty, you celebrate yourself so...relishing in your independence from exterior tyranny. But who is going to save you from yourself?

        A bright crown awaits, HIV is not a death sentence.  ..so says Keith "Wonderboy" Johnson in one of his tracks from the album "Send a Revival". A marvelous, bluesy, old time church style of song, reminiscent of an era long forgotten thanks to today's contemporary whitewash. Inspirational thought perhaps?  This weekend was one to be remembered, as I took a trip to the haunted city of Columbia, SC to hopefully catch up with some college friends. When I left there in the summer of 2002 after graduating from  urlLink BC , I finally said goodbye to a host of unworldly entities. None so prominent as the deva Cackelo aka Mike Cade. Of all my greatest adversaries, he ranks at the top of a surprisingly long list. However in my list of greatest acquaintances, his name is also close to the top of the list. He is to most people what satan is to hell...the embodiment of the ultimate soothsaying antichrist. To others, he is a godsend. A deliverer. To me he was pure, yet filtered, evil. But I took time to consider what my life would have been like without him in it and I see two different Ron's. One of them is a clueless loser who would have lived in a bubble his entire life. The other is a prince. Among the other ghosts in the city are the banshee Ruthie, my first official "stalker", the demon Dr. Swinton and his unholy band of crackheads, and a sea of supporting cast members that include numerous roommates sent straight from hell.  People tend to ask me all the time why I hate that city...and why I hate my alma mater so much. The answer is simple, I wasn't meant to love it. I was not meant to stay in Columbia and make my mark on the world from its bronzed bosom. I was meant to move on, to retain the fond memories but keep in mind the essence of the struggle. To understand life & the people who struggle. To understand that the worlds were framed by a mind more powerful and more complete than any that there has ever been upon the earth. In this haunted city, I wasn't meant to begin my spiritual evegnys, I was meant to learn and to leave.  ...obviously not leave...FOREVER, but definitely not to stay.  I still have some good friends in the city, some of which are mentioned a few entries back. After this weekend was through tho, I think I may be on the road to making a new friend. Only time will tell.  One thing I tried to do was get back in enough time Sunday afternoon to be able to make night service at my home church. Earlier in the day I visited one of the churches Dr. High plays for, a CME church off Assembly and had a great time. During the night service, one of the young brothers in the church DJ wanted to dedicate a song of his to a revered aunt of his that was in town. I was re-writing / mixing and had the only copy, so it was imperative that I got back in time. And I did...time enough to walk into the church & hear him already performing lol. Everything worked out in the end. Looking back, I wish I had put my name on program also. Seems I missed the first half of a very special night and it would have been great to have been part of that.  I also discovered that the Serles brothers have a  sister> ...who looks like a cross between an old school friend and my sister. I'd have to devote another entry to tell all about them. Just know that they are two brothers whose mother married a guy in our church. She did a number on program, and I wasn't blown away so much by her singing...tho it was exceptional...but she was really attractive. Not to mention she was singing one of the last songs I played on program at that! Very cute but very married, which works out just fine I guess. Once again, i'd have to devote another entry to explain why (and its not the reason most devoted readers would think).  This post is actually a rewrite.

       *yawn*    This hello blog thing is supposed to be simple but it looks like a lot of work to be honest. Seems blogger has established a means for people to host pictures on their network which would make it easier for them to be posted in blogs. Ah, maybe it is easier, who cares.      Duties for the week: Finish my nephews' swing set, correct complexities on two computer systems, exercise, save money & pack for Little Rock venture. Unexpected bills have hit kinda hard lately leaving my bank account in flames. If I didn't have a savings account...sheesh! Planning is a beautiful thing I suppose. For some reason everytime I miss a night service at church, a massive sleep overcomes me. I spend most of that evening in a restless, unnerving funk. Perhaps it is because i've trained my mind to ward against such people and their popular fair-weather attitudes. In either event, i'm about to go outside &amp; do...something.      One thing I will say about last week, even though it had its ups &amp; downs, I felt madd sxxy the whole time :p
