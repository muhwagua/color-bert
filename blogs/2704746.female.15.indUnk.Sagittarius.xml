      man i just got home after being up in orange county all day. i woke up at 7 to go to dereks hockey games. it was fun. i hung out with anthony. my dad was working but he ended up showing up in the rigg (4 those who dont kno the lingo, its the fire engine) with lance (my dads hawaiian engineer). it was pretty cool. he was all in his uniform and looking all professional! it was sooo cute!.. lol. but anyways.. after the games, we went to my dads parent's house and then my mom's parents house. it was really sad seeing my grandma! shes not doing well at all. my mom tried to hide it, but she was crying on the way home from their house. i guess my grandma is having some kind of heart thing going on sometime this week and shes pretty stressed about it. its really sad seeing my grandma the way she is... i just hope she makes it out all good. i didnt get to write in this yesterday, but RIP fletcher shawn pederson (yesterday). i love ya.. on a happier note.. me and hayley had a lotta fun at the basketball game last nite. it was hilarious.. seeing some of the guys and how they were acting. it was great! our fav. cheer that they did was: E-L-C-A-M-I-N-O OH OH OHHH GOOO EL CAMINO! lol.. it was cool.. umm well i gtg...buh bye  ~Dani

      hey!! today was kinda fun! school was a drag... but when i got home, i got to back the truck up outta the driveway and put it on the other side of the street!! i was soooo excited! except i was sooo far away from the curb when i had to park it. and i couldnt figure out how to take the parking break off, so it would go very fast. its not that im dumb or anything, the truck ('84 toyota pick up) is a pain in the bootay! i am gona have to drive it for my drivers test (in 10 months) so i best get used to it! 4 months - 1 day till i get my permit! i need to estudiar for it cuz i will not remember every lil detail by the time may 25th comes around. more about what happened today.. me and this guy brad are always joking around. he was in my span. class this year but we never really talked that much.. then we found out we were in the same contemporay living class together so we started talking... then the crazy thing is we sit next to eachother now in spanish. so thats a lotta brad. if he was hot, this would be a GREAT thing.. but hes not. hes pretty cool tho. anyways... he decided to take my seat in the hallway... so i have to walk behind him to get out. i was called up to the front of class to get my Principal's Award (ya i got one of those for academics and citizenship.. go me... snaps for dani! lol) and i tripped over his chair in front of everyone.. someone yelled out "dont trip!".. it was pretty embarrassing but there's no one to impress in that class so it was all ok. haha. OH.. in body dynamics, we played that game where you have a word on your back and you have to go around to people, asking yes or no Qs to figure out who/what u r. well when i got mine... ariel and stefanie laughed. i was like "what the heck could it be?" then they said it had something that really suits me... and guess what it was... lol. I was "Gluteus Maximus". It was pretty funny. But i liked it more than scooby doo (stefanie) and rudolf the red-nosed raindeer (ariel). after school we moved the comp into the loft! which still isnt quite done yet. we have the whole carpet issue.. which doesnt seem to be coming in any time super soon. oh well. ok well i guess i am gonna go.. sorry for the book! lol. alrity! ttyl luv yas! bye!  ~Dani

      I can finally walk normally!!! yay! its great! i have been walking like a retard (no offense) for like the past 3 days. (cuz of my toe!). I almost hurt myself again (!!) today... actually just like 5 min. ago. i was walking down the hallway and i ran into some lamps... didnt she ( my mom) learn not to put things in our hallway? guess not. i better not get hurt again cuz its just too painful! lol. i told shane about that today and i thought his face was gonna blow up or something because he was trying not to laugh. he did anyway but so has everyone else. i dont think he knows how much of a retard i am.. maybe he'll find out sometime.. lol. i got my orlando bloom pics from hayley today!!! they were very very nice. I found out that tiana took one but its all ok. i didnt give hayley one of the the chad michael murray ones. i think i decided that i am gonna give it to her tomorrow. just cuz i am a nice person and all lol. well i just found out from my yankee buddy erin that boone tore a ACL ligament in his knee and might be out for the season! this sucks! i dont kno who else they would have to play 3rd base. i donno if anyone besides me and erin really care... but this journal is all bout me isnt it? lol. jp.. today i started 2nd semester with my contemporary living class. the class seems pretty cool and so does the teacher. Andrew Rumps is in my class tho.. not like its a bad thing.. its just weird. softball peeps kno what im talkin about. lol. dont forget that beach party we had (erin! and teeter!) man... weird times. here are the final grades for the semester: apcp~ B- (weighted) engligh~ B- (weighted) algebra 2~ A- spanish 2~ A chem~ B body dynamics~ A total GPA= 3.83 (CRAP!)   that sucks compared to the 4.17 and 4.0 i had from the past progress reports.. and for those that kno my mom. this wasnt acceptable. im kinda just in the "bite me, i was busy" mode. ya'll kno what i mean. softball had taken over my life basically. but i dont have to worry too much about that anymore. whatever. its all good. ok well i guess i am gonna go. talk to ya'll later! bye! ~Dani

      Hey guys! whats up? not too much over here.. im just about to go and start studying for my chem final tomorrow. speakign of finals... i did really well on part of the alg. 2 one. i got 95/100 on the free answer one but i donno what i got on the multiple choice. Man.. i had to go to softball today to catch for charli and her coach is SO weird.. his name is gunny and he has the worst breath and teeth ever... but no. it gets worse. he comes behind me, cuz hes using me as a demo for charli's pitching, and is all up on me and moving my bat... like with my arms sorta thing. it was scary. then he was like spitting on my neck when he was talking. hes a really nice guy so i feel bad and all but it was still really gross. anyways.. me and charli were on our way home from softball and we saw thee HOTTEST guy in a black truck next to us. my mom like changed lanes and everything so we couldnt see him anymore. it was a bummer. but i ALMOST went up in the sun roof to tell him to change lanes.. instead i just stuck my hand up there.. how boring i kno.. but still. the bummer was he didnt get the message! so that was like the last time i am gonna see him. i think i started this thing where i take a quiz everyday.. and i am gonna post the results on here. so todays quiz was "which orlando are you?" my result was....

      yesterday i went to the softball field and it was really fun. i hung out with david, sar, charlie, and the rest of the people at softball. i was then really happy cuz i found out i could go and see my grandma today. after the fields... sar, char and i went to charlies house and started to watch american wedding. charlie dropped this glass think of taco sauce in the kitchen and it go all over the place! it was REALLY funny.. but it made a real mess. my mom came and picked me up like 5 min. into the movie so i went home and slept. i woke up real early today to go to the hospital to see my grandma. it was soooo sad. the whole time i was holding back tears. i cant explain it.. but just seeing my grandma like that... but no.. it gets worse. on my way out, after saying good bye, i lost it.. i couldnt hold it in anymore. then my mom saw me... and lost it.. then i was hugging my grandpa and HE even lost it! it was sooo horrible. i cried the whole way home too. i just couldnt help but think that that was gonna be the last time i saw my grandma. when i was holding her hand by her bedside, she was holding on so tight and it made me not want to leave. my mom and aunt told me that she doesnt wanna worry me, so she uses all her energy just so she looks like everything is ok. i kno its not.. and its just so hard to face. i am so bummed. i just dont want to do anything. i havent talked to really anyone since i have gotten home. tomorrow is her big test.. after tomorro all hell could brake loose so i just hope that everything goes ok. thats how my weekend was the downhill of fun.  another result!:   You are going to Marry orlando Bloom.

      Hey! Omgosh I am so sorry for not writing in this in like forever. Not like people read it religiously or anything... lol. Life has been pretty nice and crazy for the past couple weeks. Today's my mommy's bday! We have a banquet tonite for softball at 6:30... that should be fun. School's almost out!! so stoked! we get out on wed. We have finals but I got my hard class done today. I had english and chem today. English was easy. All we had to do was read a poem. (Thanks Marie!) Chem, the test was ok.. but if i knew the material a little better, I would have said it was easy. But I didnt... so lovely. I wore a skirt to school today if anyone can believe that. But it was freakin freezin! Brett Johnson was pretty funny when he signed my yearbook. He brought up the memory of how we met. I completely forgot about it until he brought it up. I was standing with Tyler McHugh one day and like i must have been bending over or something. Tyler was all "Brett's looking down your shirt." I highly doubt he wasn't but it was funny to remember it.   *Boy Talk*  So, my bud Marie has been having good luck with boys! lol.. Fairchild I am sooo calling you tonite to see what happened. She's hookin up with the guy she liked. It's Awesome (PG14, if any of ya'll kno what that means). I like the same guy. He's so unbelievably perfect for me... he just doesnt kno it yet. lol. ok well theres not too much more to spill here... love ya'll bye!
