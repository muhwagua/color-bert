       Hi~ Todae went 2 CO pract. Din get to see her dat much. But after practise we had oral practise, so i get to see her again. I am such a failure. I cant even resist staying beside her... cos..after oral pract, i cant even stop myself from going 2 lot 1 wif her to eat... such a failure rite? cant i jus let her go? y mus i expose myself to such danger?  I'm like a moth...forever attracted to the lamp which symbolises her. But...i'm reali happy 2dae. Embraced by pure bliss...(is dat e correct phrase 2 describe my situation?) Hmmz...i dunnoe whether dat is bliss or misfortune...but i'll let nature takes its own course. However, i'll still strive 2 keep a distance away from this 'lamp'. I'll be less sensitive, envelope myself wif more 'protective layers'. rite...haha...i guess i'm becoming more cheerful liao. She gives me life. She gives me joy. She gives me hope. She gives me the will to live. I need her.

       Hi... Today i cried in class...dunnoe why. After recess when i settled back in my seat, i start 2 feel very depressed. My frens and some classmates saw me crying..but they know  that i need some quite time ALONE. Thanks. I appreciated that. But wat i needed the most then was a shoulder for me 2 lean on. But no one was there. I was thinking...why am i alive? The world seemed so unreal to me.It seems to be jus a dream, with all hazy effects and floating feeling...I hate my life... When i came online jus now, Pins tried to console me..but to no avail.  I'm giving up. I'm trying 2 let her go the easy way. But it seems so difficult and the agony it brought me was unbearable. I felt like commiting suicide during recess, by taking excessive panadols. i haf them in my bag, i could try. It wouldn't be that painful..rite? But apparently i did not. Or else i won't be here already. I'm at a lost. With nobody to help me. I might as well just give up living. Sometimes i reali think that the only thing that keeps me alive is  HOPE . But i seem to run out of it already. I feel that the moment i stop hoping, my chest will forever stop rising.  Where is my help?  When will it arrive?  Till then will i still be able 2 carry on? I dunnoe.

       Hihi~ It's me again. I'm feeling quite okay now...or am i not? I don't know, sumhow i got this feeling to shut myself up and don't let neone into my life. "Why?" You may ask....dats becos i'm hurt. I need time. To heal my wounds... as e saying goes : "Time heals all wounds" ( I'm not sure whether it can heal mine anot.. but its worth giving it a try...rite?) About HER, i've decided... i'm not going 2 stick 2 her all the time nemore...she detests me...i can feel that the moment i look into her eyes...dats y i seldom look at her face to face, so that i wun't feel even more hurt. So, i've decided. I'm going 2 let her go... fly into the arms of freedom. (She'll b happy to hear that...) I've figured it out... it would be better to let one out of two persons to experience the pain and agony rather than both of them...and i've chosen. I'll be the one to suffer. To me at least up till now, she may jolly well be my everything, my world, my reason  to be alive. Her presence was so vital to me that she alone could make me give up my 6 years of love for a guy... Powerful, isn't it? Why is it that whoever i cherished will always leave me? Stay, don't leave me. I'm all alone. I'm scared. I'm empty inside. Maybe the only thing that can fill my emptiness is laughter, thats why i'm always appearing so cheerful to others. But i'm sure nobody will know...that deep in the night when everyone is sleeping, i'm crying... To others, i am an optimistic girl. But to myself, i know i am not. Face it, girl.

       Hello...this is e first time i'm writing. i've been feeling kinda sad lately...i'm not sure why... but i'm certain it has sumthing 2 do wif HER. Her actions intrigues me and often left me bewildered and puzzled. Why izzit dat sumtimes she treats me so gd dat i can get so touched dat i may even break into tears of joy? And sumtimes she treats me in a harsh, hostile manner...izzit sumthing which i did wrongly or haf i offended her in neway? Her ever-changing attitude has hurt me countless times...sumtimes, i jus wonder why i still treat her so nice and good. Izzit becos of  wat i said last time? "I treasure you alot, you are very precious to me. I'll be contented and happy just to be by your side..." But why izzit dat nowadays she dun even wans me 2 be by her side? She has hurt me alot even without noticing. I know she didn't mean it in neway...she jus dun realise... I'm feeling miserable... can sumbody ease my pain??

       Hi~ Havent wrote for almost a week. This week i feel very happy. Cos she treated me very well this week. Am i reali such a failure? This whole week, jus after e last period before recess, she would automatically come find me to do 2 e canteen with her. *haha, so fortunate* I feel like we are back 2 wat we used 2 be...but is this permanent...or is this temporary...? I sumhow feel that she knows that i've been blogging...and she knows what i've written...creepy. If not why izzit that she treats me so well out of the sudden? She said that she wants to go JC after her O's...that tells me that she has forgotten our promise...she said she wanted to go Poly with me and enter the same course... Her words had made me give up JC to go to Poly...but now...she broke her promise... That time when she said that during recess, my heart gave a loud "piang!"  (i reali can hear it...) Heart ache sia...that night i reali cry...cry the hell outta me.. Why izzit that things that i can remember she cant? Izzit becos my memory is extremely gd in remembering unimportant things? Can it be considered as a fortune or misfortune? I don't know. Sometimes i wonder if she keep her promises anot..whether...she remembers wat she said beforehand... She doesn't seem to treat her own words seriously...okay we'll stop here relating 2 this topic...change topic. Hmm..yesterdae she sayang my head...so gd dat feeling. then we went outside school to go to e provision shop nearby n buy ice cream and eat. Hao xin fu wor~~ Den we had a nice little chat before returning back to school.she sayang my head...haha.. it feels so nice to have ppl stroking ur head...especially the person stroking ur head is...*ahem* k larz stop here..hope daes after or week after i'm still as happy. Byez~

       Hiyazzz... As usual, nothing gd happen today. That stupid Lump 'O' Shit make my hubby (huimei) cry today. He damn irritating siaz. I seriously wanted to whack him but was stopped by HER and Pins. Before that, dat Lump 'O' Shit's juniors passed me dustpan and brooms so that i can whack him. I was enjoying myself so much that DayangCONG said that i'm making use of this opportunity to take my revenge. Hahaz. But i really got lots of energy to waste...too bad they didn't give me a chance to do so.*sigh* I didn't get to see HER much today...feeling kinda lost liaoz...Chamz ar...in this case...that means that i wun't be able 2 survive without her. What to do?!?!?! I don't want to make myself so vulnerable lehz...but then...can't help it..cannot resist. What a useless bum am i...total failure.....*miss her* Now i know the feeling liao...when that happens...i'll get a warm feeling in my stomach (as if i had just drank hot chocolate) and it makes me feel like i'm in total bliss. *sigh* It sometimes gives you a sour feeling and a queasy feeling when u are sad... terrible... i don't want to be in this state!!!

       Hiyazzz~ I'm in quite a gd mood this few daes...especially when  i managed to console HER successfully. I guess we became much closer after that incident...But i'm actually angry with DayangCONG. He shouldn't have said those things to hurt her...although i'm more siding towards her, what he said is far too overboard. Hu is he to sae someone a bitch? Doesn't he knows that she is a very pessimistic person? What he said will be extremely hurtful to her unlike ordinary people like me. My heart ached when i talked to her..she seemed so depressed when she read DayangCONG's blog. I felt like crying...but my sister is around. He doesn't know that, by hurting her..he's oso inflicting 10 times the pain onto me...MEAN guy. But then, thanks to him, She cherishes me as her BELOVED friend. so happy. I finally made it clear that no matter what, i'm always there for her. She finally notices me. Finally thinks i'm important to her. Anyway, i'm happy that she thinks i'm important to her. Stupid DayangCONG! Bully her again lar...u watch out

       hiyaz... jus woke up...took a 5hr nap. so pathetic. feeling so empty now. sumhow, i got that feeling that OUR paths will only lead to a dead end that saes "stop here". so sad. Life seems to b so colourless.  EVERYTHING  seems to be so meaningless wif little colours (mayb onli black and white...but then, black and white ISNT colours neway...duhz) Am i being too pessimistic? YOU may be thinking:" aiyahz, u think too much liaoz", but i think otherwise. nvm...got not much to talk abt either...craps...  I   G ot  N othing  T o  S ay. i reali need sumone to b by my side to support me when i'm feeling 'tired'. but none is capable of doing that yet...so i can onli struggle along until i can find sumone that can gif me e strength to carry on...now i can onli survive on my determination... every dae pass has taken away an ounce of my energy, sum dae i noe, sum dae... i will collapse... so, i can onli pray that b4 that happens, i'd alreadi found that special one who will support me. *sad*sad* so lost, any directions for me? so hopeless, who can give me hope? so hurt, who can heal my wounds? only the same person that has inflicted them.

       hiyaz... i'm so sad now...feel like crying...even though i knew e answer b4 YP ask HER, i'm still very sad and taken aback... we were never meant to be. Never ever! the truth hit me hard...i noe it...and yet i still let myself get hurt...hu on earth wud b stupid-er den me? On my way home from hospital...i thought of 1001 ways of how to commit suicide...hmmz...dunnoe why... i'm in agony...can neone soothe my ache? i have no mood to study for my exams...much less do my english corrrections...wat shld i do? can God gif me a sign or wat? There is no colours in my life...everything is in plain black and white...mayb dat is a gd thing...or mayb it isnt. Everyone on this planet is an empty shell...a lifeless corpse dat can walks...a machine dat can toks...wat are we created for? where are my goals? where have they gone? I can't imagine myself all ALONE without her...will i still b able to carry on living? Of course i can. No matter how difficult it is...life gets on...be it whether u r in agony...or in cloud nine...life will get going...throwing all my thoughts a millisecond ago into e past. EVERYTHING is the past...there is no such thing present as it onli means a millisecond. Its either past or future...how much 'future' we haf is all predestined in our past...there's absolutely nothing dat can be done to prolong it...in other words, we are jus 'cutting' away our future n 'pasting' it on our past. The total 'area' remains unchanged. Can someone help me? Tears are streaming down in my heart... Mankind are complicated beings...and so it is.

       hi.............. i feel so sad today........i think i know sumthing.....that beibei is actually fond of sumone....(not dat i reali noe...but i can see from her reaction...u noe...i'm sensitive to such things...) I am jealous that he got such a place in her heart...a place stronger den mine...if dat is e case...wat am i supposed to do??? If dat is e case....dun b so caring 2 me...i may not b able 2 take it.......dun show me so much concern...when i'm sick....dun call me everyday....i will not be able 2 take it...pls............................dun leave me alone. dun...... Why is it that those i loved will never love me? Why is it that  those i detest will always fall for me? Why is it that life is such a torture to me? Why. I'm devastated........ Heartbroken....... Lost....... Despaired........ Pain....... Agony.... what are these? Emotions are worth nothing....nothing at all Gurl,  that is the harsh reality of life. that is the cruelty of the world. Face it and stop living in your dreams...its time to wake up.

Simply irresistable. Well...abt her and dat Timpani (dats wat u all call him rite?)...although my instinct TOLD me dat she likes him...now it no longer tells me e same thing...mayb dat was juz a crush on him... but even so...i chose to believe HER lorz...since she told me dat she doesn't like him...i guess...she wunt lie to me rite? after all... she has no meaning of hurting me...rite?  Gurl ar gurl...if its time to let go...u must let go...u alwaez tell others to look at things on e bright side...but can't u do e same? i can't. Cos my world is in sphere-shaped.
