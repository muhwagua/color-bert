      I've had a very momentus week. I just found out today that my girls are giving me a party!! They are so funny because they told me they are giving me the party and where and they said invite who I want. So we are going to Bailey's Bar and Grill for dinner dinner and drinks and pool and fellowship and then we are going to  urlLink Clifton's  in Raleigh for partying and ignorance. I'm excited!!!! I love my friends, they are so good to me.     "I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again"

      11 more days. I had to say my first "good-bye" today. It was very hard and I even cried a bit. Its not like I'm going to be gone forever but still you never know what is going to happen. G is a great person. So patient, so talented, so kind...just an all around good person. Its funny that he things I'll lose contact with him but I don't think I will. People come in our lives for reasons, seasons, and lifetimes...I think that God will determine which applies to our friendship. Safiri Salama G, there will be no colored in stars, okay?  I found  urlLink this site  that is the answer to my prayers!! I've been looking for something like this and finally found it. Last night, I bought a  urlLink camera  (35mm) and a  urlLink portable cd player  . I also got a case for both and batteries. I'm pretty sure that I have everything I need now. I've been on the verge of tears all morning because I am rackin' my brain  trying to figure out how I'm going to get all the stuff I have over there with me. I have more stuff than what we are told we can bring, I don't know what else to do...  I have a busy week planned too since this is my last week in Chapel Hill. Tomorrow-a have my "date-night", Tuesday-Hanging with Tracey during the day and 'Benah that night. Wednesday-Lunch with Shawn, Movies with Wayne, Thursday-Kyoto's with Lessie!!! And I still have to make sure that I have all the paperwork I need and all luggage packed. Its going to be a long week.     "Waiting for tonight...OOHHH!"

      There are times when I'm really glad that I'm anal. I went to the  urlLink Midway Airlines  website and what did i find? That Midway has shut down AGAIN!!  I bought a flight on there Monday night for $44.50 to DC. This is the same flight I will be taking to my Pre-Departure Orientation...and now the hassle is on me to find another flight. The web says that I have to go to the Midway ticket counter print up a paper ticket, then go to US Air and get them to accomodate me. I guess they are planning a merger, but its a headache for travelers. The good thing is, I'm not leaving for another two weeks so I have time to do this. I have my linesister's car for one more day. I have to pick her up tonight so I will literally be running all around Durham today to run errands. T-baby and I are going to the movies tonight to see Panic Room. I hope its good, but its only the $1.50 movie theater so I don't really mind.  I called this lady today who gave me her business card at the Mary concert on Sunday. She said she specializes and braids and natural hair. So I told her I was looking for someone to help me care for my hair...This girl is THREE and has no idea what caring for hair is about. So I was slightly bothered but now I'm still search...HELP if you know anyone.

      I'm telling you...there is nothing quite like a margarita from El Rodeo. Its the best!!! I should have done a million more things tonight than I did but I am going to bed in a short. I'm making a list of "Things to Do" and planning on getting up first thing in the AM to get myself together. Time is passing by sooo quickly. I really need to get on my studying Japanese too. It really isn't very good right now and I guess I'm just going to have to learn by being thrown into it and learn from there.   I got an email today from a guy who got my name from another JET participant. He is going to be living very close to me in Japan. I hope I'll meet some cool people in the next few weeks who I'll actually want to kick it with when I get there. Erica and I will probably be cool, I just think she will be living so far away from me. I'll have the car so...hey..anyway I'm rambling..    "It's so hard to say goodbye, to Chapel Hill"

      I went to the movies last night with a really good friend of mine. He and I have been friends for a little over two years now and I'm pretty sure we will be friends for a long time to come. There aren't many guys out there that you can feel comfortable enough to talk about your male issues or even things you think only a female can relate to yet romance is not in the stars. Its real peace. I enjoy the relationship we have. Its so funny because I thank God everyday for the wonderful folks that he has put in my life.  You know what bothers me? It bothers me when people are not upfront about what they want and they make like small talk was the intention but they really want something from someone! That kills me. I have a student who ONLY comes up to my room when he wants his hair braided. Doesn't speak much when I see and never has anything to talk about unless its that head of his. So recently I've been just telling him no. Usually I don't turn folks down and I don't even make them pay because I like to braid but people who use folks, I just don't deal with.   I got my international student ID card today. I mailed my passport and visa application off as well.  Its official all my paperwork is in.    I've had the time of my life, and I've never felt this way before...I swear its the truth and I owe it all to you...

      I've been away for a while, but now I'm back. I had to take some time out from the computer this weekend to get myself together and make sure my things were ready to be stored. Then come Monday it just seemed like I still had a million and one things to do. I still have a Dr. appt to make but don't seem to be able to find the time to do it.  I was late mailing off my visa application and passport and I got a scolding email from my program co-ordinator today. I did however EXPRESS mail it just prior to her sending me that email so I didn't feel as bad when I got it. I know I should have responded but I hoped to get it there before she would know it was late..eventhough it was due July 12 (oo-oops).  Well, I guess I'll go do some job related work since I've been doing personal stuff all morning.

      WOW! I feel like I've been packing since I got home from work today and I'm still not even closed to being finished packing up the stuff that I'm taking to storage on Sunday. I've only got one more day so I need to get it together. I really wanted to go to the Berkley tonight for the Anniversary thing with Matt and Tracey but I just have been having the worst stomach problems ALL DAY. I figure its best for me to stick around here in case something needs to go down.  Being away last week had my eating off and therefore other things are off schedule too...

      Today has been very interesting. I've been in the office by myself today. I've been back and forth from running errands to getting ice, to picking up checks and finally sitting down in my chair long enough for a long line of students to rush me for their checks!  Well, I like having the office to myself but I don't like having to do so much on my own. I'm not a last minute person but other people's last minuteness (if that is a word) has effected me a lot today. Oh well, not many minutes left till quittin' time although i will probably doing some JET stuff (like filling out my Visa app that needs to be to the embassy by July 15th.) and balancing my checkbook.  Speaking of checkbooks...I'm going to see MARY J BLIGE sunday!!! I'm very excited. In contrast to that excitement, I am also sad because I can't hang out with the Bruhz in Charlotte this weekend. My frat (so to speak) is having their convention and I the lover of Ques that I am will be in Chapel Hill (awwwww) all weekend :(. Its really quite sad...but nevertheless I make the party wherever I may be...    "Nuttin' but a party yall!"

      I've been trying to work through this concept:  Being that I want to feel like everything I have to offer someone is intrinsicly related to me.. meaning i want to feel like what someone gets from me they can't get anywhere else...  how do you know if its a person you miss or the things that you did or don't do with a person  por ejemplo: you talk with someone on the phone just about everyday (this isn't the only person you speak with everyday during the course of the day though) and then when you don't talk to them anymore there is a emptyness.  How then do you know if the empty feeling is not just from talking to someone everyday? What makes you know that it is the person that you miss?  (does this make sense?)

        So much has gone on this summer and there are only 22 days of it left for me.  I've been having a very good time, visiting family, and spending time with my friends. My roomate has really been a pleasure--regardless of the rowdiness and occasional GAS!--we have a lot of fun in 107. Thanks Ms. Kitty!!  I feel like this summer I have been up and down on an emotional roller coaster and I don't think the ride is over. This being one of the biggest things I've ever done in my life, I think a little anxiety is okay.  Tracey has mentally guided me through my M-F work hours and been a big sister to me and I've been her sanity from the insane world of UNC School of Ed.  "What us gon' do?"  La has helped me through a lot and through it all helping me to... "Celebrate good times!" . Da Gangstress has been supportive of all my whining, talking and  "You know, I wonder.... " statements.  My friends and extended family have been so much to my life and given me so much support that I thank God for them being in my life everyday. One of my biggest challenges is going to be not having anyone really to talk to and being away from my folks and black folks in general. I love my black people, and I know they love me back--Gosh, what are you all going to do without me!?   I've been thinking back through the things I've been up to this summer but I'll save that stuff for the 10 predeparture countdown.

      Tis so amazing how God works. The friend I was so worried about in my earlier blog, just had the wake up call she needed to remove her from the unhealthy situation she was in.  He may not come when you want him, but he'll be there right on time!  I was sad for her because she really had to get the awakening in an extremely hard way.  For all of you that may be in a relationship that is unhealthy look for a way out and pray about it. Whether it is something you will like or not, if you believe God will show you the way out. I just pray that she gets over it and seeks some greater relationship.  A relationship that is worthy of her talent, beauty, passion, humor and intellect.  A relationship with the only earthly being that can truly control her destiny..HERSELF.  ... It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishment the scroll.  I  am the master of my fate!  I  am the captain of my soul. --William Ernest Henly

      Have you ever had someone in your life that you just wanted to do right...I mean someone you loved more than life itself and would do anything to help but they just won't/can't/don't get it together? I have such a person in my life and it really stresses me mentally sometimes that I can't make this person see the world through my eyes.  And not that my perspective is that of the all-knowing but it is a little bit broader than the scope of this person.  Lessons: are that which we learn through experience and from teaching.  They mean something to me because I don't like repeating the same lessons over and over again. Some people like to repeat things in their lives and the lessons that they experience do not lead to the same conclusions as mine.  When you experience the same things over and over without fail, you are wasting your time and other people's time as well.  I will never turn my back on my loved ones, there just has to come a time in their lives when they take control of their destiny and stop letting the world around them happen.

      23 is the number for the day. That is the number of days I have left in NC. I have sooooo much to do this week. On top of all the things I have to do, my mom's car broke down and now she needs the car she let me borrow back. She came and got it while I was on vacation. That made me slightly sad because I've had that car for the last year and it is difficult going with out one, but I just keep telling myself that I have 23 days left and I made it without a car for 4 years of college so I'm sure I'll be able to do it for a few weeks.  I'm so lucky to have good people in my life. I feel so blessed daily and knowing that if I really do need something here are people that will be behind me 100% and not bother me about it or throw things up in my face is a good feeling. I'm going through some issues of separation with people I care about but that goes along with the territory. I just want the people in my life to know what they mean to me before I leave this country. Its hard saying "I love you" to people that have almost never heard those words from me. But it needs to happen in order for me to feel okay about leaving. Lord give me the strength and make my words your words...AMEN.

      Well my last big trip before my departure is completed. I had a good time, Got some really nice souveniors for myself not the cheapy stuff like I bought last year, and learned a few things about large group trips that I would like to share...  #1. Don't go on a trip with anyone who is related to anyone else. Sisters especially!! #2. Don't go on trips with folks who have never been away from their significant other for more than a day. #3. Don't pour beer on men you don't know. #4. Make friends with someone outside your group, so you have some place to go when they get on your nerves. #5. Books and bathing suits make a good escape, take plenty.  I have to say, things were not terrible but it was not last year's trip.  We all expected a repeat of 2001's Essence Festival but we had already done it once and needed to try different things instead of trying to do all the same stuff and expecting to enjoy it just as much. I probably won't ever go on a trip with those same women again. Not because I don't like them but just because we were so unequally yoked that it made it hard to chill as a group. Oh well, just another learning experience.

      Today been a pretty good day. Now that Mr. J and I are no longer "seeing" each other, I find myself having much more time to do other things. Not that I minded spending time with him, I am less than a full calendar month (30 days to be exact) from leaving and there are things that need to be done. I saw him today and everything felt really natural, only I wanted to call him after the session and ask what he was doing but that is no longer appropriate so I'll work on packing for my trip.  Speaking of my trip...I'M EXCITED!!! We leave at 7am for N.O. and this is going to be very fun. I have much more vested in this year's vacation because I've paid a lot for it but being away and relaxing is going to be very good for me. I have two books that I'm working on reading and I'm sure I'll pick up one from the convention hall while I'm there. Tonight I still have to pack my shoes/toiletries, shave everything (other than my eyebrows..did that already..thanks cindi!) and straighten my hair. The last item on the list is the one that I am least enthusiastic about because since decided to go natural my hair has caused me some serious problems. Not really problems so much, but it is much more "high maintence" than I'm used to.  I guess I'll get on it, procrastination is only going to make me stay up later and bill an ILL soul in the AM.

      Its wild because I will be leaving North Carolina in exactly one month. I told myself I wasn't going to start a countdown but I think for my own sanity and to keep myself on track I will. Today begins day 31. Eventhough it is the end of the day, it is day 31 none the less.   Today one of my students went to the Emergency Room because he was having double vision...this was at 6pm today and because he isn't in "life threatening pain" he has been there for the past 5 hours. I felt a little bit bad because I should have stayed with him but I had other things to do. I've been back and forth visiting but I don't really like hospitals and furthermore, I just didn't want to be there.  They pay me far too little for all I do for this program.  My friends are so cute. The Texas Thrill is trying to learn Nihongo and says that maybe he might come out to visit me while I'm there. He only talks to me in Nihongo on IM but its so funny because I can imagine him with his southern drawl.

       Letter # 1  to Eboni Teacher from Misato Watanabe 2nd grade Elementary School student (verbatim):  Hello. Mice to meet you, Eboni teacher.  My name is Misato Watanabe.  When is your birthday? My birthday is September 5th.    Letter # 2 from Fuyumi   Teacher, How are you? Me I Happy. How old are you teacher?    These are the first two pieces of paper I was handed in envelopes all taped up with beautiful decorations and stickers as soon as I walked into my first English class today.   I had to teach three classes today. The first was 1st and 2nd grade students, then 5th and 6th, then 3rd and 4th. Fuyumi and Misato did such a wonderful job on those letters they wrote. I was so excited and shocked because I figured they would just be filled with pictures. For a 2nd graders who's native language is Japanese and has only had informal training and not very much writing I say that both of those girls did an excellent job! Also because the other students acted like they didn't understand a word I said or could write down anything.  I have a feeling I'm really going to like this class. There is only one person in the first grade at this school and only 26 students in the whole school! I had a great time today and they made sure I was well taken care of. During cleaning period one of the students gave me a "mini-potato" that she found in one of the gardens the school has. (Yes, they grow corn--and cook it, and many other vegetables)   I used the same lesson from yesterday with this group of students and it went over just as well. Only today we made cards with our name on them and if you lost at Rock Paper Scissors you had to give up your name card. I made some of mine in advance and some with them but all I did was write my name and stick an American flag sticker on my cards. I made enough so that even if I beat the students at the game they could still get a card from me. I gave them NC pencils that I got while I was still in Carolina. They like those too but it was so funny because they were trying to put them in their pencil cases, but the pencil was too long. One student was telling his Japanese homeroom teacher that it wouldn't fit but they way his voice was going up and down and he was so surprised it didn't fit, I fell out laughing.   Shoji (today's school) has chickens and roosters at their school too but not as many as Toyoshige (the one I was at yesterday).  The 2nd graders cleaned up the cage and changed the water and food so nicely. I'm a still slightly in awe.    Afterschool today all I wanted to do is come home and lay down but I didn't. I decided I'd do some cleaning and then I realized that I really hate my living room. Well, maybe not hate, but I really don'tlike it. I want a desk. I'm tired of sitting on the floor. I want a cordless phone, I'm tired of being tied down to talking in the living room or stretching the cord as far as it will go to talk and do something at the same time. I decided that when I get paid in September I am making a home improvement list and those two things are right at the top of the list! I went out to the grocery today because I had to buy myself something to drink at lunch. I cannot drink the milk that they drink because it is just tooooo thick. Its like 3.5 or 3.7% which might as well be whole milk to me and its been so long since I've had whole milk that I just can't stand it.  There is this drink they have here called Miu which tastes kinda like Gatorade. Its one of the best sports drinks over here to me so I went and bought some of  those to drink at lunch. I hope they dont  complain, but I just cannot drink that milk.  One of the old JETs from this area invited me to her house for a sleepover this Friday. I'm not sure how it will turn out but I bet it beats being home alone. I hope I don't end up having to eat my words!  But the one who invited me is cool and a few of the people I know she invited are okay too, some of them are just a LITTLE too high strung for me. I'm a low key kinda girl and high strung and I don't match. I hope that it doesn't turn out to be a huge affair with a bunch of people because I don't do crowds...

      I've had a really good day today. I had to teach my first lesson at the Elementary School and it was also my first visit there. I don't get to visit them but once a month, sometimes twice so today was a real treat.  When I got there, the students were practicing for a school festival that will be held Sept 7th. The principal and I went out to watch their marching band. It was quite good I must say. They have many formations and play all types of instruments including recorder/piano drums, trumpet, trombone, and cymbals. So, they played a song called Fuji-san for me then I did my self-intro and a student responded to me.  She said the best thing about her school was #1 that on a fine day (they say fine instead of clear) you can see the mountain from the school and its very big and very beautiful and #2 that the students were very friendly and so were the teachers.  She was very right! After the welcome meeting I had class with the 1st-3rd graders. I did a small introduction and said Hi my name is...and then showed them pictures. They really don't understand much English at all and neither do the teachers so I try to be short and use few words which helps. The teachers today were very helpful and they understood most of what I was saying since it was the basic self introduction including--  Hello my name is..what is your name?  Response:  My name is...  Hi, .....Its nice to meet you.  Response:  Its nice to meet you too.   So I took each student one by one in front of the class and we introduced ourselves and everyone clapped. Then I taught them Rock, Paper, Scissors which is the English version of Janken so they already know how to play. It was fun and the whole afternoon, they would run up to me in the hall holding out their hand in a rock wanting me to play. These students are so smart and get attached quickly. I was in the teachers room after our English class and 3 of the 1st grade boys came down the hall yelling "Eboni Senseiiiii" and they wanted to show me their class pets which are two rabbits. They were very cute. Then they took me to a cage where they have a rooster and chicken coup.  Then I had lunch with the 2nd grade students and teacher.  At Toyoshige, there are only 4 students in the second grade class. So we had a very intimate lunch. It was nice because their teacher understands a little English and they would ask her to ask me questions. How old I am, how tall I am, etc.  There was ham in the salad, so I told them I don't eat pork and of course they were surprised but then got over it.  After we cleaned up from eating lunch, the 2nd grade students took me back to the cage, but this time they cleaned up the cage. They took out the old straw and and replaced it with fresh grass. The took rocks from the gravel  drive way and replaced those that had been either raked out by the chickens or by them when they were cleaning. They replaced the water and fed the birds. I was so impressed with the way they were so attentive and well behaved when they were cleaning. Like not trying to make the birds holler or throwing stuff at them.  When they were done cleaning the chickens had lain some eggs and they gave me one. These birds are very expensive and lay really good eggs. Each egg sold individually in the store is about 300 to 500yen ($2.50-$4.50) so I was very happy to recieve this egg when I realized why they were giving it to me. I had a great morning at Toyoshige and look forward to going back for the Sports Day in September. I was supposed to go to Tokyo that weekend but there is no way I'd miss their day!  The Junior High school is going to be different because most of the children are at "that" stage when they are ackward and hormonal and its much different than the Elementary school. The best thing for me to do is get adjusted to it and try to make them more comfortable with me. They are very nice kids and smile a lot but I want them to try talking to me a little bit more.  They did some practicing today for their School Fesitval on Sept 14 , which was my alternate weekend in Tokyo but it doesn't look like that's doable either.  The JH 3rd grade is singing "Hallelujah" at the Fesitval. They sound very very good. Beautiful voices only diction of course is off and at this point I just listen. The way to make a good impression is not to come in and critique so I don't. I will do my self introduction for the JH 3rd grade students on Friday so that will be my first day of teaching them. That will be interesting.  Tomorrow I go to Shoji Elementary school, I'll have to modify my lesson some, but that should be fun. I just hope they get the no pork thing down cause I'm not trying to mess with it.

       August 26, 2002  Tonight Mizuki and I went to the Yoshida Himatsuri. Which is also called the Fujiyoshida Fire Festival. They carried these huge and heavy shrines down the street to this community center and then put them  down there. One was of Fuji and one was supposed to house the goddess who protects the mountain. Then after these men, about a hundred or so to carry two big shrines drop the shrines off at the center the they go up and down the street for about 20 blocks (i'm not exaggerating) and light bonfires on wood piles in the middle of the street. Its fantastic to watch. Up and down the streets are also many many booths with different food vendors from squid and octopus on a stick to beef, pig and chicken. They had candied apples and chocolate covered bananas, cotton candy, and some other stick like candy substance.  There was a traditional praying person and some Taiko drumming and women dressed in Yukata and my favorite the little girls dressed in Yukata. I took so random shots of Japanese little girls standing in awe looking cute or whatever. We had a really good time. Mizuki and I had a few Japanese lessons too. I am going to her school tomorrow for my first real lesson. I've been at the Junior High since Friday but I won't have a formal lesson there until this coming Friday. At Toyoshige Elementary (where I'm going tomorrow) they are going to have a Welcome Assembly for me.  I really like the atmosphere of the elementary schools so far because the teachers seem to want to talk more than they do at the JH. They are really busy at the JH so they pretty much stick to themselves. I think tomorrow will be fun!  I found a digital camera that I want. Saturday before I bought my guitar I did some looking around for cameras and I found 3 I liked. I wrote them down and came home to check them out on the net. This one Canon has a great zoom and looks like it takes very clear pictures. They even have some samples in the store. So I have to keep my eye on that one. I'm narrowing it down, but with a purchase like that you can't just go out and buy any old thing.  My days are getting so much better and things are getting much clearer for me. I like it here now that I'm finally settling in. A got a box from my mom today. It was a prepacked box but she put a card inside for me. That was a surprise but made me quite happy as well. This box had some more slacks and winter sleep pants and thick socks which I really needed because it is getting colder here at night now.    Like Scarface said, "Today was a good day"

       August 24, 2002  I bought a guitar today! I'm very excited about it. I'd been saying since I got here that I was going to start studying but now it is truly a reality. Its a nice one too, its black and red instead of the classic yellow color I love it.  urlLink Here's a picture.   While I was out shopping Erica called me and told me that she was going to go to Tokyo to party tonight.  Another JET friend of ours Monique had been telling us for weeks about clubs up there that she wanted to go to and we really haven't done much except explore our own cities since we've been here so we decided to throw caution to the wind and got to Tokyo. I left home at about 7:55pm and the journey began from there...I got to the train station and sought out a parking lot. It didn't have any prices posted but it was not right next to the station I still had to walk some so I figured it wouldn't be that outrageous.  Once I got to the station and bought my ticket (cost 2210yen for the actual fare and 1210Yen to ride the limited express train which only has 3 stops before Tokyo = 3420Yen), I had just missed the 8:21 train so I had to wait for the 9:07. I finally arrived in Shibuya, Tokyo around 11pm.  I'm glad the clubs are pretty lienent about what you wear because if I had worn anything but jeans I would have been very uncomfortable on my trip out there.   I met up with Monique and her friend Rudy. We had plans to meet up with some more of Monique's friends and with Erica so we waited around and watched people. I swear, I have never seen that many people in a city just walking around at 11pm at night before in my life. I have been to Essence Festival in New Orleans. I've also been in Manhatten during New Year's Eve and I promise there were still more people out there last night than anywhere else I've ever been. There were people coming from EVERYWHERE they had vendors in the streets and I'm sure they make a pretty penny. They had Japanese Dreadmen and I even saw these 3 Japanese Dreads, putting wax and rolling someones hair trying to help his hair lock it was wild.  I mean one dude had dreads he could sit on and had some of them bunched up in the cap he was wearing. I saw a girl in Starbucks (yes they do have Starbucks all over) who I swear looked like Beyonce! She was darker than me and had bright blond braids in her hair.  She had on all this funny eye make-up but I had to double take and make sure some of those girls weren't really black. I need to start making some money braiding hair while ya playin!  Anyway to make an even longer story shorter  (too late) , we got the whole crew together at about 12:15 and took taxi's to this spot not far from there which was a Regge club. It cost 2500yen to get in but that covered two drinks once you got inside. One of the bartenders had a straight up fro and of course Erica asked him if it was real and if she could touch it. He took off his visor and let her see it was real and let her touch it. I touched it too, and it felt just like wool. I let him feel mine so he could see what a real fro felt like. Once we got to the dance floor I was completely in awe. You had Japanese folks with the long chains and Hip-Hop style baseball caps on, some had the long multicolored skirts on with tanks who were dancing like they were straight off the boat from Jamaica and the one that killed me was this guy who was dresssed rather Mexicanish with a poncho on and this huge sombrero like hat only it was like the huge ones you might hang on your wall, and he was wearing it in the club. The Japanese are also real heavy on smoking and there isn't a lot of weed here so they just mix different types of tobacco until they get something that simulates weed for them or gives them another type of high. The Japanese Mexican guy had this cigar that was I promise, the length of my forearm. He was just a danger to be around on the dance floor. Either you get knocked around by the hat or burned by the cigar.  They played some really old songs and some newer ones too, but only a few hip hop ones thrown in here or there. I think some of the locals were getting a little pissed with Monique, Erica, and I but its all good. If I were them I'd hate me too.(smile)  We left there and went to Roppongi which is another extremely busy club district in Tokyo.  We stopped on the way to the next club at this Turkish restaurant and had chicken and rice. There was also a very attractive black man in there who I was trying to give the eye but its hard when youare in a big group. It was actually pretty good and also funny to see Turkish people saying the typical (Irashaimase!) and greeting us in Japanese. We went to this club called 911 which for me doesn't have very many pleasant connotations so I kind wasn't feeling it off jumpbut the bouncers there were Nigerians. And they kept telling is how beautiful it was to be black and how beautiful we were. One guy even assured us that he had been in Japan for 6 years and never had sex with a Japanese woman. Only because he loved Black women so much and because of the butt thing. Japanese women don't have any butt was his claim. I had to break it down that not all Black women have "junk in their trunk" either, but it was all in fun and they were really cool. We went down there and it was wack and they were playing this techno/backstreet boys mess that I know I didn't want to make my head hurt so some of us left and sought out another place to party.  We found this club called Wall Street that shocked the crap out of us...I walked in the door and the first thing you see is this scantily clothes Japanese woman dancing on the bar, then you look further down and there are more. The music was like this latin type pace with J-Lo's song "Let's get Loud" if you can call that Latin. The music started to get better, but it left a bad taste in everyone's mouth the shock we experienced upon entry and every time you would look in the direction of the bar. So we left there in search of yet another club. By this time its about 4:30 and the sky is starting to lighten up. E and I just walked up and down and met some military men that didn't want to be label as military men because they are known for starting trouble. But when you walk around in a pack of five and all of you are buff out of this world, we're going to pretty much know what it is that you really do.  The night was winding up and the trains started running again at 5 so shortly thereafter we made our way to the train station. On our way to the station we picked up a stray Turkish guy who would not leave me alone.  E and I were talking and saying bye and he was standing there waiting for me. All I wanted was to be left alone, so I kindly cussed him out and English and in Japanese and he was like I don't understand, I was like "Yes you do, yes you do" he started laughing and finally walked away, but we E and I went our separate ways he was standing on the other side of the entry just starring at us. I'm glad he wasn't on my train.   I bought a subway ticket (210Yen) to take me from Roppongi to Shinjuku where I had to catch the train that goes to Yamanashi. The return fare was another 3420Yen and I had to wait from 6am when I arrived at the train stop til 7am when it actually left for home. I couldn't stay awake no matter how hard I tried so I got a good seat on a bench, put my purse in my lap, set the timer on my cell phone and leaned over on my knees and took a nap. I don't know if the beer and Turkish food weren't agreeing with me or if it was just that I knew I still had an hour and a half train ride home that was making me feel sick to my stomach when the I finally arrived. The seats are very roomy and comfortable on those limited express trains so that made things much better. I set the alarm again for a 8:15 and fell asleep! When I finally got to Kofu and to my car of course I had to pay the attendant and it was 2900yen. This was a very expensive night and I love Tokyo and all but there is much to be said for staying around Kamiku and enjoying the simplicities of life.    "Oh, what a night...doodoo..doodoo"

       August 23, 2002  Today was my first day of school. I got to the Junior High at about 8:15, 15minutes prior to the time I was expected to arrive. Its very rude to be late in Japanese business places so I try to be on time eventhough it is not something I'm used to doing when it comes to work. But I had prepared for the first day of school for a long time so I didn't mind being ontime at all.  I said my welcome speech that I used at the village office a few weeks ago with the staff and with the students when they got to school.   Before the actual opening ceremony the students arrive in the front hall, change shoes and we teachers stand in the front and greet them as they come in. Its actually very intimate and personal. I like it. So then we have the ceremony and the Principal makes a few speechs and the Vice Principal and a few of the students and myself. After I give my speech one of the students comes up and does a response to my speech. He is so cute and nervous that I tried to calm him down but he just kept taking these huge deep breaths in the microphone and the whole gym was laughing. He did a great job though but he just would not stop heaving!   After the ceremony they have clean-up period for about an hour where the whole school students and staff all pitch in to clean up the school and grounds. Its a great thing, working together and they play this really loud Japan Pop music over the loud speaker while they are cleaning! It was big fun, although they won't let me help them much.  Since it was only a opening ceremony day the students left at 12pm and the teachers stayed until about 3:30. I didn't really feel like I was under much pressure because I've done my speech before so that wasn't such a big thing. I am supposed to be teaching classes next week so that is when I think the nervous is going to come in.  The staff a Kamiku JH is very nice, but they are quiet to me because I don't speak Japanese just like I'm sure they think I'm quiet too because I don't say much around them. Its only because they can't understand me for the most part anyway.   School is going to be fine. I just need to get the students acustomed to me and how I do things.

       August 20, 2002  I'm cramming three days into one journal entry so here goes:    Tuesday   was the first day of our Yamanashi orientation. It was great. We met the Superintendant of the Board of Education and the Tresurer of the prefecture.  I had lunch with a lovely and genki (energetic) Japanese man who told me over lunch about his adventures in the Midwestern United States. How he loved driving because of the open roads and wide highways and about a conversation about religion he had with some folks that kept talking about Bubbles. He later found out they were saying Bibles with a country accent. We had a hilarious engagement about that topic and he assured me that my student would love to hear me immitate a southerner in class one time.  After lunch we went to Shodo lessons. Shodo is Japanese caligraphy. It was fun, but I'm not very good a balancing the characters...which is something that carries over my regular life and issues with balance but that's a different topic all together. Our sensei (teacher) showed me how to write my name in Kanji. I wrote some other things too, and over all made a mess on some of the sheets but had some good work to take home with me (including the one he wrote with my name which is beautiful). That night we had a welcome dinner party and after that the group split up and some of us went out to different bars and such. It was cool because it was actually the first time that I've been here and been able to drink.  really didn't think I'd make many friends at the orientation because I tend to be kinda stuck up, meaning I don't really want to hang out with any and everyone, and my personality is that that people aggravate me easily if we don't click...so I just would rather wait until I actually could kick with folks I can tolerate and that can tolerate me. I'm glad I found those people!!! I'm always driving but this time we were walking so thank goodness for that! I learned to play darts, had an interesting conversation about the zodiac, and an even more interesting convo about the squatting pee toilets where each one at my table (8 of us) got up to go pee (at different times of course) so that we could share how each of us actually did the squat thing. It was the funniest thing I've seen in a while! We had quite a bonding experience and I actually got drunk in Japan for the first time!    Wednesday   was field trip day. First thing in the morning we got up and ate a piece of toasted bread. A two year old's bowl of corn flakes and a slice of watermelon. So of course we all sought out the nearest by convience store! Too bad for those who got up late and thought we were going to get a repeat of the Tokyo orientation food.  We got on a bus and went to Rokugo where we had a Hanko making lesson. Hanko is like a signature in Japan. There are different types of hanko but on offical documents you need a hanko and not a signature.  The sensei picks out a Kanji that contains syllables in your last name and designates it for you. Then you carve out what he has drawn on this marble like stick and then you can use it as a stamp. Its quite difficult and like everything else in Japan there is a specific method for doing it which if you mess up you ruin your hanko. So needless to say, the sensei did most of mine for me! Its cute though and my Hanko character is "Su" which this particular kanji means Bird's nest.  After Hanko we went to lunch at a restaurant where me and 2 other ALTs were the last to eat because we were eating vegetarian. Everyone else had some pork dish, and they had ordered 3 meals without pork which ended up having us wait until all 40 other people had eaten. By the time the food got there, everyone at my table was done, but it was a pretty filling lunch. From lunch we went to Minobu-san or Mt. Minobu. Which is the mountain where Nichiren Buddism was born. Nichiren Buddism is the same one that the neighbors behind my house are and Tina Turner and Jackie.  We climbed 287, 1foot high stairs. That means each step was a foot and we did 287 of them and I had on sandals and a jean skirt! Talk about a tired Black woman! Anyway, so once we did that there was this fountain at the top where you were only supposed to wash your mouth out and spit out the water. They don't tell the thirsty/tired gaijin (foreigners) anything until after we are drinking down water. Oh well...so then, we went on a tour of the temples on the mountain. It was so beautiful and very peaceful up there. I am trying to figure out how far it is from where I live because it is a nice area to spend an afternoon. Not in the temples or praying to Buddah or anything, they have many trees and benches where you sit and enjoy the serenity of the mountain. They have these two fish ponds that have huge eel looking fish that are multicolored. I was nervous about taking pictures inside the temples so I only have pictures of the outsides but those came out good as well.    By the time we got back to the hotel I was so beat from the climb that I took a nap. Then a few new friends and I went to an Indian restaurant. I ordered something that looked familiar which ended up being Chicken Tikka--tikka in whatever language Indians speak--means hot. I like a jerk, didn't ask or know I just ordered something and had to eat bread, cucumbers, and yogurt with my meal to calm my tongue down.  Everyone felt sorry for me, but that's what I get. It was very good, but just a little too hot. From dinner we went to Karaoke. Karaoke is a Japanese FAVORITE! There are more Karaoke bars here than there are liquor stores in Black/Latino neighborhoods at home and you know that's a lot!  The room we went in was very big and old JETs and new as well as some other gaijin who live in Yamanashi all came it. It was 3000 yen for Nomimonohodai (all you can drink) and 3 hours of singing. I only got up there once to sing "Dove's Cry" with Kai and Kris which was funny. A good time was had by all. Oh..and I almost had to knock some sense into this Japanese dude who touched me in my face. I thought he was just being drunk and friendly like cause he was talking close and then he crossed the line when he put his hand in my face. I had to walk away and he was coming my direction still! I think his friends had to tell him to move along and I'm glad they did cause that's not how I want folks to see me, but there is a line between ignorance and borderline "you bout to get your @$$ kicked!" The night ended well and I went back to the hotel to sleep off some of the nomimono.    Thursday   we checked out of the hotel and went to our last morning of orientation which was an absolute waste of time. I told them so on the evaluation form too. Not one thing they talked about in that 4 hours was something I didn't already learn at one of the million other orientations we had. I basically played with my phone and talked..kinda rude but hell, I got the job now.  When the conference was over my supervisor picked me up and took me to lunch. We had a breakthru I think. We talked in both broken English and broken Japanese but we talked. We went to a Italian restaurant and the food was good there. I'm determined not to let this communication thing get to me, and he seem to want to talk to me too so that was good. After lunch I went and picked up my salary and then to the Junior High where my English Teacher told me what to expect for Opening Ceremony tomorrow and what they wanted me to say.  Action packed 3 days and now the summer vacation is officially over. Tomorrow I open a new door to being an actual teacher.    Welcome to Junior High, huh?

      Two things about Japanese culture that I  WILL NOT  get used to:   #1. Slurping!  They slurp tea, coffee or anything else hot that they drink. And they slurp noodles. It kills me. I really want to leave the room when people are eating like that. I guess it was such a big pet peeve of my mother's and now it had rubbed off on me.   #2. Whining on the phone.  This lady sat in the office and whinned for what I know was a good 45 minutes. Its like the roach thing in people's houses. I'm looking around the teacher's office like "Doesn't anyone else hear this?" And everyone is busy and working like nothing is wrong. All I can hear is "hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm" It was killing me I swear. I was praying for someone to strike up a conversation and say something just so I didn't have to hear "hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm" There were no words just "hmmm".  My salary situation is worked out. I get paid this Thursday. I knew it wasn't going to be a big deal. Watanabe-san and I just were not understanding each other well. I'm glad my JTE is back though so we won't have to worry about these kinds of breakdowns anymore.  I go to Yamanashi-prefectural orientation in Kofu tomorrow and I'll be there until Thursday afternoon. This is where I'll be able to find out about things going on around this area non-school related. I want to really learn tradional Japanese dance and some type of instrument. I'm really into music and my supervisor knows that so I've got him on the lookout for some type of lessons. Even if I have to take them with the students. I also want to enroll in a Japanese Conversation class. This should prove interesting but I am looking forward to improving my communication and language skills.

      I was actually on my way to bed but I HAD to come talk about this!!    So, I'm getting ready for bed and I went back in the bathroom to brush my teeth and I hear this singing...it was weird because its like 10pm here and it was kinda loud. So I go back in the livingroom and turn my music down and the light off in the kitchen so i can both hear and see better. I know I'm nosy! So anyway, I look out and the singing is actually chanting. There is a house directly behind our apartments and in that house I see these folks rocking back and forth. Then bell chimes every now and then and I hear "Nam yo ho renge kyo". I've never met the people that live in the house behind me, but I guess they are Buddists. I feel like dork for being like "wow, buddists" but I guess that's how I feel.."wow, buddists" not Tina Turner and Jackie from  What's Love Got to Do With It.

      I was slightly disappointed today when I woke up around 9 and the sun was shining. That meant the Typhoon didn't hit early morning and I could have gone up to Fuji. The thing is I'd rather be safe than sorry so I'm not as disappointed. Since the storm didn't come I decided to go to the grocery store. That's always a day trip in itself. Traffic is always terrible on Sunday afternoon so I'm definitely going to have to find another time to do my shopping.  I decided to park some where farther away and walk but I really regretted my decision when I came out of the store and it was pouring...Anyway, I found Salad dressing and lettuce this time so I was excited about that   Tonight's Movie: Jason's Lyric. I only brought a few movies with me so I'm trying to space out how often I watch a movie. I'm glad I watched this one tonight. I hadn't seen it in a while and its is a great movie if the terrible southern accents don't distract you from the message and them of the movie. It such a sweet and real love story to me. As well as two of the greatest love scenes i've ever experienced in a movie. Makes me kinda nostalgic of having a love of my own but that's another blog for another day...  We are at such a high elevation that when it rains I am actually walking through clouds. I don't think I've ever been this high before. I know the neighbors thought I was crazy standing in the rain taking pictures of the clouds and the river in front of our house, but hey, I felt like capturing the moment. If you walk outside in front of my apt building there is a major roadway Rte 358 and directly on the otherside of the road is the Ashigawa River. On the other side of the river is a mountain that seems to go straight up about 15 stories or so. Its amazing. Behind the apt is the same thing, there are maybe two houses behind mine and then straight up mountains. Its beautiful I swear. I can't wait for the winter to see how wonderful it will look. They said it gets pretty cold here so maybe I can wait for winter.    "when love calls, you betta answer cause it might slip away and love may not ever come again"

      I got my cellie! I got it from  urlLink AU  which stands for"Always Unique". I got this phone that has Global Passport on it so that if I go away on holiday (vacation) or come to the US for a while I can still use my phone and people in Japan can still call at regular rates for them too. This is  urlLink My New Phone  I got the pink one. Since I had to go pick up my phone today I had to go back down that winding trap they call Rte 38. I don't see how they do it and people really fly down these roads. Today on the way home from Showa-cho I passed (meaning pulled over and let them pass) at least 3 cross country type trucks. If you could see what these roads look like you wouldn't believe it cause I know I don't.   No Fuji-san for me tonight...there is a typhoon coming first thing tomorrow morning and my friend Rob who went last year (when it ended up raining) told me that going up there when they are expecting rain is not even what you want. There is one more weekend left in the Fuji Climbing season so I'm going to try to go up there then.  Today's been kinda boring but Zane makes the dullness a little better. Until tomorrow...

      Another day in Kamiku.  There have been new developments with the Mt. Fuji experience. Originally we were supposed to walk the mountain during the first part of the day 8-4pm but a friend of mine told me that its too hot to do all that during the day, so I should go with the group that has planned to go at night.  At this point, I plan to spend the night on the mountain. We are supposed to meet at the fifth station and hike to the top from there. Spend the night at the top and watch the SUNRISE!! Gosh doesn't it sound like something out of the movies. I have to take 2L of water, some snacks, fruit, warm clothing (layers, hat and scarf--which I have none of) and of course my camera. I plan to bring my Zane book "Heat Seekers" which by the way is excellent and some stationary to write a few letters atop the mountain.  I'm excited about it and I'm sure I will have a million things to say on Sunday after I rest from not getting any sleep.  I wasn't able to by my digital camera today because I didn't get paid. I went to Watanabe-san to ask him about my pay and he said I won't be paid until the 16th of next month. We couldn't have a very in depth conversation because of course he doesn't understand English. So I had to wait until I saw Mizuki to tell her about it and see if she could explain/ask him what was up with that. I came home and found a letter that my predecesor had written making sure I didn't have the wrong date in mind and this is what it says verbatim "You will receive your first salary on August 16, and from then on you will be paid on the 16th of every month.  You receive your salary as an envelope of cash that is handed directly to you at the village office." I have a copy of this to take to the Yakuba when I go in on Monday...I actually was wondering if anyone is there tomorrow because I will go to the accountants office and see if the money is there myself. I'm good for now, but I know I can't last another month with bills etc. on the money that I do have. No worries though, cause Watanabe-san will straighten it out I'm sure.  So today my big deal was going to be to get a keitai right...well I'm so glad that I went with Mizuki. The phone I wanted that has global passport (I can use it in the US) and is cute and has email etc...well it was 9800yen in the AU store I found in Kofu...Mizuki took me to another store some where near Totomi-choa nd got the same phone with a fairly reasonable plan for 5800yen!!! Woo-hooo! I'm excited! She helped me fill out all the paperwork and wrote my address in Kanji for me so I was extremely greatful. The didn't have the phone in stock but I will go back and get it tomorrow afternoon. She even took me out to eat after we left the keitai-shop.  I met Mizuki at the Ashigawa (train) station which is actually in the Mitama-cho. You can get to Mitama-cho on Rte 38 which you get as you are leaving Kamiku and go off to the right so you are driving actually right next to the Ashigawa river (which is in front of my house). Well anyway, needless to say the side roads of Japan are extremely narrow, but when I say narrow, I mean like a Ford Explorer would be from white line to white line on this road and they are TWO-way streets. The scariest part is that people drive fast on these little roads but I woman like me will give them the right of way everytime! I just pull my little car to the side and let them have it. Its so funny because there are parts where you have your own side then they dip down to a one lane (two lane) street that goes right through what looks like someones front yard, literally. Now I've driven in the country, on dirt roads, on rocky roads, but there is nothing quite like this I promise. I had to leave her at 6pm because I wanted to get home before the sunset. The river is quite beautiful from the road and I bet its even better from down on the rocks. I'm going to see if some of my Junior High students will take me fishing. I know my dad would flip..I know me fishing right, but hey you only live once and you know my motto :    "When in Rome...do as the Romans do"

       Gas stations in Japan:  NUMBER ONE:  Don't get out of your car. Its self service.  NUMBER TWO:  Pop the gas tank, NOT THE TRUNK! (stupid!)  NUMBER THREE:  Bring large bills. It cost me 4600yen ($40) to fill up a 1991 Toyota Corona..Imagine what an SUV might cost!!!  NUMBER FOUR:  Wait for the attendant to STOP traffic for you before you pull out into the street. I swear there are rules to doing everything around here and I seem to violate them all. But hey, how do we learn if not through trial and error when you can't understand a THING they are saying to you.Ya know, just when I think I'm getting the hang of things...I go to the gas station and I'm back to feeling like a foreigner. That's okay, because I AM a foreigner. I'm an immigrant as mom would say.  I went to McDonalds tonight for dinner and the manager knows my face now. I'm probably going to eat there at least twice a week. I'm still new to the cooking thing. I don't think I can do it everynight. I told a friend of mine today that I'm going to be "wife material" when I get home, but the more I think about it...no one has TASTED the food but me! Shoot...I like anything as long as I can eat. When other folks are eating your cooking there is a big difference between good cooking and edible!  My boy Reg, turned me on to this website where I can order CDs and they don't charge any shipping and handling. They are some really good mixed CDs- urlLink Soulman's World of Beats . I'm going to get a few of them. One I already heard before and this DJ has every song that was ever sampled its great! I hope that the other two I want are as good as this first one.   Times are tough when the only English speaking program on TV is some interview with Francis Ford Coppala. I'd almost rather be listening to Japanese people talk about stuff I can't understand or watch those cutesy cartoons. I think I might tape some to bring home with me. I've been watching the "Sesame Street/Barney" type shows that speak in simple Japanese. I can understand a lot of the dialogue and I'm learning new stuff with the kids. I actually sat and watched some little Christian cartoon where this white guy was singing "Michael row your boat a shore" I was cracking up as I was watching it. Christians are so funny, I mean I am a Christian too but I swear some Missionaries will try to sell a shoe to a shoe salesman ya know? A country full of buddists (that's a generalization) and totally in tune with nature and spirituality and you want to convert the converted...its wild. I guess I just haven't come to grips with the whole foreign missionary thing..but I have totally digressed. Michael was rowing his boat...yeah, and I was laughing and trying to keep myself from changing the channel. (like I had some options) If I see Big Bird on TV here I'm calling PBS!    "Who are the people in your neighborhood...they're people that you meet each day."

      This week has gone but much better than last. I guess its because I finally got my internet in my apartment so I can catch people everynow and then and I've been able to email people so that is making me feel much better. Maybe it also has something to do with this new attitude that Erica helped me realize...who knows I'm just glad that things are going better.  I got my alien registration card today so now I can go get my keitai (cell phone). Mizuki is going to take me tomorrow afternoon. They have this company called AU that I'm going to get with. I saw a phone I liked when E and I were in Tokyo. They have the same one at the store down here so I'm going to see what that is all about.  Mizuki has a j-phone with a digital camera on it! I was totally shocked when I saw it but she has pictures of her dog and some owl that her friend has (yes i did say owl...don't ask)! The pictures were so clear and she can download them to her computer too! I don't need anything like that though just the basics...cute ringers, cute color, email and I-mode. Its like a two way. No one really talks on their phones they use them mostly for two-waying back and forth. The best thing about this company is that they have a bilingual hotline for customer service and its a bilingual phone so I'll be able to understand the commands and stuff.  This is going to be a real experience trying to explain to them what I want. I'm glad Mizuki can go with me.   My hair is officially off the chain. I've been wearing my hair nets but no one here seems to care. They are cool with it. I don't know if soon I'm going to start seeing my students with nets on!  My hair is getting longer and thicker. I know its only been about two weeks since I got it cut but its really growing. My predecesor told me about this Japanese guy in Kofu who does hair at a shop near the Eki (train station) who spent like 10 years in London and speaks perfect English. She said he even has a little British accent if you can believe that. I don't want to real cut, just a trim and if he can rollerset it for me I'll see how that works out. I don't know though, I have to give my self a little time before I subject myself to the Japanese hair dresser experience.  I want to be here for at least a month before I have to beat someone down for tearing my hair up, ya know?  I watch the Kangs (Kings of Comedy) everyday! I'd already memorized it before I got here now I sit in my Tatami room (just a name for a room in the house that has tatami mats instead of rugs) and act the mess out! Its just too much. But it helps me laugh which is something I really need now that I've separated from the other musketeers.  Ced has got to be my fav though. Someone told me that he is coming out with his own show this fall and I am SOOOOO SAD that I won't be there to see it. I was excited about Bernie's show but he is much better at stand-up than he is at primetime. I mean..Ced this is why he is just my fav:    "That boy made all that money and his curl NEVER (pause) never...quite...it never quite curled all the way over."  "This ain't Chinese, This ain't Tai-quanese, this just straight up Nigga Please!"

      Tonight I went to this town "Udon" festival. Its a three day long thing and tonight was the actual homecoming. Its a festival where people take three days off and go to where ever they are from (kinda like Homecoming in the southern church). It was nice I saw some of the students that I had met this and last week. They are so funny "E-bow-ni sensei"! they are so cute. So I donated some money to the little tag sales they had and danced a little bit with some of the town folks. I was met the couple that lives upstairs from me. They are so cute! We walked over to the festival together. The minute I get there the Vice-superintendent hands me some meat on a stick and a beer. He doesn't speak English either but is like, "Biru o nomimasuka?" (Do you drink beer?) So you KNOW my response..."Hai, Hai" (yes, yes) Its rude to turn them down so I've realized that I'm just going to have to eat whatever and drink whatever unless it starts to make me deathly sick.    Japanese has a lot of line type dances that they do in a circle. They are really repetitive and easy to learn. I'm excited because I think the principal is going hook me up with someone so that I can take traditional Japanese dance lessons. That would make me really happy. I met a few more of my students tonight and I met this guy Yamazaki. I am not sure if he was just being friendly or trying to holla. He barely knows English, but he came with the age old line "I can teach you Japanese, You can teach me English" It was so funny.  They had a small fire works display after the festival ended. I felt like I had to go home early because #1 I had four beers and was feeling giddy and #2 It was 9:30 and I had been there for a while. I took some pictures of the traditional drummer and the folks dancing and some very cute pictures of my elementary students in their summer traditional dress. Its like Kimono but not as heavy and its called Yukata I hope they come out well.   Getting out of the house is very good for me and good for them to see me around. Since I'm in the countryside many of the folks look my complexion. I don't look Japanese but they don't think I'm black either.  One of the older ladies in the village came up to me at the Udon and asked me where I was from (in Japanese of course)...she thought that I was partially Japanese.  Most of the people are very nice and they remember me already. I've been to the post office a few times and the Postal worker I usually deal with wanted me to come over and play the game he was running. I am having a hard time remembering names which I hate, but they speak so fast.....! Well things are looking up. Thanks Erica for making me think again about my attitude and adjusting it. I have a little more than a week before school starts and I'm going to try to utilize every minute of it to make my lesson better and Japanese stronger.   I've been watching tapes of Steinfeld that my predecessor left in the apt. I never thought I'd be so happy to see commercials. Its great! I just like looking at TV that I don't have to try to translate...if anyone out there wants to send me a few hours of English TV feel free!!! Just let me know and I'll send you my address...    "The sun, has gone to bed and so must I.."

       I forgot to post this the other day so here goes:  August 10, 2002  What an adventure I had today. I didn't leave home until around 2pm. I intended to go to the shopping center in Kofu to go to the Hyaku-en shop (its like the $1 store in US). Well I call myself following the map that my predecesor left for me and ended up on a side street that was barely big enough for my car and it was a TWO WAY STREET. I couldn't believe it. I'd heard of these streets before, but never been on one.  With the smaller Japanese cars, its not quite as bad as it was for me, but the car I'm driving is about the size of a 92' Honda Accord. Its actually a Toyota Corona (yes you lushes, like the drink). Then after finding my way off that tiny street I traced my steps (so to speak) and went back the way I came. The next time I find myself on a highway, little do I know I'm going the right way this time and drive right past the shopping center! URGGH! But eventually I arrived at Gran Park and did my shopping.  They have this store here called Uni Qlou that is very much like the GAP only...its not. They had a GREAT sale, but I resisted and just bought what I'd come there for: Groceries and stuff from the Hyaku-en shop. I bought lots a cute stationary today, some more postcards, a few clocks for the apt, and a broom that doesn't make me hurt my back while cleaning the apt. I really like the Hyaku-en shop. Its much better than the store we have at home... cheap stuff that doesn't really look as cheap.  When I got home tonight after putting away my things, I decided to COOK. Yes that's right. I, Eboni Staton, have become a cook. Well let me tell the story first then you decide. I have a rice cooker so I put a cup of water in there and a cup of rice...that cooked itself and whistled when it was ready.  Then for the main entree': Chicken! I had cubed pieces of chicken that I seasoned with garlic, pepper, salt, and a little bit of kikkoman soy sauce. After taking twenty minutes to light the stove, and calling a friend and asking a neighbor (I really couldn't figure the thing out!) I cooked my chicken and added it to the rice. Tah-Dah! My first home cooked meal. Of course I had more meat and rice than I needed so I'll save the chicken until tomorrow and throw out the extra rice.   Its pretty lonely here. I guess I've been saying that for the past few days. And all people can say is "You are having an experience of a lifetime". And its not like I dont know that or that I'm complaining, I'm just telling of how I feel. School hasn't started yet and there is no one around really. When you are a person like me who is used to being around people all the time, or having someone to call and speak with regularly its hard when that isn't the case anymore. I love that I'm here. The countryside is beautiful, the air is clean, and the people are friendly.  But I'm very far away from home and those same emotions I was feeling anticipating this move are okay to feel now that I'm here. Especially being that now I'm totally alone. I just have to get adjusted...I will be just fine.    "I'm lonely, I'm Mister Lonely...I have no-body to call my own"

      I fried CHICKEN tonight! I'm getting good at this cooking thing. I'm only working on the meats right now so I had a simple chicken noodle soup to go with it. I know that doesn't sound like it goes together but it was actually kinda good. I'm surprising myself on how much I know how to fix from just watching. My mom would be totally amazed. I came home at lunch and took out some chicken wings. When I got home after work I made a little flour batter with salt, pepper, and some garlic (which tastes great believe it or not) and mixed that in. Then I washed off the chicken and salt and peppered it and put it in the flour stuff. Then I fried them up. It was very good! I haven't decided what to make tonight, but I do want rice. Thank goodness for the rice maker. That in itself was a blessing sent from above!!! If I had to figure out how to make RICE...wow, could my mom tell some stories about me boiling water!!!  Communication problems and all, today my Superintendant gave me two large pears (nashi)! They are like large grapefruit size and kinda hard but I cut one of them up for dessert tonight and it was quite good. I think the other one will be better once it softens up a bit. My supervisor Watanabe-san was not at the office today. The other three guys, The superintendant, vice superintendant, and some other guy I don't know his position were the only ones there. I got a lot of work done.  I've been cleaning out some old Jet stuff and throwing anything away that doesn' t have a match or that is worn out looking. There is a lot of mess that looks like it has been in there for a long time and I can't take all that.  I know more about North Carolina now than I ever did.  I have this one book that basically says, North Carolina was originally Carolina (latin for Charles--some explorer) then they split that up into North and South Carolina and Georgia. And that NC was the 12th of the 13 original colonies to sign. I was very surprised. I guess growing up in CT we didn't get this basic stuff about other colonies, just our own. Its wild what I'm learning so I can teach these students.  I've been staying up late to call home and its good for me. I miss talking to my folks everyday and still can't some how reach my best friend but I'm sure she is okay. I talked to Tracey's son Brandon today. He was at work with her. "Hi Bibi" That's what he calls me, can't say Eboni. Gosh, I'm not going to get sad, but I do miss everyone.    Wednesday night they have a "fire-flower" display (fireworks) at the Elementary school up the road. I'm going to go and try to take pictures but I don't think I'm going to be doing the developing thing much longer. Its just too expensive, and plus if I get a digital camera it will be much easier to show pictures to everyone. So Friday is a half day for me and I think I'll go out looking then.  I'm supposed to be climbing Mt. Fuji with a group of people from my prefecture Saturday and would love to take good pictures of that so...we'll see.    "Jah, Matta! (see you later)"

      I'm back in business!!! Thank you GOD!!! The internet man came today and I officially have access in my home!!!  YES!!! Okay can you tell I'm excited! Alright already enough with the exclaimation points.   So, I gave my speech today and I am beginning to realize that I worry for nothing! The people here could give a crap whether I said "Saltwater taffy is my favorite meal" They clap anyway, and sit back down to do their work. I didn't even get the opportunity to do it in English, which was fine with me because the 2 seconds I stood up there was long enough for me.  Its so funny because I've never been in a place where I can't understand people and then sometimes they look in your direction or point your way and laugh. Its not a comfortable thing. So what I drove on the wrong side of the road....twice....today....or that I forgot to turn on the blinker when I was making a left into the school yard, or that I drove past lake Shoji instead of making a right (the first damn time I went there by myself) I don't find it humorous at all. (arms folded)   I'm glad I never picked on people when I was growing up because I would feel bad for them right now. I don't think they do it to intentionally make fun of me, but they as well as I am not used to something so different. The people of Kamiku and I are taking some time getting adjusted to each other and although I am virtually the only English speaker in town (the JTE is away on vacation for a week) I am determined to communicate with my boss and with my co-workers!  I told my girl E today that I've been going about it with the wrong attitude...the new Eboni says:    "I'm feeling good from my head to my shoes, Know where I'm going and I know what to do, I've tidied up my point of view I'VE GOT A NEW ATTITUDE!"

      August 9, 2002  Tonight I went to an informal welcome party that the prefecture was throwing. We met at this place called Michael's American Pub. It was nice to be around an American store owner. Made me feel a little proud. Michael was very funny, and a really nice guy. His (Japanese) wife made us pasta salad, buffalo chicken wings and lasanga. They even brought out popcorn which made me laugh at first but I was excited to be eating it. Like I am starting to realize more and more, I'm NOT a group person. There were some new ALTs (Assistant Language Teachers) and some old ones. Well the older ones had these Japanese friends that they hang out with regularly I guess and they were soooooooo loud! I guess it also bothered me because I was driving and wasn't drinking like everyone else in the pub. In Japan they have a ZERO blood alchohol level and especially in the area where I live I'm glad that they do. The roads are so winding and curving that it could be very easy to lose your control if you are not at 100%. So anyway, the screaming girls saying "KAMPAI" -which means cheer- and holding it out for like 13 minutes was just getting to be a bit much for me. I am sure that the white folks think I complain a lot, but I'm just not used to hanging out like that. My friends and I go drinking and dancing. We don't ever sit and just drink at a bar and get obnoxious. Well...There is the El...but we eat there and then go home, so its not the same. Even when we do go to a bar, its not the same as the way these folks party. I can't wait until my folks get settled so we can have some communication again. Figure out when we are going to Tokyo to party!!!  I bought a suit tonight at the train station in Fujiyoshida. They have some really nice shops there. It was a little department store kinda thing. Its BAD too. Three pieces and black. The salesman gave me a great price on it. I have been looking for one for a long time even in the states that was reasonable price because school begins the week after next and I didn't have one. My supervisor told me that I needed to try to find one. So, I finally did. I figured out with the help of the salesman that I am a size 11 or 12 in Japanese sizes. Which is like a 4 or 6 in America! Go figure.  I wrote my welcome speech today. I have to say it in Japanese and in English Monday morning to everyone at the Village Office. Wanna hear it...here goes:  Good morning everyone. It is nice to meet you. My name is Eboni Staton. Please call me Eboni. I come from North Carolina in America.  North Carolina is in the Southeast of America.  I came to Japan on August 4th. I'm so excited to be here since this is my first time to visit Japan. I studied Japanese in America but I am still poor at it.  My hobby is listening to all types of music and I am also interested in improving my Japanese while here in Japan.  I am proud to be working with you and I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can. I will try to do my best. I hope our relationship will be a happy one.  For those of you who understand Japanese, here is the other version:  Minasan, hajimemashite.  Watashi wa Eboni Suteiton to moushimasu.  Eboni to yonde kudasai.  Watashi wa Amerika no Nosu Karoraina kara kimashita. Nosu Karoraina wa Amerika no nansei no hou desu.  Watashi wa hachi gatsu yokka ni Nihon ni kimashita.  Nihon wa hajimetedesunode totemo tanoshiminishiteimasu.  Amerika de nihongo o benkyoushimashita ga mada heta desu.  Watashi no shumi way ongaku o kikukoto desu ga Nihon no nihongo o benkyou ni kyoumi ga arimasu.  Mina sama to issho ni oshigoto ga dekiru koto o kouei ni omoimasu. Ouku no katagata to oshiriai ni nareru koto o tanoshiminishite orimasu.  Ganbaritai to omoimasu. Douzo yoroshiku onegaishimasu.  What do you think?

      August 8, 2002  Today I spent the entire day inside because I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE. My JTE (Japanese Teacher of English) took me out on the road yesterday to practice driving on the left side and it is not hard but I don't like it! I think I'll go out tomorrow but not today.   The internet service people came today to get my information so they could set up my internet. He said it won't be ready until Monday afternoon. The cell phone representitive from Do Co Mo (a big company out here) came too. Their cell phone service is MAD! You pay whatever price for the phone you want 5800 yen (about $55), then you pay for a plan (3600 yen), which doesn't include minutes. I just includes service. Then you have to subscribe to the I-mode service (300 yen)which is being able to check your email from your phone, which also takes up minutes I'm assuming, and you get 50 minutes free for the month. That's it. There is no contract though, which is a good thing. I wanted to shop around a little more but my teacher has this service and she basically told them I wanted it. I couldn't get it though because I don't have my alien registration card yet. You really can't do much without that card. So in the meantime, I'm going to ask my gaijin friends and see what kind of service they have. I'd like to have a phone, but I don't plan on paying more than I paid in the states to maintain it. I had a $50 a month plan and I am not going over that. I told them I would try the Do Co Mo service but I am intending on canceling if I am not satisfied after that month.

      August 8, 2002  Well its the morning of my last day in Tokyo.  My roomates and I have been up since about 4am. We couldn't sleep and I was worried that I'd sleep too late to pack so I guess I kinda woke everyone else up. (Sumimasen!)  Yesterday was a good day. I woke up about 5, I'm not really having trouble sleeping or anything its just that when I am ready to wake up I just do so I guess. I hope this keeps up even when I finally arrive at my apt because that would make the transition to going to school first thing in the morning much easier. Another thing is the Japanese expect so much of you as far as promptness is concerned so I'm really going to have to make sure I don't disappoint them in that.  So, I found out that I'm going to have to get a Japanese license. Like take the test, driving and written.  The thing is that the laws about driving in Japan with an international driving permit have changed. Beginning June 1, 2002 you can only use your driving permit from the dates that you wanted it to be valid. Well I didn't know when to validate it so I just said immediately and that was back in June. So next June my permit expires and for the month of July I won't be allowed to drive (which is rediculous and impossible) and that is not an option because I need to drive for my job. So in order to safeguard my self and my BOE I have to take the driving test in Japan and obtain a Japanese driving license, which I heard is an insanely difficult test. So I'm not looking forward to that!!!   Yesterday we also went to Harajuku which is like a shopping district and they have Gap, J Crew, Body Shop, and my FAVORITE--the PUMA store! I was excited, but the stuff in there was of course toooo expensive. I still have to live off the 80,000 yen I have for the next two weeks so I have to chill and not buy things that I don't need. I did however buy some film for my camera which was cheap. Its hard to find a good deal on APS film so I bought like 10 roles for about 2,500 yen. I also bought a shirt at the Gap (I had too! and kept the reciept).  We had such and adventure on the subway. We went to Shinjuku station armed with nothing but a Japanese Phrase Book on a mission to Harajuku. We were just looking for anyone who LOOKED like they spoke English. These Black British men ended up stopping us (while look looking at my girl Erica's butt) and directing us the way to the Green line. Once we got over there we couldn't figure out how to purchase the tickets. So, Shirly (another US JET) goes to a younger looking Japanese woman and begins trying to ask her for help...She helps us out, takes our money and buys the tickets for us. Then she walks us up to the platform and sits with us on the train. So I'm being a smart ass and reading things out of my phrase book like "When is the next train to Harajuku", "When is the first train to Harajuku", "Does this train stop at Harajuku" and a few Japanese guys in front of us start laughing and one guy says in English "You sound so natural!" Then Erica Shirly and I burst out laughing and we are like "So, you speak English!" He's like yeah, I understand every word you are saying! It was so funny!!  Then while we are walking down the street once we get to Harajuku we see this group of Japanese teen agers who are sooo tanned wearing chloe'(like) glasses and sun visors (at night) and these glittery t-shirts that say, Area Codes and I love New York, and LA and one girl looks and me and goes "Kawaii" which means cute and they start giggling, I say "Thanks" and they keep walking. Its so amazing to me how much the mimic Hip-Hop culture over here but its flattering in a way. I know that its not going to be like this in Kamikuishiki but I know that Tokyo is only a train ride away.     Is this really my life? Wow! I'm so blessed!!!!

      August 5, 2002  Today was very eventful. Aside from the fact that I'm writing this entry in safemode because my computer is acting crazy! I had a great breakfast of fresh fruit hashbrowns, rolls and eggs. The orange juice glasses are so smallthat someone said we were drinking shots of fruit juice...these JETs are so funny.  The seminars were very interesting this morning. The first one I attended was one on vegans and vegetarians in japan. They were giving us tips on what to look out for and what kanji means msg or pork or meat product. The also told me that being a non-pork eater I should stay away from ramen because it often has a pork stock base...all those years of not eating pork and eating ramen just cancelled all of that out. Also they told us if there is anything that you do not eat, don't just say NO! tell they you are allergic and they will be much more sensitive, so that is what I plan to do about beef and pork.  I went to another session after that one on being a rural JET. Most of the information was some that I'd heard already but I did get some information about some rural JETs who have been here at least a year. That works for me so I can contact them about different things that I might come up against.    We were supposed to go to a welcome reception this evening but my roomates and I  came back here and fell asleep so that didn't work very well. The girl who is sleeping next to the alarm turned it off and we all went back to sleep! Oh well! So then we got up about 8pm and went to dinner at this restaurant called Heaven and Hell. Its like a theme restaurant. It was actually really nice, and the bathrooms are sooo funny. There is this one toilet that is in a mirrored stall with a big statue built into the wall in front of the toilet. So when you start to use it the statue comes alive starts laughing and singing and moving close to you. Its actually very alarming if you aren't warned in advance. In the men's room there is one that is a urinal that swings back and forth moving while the guys are using the toilet and then the head switches around and a woman's face appears and she begins to sing. Then all of a sudden a flash snaps from no where! Its so funny!! I took pictures of it all, I'll have to develop them later so they can be seen. Then we were on our way back from the restaurant we taught this Japanese guy with dreads how to give a "Black" hand-shake and danced in the street to the Backstreet Boys! It was so fun. I can't believe I'm in freakin' Tokyo! Its wild...  Oh, I decided something tonight...I, Eboni Staton, am NOT a group person!!! Gosh I don't know how many times I will have to say that but I don't like doing the group thing. It just gets to be too much when you have to try to wait on 10 people to do dinner then wait on 10 folk to finish and walk back with 10 people. Or to pick up 5 from another hotel and hope that they are all there and waiting, its too much for me. I don't want to seem anti-social but I'd rather kick it with a few folks I know I'll have a good time with and leave it at that. It works out though because on a few occasions I've met some cool people doing the group thing but tomorrow night, if we go out, I think that we are just going to try to get directions for everyone so we don't have to make all those pick-up drop-off stops.    "If I hear Ashanti one more TIME in Tokyo, I'm going to scream"   One more night left here, I have to make the most of it. Okay...Usher is on the radio now.. I did say no more Ashanti right..so I guess he's alright..wow..the US influence on this country and Hip Hop in particular is very interesting. I'm going to have to look further into that. Jah, Matta.

      Aug 4, 2002  Just a few short hours ago, I arrived in Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan. My morning began with a short ride to Dulles International at 9:30. We left there at 12:50 and set out for Japan.  The inflight attendants were wonderful they were so attentive and helpful. We ate 2 full meals and many snacks and drinks in between. The plan was huge, so big in fact that first class went from row 1-23! Then my area started from 24-32 was a business class, and from 33-62 was the coach seating. We flew All Nippon Airlines, and I was very satisfied. There were five major inflight movies: Ice Age, Lord of the Rings, Monsters Inc., High Crimes and some movie with that guy from Home Improvement. On top of that, you could control which movie you  wanted to watch because we all had tvs in the headrests in front of us. I slept a little and talked to some of the other JETs but basically just had a pleasant flight.  Once we arrived we had to present our immigrant cards and have our passports stamped.  The line for foreigners was extremely long and it was a little frustrating, but I think what made me more frustrated than the line was the complaining. I told a few people that they really  didn't have anywhere to go so I'm not sure why they were acting up and complaining. The way I look at is, cry over some milk you can either clean up or prevent from spilling. Once the shit has spilt or you dont have control over what happens, just chill and move on. Anyway, so then I went and got a push cart, got my bags and proceed to customs. Customs was actually quite simple to go through. I thought they were going to go through all my bags or something but they didn't...so then I started in the JET processional.  There were about 200 of us that arrived at Narita at the same time (on different flights but at the same time) and the CLAIRE folks were ready for us. They had people guiding us all the way. We got in lines  to have the large bags shipped ahead and then rode a 2hr bus to the hotel where we are staying. I'm in the Hilton Tokyo with Monica and Sylvana. Yes there are three of us to a room. Its  cool though because we wont be here long and neither of them keep up a bunch of mess so far. I actually met both of them before today so that is good too. We had Kimono robes in here and slippers to wear as well.  I went to dinner with another group of folks and then walked around Shinjuku, Tokyo a little. I went to the am/pm store, its a convience store and i LOVE these little Koala Bear snacks they have here so I bought some of those and some film. I got a calling card when I got back here so I could call Ryan and tell him I was here safe and to call my mom too! I told ma that I called her and Ryan and she was like "oooooh you called HIM first huh?" She's so funny, she didn't mean it in a bad way because she knows what that guy means to me. Anyway, I told him to order a passport because I want to see him out here.  From my bed, I can see out the window that it has been raining and its very humid outside.  You can see other very tall buildings and city lights that remind you of Time Square in NY. I am also listening to Ashanti's "Foolish" on the radio station here. Its too funny because  this is probably the 3rd time I've heard it and I may have listened to about an hour of radio! I'm happy because I probably wont hear any of this in Kamiku so I better enjoy it while I can.  Tomorrow I am going to be more sociable and talk with many more people than the folks I already know. I am going to branch out and make some new ALT/JET friends so I won't be quite so lonely when I  finally do get where I'm going. I really wish to keep up with my journal because it is actually probably the only verbal outlet I'll have.  Thanks for listening-     Truly International-E

      This morning a got a message from a JET friend that lives down in Southern Yamanashi. She called and wanted to know if I wanted to go to this Mexican restaurant that everyone RAVES about in Fujinomiya, which is about a 30 min drive from my school. I'm always up for Native English speaking company so of course I say yes. I actually know a girl I met at DC orientation who lives up there and I'd been meaning to get up with her since we live so close but the opportunity never presented itself...until today. So, after work I come home to get the directions to the place and start off to Fujinomiya.  The JETs from Yamanashi are supposed to meet me at this restaurant at 7pm. So I told my friend Ash that live in Fujinomiya, that I'd meet her earlier to catch up and talk before the other folks arrived. I got there about 6pm. At 6pm I get a call from the Yama JETs saying they didn't leave home unti 6pm and it would be 7:15 or so before they got there. I said that's cool. Well just hang around until you get here. So my friend took my to her apt and showed me around. She has quite a nice place and very nice decorating taste. I was very impressed. She also told me that she usually has a Japanese student she teaches on Monday nights and wanted to know if she could come to dinner with us. I said that would be good. I was also thinking it would be really good practice for her student. So, I'm waiting for the Yama JETs to call me back around 7pm when they should be fairly close to our meeting spot. When they call back, they said it would be another 30 mins or so before they arrived.  Now, keep in mind my day. Got up at 7:15 to get ready for work. Left home at 8pm. Sat at my desk and at the computer from 8:30am-4:30pm because there was no English lesson today and the English teacher was on holiday. Left work after having done absolutely nothing for 8 hours and drove 20 mins in the opposite direction of Fujinomiya to get the directions for the place. Left home about 5pm and arrived at 6pm. Sat around with Ash for an hour and of course by this time I'm hungry. So when they called that last time, I just told them I was going to eat with Ash and her student and then I was going home.  You also have to keep in mind there are about 6 of them riding up together and I am by myself. Also bear in mind that a party of 8 will take much longer to serve than a party of 3 and if I would have waited and ate with them, I would have been pissy so I'm glad that I just ate and when home. Their being late could not be placed on any one in particular, but me driving home on a full stomach at 10pm or later is really not what I had in mind when we were supposed to be sitting down to eat at 7pm originally.  We ended up eating at Gusto's which was very very good and our waiter was practicing the bit of English that he knew.  Ash's student was able to practice and get in some practice talking to me so that was good for her too. I got home at a decent hour. I'm going to read a little bit of Harry and take my self to sleep.  Tomorrow I start bringing my  own lunch to school and I forgot to make it tonight so I'll get up earlier tomorrow. *Yeah Right*

      Good day today. I got up about 7:45 to a sky of pouring rain thinking that soccer practice would be cancelled, but boy was I wrong. I told the team co-ordinator Laura that I wasn't going to play but I did want to go down there to get our kit sorted out and find out what team I would be on and all that stuff. It was raining much to hard for me to risk catching a cold to suit them. But I'm excited!!! We have a good team and the shorts and socks like really good together. Now we only have to find the shirts.  I came home and started reading the first Harry Potter book. I fell asleep after page 10, I hope that's not a sign of how the rest of the reading is going to go. I saw the movie so I know the plot line already although I know the book will be much more specific...we'll see.  Tonight I went to Maman Pumpkin's which is a excellent Indian restaurant with Hazel, Terry, and Chris. It was Hazel's birthday and that's her favorite place to eat. Its very good, but very spicy so I always have to get something off the baby menu so my mouth doesn't burn up! We had a great dinner and finished it up with Indian cha, which is a spicy sort of tea. Its really good too. After dinner, we went to the Sports Cafe for drinks (I had soda) and playing pool. I suck at pool but I'm getting better each time. I guess that's the only way you really learn.  As I was going to my car after leaving the cafe' I saw a girl Nilta that I'd met when I was with Sanae last week. I was waving at her and she didn't recognize me, but the other two looked so happy to see me that I got out of the car and started talking with them and exchanging information almost immediately. The two other people ended up being Aru (Brazilian guy who speaks English just like I do) and Keysha (a Black girl from Pennsylvania).  It was about midnight when I got back to my car where they were walking past, and I stayed out there and talked to them until about 1:50am! Nilta actually left about 10 minutes after I met them but Aru, Keysha, and I just stayed on the street and talked and talked. I was quite fun! We have made a date for them to come up to my place and have a sleep over, cook dinner and watch movies. I'm excited about all this, but it won't be for another week or so before they come up. We wanted to do it on a long weekend when we didn't have to go to work on Monday and I think the next one is October 14th. I really hope we keep in touch. Keysha has natural hair too and its much longer than mine so I'm sure I can help her out with braids and stuff...for a minimal cost that is. Aru has many people in his family that used relaxers and knows how to put one in so if I break down and have to get one, at least I know someone who is near me that can put it in!   This has been a pretty good day. I have my Japanese lesson tomorrow at 4:30 and still have yet to write the 1/2 page journal that Natusko asked me to write. I did work on the other homework she gave me though. I will get up semi-early tomorrow and work on it. I do want to be a dedicated student. Off to sleepy land. :)

      I can begin to explain how small this world really is. My linesister's fiance's linebrother is here in Japan! He went to school with my best friend, knows her and all I know so  many of his frat, but never met him! He's in the JET program too, about 2 prefectures over from me. Its still kinda far, but just a call away. Even funnier, we talked yesterday for the first time and found out that he is going to be in the JET soccer tournament in Nagano next weekend!  Its so cool to meet people you can talk to about stuff you are both familiar with and a Black person at that, so I'm looking forward to meeting him.  Speaking of soccer, our practice this morning was postponed until 10AM because of the rain.  I told the co-ordinator that I wasn't going to practice with them in the rain because I don't want to mess around and catch a cold. Its so easy to happen, so I'd rather be safe than sorry. I could have stayed to watch but I just left and went home. Well, I started to go home but then, I saw this huge SHOE mart.  I told myself I wasn't going to, but I broke down and bought a pair of  urlLink cleats . They're cute and were semi inexpensive. I feel like I need to find another use for these bad boys like join a soccer league or something. I have shorts and socks from the boys that played last year. We are using the kits they wore last year. I only have to find a shirt now. Most of us are in the same boat though because she wants us to wear blue polo style shirts, but they are no where to be found. I did find tons of blue t-shirts but not what Laura wants us to have. We still have until Saturday so I hope it will all work out.   We have 14 women from our prefecture playing so they want us to make two teams. We have the "Yama Mama's" and the "Mama Yama's". Its quite difficult to say three times fast! But anyway, I'm on the Yama Mama team. It should be a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to the weekend away and getting to visit Nagano.

      Mt. Fuji had its first snow of the year last night. Today on my way to school the mountain was visable from lake Shoji and of course I had to stop to see and take pictures. It was absolutely gorgeous. If only I had a digital camera to capture the moment immediately.  This morning I braided my hair and of course another uproar in the teachers room when I arrived.  I think that everyday the look to see what I'm wearing and how my hair is going to look. Today I wore a  brown skirt, cream button down and had a sweater tied semi-J Crew style around my shoulders. Its so funny because its rare that I get attention at all unless it has something to do with my clothes or my hair. Its okay though and eventually they will get used to it.    I cleared my vacation days with my Prinicipal, Vice Principal, and the folks at the BOE. I'm going to Gunma to visit Erica for sure this time!!! Its still two weeks before, but I'm excited. They told me I should drive because it takes 5 hours on the train and only 3.5 at most if I drive. So what I need to do is make about 3 hours worth of good driving music and GO. So, that's the plan. Erica just got a car yesterday and that's great news because she will know some more places to go as opposed to before when she was on her bike. I'm excited about my second trip out of Yamanashi. The first is coming up fast too--the soccer tournament in Nagano.    Saturday we have practice and its actually supposed to rain, but I hope it doesn't.

      Honestly, I don't care what anyone says...I can put some fire to a piece of chicken I swear! Dang, I have to complement myself. If I can't cook a thing else, Chicken...I can cook! Along with the help of some Japanese poultry seasoning of course. Tonight I made some of the best mini drumsticks I've ever tasted. Yumm!

      I thought I'd supressed it, but alas, the clumsy in me has resurfaced. After last Friday's "spill" in the woods pickin' mushroom, I thought I'd be okay.  WRONG! So, I'm leaving the Village Office today around 4:30, I miss the step down and bussss (not bust) my ass. I tore my   GUESS Collection  black slacks and tore up my left knee.  The skin was broken and won't stop bleeding. I also have two really bad stratches on my right and left foot right when the shin turns into foot. I don't know how in the HELL I managed that but now my right hand, left knee, and both left and right feet are scarred up. And who doesn't have cocoa butter to hide the scars once they heal...ME. You guess it! Sometimes I worry about me. The bad part is the sores will heal eventually even if they don't go away but my slacks...they're gone forever :(.  Yesterday, my upstairs neighbor and co-worker came to me at the Jr. High School and asked me if I knew that her boyfriend stayed at her house many nights. Which was very dumb because our apartment parking lot is very small and of course I know that is his car. I've seen them in it before. He spends the night very often and has been for the last 3 weeks or so.  The reason she really asked is because this morning when I was leaving from the Board of Ed (which is right next door) around 9:30 I saw him on her balcony. He must have called her and told her I saw him. She made it a point to ask me not to tell the students that he stays there. First of all, I told her that I wouldn't tell her business because if I did have some business to tell I'd hope that she wasn't at school telling all of it. I also let her know that me seeing him the other morning doesn't confirm anything that I didn't already know. She's a grown woman and what she does in her apt is her own business and I would hope that the same would apply for my business and my apartment.  She pretends like she doesn't understand as much English as she really does but understood every word I said that morning.  But speaking of the boyfriend, I'm a little concerned. I've been visiting the elementary schools every day this week so that means I leave from home later, around 9:30 instead of 8am. Only this week, the boyfriend has been there when I leave for work. Which makes me wonder--Either he is on vacation (which I wouldn't want to spend my vacation locked up washing clothes and hanging out futons like he's been doing) or he ain't got no job. I hope its not the latter because on a teacher's salary she can't support the both of them. I'm being nosy, but she was the dumb one for even saying that. I guess she had to, but he's a bitch for calling her.

      I think ALT's have been living in my apt for the last 5 years. Four women if my memory serves me correctly. So, there are some things that are in the apt that have just accumulated over the years. One of them is US TV programs that have been sent here. Today I found a tape that I hadn't seen before and popped it in.  The first hour on here was 2 episodes of Drew Carey's "Whose line is it anyway" on which the black guy basically sang and danced. I'd be rash to call him a coon because I'm sure is just meant to be comedy. After that I watch 2 episodes of  urlLink "Who wants to be a millionaire?"  when it was in its first season. Quite entertaining though I must say I enjoy watching the Japanese version much better. The host is sooo funny (even though I don't know what he is saying, the facial expressions speak volumes). He also keeps the contestants waiting much longer and there is ALWAYS a commerical right before they reveal the answer. No matter how much I try to ignore getting sucked into the hype, I can't help it.  But anyway, back to this old tape. So after the Millionaire episodes, there was this weird special on New Zealand that I fast forwarded thru and then came to my faovrite of all time: The Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! No, I'm not kidding. Although I wish I was. It just came on and its 10:37pm, but I have to watch this before I go to bed. I grew up on the Dukes! Daisy is looking a little withered, but Ennis stlil loves her!  Its amazing what you find when you aren't looking...

      I got my pictures developed from the waterfalls we went to a few weeks ago. I look like a chunk ball, but that's just pretty much how I feel on a daily basis. I also got the picture I took of Watanabe-sensei (the math teacher) sleeping at his desk. He saw it today and of course laughed. I also got a picture of all of the teachers from my school at our Welcome party on Friday. I love the photo shops here. I paid about 600yen for the developing and they were ready in 1 hour. You can't get service like that in the States! The toss up is it takes me forever to read the drop off instructions, so oh well.  My friend Erica and I have so many things in common that its really scary. We've been trying to plan out our Christmas vacation for the past few weeks. You know black folks that ain't never been no where and now have a little piece of money, we got big plans right? So we were talking about going to Paris or to Brazil, but it doesn't look like either one of us are going to be able to swing an expensive trip like that anytime soon. E is also trying to get a car and finish setting up her place so we can't go into that kind of money right now. So, we decided to stay around Japan and do some touring on the main island of Honshu. Kyoto is one of the most traditional areas in Japan, I live near Fuji and around a lot of temples and shrines, and we can also take the train down to Hiroshima to do some sight seeing. I've ordered this book called Lonely Planet Japan, that should help with reservations and trains and everything. So, I'm excited about that. Planning domestically is much easier because I can do most of it myself and doesn't involve any plane reservations.    "This is my life. You are my life. I want to thank you, I thank you father, for blessing me"

      I am finally finished with all the school festivals that I had to go to. One Saturday and one today.  The weather was so nice yesterday and the festival was by far my favorite. I really like Shoji Elementary School. The principal wants to learn English. The students are very friendly and want to learn.  The teachers want to talk to me in English as well although they know very little.  They have a lot of activities at the festival that involve the PTA and of course the momma's keep coming over to me every time there was a PTA activity asking me to join. By Saturday at had already been to 2 festivals so I'm getting used to them. Today's was okay too. The weather wasn't quite as nice. It was a little cold this morning but then around 11:30 it started raining. At first only drizzling but as time when on it got worse. They modified the schedule so that it wouldn't last quite as long but just as the closing stretches started we had to move into the gym because it started pouring!  There is a traditional warm up and cool down stretch that everyone does together. Its really neat because EVERYONE knows it from the baby kindergarders to the ojisan and obachan's. There is one little pissy ass 6th grader that really gets on my nerves. He thinks he is so funny but I think its rather disrepectful. I really want to tell the little prick about himself. I think it stands out so much  because everyone else is pretty nice except for him. Like today they played this game where you had to race for these goodie bags. Well this ass comes over to me and hands the bag to me. As I start to take it from him, he snatches it and runs away. Now that's not something that is uncharacteristic of an awkward ass 6th grader but all of the kids in Kamikuishiki show me much respect and not one of them acts that way with me. He's just a prick and the other students have just spoiled me that's all.   I started recieving an English newspaper this week. Its called the  urlLink Daily Yomiuri . It has a lot of good coverage and since its one of the main newspaper's in Japan for English speaking people it had world news. I feel more in touch with the world here than when I was in the US.  It has a tv schedule of English speaking program and things that are in the original language but subtitled in Japanese are in bold. Tonight's program is Jurassic Park. Its been YEARS since I've seen this movie. Its so weird because I probably would never want to sit down and watch it at home and I'm not really interested in watching here, but just to have something in English talking in the background as I use the internet, write letters, even do my Japanese studying is comforting. I swear when I'm in the four walls of my home I don't really feel like I'm in Japan at all.  Wait! I didn't know Samuel L Jackson was in this movie! The things you lean when you least expect it.  I toiled over my head this morning and finally worked it into 2 mother nature french braids. It came out very good and is much less time consuming than braiding my hair up in cornrows at night and trying not to sleep wild. (I know, fat chance) Having natural hair gives me the options that I so desparately need in my life but if I want to do anything other than wear it "curly" it takes a really long time to pick out, grease, comb and brush. But I do like having different hair styles. I was telling my mom about how much time it takes to do my hair and how sometimes I would just kill for a perm. Do you know this woman had the nerve to ask me if I wanted her to send me a  urlLink "S-curl"  Sometimes I think the woman has really lost it. I mean get rid of a perm and get an S-Curl?!? Yeah right!  Tomorrow we have a holiday so I don't have to go to school, but I do have my Japanese lesson in the evening.  I don't know if its being lazy or that I really like my apt, but I am so content sitting in here and sleeping my morning away, waking up to do a little laundry and housekeeping, going to the movie store and spending my day in my apt! Sounds like a plan of action right?

      The welcome party was so  much fun. Its definitely true what they say about Japanese folks easing up with they start drinking. My prinicipal was just as talkative as I've ever seen him.  I said my speech in Japanese and this time I had it memorized.  They were so I'm pressed and so surprised that I had remember it. I was very happy about the way things worked out. We had dinner at this Chinese restaurant that served about 6 or 7 courses including dessert. One course I had to pass up because it was pork but the rest were quite delicious.  They told me that they are glad I'm getting used to living and working in Japan. They told me that I understand more than any of the other ALT's they've had. I asked the Vice Principal if I can work out with the students as they prepare for the 11K run around Lake Mototsu in November. He was really excited about that and I'll be going to PE with them when the work out. Hopefully this will help get me in shape for this soccer game in a few weeks. The principal keep making me eat and drink, eat and drink. I had to slow down during the last hour and only drink tea!  I know that because everyone was drinking folks were a lot more energetic than they usually are at school but I enjoyed the loose side of my co-workers. After work we carpooled to the restaurant from school and then everyone goes back to their cars and drives home. The principal was so drunk he brought his blanket and spent the night at the Junior High! Off to bed because I have to be up bright and early for Shoji Elementary school festival.  My Speech: Kyo watashino tameni konoyouna subarashikaiwo arigatougozaimasu.  (Today, thank you for my wonderful party)  Watashiwa, kamiku chugako no minasanto deaite totemo ureshidesu desu.  (I really enjoy working with everyone at Kamiku Junior High, you are all very friendly)  Watashiwa mada nihonni wakaranaikoto ga takusan arimasu.  (There are still many things about Japan I do not know)  Minasanto nakayouku nareruyouni iishokenme ganbarimasunode douzoyoroshiku oneigaishimasu.  (If there are somethings I do wrong will you please help me. I would really appreciate it.)  Arigato gozaimashita  (Thanks a lot)

      Why am I stupid? And why is the Math teacher two desks away from me in the teacher's room SLEEP.  I'm stupid because I just took a picture of him and made all the teachers included the VP look over here at him.  The thing is we all did the quiet laugh and as I type, he is still sitting with his face in his hands elbows on the desk looking like he is reading something on the computer screen in front of him, but we ALL know that this man is sleep. I can't contain myself so I need to leave the teachers room if he begins to snore!  This morning the 9th grade homeroom teacher asked me if I wanted to go out in the woods and look for mushrooms with the class. So of course me and my happy go lucky try anything once behind said yes and now have scar wounds to prove my adventure was a success. There are woods that totally surround my school and they even had a professional mushroom picker (don't laugh, he gets much respect around this place) to come out here and hunt mushroom with the students. My group wanted to go off in the woods and walk around on some slippery rocks. Most of what we were walking on was covered by moss and while I'm looking after the students saying "Kyosukette" (be careful) I slip on one. Now, trying to avoid completely busting my behind I stick out my hand  to break the fall and my hand lands on a sharp porous lava rock.  My school is located close enough to Fuji that debris and rock from old lava flows are all around the wooded areas there and this rock cut the shit out of my hand! I have a huge gash just below my thumb joint, another deep wound about an 8 cm below it and the opposite side of my hand blow my pinky is scarred as well. At first I was like "Daijobu" (I'm alright) but the more I tried to keep going the more it began to bleed and the students insisted that I go back and see the school nurse. I felt so bad because they had to trek back out of the woods to take me and then go back out to finish their science experiment.   One of the students got bitten by a snake yesterday and the nurse bandaged his hand up just like my is now bandaged. I told all the teachers to tell people I got bitten by a snake too. I didn't want them to know I fell. So when the students came in and saw my hand and asked what happened I said I got bitten by a snake. Now, the students who were with me were like "Really? You did?". They were feeling bad because they thought I feel and got bitten. So then I said "American Joke, American Joke" like they say to me whenever they make jokes. I guess you had to be there for this one.  Tomorrow I have to go to a school festival at Shoji Elementary school. Now I have this bandage on and the last thing I want is every person coming up to me asking me what happened and of course I can't explain it in Japanese. Maybe it will be cold and I can keep my hand in my hoody pocket. Speaking of hoody--I'll be so glad when my mom can send the rest of my clothes because all I have in the way of long sleeve clothing is one t-shirt, a hoody, and this ARMY zip-up. I mean, I have dress clothes, but those are my school clothes not everyday hang around long sleeve stuff.   It gets pretty cold i my apt too so when Tray sends me that chenille blanket I've been dying to have for the last 2.5 years I'll be even happier.

      Last night I braided my hair. I got tired of it being out of control so I took action against the madness. It actually came out without many crooked parts but I want you to know that when I walked in this office this morning you could have heard a pen drop.  Then came the touching. They wanted to see, they wanted to look, they wanted to know who did it and how long it took. It was so funny. I tried to make as little eye contact as possible because they were starring me down and it was making me just a little bit uncomfortalbe. Then of course I had 2 classes today and they only commented on it for a little while. One of my 3rd grade (9th in the US) students said "Your head is GREAT!" If only he knew what he was saying! Anyway, they are going to have to get used to it being different and I'm going to have to get used to it being commented on because they are going to keep doing it. Its okay though, they have to learn somewhere and with someone right?      "If not me, then who? If not now then when?"

      Debt is not a good thing, but day after day I am slowing coming out of it. I stayed up until 12:42am to call one of the credit card companies I owe to find out the best news I've heard in a while. The are going to reduce the over $1000 I owe them to $421.06!!! You can't beat that! I'm so siked. And the best thing is that I can finally answer their offer with a YES! Oh wow, I can't say how many times how blessed I really am.  In the last week 3 people have told me they are coming out here to visit but I still am waiting to see them make reservations. I really do want to see folks and I hope they can come but for now its only wishful thinking. My friend E (I know, people call me it and its wierd to call someone else that--i digress) is having "Japanese Indirectness Issues". This is what I am going to call it from now on...JI squared. She teaches an adult conversation class which she wasn't told about before she started but never complained about teaching. Well after 4 weeks of the class one of the students brings a textbook and after class a group of people swarm around him and start talking about how the last years ALT used a book. So she's like, what's the big deal. And they are all talking in Japanese to each and all huddled up. One comes out of the group and says "Johanna used a book. Maybe E can use a book" She looked at them at this point like they'd lost their minds. Before she even started the class she asked them WHAT they wanted her to do. They said only talk to them about American and about current events. ONLY talking. No workbook or anything else. Then, and here is the kicker for E, she said they asked her to buy the book. Oh, do you know the look on her face at that point. She was heated. She said that she might end up quitting the class because she can't understand why such a big deal has to be made about nothing. And it took a group meeting for them to say, Johanna used the book could you teach us some vocabulary. Needless to say she is pissed. This is not uncommon among JETs so now I have coined a new term JI squared. Use it wisely.  GREAT news! I'm on the Yamanashi JET women's football (soccer) team!!! Yeah. We have our next (first for me) practice September 28th. I'm excited. I get to go to Nagano and I'll be playing soccer for the World Cup. Its the JET Association World Cup, but its the world cup all the same right? I'm so out of shape, I need to get my behind to a gym quick or I might kill myself out there. I know if my students can wear me down in one lap a bunch of grown (somewhat beastly) women can whip my butt.

      (singing) I found a deeeesk! I found a deeeesk! I am currently writing while sitting at the desk in my living room. Yes ma'am that is correct. I am the proud owner of a brand new 4,100yen desk that is small enough to fit in my livingroom w/o any problems and I am not sitting on the floor!!! It seems like I've been looking for weeks and weeks and all the desks I've seen have been floor desks. I'm very excited because I finally found a decently priced one that I like. The desk I really wanted was only 5,000 but to deliver it they wanted 10,000. So all together the damn desk would have been 15,000 and it was used! I could have bought a new one and got it delivered for free for that price. The one I have now I had to put together myself. I messed up one side so I had to "n-word" rig it up, but its cool now. It only wobbles a little! Tired of converting,  urlLink do it yourself.   Okay so why was I just watching a commerical and they have freakin memory sticks for the cell phones that have cameras on them. Some things are truly more than a luxury. Some things are just plain EXTRA. Its so funny how high tec this country is in some aspects and in others like having ATM machines that will give money to people who aren't their customers, they can't get that together. Go figure! oi imake pasta everynight like I've been doing for the past week. I should really go to the grocery store because I have plenty of cereal just no milk.  I wish I knew what was going on with Japanese TV because their TV dramas are off the hook! These folks are great actors. There   I'll cook, but I really don't like cooking. I like coming home to a prepared meal, but who doesn't. I really need to get this together. Or are about three I watch each night. I'm not sure what channels they come on or the name of them but they are really really good and I can't understand half of what they are saying so I know Japanese people must really get into them. The first is one about some Jr. High Students, another is some young in love people and the other is a Police Drama, but they are all great.

      I'm tripping right now. I just check the exchange rates between the US and Japan is killing me! Its good for the US but bad for me! I have to send money to the girl who lived here before me for the stuff she sold me like the TV, furniture, dishes etc. and she is only asking $450 for the stuff which is very generous considering all she left her but it is costing me like 55,000yen. That's a pretty penny here. Japan needs to get this economy thing together. I end up losing money when I send home money because the exchange rates are so bad...  I've got the day off and I'm going to run errands and see if I can find a desk and get some film developed.  I found this hair braiding place but the girl wanted 8,000 yen (about 70 bucks) for some cornrows.  And  she never braided black hair before.  And  she wasn't even adding any hair. I was like NAH, I was just being lazy. I'll do that shit myself, but if you do need someone to braid in your shop I'm free on the weekends! That's a lot of money I could be making just braiding hair. I'm off to the post office to cry because of the money I'm losing.    Cry, for me...

      Ouch! My back hurts...when am I going to stop trying to keep up with these damn kids! The school festival was postponed until today because it rained all morning yesterday. I overslept (that's what I get for going out with Sanae' last night to the Blue Maru) I woke up in a frenzy because I had turned off my alarm and went to sleep!! Anyway, I got to school 10mins before the Opening Ceremony began. I had to find the Kocho Sensei (principal) and display my sorrowful face and many many "Gomenasai's" (sorry's). They said everything was okay "Dai jyobu" but of course you never know what they say behind your back here. Neither here nor there at this point, nothing I can do about being late but try my best not to let it happen again.   The Opening Ceremony was really nice, the students did a small skit. Then each grade did a 30min play. The each grade sang a song they'd been working on forever. Then the brass band played. By this time we had lunch. After lunch we went outside for the sports part of the day.  In comes the aching back . . .there are 4 teams in this tug 'o war competition and two of them needed help because they didn't have enough people on their team. So I was volunteered to be the "sub". I didn't realize it at the time but the students were so much shorter than me and it would kill my back so much but it did. After that I was again volunteered to sub on the PTA team. (quick side note: why is PTA the same as it is in the US? Its the parent teachers association, WIERD! If the word for parents is different and teachers is sensei why do you call it PTA?) Our "PTA" team ended up winning so I was happy about that. All in all it was a long long day. The students seemed to have had a good time and I think they are very happy that they don't have to worry about anything related to a school festival or practice for it for along time.  I'm not sure if they are going to like that or not, but that's not my concern really. I'm also hoping to get on some kind of regular schedule with them. Now that they don't have an interrupted or abbreviated school schedule maybe we can all find a routine.  Since it rained yesterday I went to get a video rental card but I couldn't because I have to take a Japanese person with me in order to get the freakin' card. Two different video stores said the same thing and gave me a form that I need to bring back with a Japanese person's signature and address so that I don't steal the movies or anything. Sometimes I think Japanese folks are pressed about the wrong things, like me having to have a cosinger for a stupid video rental card!  Well since they wouldn't let me rent I went to this place called "Book Off" where they selled a million used books and a bunch of old American/English speaking movies and CDs.  Why did I go in there and buy 10 Cds?! Well, because they were only 350yen (about $2.95) each! I got 2 urlLink  SWV   urlLink CD s, an early  urlLink Mariah Carey  CD, Janet Jackson's   urlLink Velvet Rope  , 3 Prince CDs including   urlLink Diamonds and Pearls  , 2 Whitney Houston's   urlLink Preacher's Wife Soundtrak  and a greatest hits album  , Jamiroquai's   urlLink Travel Without Moving  , and an old Vanessa Williams compilation called Love Songs. I know that all of these are extremely ancient history albums but I like them. I'm making them into tapes tomorrow so I can listen to them while I'm driving. I also bought 3 movies all for 500 yen a piece. I got: Jerry McGuire, Something to talk about, and The Hurricane. Good movies!!! Yeah!!  I enjoyed myself today and I also enjoyed seeing my Elementary school kids at the JH festival as well. Although they will be taking up a good portion of my life next weekend, I'm looking forward to seeing them. They always seem so happy to see and hear from me. I'm about to be dead to the world. I plan to sleep most of the day tomorrow. Wash some clothes in the mix, and do a little planning for my Elementary school lessons up to December. I just need to have a game plan and some worksheets as a back up at all times!!!     "Oyasumi!"

      Today I had 4 English classes to teach. My most thus far. I had two this morning at the JH and two at Kamiku Elementary school. I'm ready for our school festival to get here. I just found out today from Watanabe-san (supervisor) that I have two more school festivals to go to next weekend. One at Kamiku Elementary the other at Shoji (my favorite school). After this I'm done with my festival going for a while. The days I have to work on the weekend I get off at some other point during the month so that's good news. I want to go to Okinawa to visit Vanessa and Karo at the military base so I plan to use those days to take off early on a Thursday afternoon and have a long weekend down in the Tropics with them.    The Vice  Principal informed me today that the weather is supposed to be bad on Saturday and if it is the school festival will be postponed until Sunday and if it rains then until Monday...so I am praying the weather will hold up. I'm going to fry some chicken and watch a movie tonight -The Mexican-since I have to be up at the buttttt-crack of dawn for this school festival I'm not going to go out.     "I'm calling a TIMEOUT!"

      Wow! Never would have expected it but I had such a great time at my birthday dinner/drinks last night.  Sanae told me that someone else's birthday was around the same time but I didn't realize it was the SAME day! And she turned 23 too! And she's from the US! But the similarities end there. She is from Iowa, here on a study abroad type program. Just got engaged Saturday to her long time (white) boyfriend. She speaks Japanese damn near fluently and I think one of her parents is Japanese. Looking at her you'd never know, but she is. She just looks like a chinky eyed black person to me--what do they call that Blackanese? Anyway, I digress...so it was big fun. Sanae's boyfriend KC came there. They bought Aki and I tequila shots and started humming the song "Ba, bada bada ba ba, ba bada bada ba.... TEQUILA" It was funny. I had a great huge hamburger and fries and this delicious drink called Churopikaru Dorimu (Tropical Dream). The owner/bartender is a foreigner and boy could he make drinks!!! I had THREE!!!  While I was there I talked with Kimiko and Mike, two of the folks that went to Ojiro-waterfall with us. They both do Capeora (i can't spell sorry) on Monday and Thursday at the Kose Sports park. I think next Thursday I'm going to go and check them out. He said its very martial artsy, but kinda rhythmic and fun.  The teacher is Hawaiian so some instructions are in basic Japanese and in English! Anything in English, you can sign my name on the dotted line!!! Anyway, this sports park also has a full gym that you don't need a membership to come to just pay 300 yen each time you want to come, which is quite a good deal!!  I figure that after what happened at school yesterday I need some type of physical exercise in my life...(pause from Bday party story to tell about the ass-whoopin' I recieved)  So, my JH school sports festival is on Saturday and the students practice everyday. Well yesterday they needed me to stay after and help them out with a little practicing. So I do and I'm with the C team.  Well they practiced all their events and then when it was time for the last event which is the relay race, the PE teacher comes up to me, note: she doesn't speak but a few words in English...."please Eboni to run together" and points to her and then to me. So I say "Sure!" I'm thinking the teachers have a team and she wants me to run on the team with the teachers. So then the students tell me to come on the other side of the field with them. So I do, and then I ask, "Is Ichinose sensei (the PE teacher) running?" They all shake their heads no. Then I ask "well is Harada sensei (my English teacher) running." Same response. So I say, "Are any other teachers running?" They all say no. So I'm like, Damn! They got me running against the students. I later find out that one of the students is absent and that I'm only subbing for her today so that is a breath of fresh air but I still have this lap in front of me. So of course by the time its my turn to run my team is in last place and I have to try to catch up. I like to killed myself! I thought my lung was going to collapse I was breathing so hard!  I'm glad that was the last event because after that I went into the Ladies room and had to sit my 23 year old behind on the floor!  I couldn't help but laugh as a drug myself to the car. I was glad the students were on the bus on their way home by the time I came out of the bathroom. I was thinking..."I don't want (them) to see me like dis no more" (what movie is that from?)  Back to my birthday. So dinner was great. Sanae and her friend Junko want to take me shopping in Tokyo at the end of the month so that should be great. She is learning how much I love shoes and love to shop. She had on the cutest pink and white pumas too! My kinda girl!!! So I have another really cool Japanese friend. But i think Sanae and I will hang out more than Mizuki and I have.   Birthday Cards:   urlLink From Grandma.   urlLink From Rhonda.    urlLink From Katie.   urlLink From Kiron.   urlLink From Meredith.   urlLink From Sheila.    urlLink  From MOM.   So far away and still I feel so loved. That's what I wanted my birthday to be about. Those who didn't send e-cards or letters called or emailed. Or Instant Messaged me like my neos, Reggie and Sakhu.    Who ever said you as old as you feel...LIED!!!! Those kids whooped my ass!

      Well today is the day! I've recieved a few birthday emails (a bunch from my mom) from friends and family. I got one very special latenight call (gotta luv 'em) when it had just turned midnight and I was already in bed but I'd wake up a million times over to hear that voice.  My friend Sanae (japanese girl) who I'm going out with tonight send me a message on my cell phone with this \(^0^)/ character in the phone. It looks a little different on a Japanese phone, like the thing is shouting so I thought that was funny and cute. I must be about to enter my special phase of the moon because I've been so freakin' mood and everything is on my nerves! (or maybe I'm like that usually and the only time I can really come to grips with it is when I can blame it on the motion of moon) Erica told me that I can't come to Gunma with this kind of attitude so I need an attitude adjustment right quick.  "Attitude check...Praise the Lord!" My sunday school teacher Mrs. A used to make us do that every Sunday and even sometimes when it wasn't Sunday to make is get our attitude in order and its funny how today it still works!  At any rate...I'm 23. Nijyu-San Sai desu. All though my loving aunt just sent me an email about all the things I can't do :  "How are you on the blessed occasion.  22 year ago you were brought into this world.  Now look at you. . . . . your head is too big for your shoulders, you have 100's of shoes with a limited number of places to go,  you cant get a touch-up and . . . . . . . you are in Japan!"   You just gotta love family huh?   Its 6:45am and I'm off to a good start. Feeling love by the people who mean the most to me and that's what this birthday things is about right. So I'm going to go to the middle school today and to the junior high. Have a good day, go out with Sanae and friends tonight (did I mention she has a Black boyfriend from Kentucky who is in grad school here?) have a few drinks and have a good time. I'm going to call Hazel and Terry and let them know where we are going to be. Okay, so head up, spirits high, I'm eating breakfast and I'm going out to face the world of little Japanese children! Ganbate!!    "I woke up this morning the sunshine was shining and put on a happy face!"   by the way Jenn where is my CD?

      Last night I had my first Japanese lesson. Muramatsu sensei is going to be tough but she is going to get me speaking Japanese. I told her that I was on a intermediate listening level but a very basic speaking level.During our lesson she evaluated my speaking, listening and writing skills by worksheets, reading from the textbook and talking with me. She has her own classroom with desks, a copy machine and a chalkboard. I really felt like I was in a class which is what I needed to get me focused on learning again. I've been out of school for almost a year now and this is definitely different but I will enjoy it.  I just so intimidated to speak just like my students do with me, so I totally know how they are feeling. I told her that I was really glad she is going to be my teacher and that I think I'm going to learn a lot with her because of how she teaches. Two of her daughters speak English very well and they are nice too I'm glad to have another English speaking "friend" so that if I need anything I don't really have to depend on Harada sensei (the Japanese English teacher I work with).  She was very impressed but told me that I had a lot in my head that she wanted to help bring out of me. We are going to meet each week for 2 hours and I only have to pay her 1000 yen, which is like 8 bucks in the US. She is a volunteer with the International Center in Kofu and that is the deal that they have worked out with all their volunteers. I'd heard some bad things about going through them because sometimes the volunteers aren't trained teachers and they are sometimes more excited about talking with foreigners than they are actually teaching, but Muramatsu sensei seems to be very trained and had a variety of textbooks that she wanted to choose from depending on my ability so, I'm excited! Yeah!!!!  Like everyday in my life in Japan and with every good thing comes a not so good thing. So, I'm trying to get out of sensei's driveway but it is a one lane road and her driveway is also very narrow. When I got here I was following her so I pulled and and she guided me in as I tried to park. On the way out, she said goodbye to me from the door and I was left to fend for myself...I was probably out there backing in and pulling out for about 5 mins (which seems like an eternity when you are performing a task that should take seconds) when she came out to guide me out. I wanted her to just get in and back me the hell out of there but that wasn't happening. I guess she didn't want to be liable if anything happened but my frustration level was steadily rising..at one point I was stuck between the concrete gate of her driveway, and the gate that blocks the other side of the street with my car blocking traffic in both directions. These streets are just so extremely narrow! Nonetheless, I have a slavedriving, but good teacher. I have homework already on the first lesson, but I'm glad to be back studying.     I'm learning and lovin' life.

      Yesterday was the school festival at Toyoshige Elementary School. It began around 9am, I got there about 10. The students had a sports day where you split up the 1st -6th graders (all the students) into two teams.  The red team and the white team. The compete in sports events like tug of war, and basket toss and the neat thing is that the parents participate with them. Its like a mother/father basket toss.  There is another where they race to get things like a scavenger hunt with their parents. The have games that the older men and women in the village compete in as well like bowling and croquet (i think that's what its called). The students also have a marching band which was really very good. I saw a lot of my junior high school students there as well. I had a good time and ate an obento lunch with the teachers in the teachers' room. I left there around 1:30pm and came home to prepare for my camping adventure.  I went to Lake Shiriberiko (something like that) in this town called Ichikawadaimon.  It was rainy all day yesterday and I once again really didn't want to go. I did however because I'd already reserved my spot and thought that it would be fun to meet some of the older JETs and members of YETI (yamanashi english teachers inc) that I had not yet met. The drive up the mountain was steep, rainy and very winding so I was very pleased when I finally reached the top.  Then once I got there the cabin we were staying in was on the opposite side of the lake entrance so I had to carry my things a pretty far way. Since it was raining, I left my futon and swim gear in the car. But low and behold when I got to the other side there were people in the water while its raining swimming.  All I can say is to each his own.  Then there were people who just drink all damn day. It gets quite old and people didn't really seem to get sick. I just don't feel comfortable with any of them enough to be pissy drunk. I've only been drinking  beer since I've been here which is also rough on my stomach. At home, a few coronas every now and then is cool, but this Asahi beer is not as light. Nor does it get you tipsy as fast so I just don't like drinking here that much. Not to mention the British girls I've met can drink just about every American girl I know under the table so I don't bother to get into the contests.  I like being around other English speakers and there are always some young Japanese people that hang out with YETI too which is also very cool, I'm just not into the drink until you pass the hell out thing.  I finally met Peter or "Junior" as they all call him. He went to UNC came in the year before me. Of course we never knew each other but it is good to connect on some of the UNC stuff and people we both know about. He was in Chi Psi his freshman and sophomore years so he knew a lot of the UNC Student Body Presidents and friends so that was very cool.  There was a UNC sweatshirt hanging up in the cabin and it was so funny because we both thought it was each other's but it ended up being some girl from New Zealand's who I later found out only bought the sweater because it was blue and had no idea what or where UNC was!! Too wierd.  There was a lovely bon fire and some Brazilian guys who were camping across the lake from us came over and brought a stereo and some music to party too so that was kinda wild.  Two guys went swimming naked and then maybe 6 other people went swimming with them but they all had on suits. This all was going on around 11pm so of course the lake was pitch black.  There was a toilet out there but I refused to go because it was literally an outhouse type thing with a hole in the ground. It had the appearance of a porcelin hole and the smell was atrocious!  I had to go in the woods and would much  rather than to vomit from the sheer smell alone.  I wore my grey ARMY t-shirt and ARMY hoodie that G gave me so everyone kept asking me if I was in the freakin' ARMY. One guy even told him that I was intimidating him because the letters were so big and bold...my response...get some balls man, its just a f'...in jacket.  The wildest things tend to bother folks.  Oh, and I met the editor of the YETI newsletter called the NASH. She told me that the needed writers and asked if I'd write an opinion column. I have PLENTY of opinions so why not put them to some good use?  I'm not sure what my column will be about this time though, but I'm sure it will come to me. I told her the only way I'd write is if she could promise me fortune and fame and she did so I said I'd do it. I think it will be fun.  This morning at 5am, my cell phone alarm begins going off in a cabin of about 40 people all laid out across this huge tatami matted floor and I had to tip toe across them to find the damn phone in the bottom of my purse. I was sorry to wake folks up but most of them had been drinking heavily so it didn't phase them much. I couldn't go back to sleep after that so I laid there for a while and all the random snoring started to get to me so I got up and went outside where some other early birds had already gone. They cooked some bacon that they'd found left from the day before and had eaten it by the time I got out there. I couldn't believe they cooked any meat that had sat out all night and pork of all meats...but that's their guts not mine! I helped them clean up the yard and we of course in japanese style had to separate the garbage by burnables, cans, bottles, and plastic. We started crushing the beer cans to make room for more in the bag and once we started doing that we basically woke up the rest of the camp site. I think some people got pissed, but I didn't think you were supposed to sleep until noon when you were camping anyway right?   Overall review: It didn't really feel like camping, met some cool people including a fellow tarheel, have a new hobby and direction for my writing, don't plan to attend anymore YETI events if I don't really want to go, confirmation received that I'm not in Kansas anymore. . .Off to shower, then to lake Shoji. My JH students are canoeing today, then I have my Japanese lesson in Kofu.     Never subject yourself to listening to Bob Marley's "Redemption song" sung by a half drunk acoustic guitar player from the US-Midwest. Its not worth your time and will probably piss you off for disrespecting Bob like that.

      My mom is so funny. She sent me 4 email b-day cards yesterday..all of which are very very sweet.  urlLink First ,  urlLink Second ,   urlLink Third ,  urlLink Fourth . She usually doesn't forget my birthday. This year I think she is starting out early. I was telling a friend of mine tonight that since my 17th bday I can't remember one that wasn't really fun or spent with folks I really care about or had tons of fun with.  I'm not talking about it in a bad way, just an introspective way.  Today she sent me  urlLink this one . Its really thoughtful of her and very sweet so I'm glad she remembers.   One thing I'm realizing more and more is the simplicity of little things. I've realized the value of them for quite some time now but as time goes on I value them more. Like a strong thick absorbant towel or the sun setting around 7:30 or 8pm in the summer time or seeing things written in AM/PM time instead of 24 hour or military time. Little things like washing dishes in a sink that is a least waist high so your back doesn't hurt when you are done washing, things like living room chairs with legs, not just seats and backs, things like having your toilet sink and shower all in the same room, things like turning on the tv and understanding what folks are saying even if its nothing you want to watch, things like driving on the left hand side of the road, and directional/highway signs that are green not blue. Small things like stop signs that are shaped like octagons not triangles, things like shopping for shoes and actually being able to buy some in a store, things like looking around and seeing people who look like you even if there is only one or two others in a sea of thousands. . .the smiles you exchange are worth a million bucks. Now these are not complaints, just little things, observations if you will. Adaptions that I'm making mentally and adding more and more to the list daily, which is okay because for one thing I add there is usually something else I know I can do without. Things I thought I could not live w/o that have virtually no use to me here, like a million pairs of jeans when I go to work and home every day and on the weekends, I wear that one comfortable pair that I usually wore on weekends at home...    Value the little things.

      So tonight I go to Michelle's for girl's night and movie watching. Everything was cool we had tons of snacks like last week and MIchelle fixed these delicious tacos! After dinner we sat talked and digested each other's last week of activities. I was telling them how I've canceled my school lunch because just about everyday there is something I can't eat because it has pork in it. I was also saying how I don't really like the fact that I'll be bringing my own lunch because that is more work on me in the mornings to make sure I don't forget it and that I have a healthy lunch planned, etc. I go on to say how even more frustrating it is because I can't just bring a sandwich unless its peanut butter and jelly because the only sandwich meat that have here is ham.  So then I hear about three people say at once, "Or a cheese sandwich". I thought I was going to lose my dinner for laughing so hard. Keep in mind that the only other person of color is Michelle who is Mexican. The other 4 girls are white. I didn't really realize that white folks actually ate cheese sandwiches. I thought that was just a joke Bernie Mack tells and other comedians. These girls could not figure out why I couldn't stop laughing. So I had to give them the Bernie Mack joke about how Black folks, when we go on break, that's just what we do, WE BREAK.  We go shopping, get our hair done, check out a movie sometimes...and white folks take about at 15min break to eat their cheese sandwiches and go back to work. They started laughing a little bit too. I also had to tell them, that unless a Black person tells you that they are a vegetarian...don't give them no sandwich with meat! I am laughing just thinking about that mess!  Those girls are funny. I seem to learn something new about them each time we hang out. I think we are forming a Friday dinner and a movie crew.  Which works for me, I just like being able to come back to my own bed and sleep.  Cheese sandwiches. I never would have thought...

      What a week this has been. I'm so glad its Friday! I feel like I've been running on E for about two days now and it doesn't look like I"ll get much rest this weekend either. Last weekend was cool. I ended up having a better time than I thought at the little girls sleepover thing. We watched  Bridget Jones Diary  which by the way is a great movie. We talked a lot and I got to know some of the new and old ALTs better so I'm glad I went.  The next morning two of the girls went out to McDonald's (my FAV!) and got breakfast. After half the girls left a few of us lazied around the apt and finally started moving around 12. We took showers and decided to go to a BBQ that another JET in the prefecture was having.  I guess we ended up getting there around 3ish. It was cool too. The only thing that I think is kinda weird is how clique-ish the British folks can be sometimes. Its almost like Japanese folks, where they are cool, but it takes them a while to get comfortable around you...that is how they are too. They stick in groups of other British people, but when they like you than all is well. Its weird because I have to work hard enough to get Japanese folks to loosen up around me that I don't like to feel like that around other foreigners/English speakers.  So after the BBQ I went to a fireworks display and festival in a nearby town called Ichikawadaimon. The fireworks were sporadic. Like one display every five minutes. This went on for about 2 hours. Which started of course to piss me off because the lady on the loud speaker would say in this high as nasally voice "Arigatogozaimasu, Orimasu" --which means like "Thanks, We're Done" Then five minutes later, another short display...WEIRD!  Some folks from the BBQ Saturday talked me into going to this waterfall on Sunday. We left Kofu at 9:30 which means I had to get up at like 8:00am on Sunday. NOT HAPPY. But the waterfall was worth it. We had to hike up to the waterfall, which I didn't know in advance. I thought we were just going to the waterfall and it wasn't far or a long way away. WRONG! I was soooo tired on the way up and the guy who was leading the group of about 12 or 13...maybe 13...yeah 13...well he was a BEAST!!! He was takin' us way too fast. I had to sit down on the way up for real. The group was dying too but no one really wanted to be the ONE that makes the group stop. I felt bad about it and prayed for strength and endurance the entire way up, but I just couldn't keep going. Once we got to the top there were 3 beautiful cascading waterfalls. It was gorgeous. The middle fall was the one we played on the most. It had a natural slide on it. The water is coming so fast and hard that you just sit and it pushes you down. The first time I did it, I was very very scared but after the initial fear it was just like going down a waterslide only you are sliding on rocks! The water is very cold and very unkind. Its not the kind of place you go if you can't swim and even if you can...you have to be alert because its is really moving fast. I almost lost my shoe. I got one of the girls who was with me to take pictures of me going down the second time and some at the actual top. I can't wait until we get those back.  So going to work this work to say the least was tiring because I had not gotten any rest at all this weekend.  I don't think one thing in particular wore me out specifically other than that fact that I'm having some attitude/communication issues with the English teacher I work with. I think most of it is cultural but there are something that are certainly not just different cultures.  By the end of the week it had gotten much better which makes me lean more towards adjusting. I hope things continue to improve...she has a boyfriend or some overnight caller so maybe that'll loosen her up!  Tonight I've been invited to another live it up girl's night but I can't do that two weeks in a row, plus I'm tired.  This girl from Mexico I met is really cool and she is having it at her house which we call the Temple. # 1 because its big as hell! # 2 because it is actually the annex to a temple. Her place is HUGE!!! She has a whole two tatami rooms that she doesn't really use!  Its good to have extra space, but they could have better allocated that space. Maybe by placing a couple there, or someone with kids? I don't know. She seems to really like it though. So anyway, I'm going to go to the Temple tonight for dinner but I'm not going to stay. I told Michelle that yesterday.  There is also a camping trip with the Teachers Org -YETI - on Saturday that I plan to go to. I have to go to a sports festival at one of my Elementary schools, Toyoshige, 9am in the morning on Saturday so after I leave there I will go to the lake where the camping will be.  Then Sunday at 5:30pm I will begin my first Japanese lesson.  The lady from the volunteer center finally called me back and I am matched up with a woman named Natsuko. She has two daughters who are both in college I think. They go somewhere close to home though because they come home on the weekends and will be there Sunday evening when I go to her house.  I hope that this works out well. Both of her daughters have been to the States. Each stayed for a year and learned English. Natsuko told me that she wants to help foreigners learn Japanese because people were so nice to her daughters and she will return the favor. I have to pay her like 500yen an hour and our lessons are 2 hours long. That is very cheap for language lessons but sometimes the volunteers want to talk to you more in English than they do in Japanese which isn't good. They told us this at the International Center, but they also said that its worth a try.  What a weekend I have planned for myself and still I feel like I'm kinda going through the motions. I don't really feel like these are things I'm excited about doing but that may be because I'm just tired right now and also because I'm going to be with a bunch of strangers on my b-day....i think my feelings have to do with pre-Birthday anxiety or maybe not anxiety maybe just "Pre-Birthday, first time spending it away from folks I love, you're really in Japan E Blues" (Smile) I can't help but laugh at some of the stupid things that pass through this brain of mine.   23 huh...and they say the best is yet to come....well i'm eagerly awaiting it!

      My 9th grade class has been out pickin' mushrooms in the woods surrounding our school for the last month or so (remember the fateful accident where I feel and gouged huge holes in my hand). Well, on Tuesday, one group of students found a seemingly abandoned tent in the woods. One of the members of that group found what looked to him like a human bone! So they went back and reported all of this to the principal who in turned called the police.  The police went out and investigated the tent and talked to the students and found that someone had committed suicide in the tent! Talk about surprised!!! All of the students had to go into the prinicipals office w/the police officer and he in turn told them what he found. Japan needs to get it together because their folks are really just committing suicide left and right out here.

      Gosh, its been about a week since I last came here to blog. I feel like a stranger in my own journal.  Last week was like a whirlwind trying to catch up from being away in Gunma for 4 days. I went to a really fun Halloween party this weekend and didn't really dress up as anything but I wore a black dress my black knee boots and my friends wig, i put on make up and stuff like I was going out...but the thing is folks here so rarely see me dressed up like...uh...NEVER! So when I got to the party, people were kinda cordial but weren't acting like they knew who I was! I was so surprised, but the wig hair is really long and looked pretty good on (from what others say, you know how modest I am...I'd never say). I can't wait until I see the pictures from that night. I ended up staying with my friend Alberto  I wanna go home for Christmas!!! I won't be able to buy my ticket for two more weeks and I know the prices are going to be off the roof by then. A friend of mine was supposed to come visit but I guess things just got real busy for her and she just couldn't get back to me...its sad but now I'm ready to go home. My mom isn't expecting me. She didnt' think I'd have the funds. Honestly I didn't either and unless I get a really good deal from the travel agent, I may be here for the holidays...I'll just keep praying that all will work out well.

      I just got finished watching this movie called  urlLink Black and White .  Its a really good movie. I would definitely suggest renting it if you can get hold of the movie. I saw the trailer on one of the tapes I rented from the Video Store.  The movie is crazy...it deals a lot with race, but I guess my problem is movies like that only make me have less trust in people. I'm thinking the main point was no matter what color you are and what your position is in life you can still be shady and scandelous.  There were a lot of plots going on together but it was very well written as well as acted  RACE: is constantly in my face. I can't decide how I feel about race. I can't decided if its colors that separate us or history or both and more...uh, as if enough things in life aren't confusing me like present and past tense and japanese verbs, now I'm on this quest to dechiper how I feel about race. I think what I'll do is begin my own sort of race chronicles. Separate from this blog of course because after all this is supposed to be decided to my life in Japan,  like race isn't a factor in that...?   Anyway, My inside voice and outside voice are competing so its time to go.

      I love Harlem Nights. This is my most recent find in the book store called "Book Off". They have all the used CDs and movies you could think of. I have been slowly adding to my movie collection buy films that are 500-900yen ($4-7). My favorite line from the movie is when Benny says to Vera "well swallow it and shut the F up!" Classic Movie line!   I am reading a new book called  urlLink Manchild in the Promise land . Erica gave it to me this weekend. I had been reading Harry but it wasn't holding my attention. I still have every intention to finish up the first book I started, but I am enjoying this book so far. Reading, studying Japanese and watching movies consumes my after work time. But that is cool with me because I like doing all three!

      Not a the relaxing week or weekend I envisioned. When I decided to go to Gunma to visit my friend Erica, I didn't know that I'd end up working Thursday and Friday!!! I was supposed to be taking my vacation days for having to work, but ended up at work with her teaching both days!  It was fun I must say having more students to play with and talk to since her school is so big, but still, it was work.  We had a good time though, catching up and doing some shopping.  I bought a few long sleeve shirts to hold me off until I get the last bit of my winter clothes here. We hung out with some of the ALTs (English teachers) from her prefecture and they are quite different from my Yamanashi peeps. I'm sure she thinks our folks are weird but I've grown used to hanging out with them. Our prefecture is so small that I see just about all the ALTs from the JET program that live here often and we know each others names and its all cool. With Erica's folks, she was just introduced to a lot of them for the first time. It helps to me with getting adjusted knowing that there are so many other people who I can call or talk to that don't live very far away. My prefecture is also much prettier than hers. The are so many mountains and small valley villages and the leaves are starting to change and driving past nature in all its glory, I just love it! Going to her prefecture was a nice drive. It took me about 3 hours. But once you get there its nothing but country and flat land. She lives in an apartment complex called Maruwa Heights. There are nothing but Brazilians out there and anything called "Heights" you know from the door is ghetto! It was a lot of fun, good time was had and coming home was much appreciated.  My friend Hazel gave me a flower before I left and when I got home...it was almost dead. I still think she is trying to hold on so I'm bringing her to school tomorrow to see if the school secretary or science teacher (who both have very green fingers) can help make her better. I hope so..I took a picture of the flower just in case. My flower's name is Hana, which means flower in Japanese.

      Yet another really fun weekend.  Friday I went to Yamanashi City for a birthday party for a JET who lives near here.   Saturday  I was in a parade in Kofu. I thought it was going to be boring but it ended up being really fun. I was with a large group of foreigners. People from Russia, China, Canada, Brazil, and many other places. We paraded up and down the street with the rest of the parade dancers and did some really fun easy dances. I had a great time. My friend took pictures of us...soon to come.   Sunday  I had folks over for a sleep over. I felt quite domestic. I fried chicken, made rice and noodles and put together a salad. We drank tea and of course, beer. We watched some movies I had in my small collection and talked about books and magazines we've read recently. It was really fun to get together and I think they enjoyed themselves. They marveled over how big my place is which is small in American standards but in Japan its rather large.   Monday ...the end of my long weekend. I took my houseguests up to Lake Shoji to see Mt. Fuji. We took a bunch of really nice pictures up there and then I took them all back to Kofu. On my way home, I found a beautiful park about 10 mins away from my house.  I went there and spent the afternoon watching families, enjoying the sunshine, and studying my Japanese. Its a really great place and it even has a path for running. I was glad to find such a nice park, but was really disturbed by something as I was leaving. I went to my car which was parked beside the road and I saw a small boy who couldn't have been more than 7 years old who was cripple and walking alone down the narrow street.  As he got closer I could see that he was crying...so I got out of my car and went over to him and asked him, "Are you alright?" (in Japanese of course) He didn't say anything, but he stopped crying.  Then I asked him, "Where is your mom?" And didn't answer so I started walking with him back in the direction that he came from. As I was walking with him, this Japanese man and his young daughter came over. The looked at me a little funny then they walked off with the little boy talking to him in fast Japanese. It wasn't his dad or sister, but they took him to his folks. When I drove back around, the guy waved at me and nodded. Its really hard to read Japanese people's expessions but I'm glad that the little boy found his family.

      Its finally the weekend and boy am I ready for it. Last night I went to dinner with some JETs up in this town called Yamanashi City. Just before I was leaving some JETs called me from Masuho and asked if I'd pick them up. Its about 20 mins down the mountain for me, but I also had to go to Kofu to pick up the futons for my sleepover on sunday. I ended up driving and hour and a half each way tonight to L-River. Trust I won't be doing that again.

      The biggest topic in my life recently has been interracial dating.  I guess the first thing was when a friend of mine told me that she was dating white men.  I thought it strange at first but then starting doing some thinking about it.  The next thing was the July issue of Essence Magazine...Cover story "When Mr. Right is White", then a conversation with my aunts on IM about it, then talking with a friend in London, and on and on. Today I got two emails regarding it which were sent to me from a friend whom I'd been discussing the topic with.   The first was from a sister who was having trouble finding the "Black Mr. Right" so she decided to date a wonderful white guy who had class, style, sense of humor, good job, caring, yada yada...they dated for a while and it ended in her dumping him because she was trying to fight for the black race and didn't feel like it was right to have a white man by her side. The conclusion was basically that you can't be Pro-Black while dating a white person. Hmmm....I wasn't going to at first, but I have to include her comments here:   This dude was taking me out, kicking it with me, supporting my endeavors, conversing with me on a plethora of topics, bringing me flowers, etc.. I have yet to find a Mandigo with the same characteristics knocking at my door (which would be a dream come true). However, after much mental and emotional debate, and after talking to my overly opinionated father, I couldn't justify with myself, how I could date a white man and concurrently hold a position as one of the leaders of this milleneum's revolution. So that leaves me with what? Between Mr. Charlie and an empty bed. LOL. It eventually led to turning down potential attention, love and affection because my passion for my race and fighting the injustices that people have mainatined on us, is soo strong.    So, at the present time, I do believe that it is a contradiction for a man to cry about the injustices he faces as a black man, and then lend is emotional well being to the same individual who is inherently responsible for those injustices. Dr. King had a dream, yes, but if he was indeed sleeping with a white girl, like so many militant Panthers and revolutionaries, he was wrong. Period.    The response to her email was a sister saying that she wants Ms. Black Power to slow down a little bit. Here is what the other sister had to say:   Whoa! I fully support your decision to find your purpose and start working toward a better life for our people. I certainly admire the fact that you have matured into a young woman who knows her responsibility in life goes beyond fulfilling her own dreams, but taking care of the dreams of the future. HOWEVER, you do not have to put YOUR happiness on hold to continue working toward the goal. So he's white? Big deal! You're not looking to get married today. You should be looking to experience life and the beauty one can find in things different. Companionship, laughter, support -- those things don't see color. My dream man is black and beautiful, but I will not close my options at this point in my life. I don't go out seeking to date a certain color, but I'll be open to any intelligent, funny, caring and sensible man. Problem is, none, no matter what color they are, are stepping to me!  So, Miss, you better stop trying to fit the image of a revolutionist before the romantic revolution passes you by.     Couldn't have said it better myself.

      I'm supposed to be having a sleepover at my house this weekend. As of now, I have 3 people that are confirmed to be coming. The only problem I see arising is NO ONE had a freakin' car! Meaning I have to pick everyone up from the train station. The most I can fit at a time is 3 so as much as I want folks to be able to visit, I don't want to have to take numerous trips up and down that mountain from my house to Kofu. I'll know for sure about numbers toward the end of the week because Erica is thinking about coming down with a friend of hers from Gunma. E's friend went to Spellman and the girl I know went to Clark so it will be cool for them to meet. Its Kofu week here and there is a big International parade on Saturday that Alberto signed me up for, but I still haven't decided whether or not I want to be "on display" anymore than I already am. We'll see how the weekend shapes up. I know I do need to clean up and wash some clothes before they come so they will have somewhere to sit!

      What a great weekend! On Friday night the girls soccer team from Yamanashi went to dinner at this great Italian restaurant in Kofu. The meals were kind of expensive but the portions were so large that we just decided to split dishes which cut costs and leftovers. It was good. 12/14 of us were there. It was really nice to all be together for the first time. The bonding began at dinner and continued on from there. I stayed at Katie's house and drove up with her and another car full of people first thing (5AM) Saturday morning. The drive was about 3 hrs and we were doing 120km/h just about the whole way there! The guy I was following was FLYING! At one point, I was like "nah dawg" I have to risk getting lost because he was really speeding around these curbs.  We arrived in Nagano around 8:30ish dropped our bags changed clothes and went out on the field to  urlLink warm up .Since we had 14 girls from Yamanashi and we were playing 6 a-side the team co-ordinators wanted us to have 2 teams of 7. Our teams were Yama Mama's and Mama Yama's. We had a cheer, pom poms, matching outfits, and headbands. My team was pretty good although we went 0-4.  The first day we played 3 games and on our field it seemed like the more serious set of girls were there. The other Yamanashi women's team went 1-1-2. They were good and really seemed to gel as a team early which helped out.   Out of all the teams we played the girls from Osaka were the most bitchy. They complained about everything!!! Rules, offsides, rough housing (when they were the roughest of all the teams we played), so when my team played them in our last game of the day on Friday we were already down 0-2 so we decided to forget winning and take them out. We were tired of hearing them whine and run over people all day.  So that is exactly what we did!!! It was soo fun too! I playing defense and basically trying to take this one big girl down the whole game. My teammates were so funny because they were encouraging me to be mean!!  It was so funny...I stole the ball from the big girl like 4 times and she kept coming at me the same way...I figured she'd learn but apparently not. I think they were getting mad about me tripping them and stuff so one big girl came down and took me out! I got up right away but my head was spinning. I was literally seeing the little stars that spin around the cartoon characters heads! I had to sit out for a second or two but I got myself together and watched the last 2 mintues of the game.  It was a lot of fun.    My friend Erica came down to hang out with the Yamanashi folks and they really like her too. They said she was funny and that I should tell her to come down to our prefecture to hang out with us sometime. There was a party that night at the hotel we stayed in which was a lot of fun. The DJ had a lot of hip hop but got stuck on house music too long. Our team "SAID" we weren't going to drink much because we still had a game to play Sunday morning....but it didn't quite work out like that. Someone found our goalie in the bathroom drunk and one of our forwards was caught kissing on some randome guy in the back of the party. Our girls were done to say the least.  As for me...I had 2 cans of Chu Hi (which is like flavored beer), two glasses of wine (different brands), one beer for the toast of the party, a cup of sake, another can of beer because I was the last one to hit the floor for GRENADE!!! (tell you about that later), and some rum and coke that my friend Charlie KEPT making me drink.  I was definitely done that night! But what surprised me the most was that in the morning I was good. I wasn't sick or anything...and I usually can't mix at all so I was lucky. Erica had everything I had except the Chu Hi and her no-having-tolerance self kept saying "I want some more to drink, I'm not drunk yet" I am learning that when she says this...She's DONE!   Ladies and Gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. I, Eboni Staton, met a black guy in Japan!!!! Don't get to excited...he has a girl friend and lives about a million hours away..but it made for a nice weekend. Out of the 500 people at the tourney there were 5 black women and 3 black men.  When I came downstairs Saturday morning dressing in my uniform (looking cute with my French braids and bandana tied around my head might I add) he looked so shocked to see me. We exchanged pleasantries and went off to our respective fields to warm up.  He wasn't the cutest thing but by the end of the dance (and after many many drinks) both Erica and I thought he looked much better.  He was a little cocky and was like "I'm the only black guy in here, I know you want to dance with me" And just for that I let the negro dance alone until his Jamaican groupies came along. Who I might add were dressed up in Rave and Rainbow clothing while everyone else had on jeans and t-shirts. Go figure?!  GRENADE-drinking game where you have a "Grenade Master" who during the night will periodically call out "GRENADE" and everyone has to get down on the floor all the way. Not just hands and knees...all the way!  If you don't hear the grenade master or you are last to get down...you have to down whatever drink it is you have in your hand...if you don't have a drink in hand, they will get you one.  Sunday morning was quite a sight!! We had one more person in our room than had been there all night. A guy from our prefecture that we all know didn't have anywhere to sleep so when Erica and I went to bed, he came up and stayed in the room with us and the 3 other girls who were in our room. The hotel we stayed at was Japanese style so there are tatami mats on the floor and futons, blankets, pillows, and sheets in the closet. Its much more economical this way because you can fit many more people in the room.  All 14 of us were so beat up from Saturday's activities that we WANTED to get put out early so we wouldnt have to continue playing. Our wish came true! Both teams lost in the first round and went to go watch the end of the boys tournament.    I had a GREAT time! I definitely want to go back to Nagano when YETI has their ski trip in February. Hopefully I'll be able to go back before then. I really enjoyed myself with the  urlLink ladies  and  urlLink gentlemen  of our Yamanashi group. We were by far the most outstanding-ken and had the most fun. I didn't mention the game of  urlLink strip soccer  did I??

      Yo, in my old age, I really think I'm starting to get some emotional bones in my body. I was in here watching "Something to talk about" with Julia Roberts and I had to sit in here and fight back the tears! I'm not even kidding! I watched that and Curly Sue tonight so my movie collection is officially exhausted. I need to find a new Book Off Store with some good movies in it.   Tonight I fixed some of the best chicken nuggets I've ever tasted. They were frozen and all I had to do was warm them up but when I ate them with a pinch of mustard...my taste buds exploded!!! This chicken is giving me new inspiration for cooking! (if you call microwaving, cooking). I had to bring my own lunch to school today so I packed up some pineapple rings, Ritz crackers and spaghetti that I cooked this morning.  I'm going to make mixed pasta for tomorrow's lunch. I bought some bread at the store today so I'll have that too. Not sure what else. I'm not really good at making balanced meals...I have to come up with a better system than this day by day thing. I'm trying hard not to take peanut butter and jelly sandwiches everyday because that's what they expect. I'll get it together sooner or later.  We've been told all day that this typhoon was going to overflow the river in front of my house and that all kinds of terrible weather was coming this way. This is typhoon #21 for Japan this year and the biggest so far. We ended up leaving school a bit early today because of all the high winds and rain.  Around 6pm the winds picked up and it got quite bad. But it has definitely calmed down a lot. Its supposed to hit Yamanashi at midnight, so we'll see. I'll be sleep so I probably won't know. All of our windows have bars on them so if something hits the window it won't break immediately. We also have storm doors what are made of all metal that close over the glass window sliding doors.  It makes it quite safe for flying objects and shattering windows so I won't have a problem sleeping at all.  I'm going to read a little Harry Potter then I'm taking it to bed. I've been so sleepy in the mornings that I just feel like going to be earlier tonight. Oyasumi!

      Thanksgiving night. A night I initially started to spend alone with some fried chicken and a bowl of macaroni...but boy am I glad I didn't. I got an invite to go have dinner with some of my favorite folks here in Yamanashi who I rarely get to hang with so I was really happy!  Sue had about 8 of us over to her place. I drove to Fujiyoshida to meet Chris, Sylvia, and Ollie. Then we met, Elise, Rob, Dave and Sue at her house. It was a lot of fun. It was potluck dinner so everyone brought something or made something pretty tasty. Sue made pumpkin squash with cinnamon apples inside. Which was surprisingly good.  Chris and Sylvia made perogies w/Japanese sweet potato inside and brought some mashed potatoes with them. Sylvia also made this DELICIOUS apple/cranberry sauce which tasted a lot like apple butter. I brought my special, from the box with a little addition, macaroni and cheese. Elise and Rob made brownies and a big pot of a differnt type of potatoes. We had white rice as well and Dave and Ollie brought drinks.Oh Sue also made a pumpkin pie like filling for a sponge cake which was also surprisingly good. It wasn't until after we'd finished that she told me she added TOFU to the mix, but...it was still really good.  We listened to some of Elise and Rob's country music (they're both from the midwest) and I brought my Kenny G Christmas tape. Sue had Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas CD and hella other great music. We sat, ate, and talked and then  made a Thanksgiving toast using this Plum Wine which is strong and sweet.  I really should hang with them more often. I borrowed a book from Sue and she made me a tape. I'm glad that Elise, Rob, Sylvia, and Chris are from the States because our friendship doesn't have to end here. Sue is from Canada and hey, now I have a reason to visit!  I was teaching my students today about Thanksgiving and I am really thankful that I didn't have to be alone tonight. God is good.

      So its 2:50 in the morning on Thursday (but in my mind its still Wednesday because I have not gone to bed yet) and I'm just getting in from the Earth Wind and Fire concert in Tokyo. Boy did I have a good time. I can't wait to tell my Uncle Derek. He's going to be sooo jealous. I know he has just about every album they every released (i'm talking vinyl here) but I wonder if he's seen them perform live before. At any rate, it was a heck of a trip to Tokyo (during which I finished Harry Potter book 3). The skies were so clear and it nice outside. Once I arrived at Tokyo station I took a cab up the block (not even a full block) to the concert hall with the cabby fussing the whole way about how a probably lost him a decent fair driving not even a kilometer up the block. I told him in the worst Japanese I could muster that I was paying him, I didn't know where the hall was ( I really didn't) and that he would be alright. He was asking why I didn't ask someone on the street for directions. I told him that "over there" wasn't the best of directions, cause that's all I got on the street. He was pissed when I got out but like I said, he'd be alright.   Okay so once I arrive at the concert Hall, there of course is a long line of people waiting to get upstairs. But its 6:45 at this point and the show is supposed to start at 7...to make a long irriating story short, I cut line (I refused to stand in that long ass line and I was by myself), walked past the security and took my seat. The show didn't start until 8. Although, I sat pissed about the show running late (which meant I'd have to take a later train) boy did all those feelings of resentment flood away when they took the stage. I now know that I am the granny that Erica always calls me! Verdine White the bass player was so energetic I felt like he was on a lil' something, Phillip Bailey's voice was out of this WORLD, he is the voice of EWF now. Maurice White, well he was okay but definitely looking old. He wore these really cute white and green ADIDAS with some white silk pants and changed his top all of which were extremely form fitting. Do I dare say it...well, I think the reason he doesn't tour with them as much anymore is because he is just getting to old to keep it up. EWF has been around a longgggg time. And he founded the group so I don't blame him, but its definitely starting to show. Oh then there's lil' Ralph Johnson who I almost wouldn't have known was there except for the fact he kept dancing with the dancing girls on stage. It was fun! OH, I didn't mention that about 30mins in I was taking pictures, with a camera I wasn't supposed to even have and got caught by a security guard. I got a good 3 in before they caught me though. So I hope those turn out pretty good. On they way out I saw something  I had to capture on film. There was a group of 3 Japanese guys dressed in 70's clothes. One had an enormous afro wig on and a disco ball necklace. They looked shocked but I asked if I could take their picture. Immediately one guy ushered me in the middle and 2 of them were around me and the third took the photo. Can't wait to see that one either.  Well, a great end to a wonderful night. I took the 11:50 train home from Tokyo arriving in Kofu at 2:00am. Drove 30mins up the mountain to my place and am now home at last. My room as finally warmed up with the help of both the kerosene and electric heaters..so I shall now brave the cold kitchen, cross over to the bathroom area, take out my contacts, brush my teeth and dream about "Space Fantasy" "Boogie Wonderland" and how Verdine White should really start thinking of new wardrobe tips! His fashion sense never really.....it never really....came all the way OVER (lol @ Bernie Mack). G'nite kind people.

      I've finished the second Harry Potter book! It was like I really couldn't put it down and it reads so fast I was on page 300 before I knew it and with only 40pages left to go, I couldn't put it down for the night. I had to finish it. So I'm enjoying the series but I guess its like the movie Titanic for me. Everyone hyped it up so much that I'm expecting a lot more than there really is. Well at least I can go see the "Chamber of Secrets" movie in peace now that I've finished the book. I told Erica today that I have 7 books here that I want to read before I go home for Christmas and if I keep reading at the pace I'm going now, I think I'll be able to do just that. We'll just have to see. Off to  bed now, and I hope that I don't have any Hogwarts dreams! (smile)

      On  Day 23  my task has been to come up with a Kwanzaa lesson that is easy enough for my students to understand. I have all levels of students. From K-9th grade bear in mind. So I fell like I'm almost working with 10 different lessons. I really want to teach my students this topic though, so I'm going to work really really hard on it. I'm not sure when I'll be able to teach it, but hopefully they will enjoy it.    Today I was also asked to be "Santa Claus" for a Christmas party that the Kindergardeners are having at Shoji Elementary. I think they are putting on a Christmas play and then I am supposed to be Santa and give out the toys. They also want me to sing some Christmas songs but that my dear, might be pushing it. Its 3 working days before I got home for the holidays so I might be in good spirits.

      Being in my home all weekend, cooking normal food, watching US movies, and reading English books, I almost forgot where I was. The security of being home was really starting to fool me, but alas I have my Japanese language lesson today..and of course am about to do my homework now with about and hour and thirty minutes before class. Today is  Day 24 ...I have a feeling that this is going to be a long countdown...  I finally finished Harry Potter book 1 today. I want to hurry up and read book 2 before I go home because I want to go to the movies and see that for our family Christmas movie. Every year we go to the theater on Christmas day. I think initially we did it because just to have something to do so we didn't have to sit in the house all day, but now its tradition and I really enjoy it. Now, back to Harry. I liked the book. I think I would have liked it better if I didn't see the movie because there weren't many things in the movie that weren't in the actual book. It makes me think much more of the movie and want to see it again because its rare to find a movie that captures oh so much of the book. So, now on to my next quest...Harry Potter Book 2. The Chamber of Secrets. It sounds a pretty interesting. I mentioned to one of my friends here that I wanted to read the series and she borrowed books 3 and 4 from one of her Japanese friends who has read them all. The Potter series is not one that I would want to hold on to the rest of my life, but it was enjoyable. I'm sure the children like it a little better. Wish me luck with finishing it in the next  24  days.

      I know its not the big Turkey day yet, but I decided this weekend was my time to put up my Christmas decorations. I have a tree, some lights, garland, a few wreaths, and a (colored) Santa stocking. Oh, and I can't forget the handmade "Eboni's Home for the Holidays COUNTDOWN" calendar that I made which now hangs beautifully above my small tree. Today begins my official countdown with  Day 25 . Each night before bed, I'll go in the livingroom (I plan on moving my bed back into the bedroom when its sleepy time...good thing its on rollers) and tear off a numbered paper revealing the new number of days left before my return home.  Erica calls it pressed, but I call it excitement and anticipation. Since she isn't going home for the holidays, she has notified me that she will be preparing a "wish list" of things that she wants me to bring back for her.  This doesn't sound like a problem but I hope she doesn't get carried away with her requests.  Oh, news flash, I know its been a while since I've written on a regular bases so let me update you. My brother, Jon is getting married! Can you believe that! I know, he's still only 21, he'll be 22 on Dec 23, the day before his wedding. Yes, he is getting married on Christmas Eve. Mom and I had a conversation about the fact that I will probably be the Old Maid in the family (she didn't say that, actually she insists I won't) and how it feels as if this is the first wedding of all my siblings. Of the five of us, my older sister is already married but she ran off and did it like someone was going to stop her (go figure) so I didn't even know she was married until a few weeks later. At any rate, Jon's wedding is the first actually wedding of all of my mom's kids. Its really interesting to think of "fat boy" (what i called him all through is wonder years, even though he is about 6'7" now and no where near fat) is about to have a home and a wife. I commend Jennifer for sticking in there with him and I wish them the best of luck. I've missed so much of his life because we are so different and since I was 16 never really lived under the same roof for more thant 3 months, 4 at most. I told mom that I was trying to think of something Japanese-ish to bring back with me but I keep thinking of him as a child and that he'd tear it up. I have to put those thoughts out of my head because in a month he will be someone's husband. Wow, that's hard to believe.  The good thing is that all of my mom's family will be in NC for the holidays. My grandma (mom's mom) and all her children (mom and her siblings). Uncle Tom (the baby of the fam) and his wife Angelica will be there from Texas. Aunt Connie her husband Chuck and Connie's youngest boy Adam will be there. Connie's oldest boy Gerald and his fiance Jean will be there. Connie's oldest child and daughter Kathy will be there with her husband and 2 kids. And of course my mom and all my siblings should be around...I think my oldest brother Chris is coming up from Florida with his girlfriend and their new baby (who I don't know, I actually don't even know the mother or the babies name.   As I sit here and trace my family tree, I realize that a lot of interracial marriages/relationships are here. It seems to have been that way for a long time. Out of the 5 siblings my mom has, she is the only one who married a Black person. And of the 5 siblings I have, Robyn better NOT be dating, I'm the only one who dates Black people...well Caroll does too, but she dates just about whatever race. That's interesting. Not good or bad, just interesting. I'd never looked at it like that before.  Its also cool that my grandmother isn't like most of the women I know from around her way in the south. Thinking that white people are trouble and that we shouldn't date outside our race. She's always been very welcoming to all of the people that her children and grandchildren have dated. That's what love is really all about.  Good ol' Vanceboro, North Carolina. God Bless you all.

       You know you ghetto:  when you move your bed into your livingroom because your bedroom is cold and doesn't have a tv.   You know you ghetto: when you drink red wine with fried chicken and don't see anything wrong with it until you friends point it out to you.   You know you ghetto: when put a pot of water on your kerosene heater to put some moisture in the air instead of investing in a room humidifier.   You know you ghetto:  when you use a brown marker color in the face of the white Santa Claus on the Christmas stocking left by your predecesor because you don't think Santa is really white.   You know you ghetto:  when you spend 3 hours on a Saturday afternoon trying to decipher 3 sentances of Japanese kanji so you can download Earth Wind and Fire's "Fantasy" "Boogie Wonderland" and "Let's Groove Tonight" as cellphone ringers!   You know you ghetto:  when the only time you take out your kitchen garbage is when it starts to smell.  I hate to admit it, but I my dear, am GHETTO.

      I bought my ticket home for Christmas today! It cost me a pretty penny but its worth it! I can't wait to see everyone. Its going to be weird doing that traveling by myself, but I'm excited!!! I've been trying to buy some Japanese traditional things to give folks but of course they are expensive. I have a Godchild to think about now, which won't be born until April, but still I gotta start getting her stuff...(okay I'm overly excited about the baby, sue me!)  It's going to be a busy visit home, but I'm looking forward to every moment of it. Yokatta Ne!

      I'm sitting in my livingroom watching ABC Monday night football (a day late) and what do I hear when they break for commercial? "Its gettin' hot in here" by Nelly Wow, ain't the world changin'?  I talked to Trenya the other day, and we were talking about the idiom "The more things change, the more things stay the same" ain't that the truth! What made me think of that you ask? I'm watching Dre Bly on TV...this guy I went to school with for 2 years, who tried to holla at my linesisters, get down with da frat...and he is playing ball on Nat'l TV (or should I say International) married with a wife and child....but he's the same old nigga to me.

      Well, I did it. I went to Tokyo this past weekend and got a perm! When I was in Yokohama last weekend, I met this girl named Tracey who lives on base down there. She recommended someone to me (Black chick) but she was book for the next 2 weekends, and you know me...when I decide that its time to do something, I need to do it right then or shortly thereafter. So, I called Tracey back and she gave me the info of this place in Tokyo that I should go. The owner is a guy named Mayo who is from NY but got family in Tarboro and Rocky Mt. (small freakin' world) He actually told me that he has a cousin named William Mayo that plays ball for UNC but I don't know that cat.   So I set up an appt for Saturday. I braided my hair up in cornrows after I made the appt so I didn't have to go around looking like a wild child for the rest of the week. It was cute too if I say so myself...anyway, I digress, as usual. So, when I get to this place its pretty nice, all the stylists except one are Japanese but have been to Atlanta and New York for training on how to do black hair and have a fair amount of black customers. The black girl who was in the shop was from St. Louis or something and kept acting like she wasn't happy to see me in there. I was kinda upset with her b/c you  know me, its so rare I see black folks so I'm trying to be friendly and she is givin' me the cold shoulder so I was finally like "forget that hoe" and stopped talking to her...So I took out my braids and had them take a pic of my hair before they started the perm. The girl doing my hair was this Japanese girl named China (Chee-nah) and this guy helped her comb my hair (yes it took two of them to do it) and perm. My scalp is sooo sensitive so I'm glad they decided to do the tag team to get it in and out faster.  After they did the perm they did this real nice washing job and then gave me a conditioner. She wrapped my head in plastic wrap and put me under this rotating heat lamp. It felt really really good. Then she washed my face with this hot towel and gave me a massage! It was THE BEST!!! Then she washed everything out and cut and blow dried my hair. I don't know if you've seen the new Mandi Moore hair cut, but its kinda like that. Its a few different lengths and I can wear it flipped or bob/wrapped. I have it flipped now. I am taking school pictures Tomorrow so I'll have some pictures of it to send soon. I can't wait to get my film developed so I can have some before and after photos!  So that's that. I couldn't deal with the natural any longer. The winter was getting much to cold to be washing as much as I was and it was a big hassle to try to braid or twist twice a week. That just takes up so much time. I'm very happy with my hair, I just hope I can keep it healthy and make it grow. I'm going to keep regular appts w/China. Probably once a month (that's regular for me!) to keep it cut and get that great wash and massage. It cost me $100 to get a perm wash and cut so I'm certainly looking for someone else that won't charge so much, but I'd rather have someone that knows what they are doing and pay $100 than pay $50 and come back to the states balding and pissed off!!!

      Okay, so last weekend I went to Yokohama where there is Navy base. I went to a bunch of different places with 3 friends of mine and we had a ball. At night, we hung out at two different clubs. Here everything stays open until 5am because that's when the trains start running again and YES we stayed out that late, even though we were taking cabs not the train. Anyway, I met some cool black females and a whole bunch of black men. I met about 4 that I actually took their numbers and contacted once I got back home. One guy kinda stood out from the rest and was a little more pro-active about calling me and wanted me to come back down so I could hang out with him. He was nice enough (and I haven't had a date in months  ) so I decided I would. And what a learning experience it was. His name is Karl.  So I arrived at the train station where he lives after being in Tokyo most of the day. I got my hair done (that's a letter for another email! but don't worry it looks great!) and met him down there at about 9pm.  I had an overnight bag b/c I was going to stay with another friend of mine's family (from Yamanashi) that night. Do you know this negro didn't even offer to take my bag from me? I carried it all the way across the train station to the opposite side and he never mentioned it. First sign that this isn't going to be a good story...okay well I should mention that I met him in the club at night after about 5 or 6 drinks so I should have known better than to trust "drinking eyes" but nonetheless, the girls I was with agreed that he looked good and I now realize that they must have been drunk as hell too because this man can certainly be classified as "ablockaway" cause he looks good from a block away, but up close hmmmm...another story. He's not UGLY or ! anything but he's one of those guys that looks okay from a certain angle so you find your self trying to be on his "good side" at all times...well anyway, let me give you the description: He's about 7'0'' and not really muscular but not fat at all and not skinny. He seems to be a good weight for his size and if he put some muscle his body would be much much better. He is 28 and from Macon, GA. He's been in the Navy for 8 years and in Japan for 5. He doesn't speak that much Japanese but he does speak some. "Never been to college but uh, got crazy knowledge" and loves music about as much as I do.  So after we leave the station we drive around a little he showed me some really nice places right, we were seaside and it was chill. Oo-ops, I forgot to describe the car. Don't really remember the type but it wasn't bad looking from the outside, but on the inside, it was quite a mess. I was like "Nigga, you knew you was having company. You could've cleaned this mess up!" He laughed and I did too, but you know I was serious as an aka. (lol, sorry Rikca had to throw that in) So we go to this little American restaurant for drinks and appetizer kinds of things cause I already ate dinner.  The place was nice convo was okay, but you know I had to pay for my own food...i had a $4 plate of fries and a pepsi! He didn't even offer, at least offer and I'll tell you "Nah, I got it" but this nigga didn't even offer. Okay, so we're already at 3 strikes (the bag, the car, and now the paying thing) and the date should be over right...but not yet. We try to go bowling, but they don't! have any shoes big enough for him so he gets pissy with the lady at the desk mumbling something about a conspiracy and we walk away. Did I forget to mention its his b-day and he's a Scorpio...? Okay, so next we go to a little convience store to pick up some snacks b/c he doesn't have any at home. He doesn't really eat candy or stuff like that, so he says. So we go and he's like "Get what you want." I do, and I PAY for it! Niggas!!!   Okay so the we go back to his house because he had bootleg versions of Barber Shop and Brown Sugar. Both I was excited about watching! So I watched (oh i mean we) Barbershop first...LOVE IT!!! and ate some snacks, this nigga is all in my food, so I was like "Nah nigga, you  ain't put in on this" (yes i did say it just like that and as ghetto as I could, but laughing a lil) I gave him one piece of my kit kat and then I told him to look in his fridge and eat some of that stuff from over there. Anyway, the rest of the night was cool. We wat! ched some music videos that he had downloaded from the internet and put on to disks. I got to see the Erykah Badu "Love of my life" video and LL's new love song and the Cam'ron "We can get high tonight" and one more I can't remember the name. Then we watched "Brown Sugar" and I cried at the end, and he called me a punk, which I guess I am. By this time its like 4am so I just spend the night there and sleep on his bed and he slept in the living room.  I woke him up about 10:30 and was like, "I'm hungry". So he fixed breakfast: scrambled eggs, bagels & cream cheese, turkey bacon (yes they have t-bacon on base) and the orange juice (I BOUGHT)! After that I showered and got dressed and sat out on his balcony reading some magazines he had until he got ready to go. He made me a really good CD of a lot of new hip hop (Erykah Badu's "Love of my life" and some classics Common's "I used to love her". He has a lot of stuff like that on his computer.   So anyway, he got dressed for the day (wearing a beady tan and blue FUBU sweater, some dark jeans named HEDZ UP that you could see his ankles when he sit down, and some beat up white and blue reeboks or something) and we went to this place called Seaside Paradise that he had been telling me about. It's like a really small amusement park with a lot of restaurants, an aquarium and some rides. The cheapness things was really starting to worry me so I really didn't want to fool with him w/riding rides stuff. I wasn't going to pay for some place he wanted to take me...so we had lunch, of course I bought my own and then we walked around. I took some pictures and we talked and then I went to the train station to go home. I was so worried about missing my train that I  bought my ticket said bye and dashed off!! I know it was rude and I sent him a message later saying sorry about being so abrubt but I had a long  train ride home and didn't want to miss my train.  I know this is long so here is the overall breakdown if you don't read the whole thing: he's a nice guy, someone I can ask to make me CDs, or movies, but has no fashion style and we really don't have that much in common other than being from America. Kinda sad that I sorta wasted a weekend, but the pros: I actually had a "date" in Japan, caught up on a little reading and watching some movies almost everyone I knew from home has seen (even though they were bootlegs) and got a bangin' CD.     Se es la vida

      Well, I did it. I went to Tokyo this past weekend and got a perm! When I was in Yokohama last weekend, I met this girl named Tracey who lives on base down there. She recommended someone to me (Black chick) but she was book for the next 2 weekends, and you know me...when I decide that its time to do something, I need to do it right then or shortly thereafter. So, I called Tracey back and she gave me the info of this place in Tokyo that I should go. The owner is a guy named Mayo who is from NY but got family in Tarboro and Rocky Mt. (small freakin' world) He actually told me that he has a cousin named William Mayo that plays ball for UNC but I don't know that cat.   So I set up an appt for Saturday. I braided my hair up in cornrows after I made the appt so I didn't have to go around looking like a wild child for the rest of the week. It was cute too if I say so myself...anyway, I digress, as usual. So, when I get to this place its pretty nice, all the stylists except one are Japanese but have been to Atlanta and New York for training on how to do black hair and have a fair amount of black customers. The black girl who was in the shop was from St. Louis or something and kept acting like she wasn't happy to see me in there. I was kinda upset with her b/c you  know me, its so rare I see black folks so I'm trying to be friendly and she is givin' me the cold shoulder so I was finally like "forget that hoe" and stopped talking to her...So I took out my braids and had them take a pic of my hair before they started the perm. The girl doing my hair was this Japanese girl named China (Chee-nah) and this guy helped her comb my hair (yes it took two of them to do it) and perm. My scalp is sooo sensitive so I'm glad they decided to do the tag team to get it in and out faster.  After they did the perm they did this real nice washing job and then gave me a conditioner. She wrapped my head in plastic wrap and put me under this rotating heat lamp. It felt really really good. Then she washed my face with this hot towel and gave me a massage! It was THE BEST!!! Then she washed everything out and cut and blow dried my hair. I don't know if you've seen the new Mandi Moore hair cut, but its kinda like that. Its a few different lengths and I can wear it flipped or bob/wrapped. I have it flipped now. I am taking school pictures Tomorrow so I'll have some pictures of it to send soon. I can't wait to get my film developed so I can have some before and after photos!  So that's that. I couldn't deal with the natural any longer. The winter was getting much to cold to be washing as much as I was and it was a big hassle to try to braid or twist twice a week. That just takes up so much time. I'm very happy with my hair, I just hope I can keep it healthy and make it grow. I'm going to keep regular appts w/China. Probably once a month (that's regular for me!) to keep it cut and get that great wash and massage. It cost me $100 to get a perm wash and cut so I'm certainly looking for someone else that won't charge so much, but I'd rather have someone that knows what they are doing and pay $100 than pay $50 and come back to the states balding and pissed off!!!

      I have on word YOKOHAMA!!! I went there this weekend and I straight up and down enjoyed myself. Gosh, I found my little spot in Japan. People overrate Tokyo because Yokohama is much much better. Its the same amount of shopping and clubs but its more spread out and has a few less people. I really really enjoyed myself. Kimiko, Sanae, Erica and I went down and stayed at Kimi's brother's apt. We went to two clubs, to a curry museum, did some shopping, and to a wonderful restaurant. I definitely have to go back soon!

      Wow, can't believe the last time I wrote was about a week ago...at any rate today is  DAY 2  I leave tomorrow!!!! Yeah!!! I have everything in place. I have my bus ticket to Narita. I confirmed my flight home. I have Christmas cards in the mail and Christmas gifts in my suitcase.Got money in my pocket and I'm ready to be on American soil for the first time in almost 5 months. Yippee!  Another bit of good news is I got my ISDN hookup this morning. That means two major things...#1. My phone bill will be much much lower!!! #2 I can be online all day long and it doesn't tie up my phone line! I'm siked about that! It took them about 2.5 hours to set it up on my computer because it was all in English and of course most of the people couldn't understand the words, but alas, they worked it out and now I got tha' hook up.Holla if ya hear me! LOL  Anyway, I'm feeling a bit delirious. And hungry, my lunch wasn't good today. I'm going to wash my hair and shower t'nite. Then go into Kofu to have drinks with Sanae and my Japanese friend crew for the last time before I leave. This break is going to probably help me make up my decision on whether to stay or leave. I have a meeting with Dr. Frierson on Friday which I'm looking forward to. I believe it will be productive. Wish me luck Diary-san.  Matta Rai nen!

       The best thing about being in Japan...  I don't have to look at George Bush's ugly face scouring all over my freakin' TV screen. I don't think I've ever seen a human being that makes my flesh crawl like that man. I mean, I sit here on Monday nights and I watch Dark Angel and they have all types of weird genetically engineered "humans". Josh-who is half man half dog, a weird 1/2 panther 1/2 woman, this other dude who had all this puss and blood streaming out the side of his deformed face and honestly nothing makes my breakfast, lunch and dinner want to resurge from my bowels back up into my throat like the site of this man. I just feeling like "putting him in 8 headlocks" and "throwin' his face in the garbage". (courtesy of Cam'ron).  I hate reading about this US "war on terror". I hate reading about how arrogant our government is because we back that retarded ass "Dubya" with all his cowboyish tactics and bullying of people. I hate reading how much our economy sucks and how we really rely on our foreign investments to cover our asses on a daily basis. I wish some people knew how it was do without. I wish for one day the rich could be dirt fuckin' poor and the homeless/freezing folks could have lobster and steak for lunch, eat off genuine silverware, and dress themselves in the finest of fine or whatever else they please...just for a day. I wish that all the people out there who want to fire the Chancellor of UNC because of a poor decision he made AND ADMITTED too would take a chill pill are realize that our public figures are not these ideal unfuckupable people we expect them to be.  Its like Erykah Badu tried to explain..."I cry when I'm sad, I get hungry when I'm hungry, I miss my momma when I'm away" People need to realize that we are all people for goodness sake and stop acting like they've never done anything wrong. Eminem tried to tell people that this song he has with Jay Z called "Renegade". Well, if you didn't hear him the first time, listen up good this time:   Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you To just cherish But I'm debated disputed hated And viewed in America As a motherf***in' drug addict Like you didn't experiment? Now now, that's when You start to stare at Who's in the mirror And see yourself As a kid again And you get embarrased And I got nothin' to do But make you look Stupid as parents You f***in' do-gooders Too bad you couldn't Do good at marriage (Ha ha) And do you Have any clue What I had to do To get here? I don't think you do So stay tuned and Keep your ears Glued to the stereo   Well I guess he told YOU!!!

       Snow Day...  to omoimasu  It was beautiful...I was on my way home from a wonderful evening at The Muramatsu's House (my Japanese teacher and her family) and in Kofu it was raining. I started ascending the mountain and singing to whatever was playing on the radio and the rain started to get bigger. I wasn't sure but it looked like sleet or could it be snow? Its not even cold enough for snow? But none the less it was and the further up the mountain I got the more snow fell. I got to the other side of the tunnel that leads to Kamiku and it was so beautiful, I had to hurry and get home though, because I still didn't have any snow tires on my car but by this time the roads were still very wet and not snowy or icy.  This morning when I woke up it was gorgeous!! Nothing like waking up to a beautiful snow that hasn't been touched by the world. The trees were so beautiful and covered with snow it was just like something out of a story book that you wake up to on Christmas morning. Well anyway, my JTE called me first thing and said "Since its still snowing RTE 358 is closed so I'll call to see if we have school today" Well I never recieved a call so I just slept! I woke up around 9:30 and called a friend in the states. I emailed Erica and was like "Snow Day! Yippee!" Then started moving around to get my day started, made breakfast and then got a call. It was the Music teacher...who only speaks Japanese and of course I didn't understand the whole conversation only bits and pieces. Then about 10 mins later my JTE called and asked did I have the snow tires on yet. I said no, not yet. She said she'd tell the prinicipal. She called back 5 mins later and said, "Ichinose sensei will be at your house very soon to pick you up. Meet her at the BOE office." I was shocked! So, I hurried up and got dressed and as soon as I pulled on my pants and  finished packing my bag...the car pulled up in front of my house.  On the way up the mountain to school what usually takes me about 8 minutes took about 20. I'm kinda worried about driving it by myself. I'm already scary driving with these crazy drivers but add snow and once it gets dark ice and we got some conditions that I don't want to be around for. I was supposed to have a dentist appt today but I had to reschedule because of all the snow.  So once I got to school it was already 4th period and I'd missed English class for the day. It was okay because I thought I was having a snow day and didn't want to deal with teaching. Today I have to take the bus home with the students and tomorrow I will ride with them too. Its fine with me because I don't have to use my gas and I don't have to brave the slippery roads.

       Japanese News in Brief  In Tokyo Japan, a senior officer for the Metropolitan PD has been arrested and charged with Statutory rape.  This 56 year old man has been charged with having sex with a 15 year old girl since September of this year. He admits to the charge and was dishonorably discharged from his position on Thursday of this week. Here's the kicker... the child molester worked for the division of the PD that deals with cracking down on child pornography and cases involving sex with minors. The idiot met the child in February through another case he was involved in!  Also in Japan, probably not far from the first case lies yet another interesting piece of news. A 53 year old woman is charged with the murder of her husband. Reports say that her sickly husband and recently returned from the hospital after having a stroke. He could walk but was not able to speak or proceed with normal everyday functions very easily. The woman tied him up to a pole in the front yard with a dog chain and leash and left him there to die.  After the man had toiled with the chain trying to get loose he managed to strangle himself by wrapping the chain around his neck 3 good times. His wife then calls the police and says "help, I think my husband may be dead". When the police arrived she admitted to doing it.   Now, these two cases could have happened in America but it would have been a little different. The first thing I noticed is that both of these folks committed some pretty hanous crimes, but decided to just tell the truth about it. That baffles me! If you are going to kill someone and sleep with a baby...why not lie too? Its very strange but most of the articles I read about crime in Japan, they have no problems figuring out who did the shit because they damn offenders tell on themselves.

      Aiight, so last night must have been the worst I've slept in my entire life! On top of the "pain killers" that the doctor here gave me which might as well have been children's chewable vitamins, I took some ibuprofen that I brought with me, had an ice pack on the tooth, plus drunk damn near a half bottle of wine and I was STILL in pain. Damn near delirious, but in pain none the less. I was so happy when morning finally came and I could begin preparing for the day to take my mind off the pain slightly.  My dentist appt was at 11. When I got there I told her all about the problems I'd been having, and she proceeded to remove the temporary filling. Once she did I could feel the gushing of the blood and puss that was coming out of my tooth. It was just as disgusting as it sounds. She said the problem was that she was trying to get puss to come out through a tiny whole she had made in the tooth but that didn't work so the only other way is to leave the tooth all the way open, which is what she has done. She gave another load of antibotics to take and told me to take 2 pills at a time to try to ease the pain so I'm taking all of them 3 times a day with my meals.  This afternoon was pretty good and I can feel the throbbing but not any pain. I hope it continues to be this good but its really no judge because the pain is always gone after the first day. I go back on Monday and I think I'm going to have one more visit before I leave for the US. I pray this thing hurries to heal because being in the states with a toothache is the LAST thing I need.  I also went to the police station with Sanae to pay my ticket and get the big yellow ticket taken off my car. Before I took it off though, I did take a picture of it.  Well anyway it was so funny when we were in the office. The guy kept flipping through my international drivers license which is all in English and he of course doesn't understand English. I mean he must have looked thru the thing like 5 or 6 times in the 15 minutes we were in there like he was diligently looking for something.  Then he and Sanae commence to having this conversation:  Officer: Can we call her if we have any more questions?  Sanae: "Of course".   Officer: "But, does she understand Japanese on the phone..."   Sanae: "No, but didn't you tell me you have an officer here who can speak English?"  Officer: "Oh, Yes we do."  Sanae: "Then why don't you get him to call?"  Officer: "Oh, that's a good idea!"  WTF!!!! This country boy I swear!

      Diary-san  I have yet another toothache. Today's was hella bad. I was at the Elementary school today and of course the students were being kids and being loud and I really felt like running out of the classroom getting in my car and driving far far away, but that would have probably lost me my job. I stuck it out and left right after lunch to return to the Junior High in hopes of getting a little peace and quiet but no luck. So I went for the next best thing. I searched my desk for some of that strong ibuprofen I brought with me illegally from the US, asked the nurse for an ice pack, took the pill and fell asleep on my desk with my face on the back for about an hour. RELIEF! The only bad thing is my dentist appt isn't until Friday so I have to tough out all of tonight and tomorrow. Its not so bad when I don' t have to talk much but when I am teaching its killer. I have to administer a listening exam tomorrow but after that I don't have to do anything so that's a blessing. Komatana! The last thing I'm worrying about is eating. I'm so freakin' hungry right now! I have to try to find something filling that I don't have to chew. I lose weight so quick when I'm not eating and that is the LAST thing I want to do. My mom is going to think I'm starving over here!  I'm working on this Kwanzaa lesson with Keysha. She's going to come up to my school on the 16th with me and teach. She's thinking of a dance we can teach them and I'll do my debut on my guitar with a song I'm making up for Kwanzaa to help them remember the principles. Yes, I am going to play my guitar. Yes I am going to make up a song. I know it will probably be 3 chords over and over again, but hey, its a start. I've been slack at practicing it because I've been either busy or had other things to work on like my Japanese studies but my new years resolution is to learn at least the major chords and their progressions as well as a few minor chords. I want to go back to Dustyn and see if he can teach me because I see that doing it on my own and not having a steady lesson set or teacher is not the most productive way for me to hold my self accountable to practicing. I have exactly 1 week and a half to perfect this song I'm thinking of so wish me luck...  tokoro de, today is  DAY 14 . "Houston, we've hit the two week mark!"  Wait, let me not even MENTION the name Houston in light of the Whitney story that has just come out...I'll save that any my other news brief updates for later this evening or tomorrow's post.

      Oh diary, dear diary its  Day 15   and boy do I have some stuff to tell you...where do I begin...I guess chronologically is best so here goes:  I went to Kofu yesterday to have dinner with Sanae and her friend Hiromi. The plan for the night was have dinner, watch the Craig David DVD, and braid Hiromi's hair. The latter two would be happening simulanteously. So no problems there. The video was WONDERFUL!!! It's a shame that boy is only 21 cause he could get it. Hiromi's hair ended up really good. She liked it. So we left the bar (its small family owned sports bar that Sanae knows the owner so he was cool w/the braiding) and everyone went their on separate ways home...only I was surprised thoroughly when I reached my car which was parked on the side of the street and it had a huge plastic tag attached to my driverside mirror. The tag was locked and had some Japanese kanji that I couldn't read and therefore didn't understand. I called Sanae to see if she knew what it was and alas, it was a parking ticket.  I was even more surprised when I found out that's what it was because I PARK IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYTIME I GO TO KOFU! That doesn't matter to Japanese folks. Ignorance doesn't matter, crying, pleading, having a baby, hemorraging, running out of gas, none of that matters. I have to go down to the police station to have them remove this fuckin' tag off my window and pay 15,000yen ($150) at the time of removal. Ain't that some shit!  Okay, so I live in a building with 3 teachers I work with and they go to work before me because they have to be there earlier. Why does everyone at the school the BOE and I'm sure the milkman and postman too know about this ticket before I get to work at 8:30am. The first thing the school secretary says to me is, "ichi man go sen yen" which means 15,000yen. Its crazy, I'm like damn can I tell my own business...the Vice Principal wanted to know where I got the ticket and tell me about how my predecessor did the same thing. I am of course the laughing stock of the office, but I'd rather them be laughing heartly then fussing. Fussing, I just can't take.  So, then I get a call to the Junior High saying that the garbage wasn't picked up at our apartment today because I left my raw food trash in with the rest of the trash...these people are crazy anal!!! I guess the machine's won't process raw trash, but I was so surprised when they told me that our trash would not be picked up at our apartment because I put some orange peels in with the rest of my trash. wow...

       The   WORD   according to Ms. E   #1. There is a report from Sports Illustrated that they have a number one ranked 5th grade student in basketball. The article talks about why in the world is anyone ranking elementary school students but alas they are and I along with this sports writer am amazed at how far we really let this recruitment and trying to be the best thing goonly to let kids down when they get hurt or something when there should really be no pressure at age 12 about making it into the NBAso sad.  #2. There is a group of Iraqi rebels called the Kurds. The live in the northern part of Iraq. The are willing and ready to participate with the US to overthrow Sadaam if needbe. They have male and female troops. They practice for hours and hours everyday and are the most organized troops in Iraq other than the Iraqi armybut there is a catch. They dont use bullets! we train, we aim, but we cant afford to waste the bullets WTF!!! Im going to leave that right there  #3. United air is in the midst of this huge Im about to go into bankruptcy thing.  Yesterday the flight attendants agreed to take a pay reduction in order to keep this employee owned airline in the skies. The only hold out now is the mechanics. The airline wants them to take a $600 million pay cut and the mechanics are basically like, get the fuck outta here with that. Well right now if they dont come around after the flight attendants sacrifice, the airline is almost sure to drown with a $7 million a day loss because of people not flyingThis concerns me greatly because I am flying United HOME!! When Midway collapsed, I had a flight with them too and they just switched me to a USAir flight. That may not be as easy to do with a International flight, but I hope what ever the fuck they do they get their shit together before Dec. 18th. Thats all I gotta say about that.

      I have once again spent my entire Sunday in bed. Half sleeping/half reading, but none the less in bed. I actually made two calls today that really made those two people's day. It felt so good to hear my friend say "Its so glad to hear your voice, I've had a terrible day today". We are now on  Day 17  of the countdown. I was looking into rental cars for when I get home and my friend was right it was so cheap for weekly rental. The days I put in they said it would be $116.00 for the whole week! That's excellent. I'm going to look further into that because it will be a blessing to have wheels knowing how much of a busy body I am.  Of course I have things I should be doing but laying in bed after running around all week is so relaxing! Alas, duty and my hungry stomach call...

      Tonight I had yet another wonderful Thankgiving-esque dinner. This time it was at Hazel and Terry's (which for some reason I always say Tazel and Harry...my brain just can't get it right). Hazel ended up doing most of the cooking. I didn' t know that or I would have tried to whip something else up. I thought more of the guys would bring stuff but of course, all they brought was beer. Our evening was supposed to begin around 4:30, but I was delayed because I was  trying to hurry up and finish E. Lynn Harris' book "Any Way The Wind Blows" before I left home. It ended up taking longer than I thought and I missed Hazel's phone call to get down there soon because she was in a house full of men (including her husband of course) who were talking about football and all sorts of random things that she was not interested in. I hurried to finish the book as well as the pasta dish I'd prepared (which surprisingly got rave reviews) so I could go rescue her.   Ya know, Hazel looks so much like my Aunt Connie its funny. Well she doesn't look like her all the time, its the facial expressions etc. that really get me. Hazel's 34 and really feels like a big sister to me. I've actually met a few people like that here. Its really good to have since my sister and I aren't very close.   Hazel made corn on the cob, beans and rice, mashed potatoes (fresh, not boxed) and 3 pies: sweet potato, pumpkin, and apple. Those pies really took me back home. She baked marshmellows on top of the sweet potato pie and I was really looking around for somebody's mama so I could slap her! (sorority joke) Hazel's a  really  great cook and since she and Terry are totally vegetarian I always get really healthy meals when I'm at their place.  Tonight, I had a sit down with a guy who I usually ignore because half of the words out of his mouth are ignorant.  He seems like a nice enough guy but he is young (just turned 22) and immature. Look at me calling someone young at 22, but its not his age, its his mind.  I generally just have small talk with him because he is cool, but nothing deep because I don't like feeling like I have to be the spokesperson for Black people or explain my life and how I am to him. He always asks dumb questions about ethnicity and stuff and I just get tired of explaining so sometimes...I just don't deal with it.  In life, here are some people who don't understand things (no specific thing, just things in general) but they kind of go with the flow and try to get in where they fit in. They figure it out the best way they know how or they wait until a more appropriate time to approach the subject. Not this young cat! What gets me most is that people dismiss what he says with "That's just because he's young". I am a true believer in the fact that we make allowances for people to remain how they are.  By constantly giving them the "she's/he's just like that" out...we hurt them as much as their ignorance bothers us. I refuse to do that but for so long and their has to come a time, when everyone should not have to change because of one person and that person should start learning how to be a chameleon based on their situation.    So anyway  (as I step down off my soapbox)  we sat and talked tonight and a lot of what he said helped me to put together pieces of why he is the way he is. We are alike in a lot of ways but still very different.  It was just good to see a side of him existed that didn't involve him trying to keep up with the dozens and be like "the boys". He gets caught up in trying to fit in with the other guys who seem to have an ongoing game of "Who's line is it anyway?" trying to be quickest to say something smart or witty. If he would just be a little more confident in himself then maybe he'd find out who  "himself"  really is. I think he's looking but he'll never find  him  while he's trying to be  them .  I started reading Sue's book, "The Unbearable Lightness of Being. And in an oxymoronic way, this book is anything BUT light. I said I was going to try to do some light bedtime reading but its actually quite heavy...but coming off the Potter Series and E. Lynn this is going to be an interesting ride. I read 4 books this week that contained a combined total of 1,460 pages. I have a feeling, that even if I give it my all I won't finish this one book (311pgs) this week. But I will do my best. Wow, 1,460! I didn't realize it was that many...I promise you if any of them would have been for a class in undergrad I probably wouldn't have read them just out of principle...I was really a terrible student...but life has its way of making you a great pupil doesn't it...I digress, as usual.    Oyasuminasai! Ganbarimasu!

      Its a done deal! I'm going to New Zealand March 23-April 3. There are 9 of us in total going.  Dave (the planner), Hazel and her husband Terry, Kris (from Kofu), Jeremy (from Ueno), Charlotte (who is a former JET), Shalini (I don't really know her, is a kinda know of her thing) and this guy named Jason (who may be a friend of my Japanese teacher and from Greensboro, NC but I'm not sure if that's the same guy). Its good that I know a good part of the group that way it won't be too strange but I think it will be great!  The schedule the planner has for us thus far is hype! We are going to do some backpacking, sight-seeing, sea-kayaking, horseback riding, shopping, and water skiing! And there are like 4 or 5 days that haven't been planned yet! He is from New Zealand so we'll be staying with his sister and parents part of the time. It sounds like so much fun! It is the late spring in New Zealand now so it will be summer by the time we get there. The list of stuff we are supposed to be doing is all stuff I've never done before so I know its going to be great. I'm so out of shape so I better start doing some exercise tapes in my living room or something cause I'll be beat down the whole two weeks we are there. I'm going to need to find a "backpack" like the hikers and stuff wear too. I hope they aren't too expensive.  I was thinking about what a friend of mine about not wanting to come back after all this out and about that I've been doing. Traveling here and there. I think all its doing is getting me more motivated to be productive so I CAN travel and go skiing, snowboarding horse-back riding, sea-kayaking and all the other things that "Black People ain't supposed" to do. Dave got one of the last 3 tickets yesterday to add me to the group so that was a close call. Yokkata Ne!

      Okay, let me give you the skinny on Okinawa. I was sooo happy to see Vanessa!!!! She looked so good and the kids are gorgeous. They have such and adorable family. So we spent a lot of time on base. We went to Camps Kinser and Foster which are both Marine and then to Camp Kadena which is the Air Force. We went to and bought stuff from the PX on both camps. I went to the base Beauty Shop to get my hair cut which was a relief not being able to do it myself. Friday night we went to this club that was on base and it was soooo much fun!! It was free to get in, coat check was free, and drinks were $2.25!!!! I'm talking mixed drinks, top shelf, you name it $2.25! I was shocked. I spent less than $10 including club and drinks and it was packed and the party was live. So believe you me, I was happy about that.  The guys in the club that night were funny. They were dancing and not so much worried about us. We had a really good time.   The weather there was so much warmer than it is here on what the military folks call "mainland". The only problem with that was when I finally got back here I could feel the sore throat and coughing coming. I didn't get a chance to get many pictures but it was nice. Definitely not somewhere I'd like to live either because the land is too flat and much too much wind but like many other places in Japan nice to visit,not as fun to live there.  The second night we went to this place that was supposed to be "the best night spot" and it was terrible. Well Erica had a wonderful time and the music was good. I just felt bothered the entire night. I must have been going through some serious PMS because everything that anyone said to me pissed me off. I didn' t want anyone touching me or dancing too close or looking at me. I was being a really "female dog" and I couldn't help it.I tried to go in the corner and sit because I didn't want to make Erica leave and not have a good time because I wasn't feelin' it but people kept coming wherever I was to bother me! I mean, I know they didn't want anything other than a little harmless conversation and usually I indulge them, but that day was just not the day.

      Today after paying some bills and taking about an hour at the post office to transfer money I felt the need to treat myself to a nice dinner. I went to one of my favorite places called Gusto. Its a very nice restaurant and its also pretty inexpensive which is my favorite part. I don't know what made me thing about it...maybe it was the lady I hit with the bathroom door as I was exiting.  I pushed on the door like I normally would, only problem is there is a sink on the other side of that door and if anyone is using it they are in the direct line of fire for the door. I felt really bad about hitting her and she was like "Sure, nevermind" That use of English was not exactly appropriate for the moment especially the way she said it, but anyway...after that I looked up in the mirror and asked myself "Eboni WHAT are you doing in Japan?"  Its a logical enough question although at the time only meant to be rhetorical. My eyes are extremely heavy right now and I've got to get to bed...although I'm way behind on my journaling. I'm going to try to get up early tomorrow to plan my lesson for the Elementary school. If I have time, I'll journal then. The question still looms over my head as I drift off to sleep, Why are you in Japan?

      Talk about snowing! Yesterday when my JTE said "Do you know it will be snow tomorrow?" I said "REALLY" I had no idea what we were in for. I woke up this morning moving around slow as usual and looked out and almost couldn't find my car. The drive in to work wasn't that bad. The road hadn't been plowed but there weren't any accidents and folks were taking their time. We ended up having a short day. The plan was to leave after the lunch around 12:40. But...the lunch truck was stuck behind an accident on the highway. It ended up geting to the school about an hour late. By then one school bus had already arrived to take the students back home.  None of the teachers could leave because the Principal hadn't gotten back from an early morning meeting to say whether or not the teachers could leave. The VPrincipal can say the students can leave but he can't let the teachers go early. It makes me no nevermind, b/c I leave at 4:30 regardless. I hope the roads aren't bad and you can believe I will be driving slow.  As if the snow wasn't enough to rack my brain...I called Keysha and asked her to by my ticket for the night bus from Kofu to Haneda. When she called the bus was already full!!! There are no other trains or buses that leave from this way up to Haneda so I thought I was royally screwed and going to have to drive. Then my teacher found a train in Tokyo that starts at 5:30 in the morning and runs every 11-14 mins that goes to Haneda. The only thing is, there aren't any morning trains that will get me there ontime. So, I have to go up to Tokyo and spend the night there tonight and take the other train to the Haneda Airport in the morning. Luckily I'm a friendly person and made friends w/these two black girls I met at the Earth Wind and Fire concert back in November. Anyway, I called this girl Yolandis who is still living here (the other girl went back...she was only visiting) and asked her if I could stay w/her tonight with a great big ONEGAISHIMASU and she said sure, no problem! What a relief! So now I have to get home rush around to make sure I have all I need which really wont be much since I will only be gone for the weekend. I have to find her a good gift too because she was very kind to me for letting me stay with her tonight.  God is really good, ain't he?

      Gosh, I have been really not feeling my job today. Probably because I have hopes of being in Okinawa this weekend I want the next few days to just skip by.  In one of my classes at Toyoshige today the Vice Prinicipal sat in on the class.  It was okay but I kinda felt like he was judging my performance. The class he sat in on was cool they are smart kids and we usually have a lot of fun.  Its hard to be a performer when you don't feel like it. I talked to RR today and told him how "blahhhhh" I was feeling. He teased me that being home a few weeks spoiled me. But its very true I must be spoiled or maybe its "Just one of them days" that a girl goes through. Who knows I just want to be in my bed under something reading a book....i mean under some COVERS...right right, that's what I mean.

      I had such a wonderful day today! i was so worried about skiing for my frist time and for no reason.  I went out there and of course I rolled around in the snow (not purposely) for about 2 hours and then finally was able to stop standing up.  I was among the A group people who had only been once or twice before and still they were far far ahead of anywhere I'd ever been.  The teachers were really patient with me and I have to say, my ski instructor was a CUTIE! Problem was, "He no speaku no engrish" Oh well, nice to learn from and a cutie...so I enjoyed the lessons.  The ski resort was called Fujiten and at the top of the slopes you can see Mt. Fuji when the clouds moved away. It was a good day. The wind wasn't blowing and the sun was hidden behind clouds most of the day so my eyes didn't hurt much. I'm so lucky to be at the school I'm at because they really treat me like one of them. A lot of other ALTs aren't allowed to go on the school trip but mine invited me. I was very thankful. I'm extremely beat now too so I'm going to get some rest. Oya sumi!

      Good Morning Diary-san! I started my day by reading more of my new favorite book called  The Great Investment . It was written by TD Jakes. Its my first read of him, but I am really enjoying it and learning. Its truly a great book. It deals with balancing Finance, Family and Faith. I am in need of some spiritual guidance right now because I feel a serious calling on my life and can't seem to get a hold of what it is. This book has really helped me get things into focus though so I'm looking forward to a really blessed year.  Conviction + Confession = Change.

      After all that about how cold it is in my place, I failed to mention that I didn't have any more kerosene in any of the 3 heaters I had. So grudgingly I got dressed and went next door to the gas station to fill my container up. I'm glad I did though, because after the gas man filled it up, he invited me in for a cup of tea. It was cool, he doesn't speak English of course but we sat and drank tea and at cake from about 9am-10pm. He had customers every now and then but came in and filled my cup and another older man who lives in the village came in and chatted with us a while too. Of course I didn't understand all of what he said, but it was good to be and feel welcome among the people I live with. He told me that he was sad I wasn't staying around for more than a year and wanted to know why I wouldn't stay. I told him that I missed my family and Japan was too cold. He was like "Ahh, you'll get used to it!" He's funny. What started off as a "I hate this temperature!" day quickly got transformed. I love Japan! I can be moody and no one really knows or cares.  Off to go skating...ttyl Diary-san.

      If there is one thing I can't stand about Japan its the fact that it is cold inside the house. It keeps me from doing so many things. If its warm I can get up and be the morning person that I am. Clean up, listen to the radio, do my Saturday planning for my upcoming week...the works! But when its cold, I'm talking 10 degrees and below in the house who wants to be bothered with anything but laying in the bed! I have to be careful about my eating habits over these next two months because I know I will overeat and lack of exercise or anything else to do will really blow me up. Now that I think about it, I have to make special trips to eat so maybe it won't be bad cause I know i'm not going to get up and go out in the cold to over eat.  I took this really cool personality test someone sent me as a forward. Its apparently one of those things that Dr. Phil gave to Oprah and now they are passing it around. Oprah scored 38..this is what it said about her.    Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest.  Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.    I scored 43..Here are my results:   Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.    Pretty accurate I think.

      I'm going to OKINAWA. I'm going to OKINAWA!!! I booked my flight today. Next Friday I'm going down to visit Anna and her family. I can't wait to see the kids in person. I've been trying to think of what to bring them. I am turning Japanese, you know omiyage is a custom of theirs. Anyway, we'll see. I just cant wait to get down there. The weather is only in the 60s there but that's better than the 30s and teens which I'm experiencing here. Since I've decided that I'm only going to stay for a year, i'm going to try to take one trip a month. Even if its a small trip. I found a great deal for this and Erica and I are going together so that's saving money too. I'm excited Diary-san. I can't wait to tell you all about my trip! No, i'm not going to be able to buy any new clothes, but I don't need them. I have plenty. As part of my new 2003 debt free plan the purchase of new clothes is a MAJOR No-No so I have to resist all the urges of my mind. I digress...Gonna finish doing my hair then I'm going to bed. Oyasumi.

       Lemme tell you why I'm mad son!   Aiight so today I come home and just flipping through channels stop of something that is in English. No idea what it is only that they are interviewing folks and I understand what they are talking about. It ends up being some kickboxing program that was fairly interesting. Next this video program called "WOWOW" comes on. It shows different US videos. The first was Guns & Roses. It was a cool song, something kinda mellow. Then they had an interview w/NAS. And then his video came on for "Made you Look". (here comes the part when I get mad!) Guess what came on next? KISS. Some headbangin' screamin' and hollerin' KISS. I was ill, how you going to go from "Made you look" to that mess. Japan, you disappoint me sometimes.

      I have finally returned! After a 3 week, well needed totally enjoyable vacation. The US is the same my family is the same the food folks and fun are the same and I was just glad to be back for a while. My first few days I stayed in RDU area reunited a long overdue flame, had a job interview, took it back to the El and partied Black tie style in honor of the Christmas holiday.  Then I went down to the country where my family lives and we had my brother's wedding. It was ghetto love all the way. Not in a derogatory but you know there is nothing like country ghetto two folks who love each other. I'll not go into the details of the wedding or the reception but I will say this... They seem to be very happy and I am happy for them.  I went to Connecticut to visit fam there and picked up my niece and nephew who I haven't seen in YEARS and took them to see this new movie called Drumline. We had a good time. I really will try to keep better contact with them. They're beautiful kids and of course growing up so fast. Its funny when you are young it seems like you'll never get old and when your older it seems like youth is so fleeting...I know I'm getting to be a senior citizen when I'm contemplating the pace of youth!  It is now 5:35AM and I have been awake since about 2AM. My body still thinks I'm in the US. Its a good thing we have a long holiday weekend so that I can work on my sleep schedule. I still haven't unpacked completely so I guess I'll work on that. I still don't have any water since the water froze in my pipes while I was gone. Well actually it froze in the water supply not in the actual pipe but none the less I have no water and no toilet in my apt. I brushed my teeth and washed my face with bottle water which is also cold because of the temp in the kitchen.  My supervisor said they would come back around 9AM to work on it. We'll see how that works out. I might have to go to a friend's house this weekend if they don't fix it soon because I will not be running to the neighbors house to pee and shower all weekend.

       War...what is it good for...  This week, I'm on a war movie marathon. At Tsutaya its 180yen rental day for ladies on Monday so I get to get cheap movies.  I rented, Pearl Harbor, Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down, and Behind Enemy Lines. I watched Pearl Harbor last night and Black Hawk Down the night before.  I wanted to understand more about the war phenomenon and these movies both have a true story behind them and although of course movie is not as good as books or primary sources  it has still lead me to write everyone I knew who has served in the armed forces and tell them how much I love an appreciate them for what they do.   Everyone is really quick to criticize war and members of the armed forces, but I guess I never really sat down to seriously think about the things they do and what their jobs actually are until I started to date  G .  Two of my uncles were in the armed forces. One in the army the other in the airforce but even then I didn't do a lot of thinking about it.   G , his job and his co-workers were visable to me on a regular basis and it made me come to grips with a lot of stereo types that I had about these men because of TV or whatever.  They were men and some still boys who had volunteered to defend their country. Although some may never see wartime or combat (which I hope my loved ones don't) they train every day for the worst while hoping for the best.  The man in Pearl Harbor said, "Nothing is more passionate than the heart of a volunteer." To the men and women in my life and everywhere who have volunteered (and those who wish they hadn't sometimes) you are truly some of the best people I know.  Thank you for watchin' my back.  Holla BACK!!! I got ya back!

       Bye Bye Geneva.   Tonight I went out with Aki for the last time in Japan. Aki, Keysha, Chris J and I went to an onsen (hot spring spa) at this fruit park up near Yamanashi city which is really really nice. It was extremely cold tonight which is all the more better for going to the onsen. I'm not usually a big fan of the public bath thing like so many people seem to be but I've been having some dry skin problems and my Japanese teacher told me that the hot spring water is really good for my skin every now and then.  It acutally felt really good. First you go into this room with a bunch of showers and you scrub really hard.  Once you feel good and clean, you go outside to the pools of water.  The first one we got in was really hot. It was so hot that I got a little light headed at first but when I started to get used to it, it felt a lot better. Just sitting around talking to Aki and Keysha was cool.    When that pool got too hot, we went down to the warm pool. It had big rocks in it so you could lay on the rocks when if you get hot. I felt like I was in the movie "Mermaid" laying on the rocks with my feet in the water.  I'm kinda sad Aki is leaving. I don't feel like I got a chance to really know her like I could have if she would be able to stay around longer.  She's been here for a year studying Japanese and its finally time to go home. I think that she got a little sad during the second half of her stay here because she got engaged and of course wanted to be with her fiance. The wedding will be some time later this year I think. Too bad I won't be able to make it. Anyway Aki is cool peeps and she's my birthday sister (we were born on the same day) so as long as I remember my 23 birthday party I'll remember Aki.    Bon Voyage. Safiri Salama. Sayonara.

       You can't see what I can see...   Yesterday at Shoji I had an extremely humbling experience.  In the 4th grade class there is a girl who was doing an experiment about being blind.  She had to wear a blindfold from 9am-12:30 just before lunch time.  It just so happens that my class is the class just before lunch.  Another student was assigned to be her care taker for the morning. Of course since I can't speak Japanese in class I rely highy on pictures and some small bits of English combined with body language to help get the message across to my kids.    It seemed at first as if she was okay...but as the class progress I could see her face getting more and more sad.  I asked the girl who was taking care of her if she was okay, she said she was.  Things really got heavy when we started to play this interview game. The students drew pictures of their family. I taught family grammer and the question phrase "Who is this?" Well the students were playing the game and and I looked over at her and she was crying!  The homeroom teacher (who stays in the class with me to help translate and in case I have behavior issues, which never happens) goes over to her and starts talking to her and telling her to write about how she is feeling at the moment. Then she really breaks out crying and he finally takes the mask off of her. Some of the children are watching but most are so engulfed in the game that they pay her no mind.  It was hard for me seeing her so bothered with her face buried in her arm quietly weeping. All the while I had to act like she wasn't crying and tend to the other students.    Finally class ended and I got a chance to ask her teacher how she was feeling. He said the whole time she was writing, "I can't do anything on my own. I feel helpless. Isn't it time to take this off yet? When will lunch time come? I really don't like this at all."  I'd something like that on tv, but never in real life. I wonder what the purpose of the whole experiment was? I couldn't really understand the definition they gave me in Japanese of course.  It was an eye opening experience. I never see Japanese people show emotion the way I feel we do in the states. maybe they just don't do it around me but for some reason her crying really effected me.  That's one of the main reasons I need to learn  Japanese. There are so many things that are going on around me that I have no idea about. It just makes me want to study even harder, ya know?

       Senseless Murders   i had to share the comments of a friend of mine. she totally expressed my feelings completely...  "yo...if you get a sec, do a news search (google) for chicago and chatham murders. I love my city by what's really going on? I heard around New Years that a family was killed (father, daughter, girl's baby and the father) on the southside.  They even killed the dog.  But what I didn't know was that this manhunt they were on, the dude that they were calling armed and dangerous, the most deadliest man in the history of the city, was an 18 year old! I couldn't believe this! The first groups of murders went unsolved.  The boy lived next door to the people. Then earlier this month, he kills his father. Next he kills another 18 year old on the North side, injures her fiance' and then finally kills himself after a stand off at this hotel near my Granny's crib. When they found the boy he was dressed in a bullet proof vest and his pockets were filled with bullets.  Eboni, he was killing these people with an Uzi! This shit is crazy! Seriously, what is wrong with people nowadays? I feel like a movie character saying this but people have no respect for life. There was another story on the CHicago Sun-Times site about another teenager who killed his grandmother and two kids! I'm not saying that Chicago, or any other place for that matter, hasn't had it's share of crime and violence but when have you ever heard so many stories of this magnitude at the same time? Seems like  things are just getting really bad.  Sorry for my "in-depth" email but I just hate to hear things like this. Especially when it involves black people. This is some shit that white folks used to do; get angry and go on a shooting spree. I guess I should have learned my lesson after the sniper rampage to never repeat that phrase, "Black folks don't do that." As of lately, it seems that each time I say it, I prove myself wrong."

      It felt so good to be a lazy butt today!  I washed 3 loads of clothes, cleaned the bathroom and laundry room, took out the garbage, packaged up my newspapers for burning, and took down my Christmas tree. Yes, just taking it down mid-feb.  Its been a long cold winter and I haven't been up for much cleaning or adjusting stuff. I just left it there since Thanksgiving. It wasn't bothering me any!!! It was pretty nice today but still quite cold up in the boonies where I live.  One thing I can say, IF (and that's a huge IF) anyone comes out here to visit me, they will get a taste of what the real heart of Japan has to offer. Not Tokyo or any of the big cities, but traditional rural Japanese life.  No trains, no convience stores, just a gas station, a tennis court, an onsen, and a Town Hall.  That's about it for us!  We are situated between two mountains and this time of year only get a good 5 hours of direct sunlight. I have to make sure my clothes get out there as soon as the sun hits them and don't worry about them drying after 3 cause the sun is gone and it becomes cold again. The joys of Mt. living huh?  After doing more than my fare share of Saturday work I decided I'd just watch some TV and eat junk food tonight. So, I went into Kofu rented "American Beauty" and "What lies beneath". I stopped off at a store to get more snacks than I really wanted or needed and huge bottle of orange Fanta. Made one more stop at McDonald's (can't eat all junk food right?  I'm kidding of course. ) and came on in to start my Tsutaya Night. Tsutaya is the name of my movie rental place. Doesn't have quite the same ring as, "Make it a Blockbuster night!" but we do aiight with what we got.  As I lift my bottle of Fanta (2L,and no I'm not getting a cup, I live alone, have no visitors, and plan on finishing it tonight) and pop open my can of Sour Cream Pringles...Here's to being a single beautiful Black woman and lovin' every moment of it!  KAMPAIIIIII

      Last night was so much fun!!! I started out kinda bumbed because I wanted to go to Tokyo for the Peace Rally on Saturday but found out after I left school that I don't get paid until Monday. Finances are usually slim a day or two before my expected pay day so I realized I couldn't afford to go. I had still been invited to this Chocolate themed Valentine's Day that I so inappropriately named "Valentine's Day Gone Wrong Party".  And it was only when I got there that I realized how wrong I was.  Sue had invited a bunch of people up to her place, actually not a bunch just 8 of us (and Wendy's dog Uribo) and I was the first to arrive. I walked up to the apartment and was greeted by the smell of citrus candles. This is also Sue's way of signaling her neighbors that she is having company.  I walk in and she had little colorful gel candles lining the walk way to the living room. There were candles everywhere you look and everything smelled great! Shortly after I arrived the rest of the crew came in with bags and bags of chocolate flavored everything you can imagine and beer! I had two different types of mexican mole, which is a dish that is made with chocolate or chocolate powder. Rice and homemade tortillas were made to complement the mole. We had chocolate pizza, home made chocolate hearts, chocolate bubbles (yes, complete with bubble wand), and even chocolate cake that was made in the rice cooker! Someone also brought egg salad and avocado salad sandwiches that were cut out in the shap of hearts!! The food was really great and the company was even better. We talking about so many things, had a lot of great laughs, and even had a moment of mediation for peace and solidarity.  We listened to old Whitney Houston songs, drank beer, played this card game called "spoons" which is one of my new favorites and really just enjoyed each other's company. What better way to spend Valentine's Day?   Just before everyone crashed and we were playing our last round of our version of "Name that tune" I got my special Valentine's call from home that of course made my night that much more complete.  Its amazing to me how a 5 minute conversation can put a great close on what had already been an amazing evening. Then the night came to a complete wind down and everyone decided we'd all drank too much to go home so we had a big slumber party.  Quote of the evening: "What does love smell like?"   Reply: "The wet spot"

      I'm feeling empelled to write but I don't really have my ideas together about what it is I actually want to write. I just read one of Nikki Giovanni's poems "How do you write a poem?". I think it speaks volumes...I'll enter it after my post is done.   Its Vday for us here and my friend is having a Vday get together tonight. The only requirements is that you bring a non-traditional chocolate object. She said it could be creative or not, just whatever you are feeling at the time.  She told me she thinks I have some missed placed aggression because i want to bring a bashed up chocolate heart. I just feel like tearing something up. I'm not even having a bad day!  She suggested Yoga...i think I'll try it. She said she stays angry all the time so she doesn't do it much as she used to, but maybe it will help me regulate my emotions. I swear it feels like PMS never goes off. My emotions are really rollercoaster like and its scary! Yoga is the next attempt at regulation. We'll see how that works.  my v-day tribute courtesy of Ms. Giovanni:  How Do You Write A Poem?                                                        how do you write a poem                                                      about someone so close                                                   to you that when you say ahhhhh                                                         they say chuuuu                                                    what can they ask you to put                                                   on paper that isn't already written                                                           on your face                                                     and does the paper make it                                                          any more real                                                         that without them                                                         life would be not                                                      impossible but certainly                                                           more difficult                                                    and why would someone need                                                     a poem to say when i come                                                      home if you're not there                                                          i search the air                                                          for your scent                                                      would i search any less                                                         if i told the world                                                         i don't care at all                                                      and love is so complete                                                     that touch or not we blend                                                      to each other the things                                                     that matter aren't all about                                                 baaaaaanging (i can be baaaanged all                                                     day long) but finding a spot                                                        where i can be free                                                         of all the physical                                                       and emotional bullshit                                                      and simply sit with a cup                                                      of coffee and say to you                                                      "i'm tired" don't you know                                                      those are my love words                                                    and say to you "how was your                                                       day" doesn't that show                                                     i care or say to you "we lost                                                    a friend" and not want to share                                                      that loss with strangers                                                       don't you already know                                                         what i feel and if                                                         you don't maybe                                                     i should check my feelings

      You know one thing that pisses me off more than anything...okay not more than anything because we know a lot of stuff pisses me off...well one thing that has pissed me off is a letter I just recieved. I wrote this person...HANDWROTE--not typed a letter in early January. A four page letter like Aaliyah, Diary-san! And what did a get back? Some incoherant 1/2 page response which wasted the entired 37cent they paid for the stamp (didn't even bother to send it airmail). Now, you make think I'm petty when I tell you that the letter was recieved from a 13 year old family member but you know what, I don't give a &$@#.  At 13 you are old enough to think clearly and write accordly. You are able to answer questions asked of you and write questions of your own other than that typical "how's japan?" "how's school?" mess I get from everyone including perfect strangers I meet.  It upsets me when I take time to let someone know how I feel, give good feedback and say lots of positive things and I get something shitty like this back.  I really want to write now and say some ugly stuff, but she's a kid. And not all kids realize the importance of proper and thoughtful correspondance. I'm not giving up on her though. I'm going to continue to write her and expect better letters in return. I'm hoping that she'll save them and I CERTAINLY intend to save the ones she sends me.  WHEW! It feels so good sometimes just to get stuff off your chest ya know?

       Peppermint Ball  I has such a good time last night! A fellow JET participant friend of mine told me about the Tokyo Alumi Chapter and that they were having a formal event this weekend. A friend of mine had told me that the chapter was inactive so I never really bothered to get in touch with them. Well when the friend told me about it I decided to find out a little more for myself. I emailed the chapter president and she told me a few things and they were excited about meeting me and were so happy that I was here. When I got there I was so happy! It was so good to be around the sorors and feel at home again. Most of the sorors in the chapter are much older than me and are all in some way affiliated with the military someway.  Most are teachers, some are actually in the military and the remainder are military wives.   There was a banquet and some door prizes were giving away (which were all really nice ceramic dishes/vases for the home. I was for once hoping that I didn't win because I sure wouldn't want to lug that thing all around the train stations going home.  They called all sorors to the floor and we sang "The Sweetheart Song" and as always it made me have goosebumps. The sorors could really sing too. The song sounded really good. I met two of the youngest sorors named Shai and Risha. They are both at the Air Force base and told me to come back down soon and spend the weekend. I told them I wanted to get my hair braided before I go to New Zealand so they said they'd find someone who could do that for me.  The crowd was old and the music that was played all night was too, but that didn't stop me from having a wonderful time at all.  I've got an adopted Mom now, this soror named Ms. Jackie. She took care of us for real and is going to send me a care package later on  with some US goodies and Girl Scout Cookies. I wanted some thin mints but the girls we saw were all out!! The can never go wrong with Thin Mints. And as much chocolate as I've been eating lately I'd sit down and be done with the box in a night. I'm excited about getting the cookies though.    Erica went with me and the interested girl. It was strange because some of the sorors were acting like Erica was interested too and not being quite as friendly to her as they were with me.  She of course was like "F- em" (inside joke). Its funny, I was trying to explain to her why they were being that way but its hard to explain. I mean I totally understood it with the chapter being on the edge of membership intake and having women swarming around you who want to make new friends just for the sake of initiation possibilites, but that doesn't make it easy to explain to someone who hasn o interest in doing anything with Tokyo Alumni other than chillin' and supporting the worthwhile community activities they take part in.  Today's weather was by far the most beautiful day of 2003 thus far. It was about 62 as a high and the sun was just gorgeous! I sat and missed two trains at the station in Machida on my way home from Camp Zama (where the ball was) just so I could sit outside reading and enjoying the sunshine on my face. Oh, I feel the bug of spring fever beginning to tickle my nose.  My decision to stay in Japan will be final as of tomorrow morning and I hope the completion of this year proves as rewarding as the first part. Some will be happy that I'm staying others will not be so happy. But this is about me. I said that when I first left home. No kids, no boyfriend, no ring and no reason at this moment to return back home.  God and I worked this one out. He provided a new sources of family and support in showing me the way to my sorors and I've just been recieving confirmations all week that this is the right thing for me to do. So I will turn in my contract tomorrow with no looking back and set forth in my obligations to the Kamiku BOE for another year.    Wish me luck..and keep up the prayers.

       love is...   love is...smiling all day after hearing your loved one's voice  love is...sleeping in the wet spot!  love is...the sick stomach you get when you are worried about them.  love is...considering a life changing decision based on them.  love is...realizing life has no guarantees and encouraging each other to fulfill your dreams.  love is...getting up to get the water in the middle of the night.  love is...saving their messages on the answering machine so you can hear them over and over again.  love is...establishing a folder on your email account so you can save the messages they send and read them over and over again.  love is...crying because their feelings are hurt.  love is...what I got! I said remember that! Love Is...what I got!

       NZ2003   I paid my deposit for the New Zealand trip today! I sat down w/Dave (the organizer) and he told me all about the trip. The intentions a map of the areas we'll go to and just a basic run down of everything. New Zealand is made up of two islands: the north and the south. We are start at the top of the North in Auckland where 1/3 of the people who live in New Zealand are and then down to the tip of the South where Dave's parents live.  We'll be stopping at different places and towns along the way doing all types of wonderful water and other outdoor activites.  He even told me there is a glow worm tunnel!!! I didn't know those things were real! I'm excited if you can't tell. I need to curb the excitment because I still have 7 weeks before the trip.  Way to early for a countdown. I'll probably start at the 14 day mark. (smile) Anyway, Oyasumi Diary-san.

       The Noisy Folks   Just about to leave the house to go to my Japanese lesson when my neighbor and her boyfriend come down bringing a plate sweets. They apologize for making so much noise and said that the guy was drunk and being rather rude and apologized. I said "OK, thanks".  My neighbor asked for her plate back, I took off the snacks, gave it to her and they left.  I guess the banging did the trick and let them know I wasn't a happy camper. It was nice of them to come apologize though.  But that doesn't make it alright...

      Yo, if these people don't stop making so much noise upstairs they are going to have problems and situations because I'm about to go up there in my night clothes and start cussing them out.  There is no need for all the bumping and shit that is going on upstairs right now.  It seems like the two of them are having some type of slam dance party where they are throwing themselves up against the walls and floor. I had enough and then started banging on the wall and doing my own set of screaming which probably went on for a minute or so before I realized that I was acting like a child.  Once I stopped banging it got very quiet upstairs and I was able to finally get some rest. Its not that I mind noise, because I produce my own set of noise via my music. I love music and very often play my CDs loud, but one thing I can't stand is being disrespectfully and acting noisy after 10pm. I guess college and "quiet hours" got me into that but its just disrespectful to kick up a lot of noise once people have begun to get ready for and go to bed. Maybe I just have a very ill attitude towards Japanese people this weekend and maybe that has something to do w/my aunt flow but whatever it is...its just something I have to deal with for now.

       Welcome to Black History Month   I am dead sleepy but I have got get this in tonight. I went to pick up some English conversation listening CDs from Keysha for my Private students that I'll teach tomorrow. Well I'm sitting near her job at the train station waiting for her to come out when I hear some Japanese woman screaming into megaphones that are attached to the top of a small station wagon. It is the height of election season here and the way people campain is by driving around in cars and screaming something out at the people who are in earshot. Well the car eventually stop circling around the station and parked where else but right next to me. So I'm still sitting listening to my CD and playing with the email function on my cell phone. So all the passengers get out of this car including the candidate that all the hullabaloo is about.  They walk around for about 5 minutes and pass out flyers and he gets on the megaphone and makes his speech.  I am watching closely as this is HILARIOUS to me. I've never seen campaigning quite like it but it is of course "The Japanese Way" so like everything else I laugh and observe.    Well when he is done, he comes back to the car to get in and has to walk past my window.  When he does, he pauses at my window and asks me to roll it down. Then he says in perfect English,  "Did you understand what I just said?"  I shook my head "no" and he laughed and walked on.  Then I asked him if I could take his picture. He says sure and stands up against the campaign car which has a huge plaquard on top w/his name or something up there. He gives me the cheesy "thumbs up" sign and I take the picture.  Then he gestures for me to take a picture w/him and one of his campaign workers takes the photo of us.  I say thanks and go to get back in my car when he stops me and gives me his campaign card and his business card w/his mailing address. Then he said  "Please send me photo."  I say, sure no problem and they start to leave.  As he is backing out he looks back over at me and shouts  "WE SHALL OVERCOME, WE SHALL OVERCOME!" I am so startled that I look at him and burst out in uncontrollable laughter. He is doing the Richard Nixon two hand wave and smile and drives off.    This country provides me w/a new experience every day.  Today, on the first day of Black History month I get a reminder, from a Japanese politician,  of the reason why the month exists in the first place. Its about educating people and teaching about the importance, relevance, and context of Black History.  The politician was right, We Shall Overcome...someday. I guess I just wish he knew implications that come with using that English phrase. Apparently he doesn't.

      The war has begun a baby has been born and the world goes on. I walked into the teachers room mid class time because I had forgotten a paper at my desk and to my sugooooi surprise on the TV I was watching the bombing before my eyes. You know I like having access to be able to see what's going on but I sure don't want to watch the blow by blow of this war.    On a lighter note, or what should be a lighter note. I went to the graduation ceremony at one of the elementary schools that I teach at. Unfortunately they were all at the same time so I wasn't able to attend all of them.  Graduation in Japan is one of the most SERIOUS occasions I've ever seen! I wonder sometimes if these folks enjoy anything without being so serious about it.  It was so funny to watch the students 11 and 12 years old being straight faced not talking or laughing for about an hour and 40 mins.    Now that the war has actually broken out, my mom and granma are scared a little about my trip. I will heed everyones advice and be as careful as I can be.

      A few quick things cause I' m at work and of course forgot my battery pack for my computer and the battery died this morning! TAIHEN!!!!  I'm worried about G because his inbox is full. The only times its ever full is if he is away on a deployment or at sometype of military training. Usually he emails me and lets me know when he is leaving or that he is gone but this time nothing so I'm a little worried. Especially with this morning's announcement by President Bush who intends to free the entire free world (pun intended) in the next 48 hours or so. G if you are out there, give a sista a holla.  I had lunch with my 8th graders yesterday and we were talking about harvest fruits. I was asking about the different seasons and what types of fruits and vegetables you get from each. I know, I know, not the most interesting conversation for lunch but we do the best we can. . .well anyway, there was one produce that I couldn't understand. So after lunch one of my favorite students Moe (pronounced Mo-eh) came up to me with the word "chestnut" written on her hand. Naruhodo -ne? Okay, so the funny thing is I ate at the same table today and Moe's hand STILL had the word on it!!! It was funny but she is a good girl so I didn't want to embarass her but if it had been one of the boys they would have been DONE!  Only a few more days until my New Zealand trip!!! I went and borrowed a back pack yesterday and I'm going to finish up some washing tonight so everything will be dry and ready to go Thursday night. Keysha is off Friday and she lives hella close to the bus station so I'm going to stay at her place. We are going to TRY to braid my hair. Wish us luck. Anyway bell just rang.  Ja Ne!

      In today's post I take a moment to pause and reflect on the short time that I knew a wonderful person.   When I went down to Camp Zama for the Delta Peppermint Ball about a month ago I met some wonderful sorors including one woman named Jacqueline Williams. We affectionately referred to her as Ms. Jackie. Ms Jackie was probably one of the oldest women in the chapter but just as lively and fun as the younger sorors. She made jokes with us and about us!  We (Erica, Ameenah, Ms. Jackie and I) sat and watched Apollo after the Ball that night and overall had a good time. Tank (the singer) was on that night and we laughed as she looked at him and told us how FIONE he was and that he had a nice body!  She reminded me so much of my aunts and older relatives with the old skool flava and modern slang. Erica and I had already invited ourselves up to celebrate Mother's Day with her. We were going to cook for her and everything. . .I am talking in the past tense because Ms. Jackie died in her sleep last night. She was in a hotel room on Camp Zama's base with one of her chapter sorors.  They were spending the night there because there was a Delta Academy Cotillion last night that she was MCing.  The Delta Academy girls were putting it on and had worked really hard and raised money for it. I didn't go because I wanted to save my money for NZ trip at the end of this week and now I'm sad in a way that I wasn't able to be around Ms. Jackie in her last few hours. Its so funny how life changes on us so quickly. She had just emailed me Friday telling me that she was going to get my girl scout cookies off to me that she had bought. She told me she had just been a little busy but was going to get aroundtuit soon. She said "Hold your horses lil sistah!" Boy I'm going to miss that lady.    My prayer for Ms. Jackie: Lord you have helped me in many ways in the last nine months. One of the greatest gifts you have bestowed upon me is the opportunity to meet many different types of people and some of them have been people I'll never forget.  About a month ago you brought a cheery woman in a bright red suit with a cream dress blouse who I knew upon seeing her was a Delta. She approached our table in the food court area of the PX who came in talking about wanting a "chicken and a biscuit".  It was my pleasure to get it for her and anything else she needed cause she looked like she had already had quite along day.  Once we checked into our hotel that night I even drove her car to the hall where the Ball was held because she wanted us to have her car so we could have a ride over there and she had to be there before us. Lord, there was a smile on her face everytime we saw her! I saw the beauty that only you can instill in someone's life radiating all over Ms. Jackie's person.  I am saddened by her passing but I know that your arm swept her up where she belongs.  It was her time to go and only you knew that and your reasons for bringing her home. Be with her family and give them strength to realize that we all belong to you and that no one is on earth any shorter or longer than you plan for them to be. Bless the lives that Ms. Jackie touched with her kind heart and warm smile. Give us comfort as we are reminded that you are the ruler of all and determine the length of our lives not we ourselves.  Thank you again Lord for allowing me to even know Ms. Jackie for the brief time that I did and may we who love, cared, and were touched by her always think of Ms. Jacqueline Williams with a smile on our faces. In your name Lord, I pray all these things and I give you honor and praise for who you are, who you have been to me and mine, and will continue to be as long as my days on this earth are intended to be. Amen.

      Less than a week to go and I'll be on a plane to Korea and transfer there to a flight bound for New Zealand! I am really excited. Slightly nervous, but exicted more than anything else.  I have to go pick up a bag from Dave tomorrow which I'll probably have packed by Wednesday. I'm making lists and keep crossing off things because I know I'm taking too much but once the bag gets here the lists will probably go to the trash anyway. I've been trying to wash clothes and stuff but the weather is rainy this weekend and there's of course no sun at all which is really the only thing that keeps it fairly warm around these mountainous areas. I think if it doesn't clear up I'm going to try to make a few makeshift clothes lines in the house. I still have no idea how to do that so lets just hope a little sun shines this way.   My best friend is about to finally drop that load she's been carrying around for the last 8 months! The baby isn't due until April 4th but she has already begun dialating and has contractions about 15 mins apart. I talked to her on the phone last night before I went to bed for about 40 mins and she had 3 contractions during that time! My friend Vanessa who has two kids told me that she'll be having that baby real soon now. Probably this weekend or early next week. Today was her last day at work (Friday for the US folks) for a while. I think she wants to take off two months before putting Micah in day care. She's breastfeeding so its going to be difficult but my girl is finally growing up THANK GOD! I'm glad that being a mommy has help changed her life in such a positive way.  My mom told me today that my niece is in the eccelerated readers program at school! I always love to hear that! With the girls (my lil sister and niece) I never really bought them toys. Always either books or clothes. I guess I really wanted them to appreciate the things that are important in life: being smart and looking smart (as the Brits say) ! Ha Ha Ha! But it really does make me feel good to know they enjoy reading. There are so many other things the can and are interested in but balance is SOOO important! If they learn that early they've won more than half the battle. My mom also said my other niece was I haven't had a chance to see yet is cockeyed! I think maybe its just a weak eye. That sometimes happens with babies. Maybe it will straighten out maybe not but I'm sure she's a beautiful little girl anyway. I think my Granma has some pictures of her. Hopefully I can get her to send me a couple.  Sanae wants me to come watch Sex and the City that she got on DVD at Cacy's place with her today. Kimi will come too. Sana is excited because she'd never heard of it before and now she's hooked! Kimi has only heard about it from Sana so it will be an enjoyable afternoon I'm sure! Its funny because Erica has known about the show since it came out in the US but her first time watching it was here in Japan. She was so excited that she got on some website and found the series sets so she can have them! But its worth i think. Because by the time you  rent them all, you would have watched enough and paid enough to equal what a set costs. And since she is going home to "The Chi" next week she doesn't have to pay for shipping!! It will be a fun afternoon. Uh Oh, looks like the rain has stopped, its getting kinda bright outside so I'm going to get busy and do some more cleaning before our afternoon movie session begins.  TTFN!

      What a wonderful place Kyoto is!  Hazel and I took the bus down there Thursday night. It was a really comfortable bus. They had slippers to put on and a blanket to cover you up while you slept. The bus left Kofu at 10ish and got to Kyoto around 6am ish Friday morning. It was too early to even get a cup of coffee or a piece of fruit so we just went to the bathroom washed up and walked around the train/bus station checkin' it out.  It was a pretty big station too and around 7 we finally were able to go to the information desk, get a map and try to find our way around and map out our plan for the day.  We bought these 2 day bus/subway passes for about 2,000 yen which turned out to be really good investments because the buses go all over the city and come quite often.  Day one we went to Ginkaku-ji (the silver temple), Eikan-do, and Nanzen-ji. We went to lunch at this wonderful little restaurant that was recommended to us by Lonely Planet Japan called Hinode.  They saw our Lonely Planet book on the table and got excited. The owner was so nice! We asked him for directions on how to get to our hostel and he didn't know so he took our book and called the place to get the directions. Then he proceeded to draw us out a map from the restaurant to the place which he said would take about 20mins walking.  After we left the restaurant and had probably walked for about 5-7 mins, the owner pulls up next to us and offers to drive us to the hostel!!! It was such a nice thing to do. Just when some Japanese folks piss ya off, you find folks like the man from Hinode (who's name we never even got) who do such benevolent things.  The place we stayed was kinda shaky. It was a dorming house for foreigners. Some long stay as well as short stay. It was fine because we only had to stay there one night but longer would have been a problem. It was an 8 mat tatami room with a small balcony and a kitchenette, if you can call it that.  I refer to it as the dungeon and am glad we only had to stay there one night!!! After we found the place we unloaded a few souveniors we bought and set back out to the rainy streets of Eastern Kyoto. We headed back up towards Maruyama Park where there was supposed to be a festival of lights and some stage performances. We were most excited about seeing the Geisha women dance. Its funny because I never knew how important Geisha were to Japanese society. They are actually like the highest level of feminity that a women can be. They are very well trained in Japanese art of tea ceremony, dance, ikebana (flower arranging) and many others.  The women who train to be Geisha area called Maiko. I think I was told some begin as Maiko at the young age of 15! Anyway it was really nice and so cool to actually get to see them dance and sing. The kimono they wore were beautiful!! And their make up was flawless. After that we walked around and took pictures of the scenery and the way they had lit everything up.  It was a great atmosphere. Nice date spot too! Then we left to go find a onsen type bath. The only thing is the water wasn't hot spring mineral water. It was just regular water. We did that and then set out to find dinner and go back to our hotel.  The dinner thing was hard because it was late when we got done bathing. It was about 10ish when we got back down to Gion, which is the hot spot night area.  The other thing is Hazel is a vegetarian which in Japan is hard in the first place and especially if you are just eating out and don't really know where to go. We finally found this one Asian restaurant that I throughly enjoyed but Hazel ended up not being able to eat much. She's very accomodating so it wasn't bad and she would never complain but we had to eat soon because I was turning into the mean hungry E which isn't a pleasant person so she didn't mind eating there. What a whirlwind first day and the second proved to be just as busy.  We got up pretty early and planned out our next day turned in the keys and set off into Kyoto. Today we planned to hit a few spots we'd missed the day before and a bunch of new stuff. We took a bus down to the Station so we could put our heavy stuff in a locker and set out for the temples. We grabbed a bite to eat at the station which ended up being much more suitable for Hazel. Then we took the subway up to Nijo Castle. This was probably my favorite next to the Park. It was so tight!! It was the home of the famous shogun Tokugawa. Inside the castle there are "nightengale floors". This means that whenever walk the floor boards have a distinct squeaking sound. The floors were contructed for that purpose that wherever you walked squeaks to protect him from intruders and so he always knew when someone was coming.  Since the builiding is so old they don't allow photos to be taken inside but I'm trying to hold on to the mental images as much as I can. We saw the room where he held his cabinet meetings and they had these doors that were roped with this bright orange cord. Wherever this cord was on a door there was a bodyguard behind it to protect the shogun in an emergency. I think there were some peep holes in the door too, but we couldn't get up close enough to see it.  This castle is surrounded by a moat which is the first time I've actually seen something like that NOT on TV. There were beautiful Japanese style gardens that I did get a few pictures of. It was just really nice and peaceful. I enjoyed it throughly.  Next we went to a dragon processional at Kiyomizu Shrine. No one told us about the 15 min uphill climb to the temple, but the walk and fatigue was WELL worth it. We walked around once we got to the top and I spotted a group of Japanese folks standing around so naturally we went up there. I told Hazel that anytime you see Japanese folks in a group just waiting...you go then! Because it is usually something worth waiting for.  Shortly there after, piles of people just seemed to come out of NO WHERE pushing and shoving to get to the front. We held down the front line though and Hazel got some really good movies with her digital camera.  Mine takes the movies but there isn't any sound so its no good to take movies of that kind of thing.  It was awesome though. First 8 buglers came down dressed in this heavy green and orange gear. The buglers were playing conk shells (not sure about the spelling) but when you blow in them an amazing sound some out. Next the soliders came down, then the priestesses and the high priest and finally the dragon! It was carried by about 10 -12 men and they really moved it like it was a dragon body! I was so impressed. They came down and the priestesses put something over the crowd out of their bowls using a wand of some sort and then the whole processional went down that hill we'd just come up! It was sooo cool! After they left some of the people standing around followed them down. We took another hill cause we didn't want to be in the traffic.  We came across this shop where this 80 year old woman had made these gorgeous little paper Japanese women folded into bookmarks. They were only like $3 a piece so we both bought a few.  After that we went to this place called Sanjusan gendo. It was a temple that had 33 something or others but I'm not sure what. It also had 1000 budda statues with over 10,000 arms. They say that all the faces of these statues are different and one looks like you. You just have to figure out which one it is.  We got there when it was almost closig time so we didn't get to see much.  We left there and went back up to the park and saw a wonderful taiko drum performance. After that we went to another bathhouse. This one was much better than the first but harder to find.  Both of us were craving to go back to Hinode where we had lunch the first day but couldn't justify going all the way back up there until that is we found a subway near the bathhouse! So we took a subway and then a short bus to the place and guess what!!! They were closed! I couldn't believe it. We had wasted so much time getting there too that we didn't have time to get to a nice restaurant before time to catch the bus home. So, we just caught a cab back down to the station picked up our packages from the lockers, went to McDonalds for some fries and an apple pie and then to this quick beef bowl shop. I think Hazel got rice and a tofu soup.  We rushed back across the street in time to catch the night bus back home to Kofu  Admist the heat and slight snoring I had a pretty enjoyable and restful ride home and a great weekend. I'm looking forward to New Zealand even more now because I know that Hazel and I can and enjoy traveling together so that's a relief. I'm pretty much down for whatever and so is she so it wasn't stressful at all. It was cool. I'm glad we got a chance to go together!!!

      I received on of the best presents I've ever gotten today! My 9th graders are graduating next week and they usually give all the teachers a gift. Our gift this year was a board with a picture of the class in the middle and around it a "thank you" message from each one of the students. It was sooo sweet! It was funny because it was in 1/2 English and 1/2 Japanese but I loved it just the same. Some of the kids have pretty bad handwriting so I couldn't really figure out what they were saying but I'm going to take it to my Japanese lesson on Sunday and let her look at it for me.    That reminds me, I need to pack some soccer clothes for Sunday too. I'm leaving to go to Kyoto tonight for the next two days with Hazel. We were supposed to stay until Sunday night and take the bus back in time to be at school on Monday but our bus reservation got mixed up and we will come back Saturday night instead and arrive back in Kofu on Sunday morning around 6am.  I think I'll just take Hazel home and stay in Kofu at Keysha's and take a nap. If I feel like it, we have soccer practice at 1. Then I have my private and Japanese lesson beginning at 4.  I'm not sure how busy we'll be in Kyoto and haven't decided if I'll be too tired to do anything Sunday but as of now everything is still on.  I hope that Keysha can do something to this bush that I'm pretending to call hair. I haven't had a perm since December when Lessie did it. It was about mid-December too and only the second perm I've gotten since I cut all my hair off. This stuff is very unruly!   Last week I made an appointment at this salon but when we were hanging up I quickly asked their prices. They said $70 for the perm. Not too bad, but then he mentioned that if I didn't have my OWN PERM it would be $25 more dollars! He was kidding right? Nope! He said we sell them here for about $25.  Just plain old box perm for $25...I couldn't do that. I couldn't spend $100 on a hairdo that I might hate when I walked out. So I'm waiting on the sorors to get me a hair appointment at one of the military bases. The only reason I didn' t do that in the first place was I wanted to do it on my own. If I go to the base someone has to go with me and sign me in etc. But its cheaper and with this NZ trip comin' up in less than a month...a sista is on a budget!  Well lemme shower and stuff so I can go pick up my travelin' buddy and hit the road from Kyoto. Don't worry Diary-san I'll take plenty of pictures!

      Tonight I finally got a chance to watch the tape that E sent me. Her folks taped some videos, the whitney and bobby interview, more videos, the billboard music awards and still more videos. Well, I'm up to the Billboard Awards now. I'm excited cause Cedric the Entertainer was the host and that is for real my MAN!  He's a funny dude yo. He can wear just about ANY hat he puts on! I know its sad cause I'm finally watching the awards almost a year after they came out but its still new to me.  That's one of the things I don't like is missing out on new TV. I mean I left right at the beginning of Cedric's new show. I got to see two episodes while I was home for Christmas and it made me sad to know I was going to miss out on his debut program. Oh well. Its not a life or death thing...I'll just be unfashionably out of date with current comedy when I get back. Probably revert to tellin' knock-knock jokes...Woe is me...

      Sunday's are always some of my favorite days. I usually do laundry between naps (ha ha ha) and its funny how I actually enjoying hanging out clothes. The after that, I look over my japanese lesson from the previous week, that I should have been looking at during the week and then look briefly over what I'll cover with Yumie and Shozo.  Today was no exception. The weather was chilly in the shade but the sun made it great for hanging/drying clothes.  I get such cabin fever and I really want to open my doors and windows as the sun looks soooo inviting, but its only a trap. As soon as I step outside I realize that the wind is very strong and the sun is only playing tricks with my emotions.  I can't wait for the weather to finally break and become warm. One of the teachers I work with told me that it won't happen until APRIL! Can you believe that! APRIL! I sure can't. Its seems like the entire time I've been in Japan its been freezin! I can't take it. I'm a moderate to hot weather babe. This cold spell is freezin' all my mojo out!! (I can't even take myself seriously as I write that)  This morning the first call I recieved for the day was from Miho, one of my 7th graders.  We studied English phone ettiquite last week and I told them that they could call me to practice. My team teacher told them if they did call me they'd get 10 points added to their grade!! All of them sounded excited by it but Miho was my first call. She's given them until March 4 to complete the assignment. It was of course a very short conversation. "Hello this is Miho" "Oh, Hi Miho" "Can I speak to...(dead silence)" "This is Eboni, how are you Miho" "I'm fine thank you" "Well, Miho, thanks for calling.  (silence) Talk to you later." "Okay bye"  It of course doesn't seem like much but I'm proud of her on a few levels. #1 for actually having enough balls to call. #2 being the first one in the class to call. She isn't even one of the better students at English. Its not like they get held back or anything if they don't have high grades. Everyone goes on the next level anyway. I'm just happy she called.  The second call I recieved was from my Japanese teacher who told me that if I didn't have anything to do today she wanted to invite me over for dinner.  Her husband would be cooking all chicken dishes and wanted me to join them. I always enjoy their company and her husband is a GREAT cook, so I never turn down an opportunity to hang out and socialize with them.  So after my lesson with Shimura-san, I went to spend an hour and a half studying Japanese and then the evening eating and talking with the Muramatsu family. Dinner was of course delicious.  Mr. Muramatsu made a chinese chicken strip salad  with a homemade ginger and onion dressing which was WONDERFUL! He also made an appetizer of eggplant and red bell peppers with a light sesame oil and soy sauce. The two main entrees were Chicken Gyoza Nabe (which is like a soup with chicken pastry and cabbage) and Chinese Spaghetti with chicken and bell pepper mixed in. It was so delicious!  I love eating with them because they are so fun.  Tonight we had conversations about when to use " " in speaking with your hands. I tryed to tell my teacher that you only make quotes with your hand twice when you say something and trying to help her understand situations in which you use them.  She kept doing it over and over again. I have to practice it in conversation with her so she'll understand how to use it. It was a sight too hard to explain.  We also had a discussion about Christianity and its many different beliefs and dominations. I told them about how I was raised African Methodist but have attended Missionary Baptist churches since I began college. Its really difficult to explain religion to people who don't really believe but its good for me because it helps me to affirm what I believe and explain exactly what it is I believe in. I know there was a time in my life where I couldn't have done that.  It also helps me see how far I've come spiritually.  I also brought the new Alicia Keys CD with me that I got at Towers Records. Its called "Remixed and Unplugged in A Minor". In some of the unplugged songs she is just playing the piano. My teacher is also a piano instructor so I wanted her to listen to how Alicia incorporates many different piano styles into her music.  She enjoyed it I think. We ended the night with a brief discussion of Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima and I told her how much I really want to visit the museums there sometime soon.    I really want to learn more about world history and specifically how it relates to US relations with other places. I really wasted my time in my World History lessons in High School. Although I made "A's" it was mostly shortterm memorization and that does me absolutely no good at the point I'm at today. I've got a lot to learn here! Japanese! World History! How to be a better teacher! How to be a better person! What I like! What I don't like!  What's important and indespensible! What's not important and expendible! and the list goes on. I'm glad I decided to stay another year because I could definitely use the personal growth. I feel so good about life and about myself but of course there is always more to learn.   "I never felt sooo....goood"  as Ms. Keys and Mr. McKnight would say.

      I'm sitting here reading emails and feeling a little sad. Not "boo-hoo" sad, but nostalgic. My back (linesister behind me in line #14) got married this weekend. This is the 4th wedding of someone important to me that happened since I left home in August of last year. Tasha and Prep in September, Kellie and Brandon in June, Gloria and Q in June, and now Deirdre and Duwan in July. There will be at least three more that I know about before 2003 is out: Titia and Rodney in August, Missy and Ellis...not sure when, and Benah and Anthony in November.  I have to continue to remind myself that this is just how life is. You aren't able to drop everything and go to everyone's event all your life. I was good for doing that when I was in college and I was always there for everyone's everything. For these two years, being away is HARD...especially when you miss big things in folks lives.   The little things are also very important. I gave a gift to my good friends brother and his mom told me today that her son hasn't taken the necklace off since he got it. Not to shower, not to change, never.  I am glad that my gift means that much to someone.

      Aiight, boy have a got a good story to tell...  Last Friday, I went to Yokohama with my friends Keysha and April. Yokohama is near this military base so there are a lot of black dudes there. We wanted to club so we went to this place called Club B. Of course the black guys were all over the Japanese chicks but to be honest no one in there was worth hollerin' at for real anyway  Well I was minding my business, doing a two step dance and stuff, drinking my drink and stuff, and this black dude comes up to me and was like "What you drinking?" I say "Rum and coke" He asks me "You want another one?" I'm like "No, this is my third (it was really my 5th) I'm okay" The dude looks over at me and says "You know, you speak really good English" I'm like "Ya think! I'm American crazy ass!"    Moral of the story:  You know its time to take your ass home to the USA when black dudes start thinking you are Japanese!!!  Aiight after that, we were out there dancing and the "Tootsie Roll" came on. We was old skoolin' it and slidin' left and right, then came the "dip baby dip" part. Well, on the first "dip" I was givin' them all I had when...my pants SPLIT! Right down the ass (ok, where the ass should be and I had on a thong!) Yes, I have succeeded in splitting yet another pair of perfectly good pants. I found one of the bouncers (who is a homeboy of mine) and made him walk me out with his coat so no one would see and so that I could get back in w/o paying again. Of course I was the laughing stock of the evening cause he told his boys (the other bouncers) but hey, that's nothing new.  I'm always good for a bit of comic relief.  I enjoyed hanging out with Keysha and April but they are best friends and sometimes its weird hanging out with two people who know each other so well because you feel like you are on the outside. Which that didn't really bother me much because I like to be able to move freely about the club and a train of three gets to be a bit much after a while.  I miss my girls. . .  I feel a spell of homesickness coming on.

      This weekend was a lot of fun!!! Erica's birthday was Saturday (June 12th) and she finally reached the ripe old age of 23! She insisited on telling me all day long that we were finally the same age...failing to recognize that it will only be that way for 2 short months..and regardless I'm still the older sister. That's what I've come to consider her as. We're great friends and talk just about every day and we argue like siblings as well. Although we've never come out and said, "You're my sister" we definitely act the part. Sometimes words are just not necessary, ya know.  Anyway, so I went up to Tokyo to hang out with her. We had dinner at Sizzler in Harajuku with Saitama Chris and Chiba Monique. That's the way I've come to name people because you meet so many people with the same name that you can't distingush in simple conversation. Anyway dinner was GREAT. I had cocktail shrimp for starters a nice herb chicken breast with white wine for the entree. Best meal I've had out in a while. After that we went to Shibuya and met up with some folks. We went to this place called  Club Vuenos (where my wallet was stolen back in May) and the cover was like 3000yen to get in. Couldn't see it! I don't even like that place. I suggested we go to Roppongi because there are a lot of clubs there and a lot of them don't have a cover. That way if we don't like the vibe we have the option of going elsewhere. People finally agreed to this and we went by cab to the Roppongi area.   I ran into a few of my homeboys on the street out there and they were going to this place called A Life. I had been there before with Dwayne and Ray (two of my boys) during Dwayne's last night out. Anyway, we tried to go there but Saitama Chris had on shorts and sandals so they wouldn't let him in. We think it had something to do with the "Gaijin" factor. . .but nonetheless we didn't bother with it, we just took ourselves to another place.   The main thing I DON'T like about Roppongi is the Africans there. They try to MAKE you do some shit. Its really annoying. Like, we'd be walking down the street and all of a sudden you have 5 of them in your face trying to influence you to come to their club and they have drink coupons for you and so on. Well, they convinced one of the people that was with us to try this place called "The Limit" we were walking towards the club and Erica and I stopped to talk. I guess we weren't moving fast enough for them so this one dude started tapping Erica on her back kinda hard and talking fast at her.  Of course there was an exchange of word followed by Erica imitating him with the same type of slapping on the back. It was funny. So we spent our night at "The Limit" and this other bar called "Midas". Midas was definitely the better of the two. Nice atmosphere and the drinks were on point! I ended up running in to Ray there with his friend that Erica and I so kindly nicknamed "Chi-town". He was funny!  He and Erica were "Steppin' in the name of Love" it was funny.   We left Midas as the sun was bright and shining about 7am. Half of our original crew: Monique, Ameenah, Morrall, Saitama Chris, Shaun, Erica and I was then dwindled down to 3. Me, Monique and Erica. We took it down the street to this club called "Nature". Yes, we went to another club at 7am! Stayed there til about 11 and keep the partying going! It was awesome. I got home about 2:30 in the afternoon on Sunday and was BEAT!!!! But, I still had a Private English Lesson (that I teach) and my Japanese class to go to. So, I went home showered, washed my hair and fell asleep (by accident). I was 30 mins late to my 4pm lesson because of my little nap but they understood. After my lessons, my Japanese teacher invited me to stay for dinner and being the person I am...I accepted of course! Had a good dinner and left about 9:30. What a day. Didn't lay down to sleep until about 11pm. And today as I type my body is TIRED and my kidneys even hurt! Can you believe that. I need to ease up fa sho.

      Its been so long since I blogged they've changed the format on me! But as I sit here and type I think about how I've missed chronicling my life (oh i really messed THAT spelling up!). I've definitely got to get back to this. Right now I'm in the midst of typing up minutes from our Yamanashi English Teachers International Council meeting. Yup, couldn't take the pressure of not being involved in at least ONE time consuming organization out here! So here I am, but I will get right back. I've got so much to tell you about International-E...

      Yeah! Its FRIDAY!!!! I have made it in sound mind and  body from Monday until now and I still feel pretty darn good. I guess I'm excited about the weekend and getting to hang out with BB again. He told me that we are going to celebrate my birthday this weekend because he won't see me on my actual birthday. We are going to see STOMP in Tokyo. That should be fun, but I'm curious as to what else he has in store. This weekend is also a big Samba festival in Tokyo. Erica and some of my other peeps are going up there to check it out. Chiba Mo is back and I think Erica will be with her most of the weekend. BB told me that there is a "Outback Steakhouse" in Chiba and we're going there for dinner tonight. YEAH!!!   I had the funniest experience yesterday in class. I went to the Elementary School that I like the least but still ended up having a good time. I dislike it because the Vice Principal and Principal are just asses that's it. No more no less. The teachers are cool, the students are fun and seem to like me, its just I don't like dealing with the VP and P. They suck. Anyway the 1st grade teacher Arai Sensei is my favorite! I went by her class and one of my favorite little girls, Hina, was in there CRYING. So I stopped and asked what was up. Arai Sensei said Hina didn't understand the lesson so she started crying. Then Arai sensei busts out laughing saying, "Look at her crying. Hina, you see Eboni? She is watching you cry? Do you like that?"  I think she had try to get her to stop and to see how silly it was for her to be crying for nothing. And then I started laughing. I couldn't help it. So then she told Hina to show me her picture she made. I was asking her questions about it and she would spit out syllables between her wails of crying. It was so funny. She was sniffling and trying to catch her breath and would say "my sister" or "my father" or "fireworks" describing her picture. It was great. There are only 3 students in her class including her so the other little boys were trying not to laugh to make her feel bad but we don't want her being a cry baby. She stopped after a while.  The second hilarious thing was in my lesson with the 1st and 2nd grade class (I teach them together) one of the 2nd graders Yuichi had to use the bathroom, #2.  We were right in the middle of playing "What time is it Mr. Fox?" when Yuichi tells Arai Sensei that he's got to go do #2. So she makes him come to the front of the room in front of everyone and say, "Eboni, excuse me but I have to use the bathroom, is it okay if I leave to go do #2." He got so embarrased by the end of his little speech I just laughed and said "Go Ahead".  Then Arai sensei told me that he always has to do go #2 after lunch or his stomach hurts really bad, but he never takes time to do it during his recess. She's so funny!!! I love her.  Anyway, the weather is great today and I'm feeling good. I just had a great lesson with my 1st graders and hope to have just as good a lesson with the 2nd graders and I'm done for the day. Yatta!

      I'm SLEEPY! I should have started getting up early a while back to train myself for this TORTURE! I'm so used to sleeping in.   Today is a pretty busy day for me. I have elementary school lessons in the morning, then the training meeting for the new ALTs at 1:20, then if it isn't raining I'll go for a run, come home shower and then off to my hair appt! Ryuta (my hair dresser) was supposed to do it last week but he had some family issue and wasn't able to so today is now D-day again. I think part of it not happening last week has to do with this law in my life: If I tell a lot of people about something big I expect to happen on a certain day at a certain time, it never does.  I'm not sure why it happens like that. Maybe its God telling me I need to keep my business to myself or something, but at any rate that's pretty much the law with me. I didn't tell many people this time. Actually I probably only told three people. So we'll see if something dramatic goes down or not. I'm definitely taking before and after pictures. Pretty much like I did when I get my hair relaxed in Tokyo last October for the first time since I had cut all my hair off. And of course as if my scalp knows what day it is, it wants to act crazy and start itching like there's no tomorrow. Me and this head of mine. I'm glad I'm not a person who is really big into hair. I like for mine to look nice but I don't really fret over it. (did i really just say fret?)  I'm awful at preparation and have gotten used to being able to "wing it" in class and at meetings. Its like I WANT to be prepared, and I have a few ideas on HOW I should be prepared but it doesn't usually work out with me preparing way way in advance. Like for today's workshop...I grabbed a bunch of my materials from school to show them and I've got some ideas written down. But that's about it. I'll do a little more when I get to the elementary school...maybe...I think it will be fine though.   Today I pray:  that I still have a head full of hair by the end of the day. It may sound like a silly request but I was told in my prayers that I should name it and claim it. I want to have all the hair on my head and these chemicals will not tear up my skin or my hair. I pray that you work while he is working hard Ryuta to make my beautiful. This is the first time for him too so give him confidence in what he is doing so he won't be nervous and mess anything up. Thank You Lord! Amen.

      This Japanese Proficiency Test is going to be the death of me. I went to my japanese lesson last night and was so saddened and determined at the same time. It was like my big wake up call that if I am going to pass this test, its going to take a lot of dedicated studying from now until the time I take the test. i have 3 months and 1 week until the test date:  December 7th . After I left my lesson I felt like I needed a little cheering up so I called BB. First I sent him a c-mail seeing if he was busy and letting him know that I needed a little moral support. He's sweet when he wants to be and called me right back. He basically told me what I'd already told myself but I just needed a little attention and to share my emotions. Its really cool having him in my life right now. I'm supposed to be going to visit him this weekend but I've told him that I have to make sure I get some study time in each day I'm there. He's fine with it. He wants me to do well on my test also since I show so much desire for wanting to pass. I just know that last night was my realization that passing this test is going to take some serious work on my part. My Japanese teacher is all gun-ho and has offered to give me extra lessons if I need them and extra help whenever, so that's great.  I've started running. I always used to just take off running or walk running when I wanted to get in some good exercise or felt like I had a lot of energy to spare but I've been the last 3 days in a row and I hope it keeps up. I was actually sad when it started to rain because I was afraid it was going to keep up all day. Right now I'm only running about 20-30 mins with a short break after about 10 mins to get in a good stretch and catch my breath. After that first breath and wind I can go for much longer.  Its so funny because I've always been told that I have an athletic looking body and I've always enjoyed sports, I'm just not really good at any one thing. And since I've been pushing myself to get out to the park to run I've been feeling even better. I have a bad knee that really needs to be strengthened so I'm not walking with a cane by age 30! So I've got determination. I just can't sit around and let my youth go to waste, now can I?   Today I pray : for endurance. I have a lot on my plate right now with the private English lessons, my Japanese lessons and this proficency test, my desire to keep exercising regularly, and just every day stuff. I pray that you continue to bless me with the strength to handle all that I have going on in my day to day life. Endurance to run the proverbial race. I praise and thank you for all you do in my life everyday! Amen.

      okay. i didn't have to cut anyone. somewhere into the morning the water came back on. there is still some part of the school w/o it but the teachers bathroom and teachers room are cool so that's all i worry about. yokkatta!  its so funny walking around down stairs where there aren't many classrooms and going upstairs where you can tell from the smell that hits you as you ascend that kids are around. i mean, maybe some children aren't allowed to wear deodorant until they get into high school or something but their parents need to stop. I know about four kids in each class that need to sit all together and smell each other. then maybe they will learn hygiene a little better. but you know what, they might just think its someone else's odor and not theirs. someone needs to tell them for real. the teachers here do a lot more parenting than we do at home but at least teachers i was taught by wouldn't let me walk around like that. its just foul to everyone around.

      all summer (which is a month for us) my school has been under construction. they are doing some things to bring it up to code before changes are made school system wide.  today i came into school as usual for the first day of classes and sat down at my desk for the teachers meeting and got a HUGE surprise.  the water is off here and has been off since Saturday. so you wonder what's my issue? since we can't use the water, we can't use the toilets either and these crazy mfs done told me that we are going to have to pee in buckets! that shit is wild. I WONT be doing that. I'll take my ass home first...it will be interesting to see how this day turns out. Also its hot as hell so we are going to be drinking water so we don't pass out...*shakin my head* this is going to be funny.

      I saw the most BEAUTIFUL thing today....I navy blue billboard with the words "RED LOBSTER" glowing in neon red.  Pulling up to the parking lot I felt like I was driving down MLK Blvd in Durham on my way to the Red Lobster there. It looks a lot like that one. Anyway, Charlotte and I met there for dinner tonight. Its only like 30 minutes from my house but its kinda pricey. I mean the wait staff uses the highest level of politeness when they speak and give the real DEEP bow when they leave the table and stuff. Its supposedly a really "Posh" place.  Its not a place that you go just to be going, and I don't think it has discount crab leg night or shrimp fest like that do at home. Its very different actually. They don't even have cheese garlic bread! Keysha says that its not even a real Red Lobster w/o cheesy garlic bread. I'd have to agree. I wasn't totally happy with our meal but I did have some interesting shark sticks with batter and sweet and sour sauce. Quite good, but I have to be honest...I was a little worried when we ordered them.  Please tell me WHY I slept on the Justin Timberlake CD. That CD is GREAT! Its my new favorite CD. I know its old as crap to everyone else in the free world but I just got put on. I'm mad at every person who mentioned this CD and never made me go out and get it. *arms folded, lips poked out*  Today was the last day of the Japanese English Teachers workshop. I'm GLAD its over, but I really think that some of the things we talked about stuck with the group. It was good for the new people to interact with Japanese Teachers who they will be working with in the classrooms as well as get a taste of their levels of English, their behavior, the way they lesson plan and such. I also enjoy meeting so many people. I was a group leader for all 4 days of the workshop and that was nice too. I really felt "in my element". I studied communications and people in college so it was strange but I felt like I was actually qualified to be doing this type of work. It only confirms the fact that my college years and degree were not wasted and I am using some of that stuff I learned along the way. Thanks UNC!  I got a phone call from the International Division of CLAIR the other day and one of the PC's called to ask if I would be one of two journalists for this International Bi-monthy Newletter for the December edition. Its 2 pages and can be about anything I'd like to write about. What an honor huh? I was really flattered that they even asked me.  Trenya gave me a great idea on what to write about. I'll talk about the JETs of African Descent group. I'm going to start working on it soon since I'd like for a few people to have a look at it before I turn it in to be translated into Japanese. Anyway, I'm looking forward to writing. Its been a while since I wrote anything that would be close to worthy of publication...gambarimasu!   Tonight I pray:  thankful for being brought through yet another glorious day.  Even when its gloomy outside, I have something to smile about.  The blessings just don't end! Thank you Lord for the people who have prayed for me today and for those who have thought of me as a blessing to their lives. Thank you for helping your vision for my life to become a little clearer everyday. I also pray for a restful sleep and that I wake in the morning refreshed and ready to face my last day of summer holiday before school begins again. Thank you for a blessed relaxing summer. Amen.

      I've stayed away much too long. I have been having these really sleepless nights lately and its freaking me out. I mean, its not like every day or anything but its at least once or twice a week I'm up until like 3 or 4am, not tired at all and cannot fall alseep. A friend came to say with me this weekend and I tired so hard to be quiet but I'm not so sure how successful that was. I told myself its because I haven't been journaling my thoughts like I should but I believe its much more than that. My mom and I were thinking it may have something to do with my summer lifestyle. Although I have been quite busy, at the end of the day I'm not as physically drained as I am during the school year so I can't fall asleep as easily. That may be it, but if so we'll see soon enough because school begins on Monday for me.  Having said that...this is my last weekend of summer vacation and I need a GETAWAY. I was thinking about going to the G-unit as BB calls it to visit E. She wants to go up to Nikko Castle and waterfall in Tochigi-ken. I might check that out. See if we can hook up with any of the JETS AD in that area. Still undecided, but definitely going somewhere!!!  I hate backtrack blogging so I can't literally catch you all the way up on the events of the last 9 days but there are a few things that are certainly worth mentioning:  My SOCKS came today!!! I asked a friend of mine to send me some socks and Fruit by the Foot fruit snacks and they've arrived!!! YEAH!!! The box went to the BOE and they called me twice on my cell phone to let me know that a box had arrived. That made me totally happy. So here I sit, at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in my tshirt and panties and white Hanes socks eating fruit snacks. It truly is the little things!!!  My visit this weekend was totally amazing.  I was surprised because I didn't really think that BB and I would have such a good time or enjoy each other so much, but we really did! It rained from when he arrived on Thursday until sometime during the day on Saturday. All of the fun outdoorsy stuff I had planned...cancelled. We had to go into town on Friday to get groceries and my VCR died so I needed to get a new one. That turned out to be a wild goose chase, but finally after spending about 4 hours looking for one, I finally found one. I was amazed at how difficult it is to buy just a VCR nowadays. Most things are sold as a DVD/VCR combo or just DVD. I guess I need to join the 21st Century...but I happen to like VHS. Well, anyway after that we got the groceries,  rented some movies, and came back here. We cooked dinner together (mostly him, I just did the salad and took the potato chips out of the grease) and watched TV, listened to music, drank and went to sleep. The next day was pretty much the same type of relaxing stuff, slept late, cooked breakfast, read, watched movies and then went out to the movies and for drinks.    Its funny how you reall don't expect certain folks personalities to mesh well at all but his and mine do. Its good to have someone like him in my life right now that isn't as far away as RR is. What is it w/me and these same letter initialled people? Anyway, it will be interesting to see how things pan out. We won't see each other again for a while and we are sure to be around other people that know us both not just in our own little world like we were this weekend. Either way it works out, he's a cool guy so I hope the friendship remains.  I got a new phone!!! Its real cute. And it has a camera on it although I didn't really want one with a camera. It doesn't really matter because its cute and I love it. Now I am going to try to see how I can get a moblog going as...queen T says.   Today I pray:  for a restful nights sleep. Its already been a busy week and whatever it is that is keeping me awake at night, be it that I'm not talking with you enough Lord, or that I need to drink warm milk, help my spirit to be soothed enough to sleep well so that I have energy thru the day. Amen

      i got up this morning, hung my white clothes out to dry, took out three SWV CDs and put them in my stereo, set it for random, and took my seat at my computer. i have these strange morning routines, but they can't get started good until the music comes on.  the weather hasn't been bright and shiny but definitely warm the past two days. dark weather makes me sleepy and unmotivated. i remember once in college i told my friend tami that whenever it rains i have the most awful days and i couldn't really figure out why. she was like "oh virgos are just like that". from then on i just expected that when it was rainy on the outside i'd feel rainy inside too. then years later she told me "girl, i just told you that so you'd have an explanation for how you were feeling. i didn't know you were going to take it to heart." (insert Deneice Williams)  "silly of me, to think that i could ever" (/Deneice)....trust the word of a friend.  you know, i realized that although i'm a curious lady, i don't ask as many questions as other people do. and I don't live in this world of IF that so many other people do. when you have a conversation and half of it is laced with "What if" questions...i think you may be dealing with someone who isn't ready to deal with day to day. its the what ifers and the day-after-dwellers that i come in contact most but who annoy me most. this may be bad to some people but i live in the day that i'm experiencing mostly and actually a whole lot of forethought is a little troublesome. if you're wondering where all of these random thoughts come from, trust me they do have a source.   i have a friend who i've been talking to on a regular basis for the last week or so and he is planning to visit me this weekend. let's call him B. i think we'll have a good time together but i really need him to lay off the future questions. i don't know what i'm eating for breakfast (its 10:17am) so i sure don't know when i plan to get married or when i'll leave japan or when i'll have another boyfriend. sometimes i think B just asks things to hear himself talk and hear my reaction but he'll learn soon enough. i'm just not a way ahead planner. some folks have their whole lives mapped out something like....   graduate from this university with this GPA, go on to this grad school where i'll meet Mr. Right, we'll go on to date for a year and then he'll pop the question, we'll get married the next year, we'll move in to our house (our wedding present from his parents), then we have to live together for 2 years at least before we can have any kids, but after that "baby r us"!!!    Wouldn't it be grand if shit really worked like that? Now that same sweetheart who had it all mapped out...her life probably took turns in it like...  graduated from that university with that GPA, went off to Grad School and met Mr. Right, got knocked up after first semester, he stayed in school, i got an apartment and worked at JC Penny's till the baby came, he hit me with some that ain't my kid shit, i hit him with the courts and child support payments, now i do the best i can by me and my son that look just like his damn daddy....what happened to the life i planned for myself"   I was on the phone with E until like 2 am this morning laughing and joking. That is my girl! We have so much fun together.  It is soooo nice to have a friend you can talk seriously with, party with, laugh and joke til 2 o'clock in the morning with. E and I have made such leaps and bounds together as friends in the past year.  I hope we continue to grow individually as well as closer as friends.   Today I pray:  once again this week with thanksgiving in my heart for allowing me to have such awesome people in my life. When my family wasn't around you provided me with people who took me in as daugther, sister and friend. You have always blessed me with great people from all walks of life and for that I say, thank you! Amen.

      "I hope one day I can throw myself into the air and get caught up in the wind as well. " ~B  A friend of mine from college saw my Black Planet page where it talks about my job here in Japan and a few places I've been and he wrote that note to me. My favorite element is "wind".  I speak of it a little bit on that page, I guess that's where he got that statement from but there is something about it that made my heart leap. Here I am hoping to get swept up in the wind, when I'm reminded that I'm already caught up! Who knew!  Speaking of Caught Up...I'm almost out of breath right now. Its rare that I browse through BP like I used to, but I decided to check out my friend Jz page and let me just say that LA has been good to HIM! I mean, he has always been fine. Gorgeous face, nice body, great hair....but modeling and acting is being very very kind to my boy. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get to LA sometime soon! (Smile) Its weird thinking that one of my old boo's is about to be somebody big. He told me he's been doing some ads and a little sitcom acting but right when he made his big move to Cali, I made mine out here and haven't been able to see any of his work. I'll have to give him a ring soon and see if he is still extending his invitation for me to head out there for a visit.  fingers, toes, eyes, ears crossed!   Things with me and the friend I prayed about the other day are back to normal. We had a talk and I'm not sure how much things will change but things are cool. Its so strange how imbalanced I tend to feel when things are not right around me. *As i reach back and  feel Gye Nyame* I remember God has it all in his control.

      this is so strange! its like mid-august (ok, not quite) and summer has finally begun. we haven't had weather like this all summer and now that summer should be on its downfall we are getting all these high temps and gorgeous sunny days?!? oh well, that's when i turn and look outside and realize i'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut.   i went walking with keysha yesterday and get the strangest suntan lines i've ever had! i had on this belly shirt and sports bra and my pants hung so that half my tatoo was covered and the other wasn't. it looks so strange! the top of gye nyame is brown, the bottom is yellow. anyway, the walk was right on time because i needed to get some of the physical tension out that has been building up for a while. i dont know how i'm going to feel playing soccer again after being out of it for so long. i found this park that's got two swimming pools one indoor and one outdoor. i left my one piece in NZ when i went so i'm working with a two piece but i hope it will be okay. i really need a new suit but they are impossible to find here with out two cup sizes worth of "filling" and long enough to fit my torso properly. by the time i go home again, no one will be buying suits so hopefully i'll be able to find something...but that's months away.  my aunt IMed me today. i haven't talked to her in months. she gets so worried when she doesn't hear from me but i try to tell her that no news is good news. which with me it is. i'm really bad at getting back to folks sometimes. they also got used to me being the one who sends most of the emails but once my schedule started to fill up i didn't have the email time i used to.  i can do better though. i think sometimes only a "hey, how are you? I'm good" works for them. she was telling me about some issues she and my uncle were having. i swear sometimes i really think seriously about marriage and am sooooo glad i didn't get married young like a lot of my friends and family. i need every moment of these years that i've been out here. its perfect for me. i couldn't see it any other way. i mean, i love RR and all but marriage?!? i'm just not in that mindset at all right now and i'm glad that he isn't either. What a RELIEF!  i still haven't had the heart to heart with my girl yet but at least we are speaking again. our schedules haven't permitted us to talk just yet but i'm sure it will happen soon.   Today I pray:   and thank God for all the beauty around me. My life is full, my cup is overflowing, and I am blessed. Thank you for showing me the beauty in things that seem unattractive. Thank you for allowing me to be a blessing to others. Amen.

      last night was the welcome party for the group B arrivals in yamanashi.  we met at the train station and walked over to the restaurant. we did an all you can eat and drink there for 2 and a half hours and then moved the party to a sports cafe up the street. our yamanashi AJET organization (YETI) was the sponsor (though they didn't pay for anything) and since I am a officer for YETI I was the host for this party. out of all of the things i've had to plan thus far and "host" this was the LEAST taxing of them all. everything was wonderful. the amount of people who said they were going to show up did. no one had a problem with pay for the set (4,000yen nomi-hodai/tabe-hodai). someone had a birthday and sarah, a third year, brought him a small tart which we put candles on and sang Happy Birthday. just a great time.  one really peculiar thing was this japanese woman i met who continually spoke to me in FRENCH! her boyfriend is from France and is working as a CIR here so they usually speak French to each other. she can't speak english so I kept trying to tell her that its much better to speak to me in japanese.  but she wouldn't!!! until finally i asked her boyfriend why she kept speaking to me in french and she said it was because most foreigners she meets cannot speak Japanese but some know french.  we finally got the communication thing down but i just thought it very odd at first.  i had way to much to drink last night for the fact that i still had to drive. i mean, i wasn't incoherent drunk, but i did have to pay more attention than i usually do after a night out and being slightly sleepy. i usually don't drink when i have to drive home but i figured if we started dinner at 7 by 12:30 i'd be okay. i'd only had a few glasses of wine anyway. maybe not enough water. i got here safe though and prayed most of the way here no cops would come by.  i'm supposed to be going to play soccer today with some folks but they want to bbq and stuff after and I have my japanese lesson today. i haven't been in 2 weeks because of the Tokyo Orientation so i need to make my way down to her house. i'd love to go kick around but my studies come first  (yeah right! when have i ever said that!!!)    Today I pray:  for patience and clarity of thoughts. A friend of mine and I are sort of at odds and we need to get over this hump. I ask for the patience to not become frustrated by things I do not understand and clarity of thoughts so that my words flow freely and are acceptable to her ears. Amen.

      reflections of the last year...this week has been so strange for me. exactly a year and one day since i arrived in the village of kamikuishiki i find myself having these deep reflective thoughts of where my life was just a year ago.   i arrived at the international center in kofu, yamanashi on wednesday august 6th. a group full of anxious looking japanese faces greeted us. some with signs welcoming their new person, others only fixed on the bus trying to see if they could spot the foreigner who would be a part of their community for the next year.  only this time, no one was there waiting for me to get off the bus. i was the cheerleader..."its going to be fine" "they'll love you" "call me if you need anything". i got off the bus and looked around at all of the nervous faces, not sure if they should bow, shake hands or give out omiyage on the spot. it was so funny. like looking at an out of body experience. the voice in my head quickly reminded me:  this was you one year ago.   having decided to come to japan, i felt like more of the underling among my linesisters. three in law school, three pharmacists, two nurses, a dental hygenist, a high school teacher, a few in grad school...and lil ol' E, the one with no real direction but loads of "potential" decides to take herself to Japan to pursue this lifelong dream of visiting the far EAST. who knew that after one year i would have grown so much personally and professionally?  who knew that something that seemed like a whim turned out to be the greatest experience and most growing year of my life?  who knew that I would be the one giving advice and having people hang on to every word of my experience? who knew that i would still be here working on year #2?    not I said the little yellow girl. not I.

      Well, its Wednesday night. Tomorrow I leave for BB's afterwork and we head off for Korea Friday afternoon. I'm excited. We were talking about a few places we'd like to go see and some things to do while we are there. It sounds like its going to be a lot of fun. This will be the longest amount of time we've spent together and in a foreign land (not that Japan isn't...but we live here, its a bit different). I'm just about finished packing, just have to make sure I've got all my last minute items and figure out how much money I'm going to take with me.   My best friend and another good friend both had birthday's on Sept 15. I know so many Virgos. Its funny though that not all the Virgos I know ACT like Virgos. G does, but Rikca doesn't. She could very well have been a Libra, but just like her own little girl, she couldn't hold on any longer. She was ready to get out! I can't wait to see my Godbaby. I'll be home for 10 short short days in November so I'm looking forward to that big time.     Tonight I pray:  for safe travels and a hedge of protection around my travel partner and myself. I pray that all the spirits of discontent stay waway from us this weekend so that we will be able to enjoy each other's company. I also pray that after this long night awake I don't go to sleep at school when I should be working! G'nite. Amen.

      My Neck...My Back...Okay. Not my neck, but my $%#@ back is killing me! I was in the tug o'war contest with my kids yesterday and I think they tried to kill me! I have rope burn on my arm and side. I was trying my best to help them out but I think they gave up or thought we had it easy because when I came the first round we won. The second and third. I had to stop pulling slowly but surely because they were trying to hurt me!!!!  Anyway, I had a good day. It was long as hell but good. We got to school at 7:45am and I didn't leave until 8:30. I came home took a shower and took my behind to bed. I was out by 9:30! Seeing as though the events of yesterday plus being on the phone til all hours of the night w/BB this week have been taxing my sleep as well it was a welcome break.   I'm sitting here, in my livingroom at 12:55pm on a Sunday, with the fan blowing on my freshly washed hair, listening to the Brown Sugar and someone singing Time After Time. I feel so relaxed and peaceful.   I have a private today and then I'm supposed to be meeting ppl in Tokyo. Not really sure I feel up to it. We'll see.   Today I pray: that this pain in my back subsides. I know that you are the healer of all and in  your word you say that "By my stripes, you are healed" I know you are one who does what your word says so please take this pain away from my lower back. In your name I pray and count it all done. AMEN.

      I was sitting at lunch today next to one of my 2nensei kids who isn't very popular and I started to think to myself. "I really am having some impact on shaping the lives of kids" I mean no where near as much as the Japanese teachers do of course, and I have no problem with that but I think that this is the first time that in my mind I thought about that fact.  I was looking at this kid and wondering what he'd be like as a man. I know he takes care of his little brother and sister now because his parents work late at their store and he has a lot of responsibility for someone his age. He's in the best class in the school though. By best I mean most well rounded grade of the 3 that are here. They get along really well and aren't lame like their sempai the 3nensei class. Anyway, just an awaking for me that my actions, my lessons may in some way affect how these kids develop along the way.  I had a birthday!!!! I am now 24! Yeah. I guess when most of the men you date are older, the older I get the happier I am that I don't have to worry about them saying how young I am. But honestly, that doesn't stop anything really. Also when you are 24 you start making a lot of "I'm at a point in my life. . ." Statements. I think I may have said that about 23 as well, but I mean it this time. Maybe 24 is an age of enlightenment much like 13 and 17 were for me. Who knows, but I'm 24 and I love it. Didn't get one present, which I guess may be how it goes down when you get older.

      Its 2:52 am and I just got off the phone with BB. He's becoming an everyday thing. Okay, well he's been an everyday thing but tonight we talked for about 3 hours!!! I was supposed to call Erica back but I'm just getting off so of course that didn't happen. We talked a little about our Korea trip planned for next week and decided that I should take the day off on Friday and come up to his place Thursday night. Then we'd have an extra day together. He still has to go to work, at least for a while then we'll go to the airport together and be off.  I was having an awful day today (see previous post) but somehow on the way home and getting ready to call him, all of that changed.  Talking with him really does put me in a better mood sometimes.  Anyway enough about that. I got a little inspiration for my article on the way home today from my privates, which also contributed to my change in mood.  I popped in this old tape Erica's friend Seth made for me just before I left to come to Japan last year. It was like one of the only tapes I listened to for a few months here until I got the CD adapter in my car.  On it there is a song by Talib Kwali called "Knowledge of Self" and it talks about uniting the African Diaspora and how strong we could be if we connected. It just gave me hope and a few ideas on what to write about. So, that's what I'm going to build off tomorrow when I go to work. I really REALLY need to finish this tomorrow because it has to be to them on Friday and I still haven't gotten a translation done.  I talked w/my ls A today. She is hilarious!!! She was having an "I need to call E" moment but then realized I was in Japan. I don't understand why my friends think they CAN'T call Japan? But anyway her story was great and talking on IM was great and it just really made me miss her so so much. She is really talking about coming here and that will be a lot of fun too. And now that she is working like a slave for Walgreens and making that big dough she can afford to come. So this isn't about her just talking.  I bought Rikca a phone for her birthday. The last phone she has is also one I bought for her birthday a bunch of years ago, but of course she doesn't change the batteries so the shit doesn't work well. Anyway, this is a good phone and I won it on an E-bay Auction so she should like it.  She's moving to NY in December. It will be a big change for her but I think she is ready for something big.   Anyway I'm sleepy. So I'm turning in.   Tonite I pray:  with thankfulness in my heart as usual for all the awesome things you do in my life everyday. Thanks for turning a day that seemed so dreary into one that made me smile a lot towards the end.  Thank you for BB, Erica, A and Rikca who are all very special people in my life and keep your loving arms around them as you do for me. Thanks Big Man!

      My brain is absolutely officially dead. I can't concentrate. I keep trying to write this Article for the Kokusai Forum and I just can't get my brain to think about that. It wants to think about everything else! I want to read my book. ( I just bought a few new ones from Towers Books yesterday). I want to look up art on the internet. (I went to a wonderful exhibit of 7 Mexican Female Surrealist Artists and am highly intrigued in their lives now) I want to go to sleep. (I had a helluva great time this weekend but my daily aging you verile body is tired) I wanna call BB and chat (but phone bills are too fuckin' expensive on Japanese phones). All these things I wanna do but, what am I going to do? Sit at my computer. Keep checkin' my email every fuckin' three minutes and pray that these last 10 mins I have to be here fly by.   I have a private class tonight with this adult class I'm going to be teaching at Mie's but I'm really thinking about asking her if I could stop the class. I really don't have time for it. The money is wonderful and I will probably not quite for that reason. I like having the extra income but I still miss my evenings. Aiight I'm suckin' it up. I'm going and I'm going to talk about my new book in class tonight. Its called "Underground" and is about the Serin Gasing in Tokyo back in 1995 by the religious sect Aum.  I'm intrigued in this topic for a bunch of different reasons but one of the main reasons is this cult lived in the village I currently live in back when they were planning the attacks.  Just about anyone in Japan knows my village of only 1,600 people and its this book that will explain to me in more depth what the whole case is all about.   At this particular moment:  I send up shouts of joy b/c ist 4:30 and I'm getting out of here!

      The deal is done! I paid for the tickets and got my confirmation today. Korea is going to be GREAT!!! BB seems excited too. Its going to be an interesting thing for us to be traveling in a place where neither of us speak the native tongue and from what I heard Korea is not a very bilingual friendly country.  I'm going to keep looking for hotels and stuff and try to book something there soon.  I was just trying to talk with RR and I felt almost like I couldn't breathe because there is so much I want to say to him that we just don't have time to talk about. I really had to say bye because he was expecting a customer at 11 and I couldn't stand to keep talking about NOTHING while I was waiting to talk with him. I don't want to be interrupted when we speak by a customer another phone ringing NOTHING. I got some shit to say and when its said, I'll feel better.   Tonight I pray:  that the words of my heart and the mediation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight. I have a lot to say to RR and sometimes the thoughts clog my brain and speaking clearly is very difficult. Please, order my words so that they won't be hurtful but hopefully help us bother. Amen.

      Kyo wa ii ichinichi deshita! (Today was a good day!) School was cool (as usual). I went to my first Japanese funeral. (that's not the good part). My VP's mom passed away over the weekend and they were very happy to see me come pay my condelences to the family. The only problem was, they are buddist, and I'm not sure how their whole goodbye ceremony thing goes, so I kinda stood in line and watched as the people in front of me did it and then I tried to copy. It was a little nerve racking and I probably screwed it all up, but its over and done with and my VPs family was appreciative that I could come by. After that, I went back to school and finalized my plans for my Korea trip.   BB and I are going together. That should be interesting/fun. We had a good time this weekend. We had a little glitch in the Matrix  but it really brought things "back to life, back to reality" as soul 2 soul would say.  I really enjoy this guy but I have a lot of other things going on and its almost like having cake and eating it too. It feels so right that its gotta be wrong. Okay I'm done with the cliche's but we came to the agreement that the moment one of us feels like it has to end, then we'll end it and hopefully go on being friends. Its going to be hard when that time comes, but we both agree that it will come sooner or later.  I got an email from DK yesterday saying he was just thinking about me and hoping all was well. He'll be back in Japan the weekend of my birthday. I'll be happy to see him. I have a school festival the day he arrives but maybe one of the next few days during that week we'll be able to get together.  His ending of the email was "I miss you. A little bit anyway." So I replied to his email and said the same thing at the end. Men are so funny. I seem to always have men in my life who say exactly what they feel no matter what! The thing is, I give them that same shit they give me RIGHT BACK.  I don't think he was trying to give me shit, but I respond in kind (most times). Gosh has it really been only 2 months since we've seen each other last? It seems like so much longer! Oh well. It won't be long now.  I have this article to write for CLAIR that is due Sept 12, NEXT FRIDAY and have I BEGUN it . . .NO!!! I decided I wanted to write about JETs of African Descent or some issue related to JETs_AD but I need to get the ball rolling. My writing style is so awful that I'll need to check, check and re-check it many times before I send it to be translated. Then from there I'll send it in.  Wish me luck on this.  Oh, about the very good day..(gosh I do get off track sometimes) well this evening we had football practice. I really wish I could play more but honestly today was great! I learned a stronger way of kicking that hopefully will help along the way. Also running around playing a little, I could definitely see the improvement that my jogs in the park have been helping me make. My endurance is no where near where I want it to be, but I'm not coughing and wheezing after running around for 5 minutes. Its more like 15, which is great!!! The only problem is practice is going to be on Monday's and I have this new private class on Monday. . .darn it. My life consists of Privates, soccer and Japanese Proficiency test (not in that specific order) from now until December.  Ganbaro! (I will fight)  Erica lost her cell phone this weekend. She called me about 3 times around 5am Saturday but I was too sleep to go pick up the phone. When I finally got up and checked it, she told me that she'd given it to someone in the club when this Lil John and the Eastside Boys song came on "to the window....to the wall". I guess she called herself tearing the club up and not wanting to break her phone by dropping it but ending up losing it instead. I guess she'll get a new one soon, and she needs to because my bday celebration is Saturday night.   And I dont want "PAY PHONE" showing up on my phone all night when we are trying to get shit together.   Tonight I pray:  for a restful nights sleep. I'm thankful that I was able to see yet another productive day. I am thankful for the opportunity to go to Korea and being able to spend time with good people.  Lord, you're so good to me sometimes I just don't understand why. Thanks for another great blessed day. G-nite! Amen.

      Okay, so it hasn't been QUITE a month since my last blog. Just shy I'd say, but it has been a crazy crazy 4 or so weeks.  Tonight, I'm sitting here by my computer thinking about the brillance of God and how entertained he must be as he watches our lives. The decisions we make, the situations we face, he knows all of that stuff is going to happen before it does and then bam! We fall flat on our faces, we shine like the sun, we sit around and wait for things to happen. Its all amazing.  The weather here in Japan is so nuts. It was gorgeous this morning! Like 65 degrees when I walked out to the car at 8. I think it got up to at least 75 today. Just a nice nice day. I hope the weekend weather will be something like that. We have a National Holiday on Monday so a 3 day weekend is ahead of me. Mine is actually a 5 day weekend because my Midyear conference is tomorrow and Friday.

      Whenever I sit and think about the things that my family can't do for me that other families can do for them something comes along to remind me that those things don't even matter. . . I've been looking for a winter coat and some suitable casual shoes for the winter as well. I haven't been proper shoe shopping since last December when I went home and even then I didn't get much. Well I found some stuff and I wanted to send it to my parents house and have them send it here but that's just like sending it home so that it can sit there and wait for me to come get it.  I was just thinking about other people in my life who's parents would run out and do it immediately. Mine on the other hand, good folks, just can't depend on them for stuff like that. Well in the midst of all those kinds of thoughts my mom sends me 2 more birthday cards in addition to the 6 million she'd already sent just to let me know how special I am to her! :) Definitely lit up my face and made me put all those thoughts away. I have a great family and no they aren't like everyone else's but that's what makes them mine. For their abilities and their faults, they accept me through the deficiencies and triumphs. I love them.   Today I Pray:  and am thankful for blessing me with the family that I have and helping me to appreciate all of them for who they are individually and collectively. I love you for helping me to see the good in what may be looked at as not so good. Thank you Lord! Amen.

      Its New Years Eve!!!!  Yippe! Well, today was rather relaxing. BB and I woke up, did a little cleaning around the house, made some phone calls back home, talked with Erica and caught up on the Chicago drama, cooked us some lunch, watched a little soccer and took a nap. I just woke up and showered and now its time to get into my "get cute" ritual before we head out to Ginza for a night out on the town.  BB and I, along with about 6 other folks we know are headed up to Ginza, Tokyo for this New Year's Eve "dress up" party that should be a blast.  It costs like 4,500yen to get in but that's about the same price as I'd pay at home to party so...there it is.  I don't really like being big party co-ordinator on nights like this when I know its about to be  ON (in capital letters on purpose) but folks were looking for something to do and my boy told me about this, so...I think it will be alright. Its every man for themselves. Hopefully no one will have to babysit me and I won't be doing any babysitting. So that's that. I've been using that term a lot lately "that's that", I'll have to keep that on the watch because I'm not such a big fan of that phrase.  Last year this time I was home, actually at Lessie's house getting dressed up to go out with her and some of her friends. We went to this New Year's party at the Sheraton in Durham and all I was thinking about was leaving the club to go be with Ryan. A year later, I sit here at the foot of BB's bed as he sleeps and thoughts of being with Ryan are the farthest things from my mind. Funny how things change.  New Years Resolutions: I haven't really made many. Its also not a good idea to make too many because it will be almost impossible to keep them all. So I'll go with three all starting with the phrase "GET IT TOGETHER".  #1. GET IT TOGETHER financially.   In 2004, I will pay all of my loan payments on time if not early. I will also keep a budget of my spending (starting with my first paycheck in Jan), my estimated costs, and my actual amount spent.    #2 GET IT TOGETHER emotionally .  In 2004 I will not accept anyone else's personal baggage and continue working on cleaning out my own closet and making myself a emotionally stable, personally whole being. I will make goals for my future relationships, not necessarily strict inflexible ones, but ones that don't leave me hanging on a string and insecure. I will also seriously evaluate the situations I am currently in and commit to sweeping around my own front door.    #3 GET IT TOGETHER spiritually.  In 2004 I will read more and mediate more and truly work on making a stronger spiritual connection between myself and God. I will study more to find out what I really stand for and be more grounded in my beliefs.   Three fairly attainable, yet highly common goals I'm sure. I hope next year this time I'll be able to read this blog and confirm that I have achieved all if not most of these goals.   Today I pray:  Smiling and being thankful for being able to see the beginning of yet another calendar year. Being able to spend time with people I care about is important to me and I'm thanking you Lord for that as well. You have been better to me than I feel I deserve and I thank you for being great and powerful and for looking out for me. Amen.

      I'm here!!! So, I'm staying with BB for the next two weeks up in Chiba. I'll leave from his place and head off to Singapore and Malaysia after the New Year. We'll spend Christmas and New Year's together. I'm excited. I was worried at first because his sister is getting married in May and she wanted him to come home at the last minute to meet her fiance. He was considering it but really didn't want to go home in addition to the fact that we'd made all these plans including Japanese Language School and a Stevie Wonder Concert 2 days after Christmas. So...yeah. I'm here now.  Its going to be different. We've got a lot of straightening up to do in order for me to have space. His apt is much smaller than mine. I guess its like a typical Japanese spot though. One main room, that triples and quadruples for anything you need to do: bedroom, dressing room, tv room, study hall, closet. Its really an all in one. Then he has a long hallway sort of kitchen, a bathroom (which is really just a toilet with no windows) and a shower room. There is no sink other than the one in the shower room and the kitchen sink. So, after using the bathroom or when brushing your teeth you either have to get your feet wet and go into the shower or use the kitchen sink. Choose your poison. It may just be me, but I have a thing about using kitchen sinks for anything other than washing dishes and kitchen related things.  I shipped my bags from my house to his because I didn't want to worry about lugging them around, but now I have to worry about waiting for them to arrive. The delivery guy said "morning-ish" but its damn near 1pm and they still haven't arrived. Its actually a nice day out, not too cold and I want to get going with my day, but instead I'm stuck here waiting on these freakin' bags! Piss.  Okay, so since this is MY blog I guess I can just go ahead and put this out that there I think a girl I just met and Jody have been initimate. Either they have or one of them/both of them wanted to be. I'm not certain...but its just a feeling I have. I need to keep my eye on the situation.    Today I pray:  for wisdom. I feel very close to BB Lord and I don't know where our roads are leading too. I'm so connected to him at times. And others I feel kind of cautious and weary. I guess that's only normal, but Lord please guide my mouth, my words, and my actions. I also pray that all wicked energy that would cause us to fuss or fight be far far away from this apartment. In your name I pray. Amen.

      Tonight I went to my JTE's wedding. It was my first time going to a wedding here and Japan and boy was it memorable. First, the way they had theirs, I didn't go to the actual wedding ceremony. I went to the reception. But apparently the reception is bigger than the wedding.  Okay, so I arrive at this big wedding plaza, running late because there was so much traffic on the highway leading up to the place. Instead of it being a church, its just a huge wedding plaza. Very hard to describe. Anyway, i go up to the information desk and ask about for "Harada Chizuko's Wedding" at this point, its 4:54 and the wedding stuff begins at 5. I have to run in my heels and dress behind this bellboy who is running top speed into a totally different building. When I reach, I give the ladies at the door my envelope (you give money to the bride and groom here) sign my name on the register, recieve a seating chart and follow behind the bellboy who has once again taken off running as I hear him say "It starts at 5 right?" As I run through the door of the building of our final destination I see Ms.  Harada in her kimono. Breathtaking!!! She looks so beautiful, but I can't pause to stare as the staff is fussing with me to get me into my seat in the dining room before the bride and groom walk in.   So, shortly after I'm seatin and say my hello's to my co-workers and former Vice Principal, the wedding planner (or whoever she was) announced the entrance of the bride and groom. Lots of bowing from the staff, and the couple walks in dressed in what look like VERY expensive kimono.  Although it looks very difficult to walk, Harada is doing her best to walk w/all those heavy layers of kimono on and her hair all slicked up with dangly moving things in it. They both looked great though.   There were toasts and stuff like a usual western wedding but then as the meal is being served, the couple goes out again and comes in a few moments later changed into western style clothing. Him in a grey shiny, silky looking suit and her in a really nice white weddingd dress. During this change of clothes, they go around to all of the tables and take pictures with the people at the table. That was kinda nice because people got to take good up close pictures of the couple.  There was a bit of a break between the last change of clothes and this is where my Vice Prinicipal and Principal have had enough to drink so that they can become "themselves" again. I just witness this event a few nights ago at our End of the year Teachers party, and could sense the signs. They were so funny. Coming around pouring me wine and in turn I would go to their tables and pour them beer and wine. Then a random table full of men called me over to their table because they wanted to take a picture with me. The guy sitting next to me was the groom's cousin and he was flirting in his own little was most of the evening. Funny stuff. But I think the best was that the teachers at the table, Principal and VP told me that when I get married to please invite them. They really want to come. And that if I have my wedding in America, we should have the 'second party' in Japan! Hilarious group of folks.  So, then the couple come back in...well, first the groom. This time he has a Santa hat on and strapped to his bag a keg! He's going around pouring beer and such for about 20 minutes and then the bride comes back in wearing this weird Minnie Mouse looking thing. It was strange, but...not my wedding right? It wasn't an ugly dress, just looked liked something...hmmm...well just not something for a wedding is all.  At the end we got a take home copy of the photo taken with the bride and groom at our table, which was nice and a bag full of goodies. Two bottles of wine (small ones) red and white with "Just Married: Yuichi and Chizuko" on them. Then I got two bowls, not mixing bowls but glass like that. Nice ones though. Also some cakes and flowers from the table and a real wreath that was the center piece. The table stuff and flowers they told us to take. I didn't just lift the mess!   I love weddings. They are fun. Everyone seems so happy. The weird thing about all of this is...now I'm going to have to call her ". Sakai" and all I've ever know her as is Ms. Harada. I mean, with my friends who are married, I call them by their first names and always have, but I've always called her Harada. That is going to be very strange. Oh well, I'll get used to it.   Today I pray:  that you will bless the union of Chizuko and Yuichi. They have the possibility to bring forth great children and much happiness. Keep them in your care I pray Lord. Amen

      Lately it seems like every time I blog here I its been ages since my last one and I have to explain why its been so long blah blah blah. Well I'm not going into all that. I move on from here.   So, I just joined this group called  urlLink Friendster  and its a beta version so everything is still slow ass hell and I can't get it to work. The girl who invited me swears by it and says it speeds here day along. But I can't get mine to work so I'm about to give up on it. Boo Hooo!!!  On to much better news: I'm going to Singapore and Malaysia. I can't hardly believe it myself but I am. I'll be sunning, travling, and beaching from Jan6- Jan13. You talking about a happy girl...I'm her! I'm going down by myself and traveling up to Kuala Lumpur by train (i think) and meeting up with another girl from here who will start her South East Asian adventure on Christmas Eve. I only wish I had the money to buy a video camera before the trip. But, when you make 4 international trips in a year's time...money tends to run short. Even when you're finding stuff on good deals like I have.  Gosh...its really been 4 trips. New Zealand in March, Korea in September, I just went home for Thanksgiving and Singapore/Malaysia in a few weeks. Talk about blessed. I can't even describe it as anything else than pure blessings.  It seems like even when I don't have money, I end up finding it from somewhere to pay a bill or plan a trip ;).   Today I pray:  with thankfulness in my heart for being blessed with the opportunity to just be in this country and build myself up. I've been having such a rewarding experience. So Lord, THANKS!

      wow. this is probably the longest moodswing/i hate people phase i've been through in a long time. i'll be spending a lot of time by myself this week, all of next week and the week after. i want to go skiing the first weekend in february but my finances may not allow. at the same time i just am not feeling being around people.   school was okay. i had kindy kids. they are always lovely. but they just made me think about my niece and my sister who i miss. my godbaby who will be 1 year old March 18th and I still haven't planned what I'll do for her yet.   i just feel this planning thing. i have to plan what i'm doing this weekend and all the weekends until school is out. i want to plan bb's bday shindig. i want to plan what i'm going to do after i have to leave JET (since i have decided to stay another year). i need a plan for every fuckin' thing and that's getting on my nerves.   i need a new friend. i said it tonight to BB as a joke, but i think i do. he's always tired and i'll wanna talk and i can hear in his voice that he is ready to go or that there's something else he wants to do. which is fine because he works hard and deserves his evening time, but i guess that's how it is once you get comfortable with someone. they don't have to try so hard to be interested. not that he is disinterested, but not so much as he was. i need something new.

      my friend said yesterday that she thinks the song by Vivian Green "Emotional Roller Coaster" was written for her. I think it was though. for her and every other woman/man that is able to feel. sometimes we think its a bad thing to be unstable emotionally, but i don't think it is. i think what's bad is not being able to control it once you feel like it starts to get out of hand. i don't have to be happy all the time. i don't HAVE to have it together all the time. i don't HAVE to smile all the time. i don't HAVE to be a people person all the time. i just know that when i'm having the "I can't stand people" minutes, hours, days that i need to be by myself and not subject others to my moods.  why was in the post office today and some strange guy who i don't know comes up to me and asks me how much money i make? here's a reinactment of our convo best i can remember:  Asshole:  You've got a big salary don't you?  (it was a dude who lives in my village but you don't go around asking folks about their salary! even folks you know and I didn't know this dude from a can of paint)   ME: I get paid. I'm not sure if its what you'd call a lot or not but i get paid.  Asshole:  Yeah, i know you do get paid. What? Like 300,000yen a month?"   ME:  How much do you get paid? Do you talk about your salary with strangers?  Asshole:  No..not really  ME:  Then WHY are you asking me about mine? I get paid. I'm not telling you anything else. Goodbye. ASS: stands there looking like the freak he is with his mouth open as I walk out

      where are interesting folks when you want someone to chat to? why am i sitting here thinking "why don't i ever know exactly what i want but i know exactly what i don't want"? why aren't there any English programs on TV tonight until 10:10pm? why must i be forced to watch movies i've seen a million times already because there's shit on tv? why are people "renting" their children to smuggle crack internationally? why did i get an email from RR today and almost cry when i know i don't want him in my life anymore and am glad that i've moved on? why do i call someone i don't really want to hear from just for the confirmation that i really don't want to hear from them?  "you're weird" says BB on IM. and he's right. I am weird. Sometimes I puzzle myself.  Had another "selfish/weird" E moment. I was reading emails from an old friend of mine. Back during the time while we were "courting" so to speak and I really wanted to hear his voice. So, I called him at home. Missed him. Left a message.  Then I called him at work. No friend. Left yet another message. Only this time I said some crappy Love Jones bull like "I'll call you again another time, and I'm going to keep calling until the next is the right time." Well then I went to bed and woke up to and email from him. Lots of unimportant filler then the "I'm going out of town this weekend with (drumroll....) my girlfriend." And then the sealant "I just smiled because my first thought was, 'Damn, Eboni sounds like a grown-ass woman' ".  At the end of it all, we do end up chatting on IM for a minute when he tells me that this girlfriend of his is "THE ONE". He's my boy. I don't like him like that. I should be hella happy for his old ass finally finding someone who was ready when he was....but that's not how I feel. I'm not HATING but I can't put my finger on this emotion. Then it hits me. I don't want him, but I want him to want me. I don't intend to pursue him because he doesn't want me but I think I feel a little empty in some way because he doesn't want me. Is that wrong? Is that selfish? HELL YES. But let me feel like Tony Rich cause nobody knows it but me. I'm not dying inside, don't get me wrong. But there is a little strange feeling there.

      Okay, since my last message things have gotten much much better. My travel partner met up with me a few days later and now we're back in Singapore. Malaysia is a very very Muslim country and Kuala Lumpur the capital city has the largest population by far of practicing Muslims so getting their groove on isn't the highest on their priority list. So, what you have is a big ass city with lots of potential for fun and trouble but sad to say...its a bust.  During the day you've got plenty of shit to do. Walking around viewing mosques, museums, cultural shows etc, but when its time to go out...it leaves much to be desired. The alcohol is very expensive and when you go to the clubs they have this weird thing where you get 30 mins of DJ 30 mins of a live band ALL NITE. who the hell wants to hear Malaysian Hootie and the Blowfish/Santan Wannabees all night long? NOT THE KID!  So...I'm anxiously awaiting returning to Tokyo and being with my peeps. I'll enjoy the day life here and hang around the Inn Crowd (my backpacker which is PHAT by the way..www.the-inncrowd.com) and drink with the other packers at bars in the area.  Hittin' the manmade beach this morning and a few rounds of mini golf (which is about all the golf i can manage) and maybe seafood for dinner.   E

      i had quite a rough experience last night. when i got to the airport in singapore it was about 1am. i did got my bags and went out of the customs area like a dummy instead of staying in the travelers area where the couches were. see the plan was to find a comfy place to crash until the AM when I'd venture into town and find a train up to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. So, I couldn't find anything comfy anywhere and read as long as my eyes would stand it then tried to lay down on this hard 4 seat row. slept for a whole 30mins then decided i'd need a plan B! so i hung around up there til 4ish and read more in my lonely planet guide book that the first train up to KL is at 642 so i took a cab to the train station at that time. come to find out the schedule from the book was way way way old and the station doesn't even OPEN until 7am. plus between the hours of midnight and 6am the cabbies charge 50% MORE than usual. so here i am at the closed train station at 4:30am (by my watch) which is really 3:30am here. so i go in an open outside coffee shop (it was sooo humid this morning) get a snack and and sleep til 6:45. at this time I still don't know the first train isnt til 915am. i need a shower. i'm hot and havent slept well, they open up and break the bad news to me. so i ask them to watch my backpack and i take a walk out in the city to find breakfast and calm my nerves. that was nice. great looking city too. i'm looking forward to finishing my trip up there, even though yeah i know, i'm just getting started. i got back in time for the train took my seat and headed up to KL. Didn't arrive in the station until 3:30 and am just settling into my room here at Pondok now at 5pm.  I'm going to repack my things, shower and go get some grub and maybe find some mischief! I deserve it!!! I also just got an email from my traveling companion Takeyah and she is stuck up in Bankok and wont be down here til tomorrow night so i have the rest of the night and all day tomorrow to piddle around alone and find fun. YEAH!!!  Traveling alone is different, but cool. I'm sure the adventure is just beginning.

      i found out tonight from one of my most reliable line sisters that the reason i was tripping all last week is probably because of the birth control i'm taking. its three levels of hormone and it is know for causing high numbers of depression in women who can't take or arent used to the hormone. isn't that wild? why didn't anyone tell me that before i started taking this shit. try to protect yourself from having kids and go dammit crazy in the process!  well i'm back to the good ol' E. not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing but its better than that nutcase i thought i was last week. she isn't sure but my body might get used to the hormonal changes. i sure hope so. i'm tired and haven't finished my plans for tomorrow's lesson, BUT...do i ever? off to turn on the heaters in my bedroom, shower and get ready for bed.  BB is taping the superbowl for me even though i watched it (kinda) on ESPNgamecast and listened on FieldPass by RealPlayer. It was so good to listen to I can even imagine how nice it will be to watch! Even though my boys didn't win, I still want to see the game.

      Yatta! Yamanashi is moving on up. My soccer team placed 2nd out of 9 women's teams in the  urlLink Tochigi Football Tournament  this weekend. We did really well. I'm so proud of us. The last time we placed 3rd. This time 2nd we are certainly trying for the championship again!  We played a total of 5 games including the championship game. Scored 15 goals and only allowed 2. The same team that beat is in the earlier rounds, we met again at the finals and lost 0-1 just as in the first game. It was very well played and although we didn't win the big trophy we did well.  So now everyone is siked about the June tournament. Plans to train hard and all, but we'll see how much of that actually comes to fruition. I know I always say how hard I plan to train my body but never really do and get sad when I get to the tournament and can't run around! LOL. All in all I'm pleased with the weekend. I always look forward to hanging out with Yamanashi JETs. They are such a blast. And we have really great Japanese friends that play with us who keep the party jumpin!

      You ever feel like you got something to say to someone who isn't ready to hear it. . .well I do. And moreover, I'm not sure if i'm ready for them to hear it either. But you listen to everything Diary-san so here goes:  I've been alone with you inside my mind And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times I sometimes see you pass outside my door Hello, is it me you're looking for?  I can see it in your eyes I can see it in your smile You're all I've ever wanted, (and) my arms are open wide 'Cause you know just what to say And you know just what to do And I want to tell you so much, I love you ...  I long to see the sunlight in your hair And tell you time and time again how much I care Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow Hello, I've just got to let you know  'Cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying, I love you ...  Hello, is it me you're looking for? 'Cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying ... I love you   I know, not my words at all. They are those of the great Lionel Richie. I'm there with him though...I'm right there.   Today I pray:  for the safety and health of the ones I love.

      A friend of mine asked me today to define freedom. I'll give my answer but a few others before that:  "Freedom is the distance between church and state." ~  "Freedom is the ability to make choices about the direction you want your life to go in and the ability to affect changes on your life." ~AxInNitsky  "Freedom is 2000 lbs of explosives. Only if its our bomb though, otherwise its terror." ~ US Gov't  "Freedom can be defined as that state of being which is characterized by a knowledge of absolute truth and a responsible adherence to and application of that truth. " ~Mary Ann Diorio, Ph. D.

      I'm at school today. School doesn't actually start back until the 6th but I have some "preparations" to do for the new school year. Well...I SAY I have some prep to do but all I've been doing is chilling and chatting. Catching up with old friends, returning emails, and doing a little work in between.   I had a great conversation with my linesister V about christianity today and her beliefs. She feels like she's getting stronger and has more faith and is really excited about her new revelations and I'm happy for her. I on the other hand feel like I'm questioning my reasons for calling myself a christian. I feel I'm ready to do that. I enjoyed talking to her because she didn't make me feel like I was wrong or unfaithful for having questions. Some christians try to  make you feel bad like God is going to spit or you or something for wondering "why"? I can't remember what I asked her but I was like "That just doesn't make sense to me" and she came back with the most christian response "Lean not unto your own understanding" .   Today I pray:  with thanksgiving in my heart for having good friends. People who won't leave me when I'm confused or shun me when they don't agree with my thoughts. People who love me unconditionally and always will. I've been blessed with great people and great friends and for that I'm thankful! Amen.

      okay, can you really be hungry when you buy dinner and leave it in the car? only to realize 1/2 way thru the 8 o'clock movie that you are extremely hungry and can't figure out why?  i'm BAKA!  ----- its been way too long since i've journaled. its strange but i feel like when i have time to journal i'm doing the most to be my best. its like i'm my best listener. i'm cool! i'm ready to be different. i'm ready to get rid of a lot of the anger in my spirit. i'm ready to feel happier (not that i'm sad, but there is always room for more) and whole. so, get ready to be my ear again!   Today I pray:  to learn how to be committed to something. I have lots of temporary spirts of wanted to dedicate myself to different purposes, but what I'm lacking is the necessary drive to commit to bettering  EBONI  everyday. So my prayer is for dedication to be committed to ME!  (smile!)

      I don't know if its just my body finally slowing down from a helluva a month but I'm sooo tired! Yesterday I fell asleep twice at school. Once at my desk and once while my student was giving a presentation. I don't know if anyone saw me, but I was embarrased. Then today after lunch, you could have called it a day because my brain would not work at all. I'm not going to soccer this week so that I can rest a little more in this week (plus Erin Brockavich is coming on BS2). I hope I get back to my normal energy level soon. I have a week of Elementary school lessons next week and those kids need my full energy.  As if the lack of energy thing isn't enough, I think my acute bronchitis has come back. In February I had what I thought was just a bad cough, and turned out to be bronchitis. They put me on loads of meds and an inhaler and it went away. In the last 2 weeks, the cough has come back and I thought it was just due to me not resting but the school nurse seems to think its the damn bronchitis again. I'm heading to the doctor first thing tomorrow morning (finally) to see what's going on.  Well  urlLink The Monk  is on, and I can't stand to miss an episode so I must give Adriene my full attention. Til the next time.  Ja ne...

      Summertime in Japan! I swear there is nothing like it. Okay, yes there is. Summer time in Chapel Hill. Okay nah, its a little different, well its a lot different. Damn what am I saying here?  I've been having a very good time recently. Hanging out with my people who are about to leave Japan, kickin' it in Tokyo on the regular, going to meetings, and finishing up projects at work. Its been a good but busy month, June has. And on top of that my friend G found this link to a online newspaper called the  urlLink Asahi Newspaper  here in Japan, that interviewed me a while back. The article is all in Japanese so my people from home can't read what it says but its basically just an interview about my life. How I ended up in Japan, what I do at school, what kind of things I'm interested in and what I want to do in the future. I would be cool to post that stuff here, but nah...I'll let the pages of my life unfold through my blog.  I always say I want to get better at blogging more regularly but I really mean it now. Even if they are really short, there is always something for me to say every day. I promise to make the time to share more about my life and continue writing the story of my years in Japan.  How it ended up at years, when I thought I'd be around for one...I have no idea. Micky D's time. The have this new burger called the McGrand that is very expensive for the burger itself and ridiculous for the set, but its very tasty. Tanoshimi!  Ja...

      How appropriate! Since my last post about victorious soccer tournament in Tochigi, it is now time to prepare for another winning post about Nagano! We've got a tournament this weekend and we are really siked about it! We've got 3 teams going this time, one that is a strong team and 2 mixed ability teams. Some girls from Niigata didnt have enough folks to play so we are splitting our girls down farther so they can join in. We only play 6 a side so you dont really need 11 girls anyway.  Other than that I've been pretty busy with JET stuff. There is a Re-Contracting conference next week where I am in charge of presenting a workshop on "Using Music in the classroom at Junior High". The handout in itself is keeping me quite busy, but its all my fault for waiting to the last minute. June is just getting started but it will be a long month. Let me get to it. Ja...

       My Granma  is the coolest.    I don't know anyone who has a Granma that uses Instant Messenger, except me. She forgot which messenger we used to use and had been sending me allthese messages in Yahoo! but before we used to chat on AOL. Sheemailed me asking why I never sign on anymore and was telling me how she signs on everyday to catch me but I'm never tehre. It was funny to me but when you have a 72 year old Grandm who even attempts to  #1. Deal with computers period and #2 Chat on IM... you just gotta be proud.  Speaking of people to be proud of, my best friend is such a strong and beautiful woman. She has had so many tribulations lately though. She can't get a job she wants, her daughter is living with her mom while shes on the grind trying to work it out for the them, the men in her life are shit and she has the worst luck. She just found out yesterday that she didn't get a job she was really banking on and it crushed her. I just pray that she has some sunshine in her life. I'm glad she has her daughter in her life but I hope that she gets some more joy in her life. Its tough when bad stuff happens to good folks. It's hard for me to find stuff to say to her to encourage here because I really dont know any of her struggles (except the financial ones, but mine are for other reasons). I'm proud of her though because she has grown up a lot. She is a good mother and person and I hope some good things happen to her soon. God knows she needs it.  Well, I'm headed up to Tokyo to meet the second group of new ALTs today. It should be a fun time. I'm going to meet up with Schwartz one last time before he heads back to the states sometime this weekend too. I really enjoyed having him here this summer. Its hard when your friends leave but, I have a  feeling he and I will stay in touch for a few more years to come even if oceans separate us.  Jah.

      I've been a very Lazy Lucy lately. (do I get points for using three L's in a row) I've had plenty of time and been relaxing the last few days. I guess I'm just happy to not&nbsp;have a full schedule. But alas, all good&nbsp;things must come to an end. From tomorrow I head back in to Tokyo for the Group B Orientation for new JETs. I'm an assistant this time instead of just going to help&nbsp; out with JETs Ad stuff.  I talked to my sister yesterday and the surprise party for mom is off. I wanted to throw her a big 50 party and surprise her by flying home, but Caroll told me that mom doesn't want a party. She said all she wants for her birthday is to have all her family home. If I go home in October (right after my expensive Europe trip that has me eating Ritz and noodles right now) I'd only be able to stay home for like 4 days. So, it has been decided that I head home for Christmas instead. So home for the holidays, I'll be.

       #1 Fan   David Beckham is my boo! THAT is a good looking dude. I'm sitting here watching the REAL Madrid V. JEF United Exhibition game and he is just a specimen. I'll have to echo my soror's comment about men who play soccer, they are just plain fit. I swear, out professional athletes soccer players are some of my favorites. I can't wait to go to Spain.  &nbsp; Jah.

       Jumpers    &nbsp; Yesterday as my train home from Tokyo was pulling into Hachioji Station, we hit a suicidal jumper. I was in the first car pulling in so it was MY car that hit her. This was a 5 o'clock limited express train that travels one of the busiest routes in Tokyo. From what I was told it happens a lot too. I was sleep when we first pulled in but I heard the chimes saying we were arriving at the station and that woke me up. A second later the train stopped short and they announced that they'd hit a person who jumped onto the tracks. On the platform, train&nbsp;workers were putting on special plastic uniform things and then ran out onto the track. It was then that I looked out the window and toward the front of the train that I saw the young woman (whose body/clothes&nbsp;looked to be no older than that of a 30 year old) laying face down. All of the&nbsp;people on the platform opposite us had an even clearer&nbsp;view of the atrocity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'd heard about folks committing suicide on the trains lines before and have even been on some trains&nbsp;that have been stopped because of the jumpers but never have&nbsp;I seen one fall or the reaction of the people around the scene.&nbsp;What appaulled me more than the fact that she jumped was the people laughing and pushing to try to get a glimpse of her. The train workers were trying to get people to pull down the shades on their windows but they wouldn't do it. Then worse of all I saw a teenage girl taking a photo of the&nbsp;body on her cell phone. Un-fucking-believable.

      Root Canal. That is the word for the day. I had some infection under a filling in my molar and now I've begun the process of getting a root canal done on that tooth. Of course Japanese pain meds are SHIT and don't stop any pain at all. I guess my dentist remembered I said that from the last time I went in to see her and asked me if I still had any of my "special medicine"  (which was really only ibuprofen).  I told her not to worry about it. I got the "stuff" at the crib.  &nbsp;

       Oh what a night!     &nbsp;  Last night, we had our end of the semester party at my school. It wasn't actually at the school though. We went bowling and then to dinner at a really nice sushi restaurant. I wasn't driving so of course I got pretty drunk. Actually this is the drunkest I've been at an enkai (drinking party) ever. The lucky thing is, where the Japanese folks turn all red when they get wasted, I stay my same beautiful brown  (thanks to the sun this weekend)  color. The only give away is I run my mouth a mile a minute. I started off with a half and half (1/2 pale ale 1/2 dark), then had a red wine (which i wasn't feeling)&nbsp; and went back to the beer. The principal sat across from me and he and I talked a lot drinking all the way.   I woke up this morning from my drunken stupor and realized I'd&nbsp;sent a bunch of emails on my cell phone I didn't remember sending.&nbsp; Then I saw my call log and felt awful because I was pretty sure from the tone of my emails the calling was just as unpleasant. To my surprise,  (after I sent the "I'm sorry for being stupid when I'm drinking" mail)  BB said I wasn't mean at all. He said the conversation was "quite pleasant".&nbsp; So that's good. Very suprising, but good.&nbsp; Someone should really confiscate my cell at drinking parties so things like last night don't happen. I still haven't heard back from E yet today.&nbsp; I sent her the same I'm sorry email this morning.&nbsp;   Somehow I managed to crack a filling in one of my molars last night. Its killing me today, I'm&nbsp;hungry&nbsp;and my appointment isn't until 3. I'm going for lunch w/Charlotte (Is eating all she and I do?)&nbsp; in a few so I have to go get ready.&nbsp; I guess I'll have soup or something.  Jah.   *if jah is standing by my side, then why should i be 'fraid..."*

       The Questions    One of my students just passed slam out in the middle of giving his speech! We had our closing ceremony a minute ago and Shota (my student) was at the end of his speech and all of a sudden, collapsed, he fell backwards  (the student who was behind him moved out of the way)  and hit his head on the blackboard!&nbsp; We usually have our ceremonies in the gym but because of the heat, we did it in the music room since its the next biggest room. Half the kids were staring in shock, one little girl got so scared she ran to the back of the room covering up her face. The teachers all rushed to him (creating more heat around him) then finally someone ran to get the stretcher and took him to the nurse's room. His homeroom teachers went out with him and as soon as he left the room they continued with the rest of the ceremony like nothing happened.    Question#1:&nbsp;  Why is it that in a school of 55 (small as it may be) there is only 1 fan in the school and that is in the teachers room?    Question#2:  Why in temperatures reaching the 90's the past few days haven't the students been able to use their personal fans since there are not any at the school?    Question #3:  Why in the year 2004 when temperatures reach close to 100 every year, are there no Air Conditioners at school?    Question#4: &nbsp;When you have a Japanese English&nbsp;teacher, is a&nbsp;foreign English teacher more important than making sure students temperatures dont reach levels where they are passing out at 9am? Couldn't the salary they pay me foot the bill for some fans at least?

      I'm pretty tired as I'm just getting in from a nice, but tiring two days but I had to journal quickly about&nbsp; a friend I had to say goodbye to last night. This guy is more than amazing. Just one of the most down folks I've ever met. From the night we met... me amazingly drunk and none of my friends around, he kinda drunk, but sober enough to look after me until BB showed up to take me home...we connected. Now, 10 months later I feel like I've known him longer than that. He's been a good friend and one of the few people who party as hard as I do!!! He's off to NY to hit up grad school and I'm sure we will meet again in this life.  &nbsp;   Goodbye Richie . Have a safe journey. Safira Salama. Sayonara.  &nbsp;  Jya ne.  &nbsp;   (Speaking of Jah, I'm reading this book called "Born Fi' Dead" about Jamaican Posse/Gang Violence. Pick it up. Deep shit going down.)

      I'm sitting here trying to type on a Japanese system computer and its driving me nuts. I can not find the apostrophe so no conjunctions or possessives which just makes typing a little more difficult because I have to think of other words. piss.  &nbsp;  Anyway, yesterday I bought two travel books at Tower Records in Shibuya. They have a really great book store on the 7th floor that I frequent. It is probably the most thorough of all the English sections I have found in Tokyo. I got a Frommers Barcelona, Madrid and Seville and a Lonely Planet London.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Spain book has really got me excited. Although I read about a horrible incident of racial profiling 2 years ago against this African American musician who was there playing with a symphony. He  fit the description  of a car theif the police were looking for. 4 cops jumped him, whooped his ass, and basically said Sorry the next day. The thing is, and Frommers also included this, that this type of thing is happening all over the world now. Lots of people are moving around trying to find peace, while others are afraid the newcomers are there to create havoc or bring terror. Its a sad state we are living in right now.  &nbsp;  I did not think I was going to like&nbsp;the Frommers book before because I had never tried them but they are actually quite good.&nbsp; They have very helpful check lists and interesting stories from other travellers. (I found the apostrophe)&nbsp; The only thing I found that seems to be lacking is advice for travellers on a budget (are there two l's in a travellers?)  &nbsp;  Alright. Time to get dressed for the day, grab some grub and head w/the crew a la playa. (that's today's attempt at Spanish) I'm listening to Launch on Yahoo and Juvenille's "Slow Motion" is on. Good Song.  &nbsp;  OH, I almost forgot! I went to the Joe concert last night. AWESOME!!! Joe isn't the most charasmatic artist or anything but he sure can sing. I MEAN. Just a beautiful voice. Not to say that he is street trash either. Maybe charasmatic isn't the right word. He just feels like a homeboy ya know? Not really STAR acting, which I like. We met him before the concert and he knows Romy pretty well and I think he met E before, but it was my first time.&nbsp;I had my booty jeans on too. My rear view mirror jeans, that make objects appear larger than they really are. It was cool though. Joe sings lots of lovey stuff though, so of course I shed a tear for lost love. Its still new. But great concert overall.  &nbsp;

      I woke up this morning with BB on my mind. In-freakin-escapable! It makes me angry to even wake up with him on my mind because he just doesn't deserve to be there. Maybe something in my subconcious needs to be settled with him because everynight for the last week I have waken to some memory of a dream and he's been in it. I'll see him this weekend at the beach and if I can't deal I'll just leave, but I hope it doesn't get that bad. I haven't talked to him in almost two weeks and have absolutely no desire to. Maybe its just knowing that I'll see him this weekend that is bothering me. If I'm feeling weird&nbsp;Sunday I just won't even go.  &nbsp;  It's vacation time again!!!&nbsp;As a 25th birthday present to myself, I've booked my tickets to... (drumroll please)  England and Spain! &nbsp;I'll be in Europe for 12 days in September visiting my college buddy and some friends from JET. I was supposed to be meeting up with an old friend in Spain, but it looks like that's not going to work out. No worries there though because I am up for making new friends. I'm still trying to plan where I'd like to go and hopefully will pick up some travel books when I head into Tokyo today. I'd like to do something significant for the 25 years of my life. Meet 25 new friends? Collect 25 stones? Buy 25 stickers (I'm a huge sticker freak)? I don't know but whatever it is will be cool.  &nbsp;   RANDOME:  Why did I find Boone's Farms in Don Quixote (like a Japanese Wal*Mart)? And it was only like $400. Cheap shit where ever you are in the world. I'm sitting here talking junk, but you know I picked up a Strawberry Daquiri for the crib right? I would have bought another bottle but I'm not expecting company anytime soon, and I don't want all that sweet liquor in the house.  &nbsp;  I went to dinner with Charlotte last night. On the way to the restaurant we stopped by MY store, this place called Bicky that sells lots of cute little stuff that actually fits me well.&nbsp; At a little shop next to Bicky was a T-shirt&nbsp;I wanted to buy sooooo badly. But it was really just way too small. The photo is above.

      Just got back in from a nice little dinner at urlLink  The Solar Cafe  . Just in time to turn on the 8pm movie  Message In A Bottle . It just started but it looks to be a sappy girlie movie. Which is cool sometimes but I'm not in a mood to really enjoy a sappy movie. Not in a bad mood, just not in a sappy mood.   I've been eating a lot lately. I don't know why in the world I've been so hungry lately but I have. It's a good thing I dont keep much food here (other than ice cream) or there would be great potential to become a fatass.   It's only Thursday night but I kinda feel like its the weekend already. I guess its because I don't have any more lessons to plan. I have two more days of classes and I'm home free! Well for 30 days at least. That's all we get up here in Kamiku for the summer vacation but I'll take it with no complaints. We have a long weekend this because Monday is a holiday. What holiday? I'm not quite sure, but what I do know is we don't have school. Yatta!  I've got a action packed weekend planned. Well, maybe not so action packed but it should be a lot of fun. On Saturday, I'm going to the Joe concert in Ebisu with E and Romy. I saw Joe the last time he was here with E. She met his manager in some randome fashion and ended up getting us tickets and backstage passes. E, Romy and I are going to do a girl's day and then the concert. I'm not staying out all night after the show because I'm headed to a beach in Chiba on Sunday with some folks so I want to be rested. I'm going to stay at a friend's house and get up early to meet for the beach. Then Sunday night for the grand finale to my weekend, I'm staying at my namesake's place in Tokyo. Rest up a little after the beach and go to a Salsa Event at  urlLink Velfarre . A friend/soror is dancing. She's a wonderful dancer and I'm so looking forward to seeing her perform. There is a dancing clinic at 7:30 and the show starts at 10.  She also got me on the guest list for the night for what would have cost me 3,000 so that's nice too.  I guess I'll burn a little chandan, enjoy the fresh breeze blowing in from my balcony which sitting in my recliner and watch the rest of this movie. Its so nice to have a full belly and a night ahead of you with nothing particular to do. Iiiii na.  Jah.

       Let me describe for you my day at the gynecologist in Japan. This post is not for the squeamish.  Today I finally got up the nerve to go get my bi-annual female examination. Not that I was worried that anything was wrong medically, I'd just heard so many horror stories about the Japanese Gynecologist. And today proved they were all true.  Usually when I go in for my examination I get all the tests done: Pap Smear, STD (general), HIV, and pregnancy. Today, I asked for the same tests. I don't know these terms in Japanese so I couldn't explain it to the nurse. She had to call the doctor to help me fill out my forms. I get called back to speak with the doctor who is about a million and half years old.    No, I mean literally a million. This guy was so old (How old was he?) He was so old...I think he helped deliver Jesus. Dr. Park's is what he calls himself. He lived in America over 30 years ago he said, but isn't as good as English as he was back then (yeah think?!).     So, I start telling him the tests I want: first I say Pap Smear. He writes it down and says okay. Next I say HIV. He looks up and me and cringes simultaneously. Then asks "Do you have any symptoms?" I say "No, but I like to get test regularly." He looks at me with a "Yeah, right" expression and writes it down. Then I said I wanted the general STD culture done. He cringes again, taking a little longer to look up at me and starts asking me if I have all these different types of discharge and spots and shit and I'm like "No, these are just test to make sure I don't have anything and am asymptomatic!" Another "yeah right" expression and he rights it down.  He orders the nurses around and then tells me to go into this room and take my bottom clothes off. I go into this room where there is stirrups chair but when there is a curtain in front of the seat so that when I sit down I can't see him, the nurses, nothing. And they have me hiked up so damn high in the chair I felt the blood rushing to my head. I asked them to open the curtain but he goes into this long story about customs in Japan that I was SOOO not interested in. Bottom line: He didn't open it.   This dude didn't use any lubrication, just shoved his damn instruments and hands whereever, didn't tell me what he was doing or when he was going to do something different, just kept digging and shit. NOT FUN! Then all of a sudden, he goes "Are you married?"   At this point I get scared. Dude has been poking and mess for like 10 minutes and busts out with "Are you married?" What would YOU be thinking? I tell him I'm not and he rips back the curtain to show me an ultrasound screen. He explains that I'm not pregnant and I have a healthy uterus then gives me a photo taken from the ultrasound screen.   Now, I've heard of urine tests for pregnancy, but this was my first ultrasound. Kinda strange I thought at first, but what a way to know for sure. Even less of a chance for error than the urine test so that's comforting.   He finishes up and tells me to get dressed. They take my blood pressure and then the blood sample   with that terribly long hateful syringe   and I'm done.  I'll go back on Friday to get results from the first set of tests and the HIV next week. I never hated the gynecologist before but I do now. Hopefully I'll be in the US the next time I need an exam. Men just don't even realize how uncomfortable and unnerving it is to have a random man "down there". My doctors have always made it a point to make me feel comfortable, but that's not the "Japanese Way" I assume. I'd always choose making sure I'm healthy over my comfort level, but it still sucks to feel the way I did today. Now I see why Japanese women wait until they are about 25 to get their first gyneological exam.    NOT an exaggeration!!!    Ja ne...

      As you can see from the photos, the Sayonara Party costume turned out great! Aside from the blue wig, which I hoped would have been blond or brown it all pulled together quite nicely. I mean, blue wasn't bad because it gave me a whole look I wasn't necessarily going for but it wasn't QUITE the  urlLink Ganguro Look  I was going for.   The party was fun. The costumes weren't as original as I'd hoped they'd be. There were a lot of women with yukata on and men with Jimbe or male kimono on, a shit load of construction workers, a vending machine (very cute/original), a japanese flag, a school girl, a highway (complete with cars, cones, and REAL road signs), a samurai or two, and a onsen bathing man (quite naked, very cute butt!). It was held at this restaurant called  urlLink Solar Cafe . Its an organic restaurant with a garden right there in front of the building and even has a vegan menu. It was my first time going there but would love to go back on a non-event night to have dinner. The pizza was awesome and they sell Dr. Bonners SOAP! And all kinds of other herbs (SMILE!). Who knew? Herbal Greatness Right in my own back yard..."Ahhh shiawase"  Ja ne.

      Friday night Black Rose Productions (Erica and Mo) had a party at  urlLink The Nature  in Roppongi. The girls usually do the parties on the first Friday of every month but this weekend they did it on the second Friday so it could be in conjunction with Erica's Birthday. At first E wasn't feeling the party as being her actual bday celebration but I'd decided this was going to have to be it because I had Sayonara party to go to Saturday and couldn't kick it all weekend. So...I went a little bit behind the scenes and called in some favors and friends so we could make it a good night for E.  First I called Romy, who helped me with the cake and balloons (of which 1 helium balloon cost about $5!). Then I called the DJs and asked each of them to do a short 30 min or so, old skool hip hop set in tribute to E, cause she is such a huge hip hop head. Then I made the hotel reservations and everything just worked out from there. E, Mo, Ameenah and I were all set to stay in the room (which didn't happen but I'm not even going there) kick it all night and head to lunch the next day. All plans were in motion.  To make a long story short, although I hate Nature, the nite was good. The music was tight. Some of my friends and E's rolled thru and it was a cool little party. I wasn't able to do my "rounds" on the strip like I usually do, but that was fine because I was chillin' with my peoples. I got E a necklace, earrings and a t-shirt for her birthday which I hope she liked. She seemed like she did. It ended up just being me and her going to eat at her favorite restaurant in Roppongi Tony Roma's. After we ate the manager who knows her brought out an ice cream brownie and everyone sang "Happy Birthday". Although it was still about 2 days early, I think E had a good little bday. She spent Saturday with Mo at some club in Yokohama. Its cool to be able to have a good birthday around your friends. It will truly be her day in about 3 hours so until then I'll do the count down to the midnite call. \(*.*)/

      I am going to a Sayonara party on Saturday and the theme is "JAPAN". Very vague. I know. And I've been plagued for quite sometime trying to figure out what to be. But alas, I have decided. See the strange, bleached hair, white makeup Japanese girls in this picture? I'm going as one of them! I still haven't figured the hair part out yet, but I'm doing a practice make up run tonight and I'll work out the rest of my costume tomorrow. Wish me luck!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      My friend G got married May 30th. He sent me  urlLink photos  from the wedding. They are just georgous. It looks like it was a very nice day and he and his bride look very happy. Its an interesting emotion seeing someone you used to date get married. The biggest thing I feel though is happiness because I feel that G has been ready and waiting on that someone who was also ready. Then along came "The One" and the rest is history.  It's so cool when it works out that way. That's the way it should happen. But what about those of us who its not so easy for? What about when "The One" comes along and both of you realize it, so you run from it. For personally selfish reasons you aren't ready to commit but can't help but feeling bitten by "The Love Bug". You are bitten. There is no doubt about it and soon your body starts to react to the bite. It is slowly being infected by its love serum. The more you try to ignore its power, the harder it becomes to function normally. But still personal desires keep you from completely submitting to the power of love. So you wait and you suffer.   Doesn't that version just suck.  Congratulations G and T. I wish you all the happiness that true love can bring and more. May your union be blessed with trials and celebrations so that you may appreciate the companion you have been given and may you always remember that your partner is your special gift. Treasure each other like no other thing you've ever been given because this one is extra special.  Ja...

      Why in the hell is it already 85 degrees at 8 am!? We are approaching my third summer in Japan and it is unseasonably hot right now. We barely had a rainy season (which sucks for the rice farmers) and have seemed to fast forward into the summer heat. If July is this hot, I have bad bad feelings about August. I dont even HAVE air conditioning in my apt. It's usually not hot enough to worry with but I have a feeling I'm going to be missing it this year.

      I've heard it all...  I have been too busy recently to keep up with the news but I am so glad I took the time to read today. While browsing through the Yahoo! News "Oddly Enough" Newstories, I found  urlLink this one  about German female officers who have won the right to NOT wear their uniform caps because the women complain they (drumroll please) "ruin their hairdos". Now if that ain't some Black people mess. I mean I know the German's aren't black but couldn't you just see some of the NYPD Black female officers being like "uh-uh, I just got my hair did".   Then there was an article about the strike on the tubes in London. In that one, perspective was the main thing that stood out to me. The reporter interviewed a few folks who were all stressed out walking to work because they were hours late, the streets were crowded, the buses were packed, everyone is stressed out...and then you have the word from the dude who works at the lotto booth. The lotto dude is like "I'm enjoying it. Seeing all the people walking around, the weather's nice, jumping from bus to bus...I just find it hilarious". One man's tragedy another man's comedy.  As my friend S. Mo would say "PIIP-Put it in Perspective"  Ja...

       Hot vs. Warm   Tokyo was hot. No, like really hot as hell. Its been 30 degrees PLUS for the past 31 days. I didn't even get a chance to hop in the pool this time around. I wanted to go up to the lakes today but there is another typhoon passing thru and its raining like cats and dogs. I hope this passes soon though because I'm a friend over this weekend.  I just finished reading Obrigadabrasil and one of  urlLink Chandi's guest posts  that has me totally looking at my planner trying to figure out if I can hop a plan to Brasil sometime in the coming year. I guess she isn't an attorney for no reason, I'm totally persuaded. I literally read the post like 3 times trying to relish in her experience. "Warm" is what she referred to it as. I've never had such a longing to be warm in all my life. Thanks Chandi.  Jah.
