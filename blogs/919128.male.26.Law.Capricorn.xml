      Postscript: Sex Machine (James Brown) was on that CD. I'd forgotten how hilarious that song is.   James: Can we hit like that one more time? Others: One more time! James: Let's hit and quit! Others: Yeah! James: Can we hit and quit? Others: Yeah! James: Can we hit and quit? Others: Yeah!  Who are those people, that James Brown needs there assurances about hitting it?  I really don't have anything of substance to post tonight, but I'm bored and don't feel like being serious. This was also the CD that reflected my small collection of old-skool rap. Black Sheep, Snow (that white guy, if that's not obvious), Wreckx 'n Effect, and of course, Skee-Lo. I'm gonna burn those, along with the Taylor Dane and Irene Cara stuff, to a CD and call it my Assembled by Mental Patients mix.

      RIP  urlLink Jam Master Jay .  In other news, it's Halloween but that affects about as much as the rulings of the Australian parliament. I have lots of candy though!  I found an old CD I burned sophmore year of college, full of MP3's. I don't actually  remember  using drugs back then, but given the eclectic and somewhat disturbing contents of the CD, I must have. Johnny Hates Jazz?  They suck!  A sample:  ...and now you're given me, given me nothin but shattered dreams, shattered dreams feel like i could run away, run away...  I'm pretty sure I only have this song because I made a CD for my sister, but yikes. On the upside, there's a nice copy of Fire and Rain (James Taylor) and that Spacehog song that was popular 7 or 8 years ago. I'll stop writing now before I completely annihilate my remaining credibility.

      I just read a case for Civil Procedure in which I found myself agreeing with then-Justice (now Chief Justice) Rehnquist.  Against the likes of Brennan and Marshall, two all-stars of the Supreme Court if there ever were!  Law school makes us do strange things. No worries, though, it wasn't on some key moral issue, just the contacts needed for a state to apply its own laws instead of the laws of the state where an accident occurred. Like you know what that means! ;-)

      Meanwhile, in NBC's alternate (better) reality, President Bartlett kicked ass tonight. It's really a shame that none of our current politicians can think on their feet as fast as he portrays. Obviously they don't have multiple takes to get things right, but I can still yearn.   And then there's our current President, who couldn't find a coherent thought if you stapled one to his forehead.  Anyway, still have a little Civ Pro to read tonight, and maybe some Torts if I feel like. The beauty of Torts is, no matter what I read I won't be able to use it if Ursin asks me any questions. We'll also find out if I did well on the practice midterm in Torts. A day of wonder!

      Have you ever noticed that television and movies portray law students as pompous bastards? On CSI tonight, the police were holding a bunch of people, and of course Mr. Law Student (Third Year Version) says "Hey I'm a Third Year Law Student (of course), and I know you can't hold us like this."  Yeah, he's right, but you know what? When some kid is murdered and the cops are holding everyone from nearby, 99 out of 100 law students will sit dutifully by and cooperate. So nuts to you, CSI, and all other shows that make me feel like a jerk for being in law school.  There's another whole issue here concerning the disparagement of the law profession in general. But I'm sure every first-year law student tries to heroically defend his or her chosen profession, so I won't belabor the point right now.  But I'm on to you, Hollywood. ;-)

      I'm moving to Minnesota and voting for  urlLink Mondale  as a tribute to Sen. Wellstone.  He really was a pioneer, and a wacky liberal like me could usually count on him to do the right thing. That was so rare in public office, among both parties. He will be sorely missed.

      Prescript: Blogger sucks. I haven't been able to post this for almost 3 hours now. This certainly doesn't make me want to PAY for service in any sense. ... Boring Sunday. Lions  urlLink lost  but to a good team, so we're not too unhappy.  Sometimes I have so much work to do (like this week) that I can't even get started. Perhaps that is a study skills problem, but I've never been able to fix it. Maybe that's why it's already 2:30 on Sunday and I still haven't done anything. Sigh. I should stop watching "Amityville Horror 2" on UPN and maybe start my Criminal Law homework.   Oh by the way, Madonna's  urlLink movie  is out of theaters already. I smell an Oscar!

      Slow day today. Not much to report on, but my dad popped up in the Detroit News, which is cool. The Detroit Free Press woulda been better but hey, there's a picture!   urlLink Dad's famous!  (he's on the right in the top pic)  That's all for now. I think it's a Wendy's night, then time for Contracts! Hooray Contracts!

      So tired. I haven't seen this side of 1am on a Thursday in months. But cancelling Property allowed me to bust out on a 2 hour game of Diablo. Woo!    That's pretty much outta my system now.  There's a good chance I'll actually head to school tomorrow despite it being a day off. I mean, it's always  mostly  a day off, in that class is over at 10:15 a.m., but it's slightly different with no class at all. I'll be sleeping IN.  No more sniper in DC, that's nice. I think they were getting a little stir crazy over there. Glad I'm way the hell out here in San Diego, I tell you whut.  Okay it's off to bed! It's 4am on the west coast; people will be getting up in a couple of hours. I only mention that because it still amazes me. Sad but true.  Law Fact of the Day: if you are served a summons while flying over a state in an airplane, say for Arkansas while traveling from Georgia to Texas, that summons is good and you must appear in court. Sucka!

      Long day  again . What is that about? At least after Torts and Lawyering Skills tomorrow, it's weekend time!  God bless the administrative genius who sent Wiggins to Washington, thereby cancelling my one-and-only Friday class. Bless you, kind sir!    I imagine we'll be getting our Open Memo assignments tomorrow, so my jubilation is surely short-lived. I need to think of something to do tomorrow night - haunted house, maybe?  "Jerry!  Hello!  Jerry!  Hello!" Seinfeld is the best. Even in reruns. Maybe I should think about going out more...  No law fact today. My brain is mushed from too much Tort action. Although I CAN tell you that there is no voluntary act requirement to false imprisonment. Really!

      Buffy was really good tonight. Glad to see it's returning to the good ol' days of programming. Last year was just a tad too dismal.   urlLink It's a bad time to play Wolf, I tell you what.   Too bad the new UT2003 doesn't have a very good sniper rifle. Some stupid electro-gun thing, which is cool but it's not the same.   If anyone wants to get me those Onion refrigerator magnets for Christmas, that would be darn tootin' of you. Seriously.  In other news, I'm tired and I have another long Wednesday ahead of me, just like last week. Fortunately West Wing isn't going to go be all "brand new" so I can just concentrate on my fake Torts midterm and my all-too-real Memo rewrite, both due Thursday.  Law Fact of the Day: Minimum contacts must be established for pretty much any assertion of jurisdiction (in rem, in personum) to hold up. Otherwise, tough titty said the kitty.  That's a legal term. Seriously, Clarence Thomas says it all the time.

      A guy at Carl's Jr. just offered to buy my car for $6k. What the hell?  First of all, it's worth way more than that.  Second, does he just randomly think I want to sell my car to some guy at a drive-thru window?   On the plus side, he's the second person to compliment the car in the past 4 days. Granted, the first guy was an Acura employee but he was just walking by when I picked up my car from the dealership. Still, it's weird to have a car that people think looks good.   Thanks Mom!

      I had a weird dream about some guy punching me in the nose. It was about a bunch of other things too, but that was at the end before I woke up.  What sucks about dreams is that I felt ineffective and unable to fight back, like my own attempts at punching were equal to that of a 6-year-old's. Maybe that's the truth, although I think I could do a LITTLE more damage in real life than that. Anyway, it makes for a frustrating feeling when you wake up and the entire (fake) incident is vividly replaying in your head.  Just my two cents on sucky can't-hit-the-guy-hitting-you dreams. After I woke up I realized that in real life I could have pounded him and then got off scott free because it's self defense.  Thank you Crim Law!  We'll just call that our Law Fact of the Day.  In other news, Tech's winning and I might have study group today instead of tomorrow. Also my car was looked at and generally maintenanced yesterday, to the tune of about $350 (a big chunk was the new battery it needed). I don't mind the money so much because now I can rest easy that she's in good shape.  Since I was spending money I popped in CompUSA and bought a computer game, it was on sale so I didn't feel TOO bad, but I've pretty much run out of good games to play when I have some free time. Yes, I know I don't have much free time, but Friday afternoons can be long when all you have is TV.  I also finally bought a can-opener so I can get to those nice canned pears we bought at Costco.  I'm tired of these damn gray San Diego days.  The sun should come back out! Not that it's raining, really. But still, 61 degrees does not a high make, especially in SoCal.  Boo!

      Ants!  There are goddamn ants in my kitchen. I mashed a bunch but, being ants, that didn't dissuade them in the slightest. What does work, however, is 409 spray. That shit works faster than Raid, I tell you what. So now I'm a mur-diddly-urdler. Of ants, at least.  The Acura dealership says the car is fine, except it needs a new battery, which I figured because operating both windows at once was causing the RPM to drop while idling. That's never good. Total cost to Sam: about $350.  The price of owning a nice car, I suppose.   In other news, it's friday and thank god for that. What a bitch of a week it's been. I plan on spending the rest of the day goofing off and generally acting like someone not in law school for a bit.  Whee!

      Man it's been a long day. Tomorrow is extra-early due to a super-long Civil Procedure class (mid-term!) and then I get to hustle to the library for an hour to bust out a lawyering skills research project before class at 2:30.  I shall be mentally burned by the end of the day, just in time for Scrubs and some hot ER action.  Or maybe an early bedtime. ;-)  Law Fact of the Day (is a boring one, because I'm tired): The statute of limitations on tort actions has just recently been raised from 1 to 2 years in California.

      If you ever come across children wielding nitroglycerin bottles provided by homicidal lunatics, and some of those children have infants strapped to their backs to discourage retaliation when the children throw their home-made bombs at people, maaaaan you better just watch the hell out.  That's all I've got for now.  The hypotheticals we use in Criminal Law are going to make me warped.

      Tomorrow is more studying for Property, good ol' Criminal Law, and Contracts which I haven't read for yet. Maybe because my schedule is full. Of course if I hadn't taken 2 hours to watch Buffy and Smallville that might not be true... (quick review: Buffy good as always, Smallville better than usual). Now it's time to re-edit my Property outline in preparation for Friday's exam. Wish me luck!  Law Fact of the Day: If you yell at someone, and they get mad and run outside, and are eaten by a bear, you are not liable for their death. However, if you chase them outside under threat of injury and they are eaten by a bear, you just might be liable.  A heads up to you folks in bear country.

       urlLink My trip to the San Diego Zoo.   Okay, not really, but it's pretty funny.  If by funny I mean frightening, which I do. Another long day of class, after I read my CrimLaw I'll pop out another Law Fact of the Day.  Also notice that SpongeBob  urlLink is a hero in the gay community .  My dad has a hideous yellow SpongeBob t-shirt. Level of concern: rising.

      First post!  I guess there's not much competition for it, but I need to get something up.   I'm a 1st-year at USD School of Law. I have a Property mid-term at the end of the week and lots of homework besides that, so this won't be the most insightful or newsworthy blog you've ever seen. I may come up with something interesting once in awhile, though.   The big talk now is that stupid sniper in Maryland. Even out here, people are freaked out. It's understandable, and maybe it's the heightened randomness of it that is especially scary. I don't distinguish it much from other random acts of violence (which go on everyday) except that this is apparently one guy. I hope they catch him soon, so that my friends and family back home will relax a little bit.  Anyway, I also just found out that I have another mid-term, for Criminal Law, next Monday. It's ungraded (thank god!) but that will put a bit more of a cramp on my weekend plans. No rest for the weary law student, I suppose.  With all these mid-terms (a Civil Procedure one is lurking but hasn't affixed itself to a date yet...) you'd think I'd be studying. Get off my back!! ;-)  Law Fact of the Day: If you get an official letter from the Attorney General saying it's okay to commit a federal crime, you have a valid defense when charged with that crime. The AG will be in hot water, though.

      Yes it's been forever. And I'm not going to write much now, because I'm off to the store!  But I wanted to update that it has been forever since I've updated. I revel in irony, man. If that's even irony.  Thanksgiving was fun, FYI. Kind of a non-event compared to tradition, but that's how these things work I suppose. I've been doing some outlining and watching movies for 3 days straight, and I think it's making me goofy. MIB2 is mildy entertaining, not nearly as fun as the first one, but it had its moments. Tomb Raider was pretty cool but again, nothing to write home about.  Reign of Fire has been elusive; I've downloaded it twice now, the first time it turned out to be "Dude, Where's My Car?" and let me tell you, that's a let down. The second time it seemed to come through but I can't play it with any of my codecs. Yes, I have DivX.   Also: I want one of those talking Simpsons Burger King watches. Not that Bart one though, maybe the hamburger one.

Also for George Thorogood and his very funny lyrics to "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer".   Back to writing my paper! Sorry for the lack of interesting updates but school has kept me busy for a little bit, before Thanksgiving hits. That's a rhyme!

      Now I gotta say, I think  urlLink this  is just about the lamest thing I've ever heard of. For those of you too lazy to click the link, it's basically a company that's offering websites a way "around" pop-up ad blockers. About a month ago I finally installed one of those blockers (and it's pretty good, I think I might have mentioned it in here but if not you can get it at  urlLink www.panicware.com ) and it's been great. Now this guy says it's actually theft!  Theft, he says! He must have the same brilliant gift for analysis that the guy who said "fast forwarding through commercials is theft." Look, pop-up ads suck. EVERYONE hates them, especially the ones that spawn over and over again. I'm also annoyed by those interstitials (ads that play right on the page, blocking the content) but pop-ups are far worse. The idea that we shouldn't be allowed to stop ads from opening new browser windows is absurd; you could make an equally compelling (and by compelling I mean absurd and flimsy) argument that causing pop-up ads is a breach of security and privacy. I control my computer, and I control what I want my web browser to do. If someone tries to hijack my machine, you can damn well bet I'm not visiting that site again.   Yeah, so basically shut the hell up. "Anti-theft" my ass. This company pretty much sucks all around, also promoting source-code blocking tools and tools that keep users from "undesirable" countries from accessing their clients' web sites. I won't even get into why those are extraordinarily under-handed tricks.

      So here's an interesting tidbit: they found my car! The police called at the ultra-convenient hour of 5:30 a.m. to let me know it was at a towing place in Miramar (not the airbase, just north of there). Of course they can't tell me what condition it is, so I spend half the day worrying about it being broke as hell (but not broke enough to junk - thus excusing Geico from paying me the full value of the car). I call the towing people, and despite the fact that my car is right there, they can't tell me if it's okay either.  So Marek gives me a ride up there, which is really nice of him because traffic back was a bitch, and I get my car and  absolutely nothing is wrong . I was almost annoyed, basically the car thieves "borrowed" for 2 weeks and were pretty much just as careful as I would have been, had I been driving it.   Downside: no new (well, different used) car for me. Upside: didn't really want a new car. Now I have my girl back. :-)  Of course, now I have to find a way to keep thieves out since I know they know they can pretty much steal it whenever they want. Too bad the Club is such a useless tool, I'm heading to an automotive store today to see if there's anything better they can do for me. Remote-controlled ejector seats, or an ignition cut-off switch, would be cool.  Not much else is new right now. Gotta work on my open memo paper all weekend (the rewrite), and next week I only have 3 days of class (6 classes total) before the Thanksgiving break. I won't be going home for it, because home is too far for so little time off. And there's plenty to do, as far as outlining and studying and such. I will, of course, miss the turkey and the fam, but whaddyagonnado.

      Man I gotta figure out what the hell kinda car to get, and I have to figure it out soon. I'm leaning towards a Jetta if I can afford it, but lately they've been pricey and we'll have to see if Geico tries to screw me on how much my car is worth. Cross your collective fingers for me.  Of course, getting the money is half the battle, because  nobody  ever got screwed when buying a used car before, right? Haha... hmmm. I'll probably go to a dealer, for convenience and speed, and maybe a warranty.  Anyways, any suggestions for cars to buy would be appreciated, because lord knows I gotta have more ideas that a Jetta.   In other news, I've decided Bernie Mac is funnier than Ed this season, so I may be making the big switch. In case you're wondering, yes my life is this boring. Gotta fill the brief non-law school void with something!

       urlLink Go Wings!   Nothing much to report tonight, except that the dude on Smallville who plays Superman always looks like he's 5 seconds away from bursting into tears. What a maroon.  Also I wanted to share this Law Fact of the Day: There is a thing called the "Uniform Simultaneous Death Act" (lawyers like things to be called "Uniform" because it makes them feel safe) which details how to proceed when 2 (or more) people who hold a joint title of some kind die at the same instant.   Sad Fact of the Day: I find this stuff interesting.

       urlLink RIP James Coburn.  He sure did have a big mouth, and I mean that physically. His teeth were like a wall of white. He'll be missed, the grizzled old bastard. The Magnificent Seven is really a kick ass movie though, I recommend it if you haven't seen it.  In other news: I have no other news. Only a week and a half 'till Thanksgiving, and then only a week of classes left before Finals Begin And I Am Killed. By the Finals. It will be the suck.  However, a week and a half after finals begin, they end and I get to visit DC for a couple weeks. I'm really looking forward to that, so yay! Let's hope I can push that to the back of my mind and concentrate on school until then, yes?

      Man, I really hate it when good shows leave a cliffhanger, not only until next week, or even 2 weeks, but until  next year . Angel was pretty cool and it ended with lots of questions. So of course, what are they going to do?  Put on reruns (or the Wizard of Oz?  wtf?) until January or so. That's just fiiiine. Networks piss me off, if they don't have enough shows they should have made more. I guess that's what you get from the WB, UPN does it too but they seem more appreciative of Buffy and have only played reruns a couple times so far this season.  So that's my rant for the night. Simpsons was funny, now I'm watching The Practice but that show kind of annoys me. King of the Hill wasn't that great. I'm sure you care about my opinion on all these things. ;-)  Now that I've read Contracts and written my Crim Law paper (only 2 left to write, then I'm done for the year!) I think some GTA is in order. Or maybe I'll just fool around on the Net for awhile.  Oh, and the weekend was fun, didn't do too much but got to hang out with some folks and that was cool. Also my apartment is superclean now (had to make the study group feel less disgusted when they saw my living environment ;-) and maybe I can keep it that way for more than a day or two.

      Nerd comment of the week:  My DSL has been up and running for 2 weeks; I've downloaded more than 2 gigs of data in that time. And not even half of that was porn! ;-)  Seriously, maybe it's time for a reboot. I miss my router, which kept me safe from the mean ol' haxors and phreaks.  Also, I just beat GTA3 again. Exactly 1 week after I got it back from Adam, AND I had law school in that time as well. A testament to my mad skillz i'm sure. Now that I've cleaned the apartment, though, I'm getting bored. Maybe it's time to watch the 4 Sopranos episodes I downloaded.

      Thank god for stupid kids. They provide so much entertainment with their various shenanigans. Of course I have no sympathy for  urlLink this guy . Maybe somebody should have given him some common sense before he turned NINETEEN.  This is hardly a game's fault at that age.  Hell, at any age it's not a game's fault, but to imply that a 19-year-old was driven by a game is asinine.   Somebody once gave me a pretty good analogy. Stop lights have conditioned me to stop, but I don't freeze in my tracks every time I see a red light go on. Why? Because I can determine context, and anyone who can't has much worse problems than the video games they play.

      Didn't do as well on my Property mid-term as I would have liked, but better than I expected. Translation: I did middle-of-the-road. The upside is that it was the first mid-term, therefore my first law school test, and it's pretty much downhill from there. I'm already smarter than I was waaaay back in October. ;-)  Anyway, just a mention because I can't think of anything else to talk about today. Homework was fairly simple, and I have lots to do this weekend (including hosting a study group - time to clean!).  In celebration of an easy homework night, I'm going to play some rare weekday-GTA3. Experience the magic!

      Here's an interesting  urlLink Salon.com  article for all my peeps who meet, date, and contemplate long-term investments of emotional capital using the Internet.  Sneak preview: those who dabble in online dating are probably healthier and more self-aware than those who don't.

      I got called on in Civ Pro today, that was nerve-wracking. It was especially harsh because it was to discuss a case we had to read for LAST class, not today's class, so I read it a week ago and had trouble understanding it even then. So today, I forgot we hadn't covered it and the professor said, "Okay, let's talk about Free v. Abbott. Sam, why don't you give us the facts behind the case."  Naturally it took me a couple seconds to remember we even HAD a case called that, and what the hell it was about. But after a rough start I think I ended up doing okay. Nothing all-star, but I was fairly competent.  Tonight is more work, because i pretty much dropped the ball last night after the "festivities" between me and Kim. It's hard to focus on something as dry as Civil Procedure and Torts when your personal life is messed up. Maybe that's why my fellow law students seem to avoid dating like the plague. ;-)

      Sometimes other people surprise you. You always hope that it will be in a good way, and when it's not it can be pretty shocking. Even the phrase "sometimes people surprise you" has a positive ring to it.   And then when they go the opposite way... I guess that's when it's all the more painful. For now we just wait and see.   In other news, car's still gone, sun finally came out, and GTA3 is as fun as I remember it. Thanks Adam! ;-)

      It's pretty crappy weather around here. Even  urlLink CNN  thinks so. Don't let them fool you, what they call a "Winter Storm" on the west coast isn't remotely like a winter storm on the east coast. They just say that because they don't know any better. ;-)  Still no sign of my car. :( I have a crappy Ford Focus from the rental place, though, so at least I'm not trapped in my apartment. Although if the dilemma is go out  in a Ford Focus  or stay in, it's a much tougher call than you might think. ;-)

      Stolen!  Yes, stolen.  My car is no more. My very nice, well cleaned, Acura Integra disappeared from the parking lot last night while I slept. Slept no more than 25 feet away, actually.  The proper authorities have been informed, but boy does this suck.  Now I have a Ford Focus and I tell you what, I'm not buying one of those if my Acura never comes back.  And if she does come back, maybe it's time for a car alarm.  Or something.  Because damn, sucka!  Ironic Moment of the Day #1: after calling cops/insurance company, I turned on the TV and the first thing I saw/heard was some guy reporting his car stolen to the police.   Ironic Moment of the Day #2: i got a package from Adam in the mail, and guess what it included?  Grand Theft Auto 3. Timing is everything, now I can exact justice cyber-style.  As if that will help.  Sigh sigh sigh.  San Diego loses points for this. DC never stole my car, they just ticketed it repeatedly and once broke a window.

      My leg hurts. I don't know why, it's like a hamstring crossed with a general ache. Only in one leg, and only when I walk.  Which, unfortunately, I do alot of. Stupid fringe parking.  Anyway, just wanted to whine because I can. :-) Thank god it's Thursday night.  Maybe this weekend I'll favor everyone with some thoughts on why people need to get over stuff. In case you're wondering, it's not you (nobody who reads this dumb thing, anyway).  ;-) But it's a trend I've noticed with some people: an inability to move on from a particular situation or relationship, despite overwhelming evidence that it's not doing them any good.

      Well that was just a big mess yesterday, wasn't it? I've already changed my mind about who's fault this is. It's no longer the stupidity of the vast, uninformed American public (though they never help things). It's the Democrats.  Am I traveling in the wrong circles? Why is everyone I know fairly-to-very liberal? And yet the Democrats are moving towards the center. They're no longer progressive, as a party, nor are they even very interesting anymore.  They're a weak and pathetic imitation of the Republican party, who, god bless 'em, at least have the chutzpah to stand up for what they believe in.  I may fight them to the death on almost every issue, but at least they don't equivocate their thoughts away like the D's.   Yes, the Democrats were scared. I would have been too, holding a tiny majority that represents their last real vestige of power in the Federal Government.  Now, because they were so chicken-shit in this election, they've lost everything Clinton put together. They've been too eager to say "well I'm not against  insert conservative issue , but I think we need to be smart about it."  Goddammit, I want you to be AGAINST an overly-broad interpretation of the 2nd Amendment. I want you to be AGAINST allowing God into government. I want you to be AGAINST pollution of the environment.   And yet, Democrats cave. They give in, show off their hunting rifles and talk about how important God and their SUV are in their lives. They've lost my vote for now, and unless a Democrat comes along with a better theme than "the party that's a little less rigid than the GOP", I'm voting Green.   Oh, and the worst part?  The implications this may have on the Supreme Court. You better  pray  that Rehnquist and O'Connor stay healthy. One thing law school has taught me is the power of the Supremes, and boy howdy will they wreak havoc if the Court is stacked with conservatives.

      Blarg! The stupid Republicans are going to pull this off, aren't they? You know, the only thing saving this country from its own completely inept leadership was the tiny Democratic majority in the Senate.  If that's gone... I am literally weak from fear right now.  Or maybe I'm weak from eating two peanut butter & jelly sandwiches for dinner.  Nothin' like home cookin!  A pox! A pox on the Bush administration's disastrous effects on our nation.

      New  urlLink layout ! (don't bother clicking, it's a link to this blog). I got bored with the tiny-tip-o-rama that the other template gave. There was a time when I'd spend hours customizing this stuff, but sadly my knowledge of HTML has faded to a quiet murmur, and have I mentioned I'm in law school? Busy busy!  I tried to watch that 20/20 interview with the guy from N'Sync, but god help me it was just to insipid. Sorry dear, guess I won't be able to give you a full report. ;-) If it matters, CSI: Miami is much more entertaining.  My mom's buggin me for a Christmas list. It sorta feels weird to put together a list like I've done every year since I was 5, but it's comforting in a way. Also utilitarian; my family would never guess right if I just let them go at it without hints. :-) I won't be so vain as to put that stuff here, since I'm not sure what the purpose of that would be, but if anyone knows of any really good computer games or DVD's that are worth owning,  urlLink drop me a line .

      Well Virginia Tech obviously  urlLink dropped more than a few spots  in the latest polls - #10 in BCS and #'s 8 and 7 in the other two big ones. Not much to say about that except that VT is now closer to where it actually belongs in the rankings (according to my ever-so-humble opinion, obviously). ;-)  Contracts was cancelled today! Nothing like walking to what you think will be an hour and fifteen minutes of boredom and getting a last-minute reprieve. Hope he didn't get hit by a bus or something, though.  The extra time gave me the chance to finish up my Civil Procedure reading for tomorrow  already , which means mor time for open memo writing tonight. (Translation: I'm not going to do any real work)  Law Fact of the Day: committing a crime while intoxicated almost always results in a charge of "reckless (crime)", e.g. "reckless homicide". this is because the law is your mother, and says intoxication is reckless, and what will the neighbors think?

      Forgot to give my own personal commentary on  urlLink yesterday's football fiasco(s) .   First of all, both VT and Notre Dame were heavily overranked. Tech hasn't really beaten anybody that strong, nor do they have the players they need to warrant ranking them as high as they were. Running backs do not a team make. Same goes for Notre Dame, who I inherently despise because of  urlLink Rudy , but who also were overranked just because of their name. Yes, both teams are quite good, but #3 and #4?  No way. Anybody who's watched Tech for the last 5 or 6 weeks should have realized that - they have no competent quarterback! You can't be 3rd in the nation without a good QB.  Anyway, I didn't see the whole of the game, but it occurs to me that all the people blaming that one guy for a penalty are a bit off the mark. Yes, the tide turned, but one penalty does not equal 21 points. Tech's defense is pathetic, and has been shutting down in the second half all season. I'm glad it finally bit them in the ass, because it certainly has threatened to do so in the past. One mistake  never  equals the entire game, because even if it's at the last second (ie. a missed field goal), people tend to forget that  59 minutes were already played!  If a team is really better, then they would put the game away early and keep it away.   Whew. Yes, a rant, but what can ya do. Rampant fandom has never impressed me much, and now that my alma mater inspires such blind zealotry, I feel like I should be the voice of reason.  Also I like to hear myself talk (type?).

      Study group cancelled for today, which is too bad but probably for the best given the amount of homework I still have to do.  Crazy  urlLink California drivers  get destroyed by fog. It's really not their fault, the fog around here can be unbelievable.  Lions games is scoreless so far. Still freaks me out that it's the 2nd quarter already and only 11:30 in the morning. What the hell! ;-) I kept Kim up until like 4am EST last night, now I feel bad. She has church and stuff today. :-(  Today will be a success if I finish both Crim Law papers and do some memo work. Actually it'll be a success if I can stay out of Diablo for the day.

       urlLink Fly the copter  and see if you can beat my high score of 2784. Offer not valid to Raf, who already beat it by a mile because he was obsessed with the game for a month.  This post is probably an indicator that I am bored. In fact, I am, but I'm doing laundry and paying bills so it's a productive boredom. And isn't that really the best kind?  No. I used to be with "it", but then they changed what "it" was, and what's "it" now seems weird and scary to me.

      Hello!  Yes it's been...12 days since I updated but in my own defense, I was not near a computer and I don't know my own password to this thing. But then I figured it out so you, my adoring Internet public (2 people, one of whom is in prison) can hear what I've been up to.  Finals are over, yes, that's very nice. Won't know how I did until like, February so don't even ask you punks. Been back in DC since Dec. 21, it's been good to see folks and friends and Kim, and I'm sad that I'll be going back this Saturday (day after the old b'day). But on the other hand, I look forward to being back where my stuff is. No offense to DC kids but it's warmer in San Diego and like, my clothes are there.   Christmas was good to me, I got a laptop for use in school and general fun. General fun = wireless networking, which is so cool. I'm a huge dork. But i don't care because it's so cool to be outside on the sidewalk checking my email. Shut up!  You're not the boss of me, I can do that if I want. ;-) Also, I got Spider-Man and SWEp2 on DVD, some Onion books, some really cool pants from the little lady (and some cool pants from family folk), a guitar tuner and some VT clothing (I didn't have any. Sad but true.). The birthday is on Friday, and it's likely I'll get another DVD and perhaps new shoes, because my mom is horrified at the current state of my footwear.  Oh also I got Medal of Honor: Spearhead but only in theory, as my mom accidental picked up MoH:Allied Assault (which I had) and I still haven't been by Target to swap 'em. But I will, Jason says it's cool moe dee and I will enjoy it once I get back to San Diego and my graphics card that doesn't suck.   What other news! Kim may be coming out to SD in February, so that would be cool. I'm going to Vegas next week with the study group, and that will be cool too. Less gambling this time, however, because I am poor and can't afford it. If anything interesting happens in Vegas I'll be sure and note it here. :-)  Okay that's about it, and I believe the battery on the old laptop is fading so I'm going to go back upstairs and plug her in. Tonight = low-key party as Jason's to celebrate the death of 2002 and birth of 2003. The future is now!

      I get some kind of weird high from "getting things done" and yet, I'm one of the biggest procrastinators on the planet. Today, I took a final, got my haircut, paid almost all the rest of my bills (except rent) and arranged for parking while I'm out of town.    Let's see, what else... I saw this guy almost get hit by a car this morning.  The idiot (take your pick, driver and pedestrian were both morons) should have watched where he was going. Fortunately nobody actually got hit but geez.   I've also decided that I'm a weird person.  Examples: - I worry about picking seats next semester because I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. - I rehearse what I'm going to say to the haircut lady beforehand, so that I know. I don't mean chit-chat (I'm pretty quiet) I mean what I want her to do to my hair. - Actually I rehearse almost everything I'm going to say to someone, especially if it's over the phone. I used to be much worse at that, but I still do it today. - I get nervous about upcoming events that are, to everyone else involved, fun. To me, they will  probably  be fun but I can't think about that now, all I can think about is being nervous.  Anyway. Just some thoughts from my brain.  I've decided Trent Lott should resign his post as Majority Leader. So everyone can breathe easy, now that I've come to a decision on that crucial issue of national importance. He shouldn't be forced out of office, though, as some people are pushing for - Mississippi elected him and Mississippi can elect someone else the next time they get a chance. Speaking one's mind isn't grounds for resignation or impeachment, and it shouldn't be. Will Mississippi elect someone new? Probably not, but it's up to them. Ahhh, Democracy. Enjoy it, old man - it will be your last.  Last night (I just can't shut up!) I was watching a rerun of Everybody Loves Raymond and I laughed and it sounded JUST LIKE my dad laughing. That freaked me out. Speaking of laughing, I miss having friends around that I can share the little inane TV stuff with. Like "Rusty!" "What about George?" from Seinfeld, classic lines that are lost on my west coast friends. Not because they don't appreciate funny, but because... well it's the kinda thing you have to be there for at the start.  Because the name "Rusty" isn't inherently funny or anything. And speaking of not inherently funny things, "Local Oaf" is probably only amusing to one of the oh, 3 people who read this. So maybe I'll change it again.  Law Fact of the Day: Torts finals are hard, man. That's a fact.

       urlLink This  is pretty funny. Lo Pan is awesome, by the way. And don't get me wrong I think LOTR kicks ass, but hey, what movie  can't  benefit from lesbians?  Answer: none.  So I'm studying for Torts now, which is weird because I have to memorize stuff and I don't have to do that for any other classes (they all let us use notes/books). So that = the suck. On the other hand, Torts is such a weird class that when I wrote up my notes, I came up with only 3 pages of stuff. Not that hard to memorize.  Right now on TV: The "Bear Tax" episode of the Simpsons. One of the best. "Lisa, I want to buy your rock."  So far no change on my title here. Damn it all. Maybe I should try changing it again.

      So I was pretty bored tonight, and not even remotely interested in studying for Monday's Property Final. FYI, I think I did okay on the CivPro Final this morning, but essays are tough to judge afterwords. We'll see.  Anyway, so I started looking up folks on the 'net like I occasionally do, Googling them and such. Most of my good friends have really boring names (all you damn Hunters are useless ;-) but I did come up with urlLink  this interesting article about my friend Chance's brother . The weird shit you find when you're bored!  I also found a recent picture of an old high school friend, which is relatively interesting but not worth mentioning beyond that, mostly because nobody who reads this would know her.  If you know Chance and Canaan, this article will crack you up. And even if you don't, parts of it are still hilarious (if not unsettling - Canaan's pretty much crazy, in a serious institutional way).   In other news, Kim won't be getting a job back in Alexandria because the Transportation Security Admin. decided not to renew her companies contract. Or they decided not to make a new contract. I'm not really sure. She was a little tipsy when we chatted, since after the depressing news her office went out for drinks (at 11am).  Good for them, says me. I still feel bad for Kim, though maybe not as bad as I should since this will make it all the easier for her to move on out to San Diego.  Sleep now!  I lack even the motivation to continue this blog entry, so you'll just have to

       urlLink Andy Richter Controls the Universe  really is one of the funniest shows on TV right now. You should watch it, because if it goes the way of Undeclared (the last funny show that died for no good reason) I will be annoyed with you. Yes, you.  So to recap, you should be watching: Buffy, West Wing, Bernie Mac, Scrubs, Andy Richter, The Simpsons, Futurama, and Angel.  I respect those who are 24 or Alias fans but I really haven't had the room or the time to squeeze either of those into my lineup. If you find yourself with time to watch TV but none of those shows are on, try the King of Queens, Everybody Loves Raymond, King of the Hill, and Firefly (at least until it gets cancelled). And any of those numerous Law & Order shows are usually good TV.  Maybe I need Carina Chocano's job. I could review TV shows for a living. Course then this whole law degree thing is pretty much a waste of 120 grand. Maybe I'll get the degree and then review lawyer shows; it's not like there has ever been a shortage. Of course then I would have had to watch that wretched (and thankfully short-lived) Fox show about 3 girls just out of law school. Girls club? I forget but it was pretty bad. Law & Order is still the most accurate show I've seen, based on my brief education thus far; last night's episode even touched on jurisdictional issues, which I have a test on tomorrow! So last night's watching counted as studying. Really.  Speaking of studying, I'm going to go do that. Law Fact of the Day: a bond can remove the need for a pre-attachment (prior) hearing but does not remove the need for a post-attachment hearing. Boring but true.

      I don't know if I mentioned this before, but law school textbooks refer to all hypothetical people with female pronouns. That is, if X and Y are fighting and X kills Y with a fork,  she  is guilty of homicide. It's always she or her.  I'm not exactly sure why that is, except maybe that it's an attempt at avoiding sexist writing by always having female hypothetical actors. But the end result is strange, because when the situation calls for 2 different genders, but only one of the participants is guilty of a crime, it's always the woman. Only in the Land of Law School Textbooks are women more likely to kill their husbands, rob banks, or generally cause mayhem.  None of that holds true when it comes to rape, however, which makes sense I suppose since traditional rape laws don't involve anything but female victims.  Anyway, just thought that was weird enough to point out. On the upside, it makes it easier to remember weird hypothetical situations, because when I read "he" I just think "person" but when I read "she" I think "a woman did THAT?"  Maybe I'm a sexist bastard.

      So I finished my Civil Procedure outline, and my Contracts pseudo-outline is fairly complete, and I said to myself, "Why don't I make a blog entry?"  I should have immediately answered "Because none of that is interesting to anybody except you.  And not even you, because the voice inside your head is bored with it too." Instead I just started typing. Such is life.  Lions lost today. Tech lost yesterday, which was unsurprising but still mildly sad. They really weren't good enough to compete at that level (in the top 10 teams) so I'm not terribly distressed. The Lions are a lost cause so I won't bother talking anymore about them.  On the bright side, the Skins lost again as well, to the Giants of all people. They suck!  But then, so do the Redskins so I guess it was a craptacular toss-up.  But watching a team you don't like lose can only make you so happy; even  I'm  not so callous as to be completely rejuvinated by the misfortune of others.  In other news, I really need to start making a list of Christmas presents for the family; hopefully I can purchase alot of them online, and ship them directly to Virginia. That'd be convenient. In other bad news, I'm still poor and that sucks, so anybody expecting a present and reading this blog should remember that when opening said presents. ;-)  Practice tests abound tomorrow, so I'm off to bed. One of these days I'll toss out another Law Fact of the Day, but right now I'm so chock full of information it's too hard to discern anything specifically entertaining.

      I find this... either amusing or mildly shocking.  urlLink Good ol' boy Trent Lott  told the audience at Thurmond's 100th Birthday that "When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either."  Now, let's remember that when Thurmond ran for president in 1948, he ran on a segragationist platform which said "we stand for the segregation of the races and the racial integrity of each race."  What the hell is Lott thinking?  Does he mean "oh, besides all the race mongering and such" or what? As much as I enjoy seeing GOP morons putting their feet squarely in their mouths, this is more shocking than usual.  If anyone was under the idiotic impression that race was no longer an issue in politics, we need look only as far as Trent Lott to see that's not true. Apparently America would have been a better place had we kept it segregated. Hell, even that senile old bat Thurmond isn't stupid enough to say things like THAT anymore.    Anyway. Back to my CivPro outline.

      Yeah so classes are over. I'd give that a big "whoopee" but I have all my finals to worry about, and those aren't going to be easy. I get Monday and Tuesday off, then it's a final every other weekday until the 20th. That's only 5, but each one will take a monumental amount of work to prepare for.  So, can I motivate myself to do it? I have 4 days until my first final, Contracts, and that's plenty of time. If I make myself do it.  Nothing else to report, it's been too long since I've updated but all I do these days is prepare for finals. Color me boring.

      That song in the new Beetle commercial, Mr. Blue Sky (by ELO orginally, I believe) is not sung by same guy but it's incredibly catchy. Actually, now that I hear it again (on the TV right now!) it sounds like that guy who plays Oswald on Drew Carey (and the neighbor in Office Space). I know it's not him but if he sang that's what it'd sound like. (postscript: it is the same guy, the lead singer for ELO, but without all his idiot backups and weird funk noises it was hard to tell. I stand by that Oswald thing, though.)  Maybe it's getting late. Is it bad that all my favorite new songs are from commercials now? I don't think I'm nearly as lame as that sounds because so many commercials use really obscure stuff these days, and it's introduced me to a bunch of new bands and such. I'm digging Telepopmusik thanks to Mitsubishi, and even though I don't know the group the jazzy music from the Lincoln Navigator commercial is pretty cool. Not that I'll buy their cars, but still.

      Lately, I've found myself slightly more affected by emotional (sad) scenes in movies, tv, and books.  Well the books part is kind of an assumption, as it's not like Civil Procedure is all that emotional draining, and I don't read anything else.   But anyway, what the hell is that all about? I've come to the tentative conclusion that I'm not getting wussier (although I'm not completely ruling that out), I just have more in my life to care about. And more experiences from which I can draw empathic responses (my dad's big surgery, various other health scares in the family).  I think the main reason, however, is having people in my life that I care deeply about. Family has always been there, and I've always cared about them, even though I may not have been aware of how much I cared until more recently (recent = last 2 or 3 years). But even beyond family are friends and a certain other someone, people who have collectively made me think more about my life and my future than I ever have before. Those thoughts have then (I think) naturally lead towards an unshielding of my emotional side.  Right. So, introspective thoughts of the evening. I still play GTA3 and enjoy Jackassesque (my own term) humor, and I still don't cry when I hurt myself so I'm not completely gone yet.

      Now, I'm not saying that  urlLink Heather Graham  is a bad person. But she's not that great an actress, that I've seen. Maybe I've missed her signature role (Boogie Nights? Definitely not Austin Powers.)  And here she is again playing a porn star. That's pretty weird; she certainly hasn't had many problems with being all sorts of naked on screen. Of course, I don't mind that at all.  I don't think I want to see "The Guru" but right now I've got the 25th Hour and Chicago on my list. Perhaps Daredevil when it comes out in a couple weeks.  What a boring night! I think I've played like 136 hands of spider solitaire, watched half of "The Cell" (weird) and eaten 3 hotdogs. Ah the life of a bachelor.

      The Social Distortion cover of "Ring of Fire" (originally by Johnny Cash, I believe. You know, the space coyote.) is pretty kick ass. Not to dump on the unstoppable Mr. Cash, but it's better than his version.  This is why bands like Social Distortion have a place; not to make their own craptastic rock music, but to cover songs that could be much cooler if you tossed in a rockin guitar and back beat.  In case I haven't mentioned it, it's 81 degrees here. I just got back from working out and being at the pool.  On an unrelated note - well not totally - Cash got me thinking of that quote in High Fidelity about his autobiography, which then got me thinking about an even funnier quote:  "Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breast that I would try to touch her between her legs. It was like trying to borrow a dollar, getting turned down, and asking for 50 grand instead."

      Man alive, there are... men alive in here!  Okay not really, but that would be a good slogan for a gay bar or dance club. I don't know what made me think of that except that anytime I sit down to start writing in this thing I get all kinds of random thoughts.  I did get a haircut today, that was nice. Lots of compliments on it, but I can never distinguish between it's-obvious-you-got-a-haircut compliments, and it-actually-looks-good-please-sleep-with-me compliments. ;-) But it's pretty short again, though not at Marine-level short like it was last time I got a big cut.  Wow!  Haircuts = blogging gold!  Why don't I talk a little more about it! Note: sarcasm difficult to convey in print.  I wasn't very impressed by the State of the Union, but I'm man enough to admit that I came into it with a severe dislike of the main speaker. Even if his message was well-crafted (and it was), the man is such a bad speaker it kills any chance I had of respecting it. Even Bush 1 was better - I disagreed with his policies but the man had a brain and that comes through. It doesn't matter how good Bush Jr.'s speechwriters are, they can't disguise the fact that he's not the sharpest tool in the Presidential shed.  Scrubs is coming on, so I'm pretty much done. I think I'm losing focus on school somewhat, so this weekend I'm going to try and refocus and get back in the swing. I'm not really slacking right now - I do all the work, but all the recent distractions have made it tougher to concentrate. Here's to tackling that pesky inner monologue!

      What a  tiring  day, man. Campus from 10am to nearly 6pm wears a brother out, yo.  Some days are weird; I start in a good mood, or somebody puts me in a good mood, and that's nice, but just like that it can fade right away again. I'm not in a  bad  mood per se, but sometimes the elation fades. I'm not sure where the elation comes from in the first place, honestly, maybe the weather. It's hard to be in a bad mood when it's so nice out. Today it turned colder, but I hope I'm not that easily swayed that an overcast sky can completely change my mood.  Perhaps it's just having alot on my mind right now, which I do. Family/friends/relationships/work/school - nothing is working quite like I want it to; most areas show potential, but I'm an impatient bastard. ;-) I want what I want sooner, rather than later. I've never been one for patience, and the more I start focusing on things the longer it seems to take.  Sometimes, I think too much. Most times, I think too much. I can't just let things be, I have to overthink everything, and nobody else does that. I'm SURE nobody else does, maybe because everyone else is far busier than I am. When you're busy, you don't have time to have long drawn-out conversations in your brain, and you don't let your mind wander for miles upon miles. At least, that's the theory. I'm gonna give that a try - busyness will cure my overactive imagination. ;-)  Tomorrow, if I can get out of the damn library before 4pm, I hope to get a haircut back to my marine-esque cut. It's really too warm, and I'm too shaggy these days. I don't really know that anyone actually  likes  me in short hair, but I'm not really seeking to impress. I just want to waste less time on personal grooming (the amount of which I currently engage in has probably doubled in size in the last few months).

      Post from the library! No real reason except that I'm killing time, trying to decide whether I want to do more work here or just head home and eat. My head hurts, so home is currently winning. But on the other hand... if I do work here it will get done, whereas at home there are distractions (like Buffy tonight). I'll probably hang around a little longer.  I have no other news, except that we got our grades and I did okay. Not stellar, but my average is above the class average by a hair or 2, so I'm not displeased. Plenty of room for improvement (except in Contracts, where I got a fluke high score that I will never be able to replicate).   Some people are very sad about their grades, and I'm torn between advising them to stay because they are my friends, and advising them to do what's in their hearts, which could well mean leaving school. But that's so sad! Sigh. My grades are neither spectacular nor gutter-residing, and so I continue to plug along. I'm destined to be that guy that made no visible impact in school, but was competent and graduated with nary a close call on his record. That should make me happy, considering that law school is damn hard and everyone here is damn smart, but right now I'm just thinking day-to-day.

      Top Ten Dumbest Things About the Superbowl: 1. "and when we come back, the coin toss!" 2. the musical act right before the coin toss 3. the musical act right after the coin toss 4. every other musical act associated with football 5. kid rock's participation in any form 6. raider's fans 7. how scared san diegans are of raiders fans 8. halftime 9. john madden's insightful commentary ("when the ball comes your way, you've just got to catch it.  you've just got to.") 10. watching the superbowl "for the commercials". because most weren't very impressive for $2 mil.  and the best things? 1. seeing the jets fly over the stadium on tv, as they cut to commercial, and then hearing/seeing them fly over my apartment. sweet! 2. two good football teams knocking the hell out of each other 3. the Hulk commercial

      OMFG why don't more people live here in San Diego?  Today: 80 degrees, bright, sunny,  absolutely beautiful . Went down to PB walked around, beached it for a little bit and watched Hilary's South African friend surf. Foreign people always sound polite, I've decided. Even when telling you to piss off or something (not that he did - I'm just saying) the accent gives it class.    Of course, I'm an idiot, so why wouldn't I think that? :-)  It's just such a beautiful day I had to make another post.  I'm even a little sunburned!  Yay for California!  I see now what people meant when they said "you're never going to go back to the east coast" - if there are more days like this (and there will be) they're right.    I've upgraded my apartment's condition from vomit-inducing to simply nauseating, so that's good. More cleaning to be done, though. I'm such a slob.

      I kept wondering why nothing was working last night, and I had hoped it was my DSL just being fruity for a few hours. But it turns out to be  urlLink much more widespread  than that, so I feel better. USD's dumbass techs have let the email server crash, which isn't that big a deal since I only get mail from people around here, and since they can't send mail either... not missing much!  The NFL is all over the place this weekend, so maybe I'll find my way downtown to gawk and such. I also have to finish cleaning this hellhole if people are going to come over for The Game tomorrow. Because right now, yikes.  First: breakfast and Kim Possible on ABC. It's funnier than most cartoons, I tell you what.  Or maybe I'm just a sucker for redheads. ;-)

      Is anybody ever really  happy  with their lives? I mean, besides overall happy, which I'm assuming some people have, isn't there always something that's keeping you on your toes? Even if you have a lot of great things, you might not have a good job/a good family/a good significant other/any friends or a combination that keeps people from being totally at peace.  But in those few moments when we achieve all our personal goals, don't we just get complacent? Perhaps humans actually need some turmoil - if you have great friends, a great spouse, great kids, a kick-ass job, and a loving family... I don't know how long the euphoria from that would last. Maybe those people are the ones who are closet axe-murderers or child porn makers or other vile things.  I just wonder whether everyone shouldn't just try and  live  or something. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. It just seems like everybody's got something that ain't goin' right, but I don't think that most people would say they're UNhappy.  Just not ecstatic.

      I've decided that I'm not sure I can focus on one thing at a time very well. I don't mean on a small scale (like a book) but in the big picture, like "law school" or "a social life" or "a part time job" or whathaveyou. Even though I've decided that my social life should (and pretty much is) taking a back seat to law school, that's maybe 25% my doing and 75% just-the-way-it-is. I'd like to take credit for being focused, but the truth is that in its spare moments, my mind is concentrating on everything BUT law school.   So why can't I just focus? I don't even WANT a social life at this point, but I can't stop my stupid brain from thinking about it. Perhaps it's simply a matter of discipline, of denying myself the social contacts that keep those thoughts alive. I don't go out much as it is, but maybe it's time I completely shut down that part of my brain.  On the other hand, who likes a guy who cares about nothing but his work? Answer: nobody. And I don't mean that in a "I want to be liked way" but more in a "I want to be happy with myself" way, and I'm pretty sure I'd get really sick of me like that.   I think I have a lot to sort out about myself these days. Trying to figure out just how much of my personality is (and should be) devoted to hard work and life goals, and how much is devoted to living life to the fullest right now. Because as I see it, the two aren't coexisting very well.  Also I'm out of milk. I hate that. And I'll be damned if I'm going out again tonight. It's already 5:30 and I'm exhausted.

      Working on the old resume. It's kind of scary to see what most of the other people around here have on theirs, and then compare it to mine. My activities/honors are pretty sparse, my work experience boils down to Fight Crime and that's pretty much it. If I don't get some good grades or something to boost this bad boy, I may never be employed again. At least not in a legal capacity - there's always fry cook at Carl's Jr.!   I didn't collapse completely (see last post) but I did go get Taco Bell, thereby defeating the purpose of working out. ;-) Well maybe not completely, but I was really hungry for some tacos, man. I'm gonna mail the extra taco (I always have one) to Raf.  I'm considering thinking about maybe possibly going forward on signing up to go abroad this summer. I don't know where, exactly, but I'm not sure when I'd have another opportunity like this. Gotta decide by the end of next week! Yikes. With possible jobs, summer school, and abroadness, I've got alot on my mind these days. Not to mention all the other stuff.

       urlLink The new Gabocorp.  I don't really know what this is for (Nike?) but it's pretty entertaining stuff. If you're easily entertained like me, that is.  More later if I haven't collapsed completely. Note to self: you may think 30 minutes on the bike is easy while you're doing it, but later on you're gonna want to kick your stupid ass for thinking that.

      Okay so I'm watching the "new" Meet My Folks thing on NBC. I say new because it used to be on, like last year or something, and it was far more entertaining. Now, instead of 3 "potentials" and 1 other person, they start with 8 or so. And it goes over 2 days, eliminating them all.  So anyway, this time it's 1 guy and 8 girls, which is fine, except all the girls are pretty much morons. When I saw it last time, they weren't all that superficial plastic-ish type, some seemed to have an actual brain. Now, it's like watching the Bachelor or TRL or something. Not that it wasn't high culture to begin with, but I liked the element of truth (the parents decide everything, not the idiot who is the center of attention) that the show contained. That's pretty much wiped out now. And the guy who's in the middle of it all is a moron. Argh! I hate him so much!!! Sigh. And don't get me started on the polygraph. You can't put a person under huge stress on a poly and expect accurate results. These poor girls are being asked hugely personal questions by people that they're trying to impress, and we're supposed to expect that their responses are valid?  Hell no. The freaky sex chick on this one looks alot like Jason's friend Rochelle. Except Rochelle was more attractive.  So there's my rant against this particular show. Most reality shows annoy me in general, because the people who are on them are complete tools. Not that I wouldn't be on one, but if I was it would never air because it'd be the most boring episode of whatever the hell show it was.  Real World San Diego: "Sam we need to have a house meeting."  "Later, I'm playing GTA3."  "Sam, that's all you ever do. Nobody even knows you're on this show."  "You're blocking the screen."  Today was boring, although I did decide to have a get together for the Superbowl. Just study group and a couple others - obviously it has to be small, given that my apartment is only big enough to hold 1 person comfortably. And "comfortably" is a stretch. Found out that grades won't be out until Jan. 27, which sucks but I'm in no hurry to see my little illusions of intelligence shattered. Actually, I don't care that much about myself, but I know some people don't have enough faith in themselves already, and some mediocre grades could really put a depressing mood on things. The sad part is, if someone gets poor grades they're just going to be because 1st semester is hard on  everyone , I seriously doubt it will be a true reflection of anyone's actual law abilities.  Alright I'm done for the night. I should think about reading some Contracts... except that I'm not going to, since I know I won't be called on. See what happens when you become to predictable in who you call on? The slackers slack. ;-)

      Yay for MLK. Yay for not having class today, too. Still have to do a bunch of reading, and work out, but I'm in a better mood today than I have been recently so hopefully it will be easier to concentrate on other things.  I don't have much else to talk about right now; last night was a good step towards everyone feeling better about everything. I'm not an idiot, I know it will take lots of time, but now I can believe that there's a better chance that it will turn out well in the end.  Short post!  Didn't watch the Golden Globes last night, mostly because I don't care that much, and since going to the beach on Saturday was pretty much the most interesting thing about the weekend, I'll just stop talking now.

      Something! It was so nice out today (even in San Diego, January can be harsh and uncooperative) I actually went to the beach by myself for the first time. I'd been meaning to, since pretty much everyone I know says "you don't go to the beach???" in wildly incredulous tones. Now I can say yes, yes I do, and I am the pastiest corpse-like person for miles. But that's okay, it was on the chilly side anyhow so I kept the old t-shirt on and just read some Civil Procedure for a couple hours.  It really wasn't all that eventful, now that I think about it, but it was a mental event in that I drove all the way out there and such. Anyone who knows me (and you know me pretty well if you know about this here blog) knows I'm not a very outgoing chap, so I was pretty proud of myself for going.  Plus, I didn't die, so maybe I'll do it again someday.  Then when I got back I had a nice email from a law school friend of mine telling me to go outside and try not to mope too much. That's the kind of thing that brightens your day - unexpected messages that wish you well.  Oh, and just to stick it to ya'll on other coasts, it was about 80 degrees and sunny today. That is unusual, even for San Diego, so no climate-related promises when folks visit.

      Well here I am at the brink of a three-day weekend, but I'm not at all excited about that prospect. Three days by one's self is along time, especially right now. But pretty much everyone I know out here is out of town or otherwise occupied. It's not that big a deal, I figure I'll get reacquainted with my old friend Diablo or something. I'm planning on going out to a park of some kind, maybe doing some mini-hiking or just sitting and thinking. Lots to ponder these days, I suppose.  Classes aren't nearly as exhausting as they were at the beginning of last semester, and without Criminal Law (one semester and you're done!), it seems downright easy right now. But that will change, of course; I don't have a backlog of work yet. I'm probably going to do some work study, if they'll let me, to raise some money to pay off my monstrous credit card bill. Boy does that thing grow fast.   Don't expect too many updates this weekend, unless I actually do find something entertaining to do. There's only one thing more depressing than having nothing to do for three days, and that's writing about how you had nothing to do for three days. ;-)  Amended note (not a new post because I said no new posts!): I do still have most of Season 3 Buffy to watch on DVD. So don't cry for me, Argentina.

      It's basically true that unless they become a real bastard or something, you never stop loving someone. Fortunately for me, I'm a real bastard so I'm pretty sure that my own "string of broken hearts" will in reality be a "string of really pissed off women". But you can love someone and know that they don't belong in your life right now, and it's one of the hardest things to admit. Someone smart recently told me: "Meeting the right girl is only half the battle. Meeting her at the right time will complete the picture.  Meeting her at the wrong time only ends in the pain of what might have been."  People think that if you try hard enough, or want it bad enough, you can create the "right time" but that's not true. And now I know exactly what that feels like, so if anyone ever has any questions or wonders if that's whats happening in their relationships, just ask me. I'll give you a gut-wrenching description of how it feels to be at the wrong time.

      Creepy song of the day: Mad World, I think originally by Tears for Fears but the version on the Donnie Darko soundtrack is the one I'm familiar with. I don't really know if they're different or not, but I downloaded it the other day and it's simple and creepy and quite pretty, in my opinion.   But then, so was Donnie Darko. Good movie, which I'm gonna have to see again soon man.   Okay yeah the original is pretty weird too, faster and more 80's synth pop. Which is what you'd expect from Tears for Fears. Get the one by Gary Jules, it's better.  Also listening to: Hallelujah by Rufus Wainwright (I know), that strip club techno music by Darude (Sandstorm?), Sinnerman by Nina Simone and whatever's on the radio.  Yeah I don't have time for music appreciation much anymore.

      Well, one day of classes down, 3.4 gagillion to go. Property was the same as always, as if the classroom was frozen on the last day and then thawed at 9am this morning. Strange. We were allowed to switch seats, if we wanted, but nobody did and our professor thought we were weird. So she sent around the seating chart again and it's the exact same as last time.  Contracts was different, there was some good fluctuation and though I still sit in the front row, I'm next to Jaime and Cindy so that's more fun. Tomorrow is Civ Pro and Torts, which will be interesting. Now that everyone knows we can change seats.  It's an interesting phenomenon to see where people sit, because unless they have actual problems with where they are, they won't move.  Overall it's strange to be back in school, but also very familiar. Hope I can get back into it easily. Got my financial aid "refund" today which is cool, that should make things a little less tight for, oh, a month. Then it's back to being poor. Also found out that grades don't make an appearance until almost the end of January, which is both good and bad. I'm anxious to know, but as my Contracts professor said, "This way the honeymoon can last a little longer."  I'm so hungry I could kill a man just to watch him die. Maybe I'll go get some food.

      I just read Adam's blog literally 4 minutes after he posted it, I think. I think.  I'm not stalking, I swear, it was just a coincidence but still, weird.  Big day tomorrow - first day of semester numero dos, classes are all the same (except no Crim Law, boohoo and yay) but in different places so oh boy, have to pick new seats probably. There's something about picking seats in class that is so... nerve-wracking, at least to me. Maybe that's a sign of wussiness or something, and maybe it's just a sign of my own hypersensitivity about things. I should just wing it, but since it's an early (9am being early in these parts) class I probably won't see anyone I know before I get to the room. So it's flying solo and hoping I either a) see someone when I get to class or b) someone sits by me after I sit down.  I think the best course of action is to STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. It's not like I don't have a billion other things on my mind right now (see last post). I'm piling more onto a mind that wasn't up to code in the first place, to paraphrase... well something.   On the plus side, I now own yet another bag, which brings my personal non-suitcase bag count to 4. Yikes. Only 2 are really serviceable though, and one of those is a mere laptop bag that shan't be used much. Nay, it shan't! Also on the plus side, I've finished my property homework (first Official Homework of 2003) for tonight, and it wasn't that hard. I even took some notes on the new laptop, in case I get the urge to use it tomorrow in class. Well, I will use it, I'm sure, because otherwise it's just a very expensive weight in my backpack.  Hungry now. Must find either fast food or fridge goodies.

      Well okay, 2 days later. But I'm busy!  Sort of. There isn't much more to tell about Vegas, so maybe I'll just consider that topic closed. Nothing suitable for an all-access PG-13 blog, that is. ;-)  Today, I went by campus to get Monday's assignments, and of course there's nothing up there for Contracts. Smith is a great professor, but he slacks a little on punctual reading assignments, and thus freaks out everyone who's up to bat (read: people who are next on the list to talk in class).  Also I went to Albertson's for the Official Inaugural San Diego Grocery Trip - 2003 Edition. Spent nearly $50 of birthday money (thanks Dad!) there but am better stocked with all the staples (staples = dutch apple pie, celery sticks, coke, etc...).  On some other notes, I'm feeling pretty weird about things right now. Things in general, that is. My trip home was great, fantastic really, because I got to see everyone that I could have possibly seen, though not all of them perhaps as much as I would have liked. However, things seemed off somehow, like the world had moved on and I had been frozen in time. Actually, that makes perfect sense, as my West Coast Life and my East Coast Life are almost exclusively unrelated. So going back "home" was more like visiting old friends, and coming back to "school" was more like going back where I belong.   Not that I fit in here in California just yet - although today was my first official Real Workout Day (not pushups/situps, but actual bike/weights) so I am now more like the rest of the psychotically fit people in the area, or at least I hope to be in a few weeks/months. I plan on (hope to) stick to it 5 days a week until the end of January, and if I can see any improvement then I will consider it a success. That's 3 whole weeks away, so damn if something shouldn't start tightening up or disappearing.  Anyway, the truth of the matter is being out here is starting to feel like what's right, and while normally that wouldn't be a problem, there is a certain someone whom I hoped would make the big move out here. But now that I've seen her in her element, with an apartment, car (despite it's lame ass name ;-) and friends back in DC, I am beginning to doubt that plan. She has a life there, and I have one here, and although "ever the two shall meet" is a nice sentiment, it seems less likely every day. Perhaps things shouldn't be disrupted. She has 1,000 reasons to stay, but only 1 reason to move.  But if she doesn't, then... well that thought makes me supremely sad. But it's beginning to seem like an inevitable sad, like when you and an good friend from college part ways at graduation. Maybe that feeling in itself means something.    For now, I shall plug away and see how these thoughts sort themselves out. Perhaps it is merely Back to School jitters, or my stupid brain working overtime during a period of low stimulation. One thing I have learned in my 25 years is that my brain comes to conclusions and then reverses itself pretty quickly - I know now not to act on those conclusions until they've proven their staying power. But I love that I can talk to her about them and she doesn't get all freaked out by my bizarre confessions. How can you love someone so deeply, yet see storm clouds gathering on the horizon?

      Just back from Vegas 2.  Or should that be Vegas^2?  Whatever. Either way, I'm back in SD and Vegas was a blast. New things I've learned: 1. Go to Vegas during the week. The crowds are gone and it's much easier to eat in nice places or to chill in any of the 4,203,294 bars. 2. Go with girls. They get let in everywhere, and they can get drinks way faster.  3. Go when the Adult Video News people are having a convention. Porn stars everywhere!  But damn if porn stars don't look kinda nasty up close. It's like looking at a Monet from an inch away - you really can't see what the fuss is about.  Anyway, more later when I've gotten some food and maybe some rest in me. There wasn't much more that happened, actually. We ate at nice places, went to Rumjungle in Mandalay Bay and stared (noticed! glanced, I mean!) at the chicks dancing in bikinis. I didn't lose much, and actually won like $25 and then $27 at slots, on just a couple of quarters. Overall I am probably down about $25 but it was worth it.  Wait didn't I say more later?  I'm gonna stick to that.

      Back in San Diego, which is nice especially considering that on the first day back, it snowed 4 inches in DC and it was nearly 80 degrees here. Go west coast!  ;-)  And tomorrow I'm off to Vegas with the law school gang, which should be a grand old time. I have no money, really, but that's okay because I can just watch everyone else gamble. Right?  They like that in Vegas, right?  Hmmm.  Also finished Medal of Honor: Spearhead, which took approximately 18 seconds to complete.  Boo to short games!  It was fun, though, I'll give it that, although not that big a departure from the game on which it was expanding. A good distraction for a few hours, though. Spent the rest of my back-to-San-Diego time watching the very long and very enhanced Fellowship of the Ring DVD I got for the old b'day. It's very entertaining, with the additional scenes, and for the first time I find many of the extra documentaries actually interesting.  That's a first for most DVDs, which have extras that are about as entertaining as watching paint dry. And not that nice latex stuff, either, the boring oil-based crap.   Okay I have to find some food for tonight. Then pack a small bag for the Vegas baby Vegas!

      Well I'm two and a half decades old now, which is pretty weird but not as weird as you might think.  I've been preparing to be 25 for more than a year, so now that I finally am, it's not that big a deal. Official Twenty-Five Numbers: 188 lbs., still 6'2", still have all my fingers and toes (20, for those in our backwards states who might wonder how many that actually is).  My horoscope ("so you were born on Jan. 3, eh? well...") said that I was funny and more sensitive than most people know. That's debatable, but it  really  took a weird turn when it said Sagittarius and Gemini would play major roles in my life. I honestly can't think of ONE person that has a birthday in that range. Well I take that back, some chick in my class at school is a Sagittarius (I remember people saying "happy birthday" during our Torts final) and I'm pretty sure a guy I worked with at  urlLink Fight Crime  was born on Dec. 7 (day that will live in infamy).    Anyway, I gotta think of someplace to drag people tonight, to celebrate 25 but also in recognition of my last night on the eastern seaboard. I miss CA, if you can believe that, but mostly because all my stuff is there. Okay, also the weather, but that was pretty crappy when I left (50 degrees and raining. Boo!) so it's not like I'm filled with longing for THAT stuff right now.  On a sad note, I just read that Blockbuster got rid of thousands of old, working VHS movies (which apparently it didn't have room for) NOT by selling them, or even giving them away, but by  throwing them out .  WTF?  "Dear Satan, I can't think of any ways to make America hate corporate-types any more, any suggestions?  Love, Viacom."    Also, I was forced to pick up all of MS Office because I wanted Excel, and guess how much Excel costs by itself?  $350 that's how much. Sam, you ask, how much does all of Office cost, with a student discount that the cashier didn't even check?  $150 that's how much. Microsoft is back on my shitlist - I didn't want PowerPoint or Outlook and yet I have to have them now because the bastards that run that stupid company don't see any utility in offering just Excel to poor students. Should have cost me between $50 and $75, tops.   Shower time!  Yes it's 1:30. But in California it's only 10:30 so I'm not that lazy if you think about it. Think hard.

      The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen of the United States. (U.S. Const. amend. IV.) These rights, like many others, can be waived and consent to search can be granted. The consent to search a residence, however, can only be given by a person with actual or apparent authority to consent. The case at hand concerns the ability of a third party to consent to a search when, although the third party lacked actual authority, apparent authority to consent existed.

      Dad's coming to town! He called this morning to let me know, some kind of conference or something on Sunday and Monday.  Now I wish I didn't have that damn argument paper to write, but them's the breaks. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it today and tomorrow; Dad comes in tomorrow night, and then if I've done enough work Sunday will be more open. Still gotta read Property at some point, but after that.   I've always had serious procrastination problems, but when faced with big projects (like writing a paper) it gets even worse. You'd think that the sheer amount of work would force me to get started sooner, but alas, that's not how my brain works. The key has been to set time limits - I will start work on the paper by 1:30 this afternoon, and since I have nothing to do tonight I can work for 12 hours straight if need be. I won't, but it's encouraging to know that I  could .   Weather's still kinda nasty. I hope it clears up before the East Coasters arrive, but the news keeps saying "sometimes people forget that March and April are San Diego's rainiest time of year." Of course, compared to the 0.002 inches of rain we normally receive, that might not be all that threatening.  urlLink  Weather.com  says that it will warm up by the end of next week, though. 67 degrees!

      I'm really way to neurotic for any woman to ever put up with me for more than a few weeks, at least in a relationship. I have no idea how Kim did it; maybe I wasn't neurotic in the beginning or something, and so when I did go insane it was already well into the 'ship. Frankly, if I met someone like me (well, except female) I'd probably lose my mind after 1 week of dating.  Perhaps the key is to not date anybody you actually care about. That way, you don't get neurotic because you don't worry very much because you don't care. That doesn't seem very interesting, though. Maybe that's why people meet first and then fall in love, instead of falling in love and then getting together. Because if you think about it, falling in love first puts everything right up at the beginning. There's all this emotion running rampant, and you're trying to get a relationship off the ground at the same time. Plus, doing it that way makes the pressure to succeed so much greater. On the other hand, if you barely know the person and just started going out because they seemed interesting, there's plenty of time to endear yourself before all those pain in the ass neuroses make their entrance. Maybe that's how Kim put up with me - we weren't in love right from the get-go. And only after we actually started caring about each other did it become worthwhile to put up with all the crap we gave each other. So, in conclusion, no more dating friends. I like my friends too much to put any of them through that.  I really don't know why reading about interpleading and subrogation of third-party claims led to this. Me + Law = strange relationship, man.

      Okay, so that personality test was not a hit with anyone. Maybe it's NOT accurate, I'm hardly a psychologist. It told me fairly positive things, and in those categories that I scored "Below Average" I was in agreement.   For those who are taking the test and getting poor results, I would make two disclaimers: 1. Your state of mind when filling out those little rankings is pretty key. If you're in, say, a horrible mood then yeah the test will reflect that. Take it again when you're cheerful and see if the results come out differently. 2. Make sure you read the responses carefully - the test details only mention a couple of categories (i.e. "People who score Above Average are...") - but not specifically the category you may have fallen into.  I think "negative perfectionism" isn't all that bad anyway. Nobody likes cocky people. Overall these tests are like horoscopes; you see what you want to see, pick out the parts that seem to coincide with your own self-image, and toss out the rest. The results aren't meant to be a laundry list of specific personal problems; just  possible  problems that could  someday  arise.  In other news, interesting discussions with the kids at lunch about jealousy and what it means to a relationship. I was always of the opinion that jealousy reared its ugly head when deeper emotions came into play; nobody cares that much when someone you barely like acts to provoke jealousy. But perhaps jealousy is just a tool that people use to mask their true feelings about their own inadequacies and fears. I've never known anyone to be jealous of anything I do, simply because there aren't that many people who give a rat's ass about what I do. So it's hard for me to approach it with both experiences in mind (being jealous and being the subject of jealousy), but I still think that it's a natural emotion that shouldn't be completely crapped on. Only when it's used to hurt, or to destroy trust, or to otherwise compromise a perfectly healthy relationship does jealousy become harmful.  Sermonizing off. I heard about Mr. Roger's death in Adam's blog, which is weird. I guess I checked the blogs before I even went to the Post, which is kind of scary.

      Arlington County finally sent me a tax bill. They're withholding part of my state tax refund until I pay. The weird part is, they're withholding more than enough to pay the bill (a whopping $28), but what they want me to do is send them a check and then they'll send me one right back. Government efficiency at its finest!

       urlLink Who are you?  This online personality test is unlike most others on the web, i.e. it's very technical in nature and probably far more accurate than "HOW KEWL R U?!?" at The Spark or something.  Not that I don't love the Spark, I'm just saying.  Anyway, if you can decipher the fairly complex results (be sure to hit the Info button at the bottom of the first results page) you might find that it does a pretty good job of nailing strengths and weaknesses. Hell, it told me I have self-esteem difficulties, and anybody who knows me probably knows that's my biggest personal issue. Besides all the heroin. I use humor as a defense mechanism. ;-)  My biggest fear these days is that I'm manic depressive, except perhaps it's a very mild case. Some days I'm just like "bring it on world!! yeah!" and then the very next day I feel like it's all a bunch of crap. That could also be just the way law school works, so I'm not too worried.  While I'm (not) on the subject, here's a weird thing: people only tell me about the bad parts of their lives. Actually that might not just be me, maybe it's general human nature. But I've noticed that alot of the opinions I have of other people are improperly slanted towards the negative. I don't mean people I actually  know , but more like people they tell me about. Friends, roommates, boyfriends, girlfriends, parents - everyone complains, I suppose that's natural. But then people get surprised when I have a slightly negative opinion, like it came out of nowhere.  I saw this problem with Kim and her mom a few times. She'd tell me all that bad, horrible, mean crap that her mom does, and then she'd be surprised at how much I disliked her mom. But when all you hear about is the bad stuff, how are you supposed to form a full opinion? Granted, after I met her mom and such, my antipathy slacked off, but it's an awkward position to be in, meeting someone for the first time and already having a negative opinion.  Currently the same thing goes for Cindy's boyfriend, who by all objective accounts seems like a perfectly nice guy. But since she always seems annoyed or frustrated, or talks about how she's 3 seconds away from dropping him completely, I tend to go that way as well. After all, I don't know him, but I know her, and my natural inclination is to sympathize and support. But now I feel bad because there seems to be a general impression that I dislike him, which is unfair to both of us because we've never even met.  So to conclude, I blame you people for not sharing the happy parts of your relationships with me. If I'm a bitter old man who hates everyone except my close friends, it's all your faults. ;-)  Okay not all, but share a little love sometime!

      Nightly dilemma: I don't want to eat anything I currently own, but it's rainy and crappy out (3rd time this century!) so I don't want to go to Carl's Jr.  My god the choices!!!  In other news, rain sucks. Classes are a pain in my ass. I have to write a huge paper arguing that the FBI's search of a guy's house was legal even though they didn't have a warrant (it's approx. 142,000 times more complicated than that sentence) and even though it's not due until Monday it makes me very nervous.  On other, less academic fronts things are going well. Some recent advice from a friend (something like "just back off") has already started working wonders. And while I still have lots of stuff on my mind (stupid VA DMV, having no job this summer, stupid CA DMV, wanting to move) it's nice to put other things on the back burner and just enjoy them for what they are. If you don't get my drift that's okay, this ain't a therapist's office it's my blog.  :-p

      Saw  urlLink this  article just now - it's a pretty interesting look at why some songs get stuck in our heads, and others never do.  Also features this quote:  "...new research shows that people most frequently plagued by this phenomenon are those with slightly neurotic tendencies, and people who enjoy and listen to music often."  I think I fall into that first category. I know alot of slightly (and more) neurotic people so maybe I'll do a focus group.  Of course now thanks to the article I have "Who Let the Dogs Out" stuck in my head.  Time to remedy that with some Pagliacci.

      I went to the DMV to get a California license (see  urlLink earlier post  for why) and after waiting an hour or so, I hand in my paperwork, and the woman at the desk starts processing.  "Uh oh," she says. "That can't be good," I say.  "For some reason Virginia is reporting that you are ineligible for a license. That means you're either wanted for a felony or you have unpaid parking tickets." "Well I'm not a felon," I said. "Also I don't have any unpaid tickets." "You're gonna have to clear that up before we can issue you a license," she says, and then she jumped up and chewed off my nose.  Okay that last part is made up. She didn't actually say anything before she chewed off my nose.  Now I have to harass the DMV in Richmond to get my license cleared, which is a pain because the time change means I have to get up early to do it (they close promptly at 2pm my time, while I'm still in class). I think this may have something to do with my being indicted for tax evasion. But just because I failed to pay a simple car tax (like, $30) I don't think they should reach 3,000 miles and punch me in the balls like this.  I blame this on computers. They would have never known I was a malcontent in my home state if not for the silly Internet. A pox on you, you mechanical monster!

      So much academia accomplished today. I'm still in the library (and have been for about 4 hours now) but I'm done with Contracts, Property and Civil Procedure for the next classes. That makes me good to go up until noon on Tuesday (or even Wed. morning, if you don't count Torts. And since he just called on our row, I don't).  Now I'm just killing time in the library until it's close enough to dinner time for me to go home and stop at McDonald's on the way. Since today my total nutrient intake has been a banana and some M&M's, I'm pretty hungry.  It has been a quiet weekend, and for that I'm glad. Friday night was fun (see below - Trivial Pursuit) and yesterday was pretty uneventful (went shopping, pretended to do some work on my outlines). Slowly but surely I feel like my brain is coming back into focus, and I can put all the weirdness of the past 2 months behind me and concentrate on what's important: women. Haha! Just kidding. I mean school.  Also I played the Splinter Cell demo, which was pretty damn cool. I usually don't like the games where you have to sneak around too much, because alot of it seems arbitrarily difficult, but this one was an exception. Too bad I have neither the free time nor the bling bling to buy the full version, whenever it comes out. Exception: GTA: Vice City, which I heard comes out for the PC in May. Right in time for Finals! Somebody up there wants me to be a janitor.

      The fog, my god the fog!   Yeah it's pretty foggy out. Not a rare occurence in these parts, but it's rare that I have to drive in it (usually I'm not out and about at midnight, I'm asleep). Visibility is so bad you have to get in exit lanes and hope that it's your exit, since you can't read any of the damn signs.   Trivial Pursuit was fun. I did okay but my team lost. Twas a nail-biter, though. Both teams got full pies but the team with 5 people beat the team with 2 people. Well okay, full disclosure: it  was  4 v. 5 but then two of our teammates had to go. And lo that was when the other team managed to get their last pie and the last question. Boo! ;-)   Did anybody else out there know that a big cloud of carbon dioxide came out of a lake and killed approx. 1,600 people in Cameroon one time? Because it did. We guessed "carbon monoxide" and lost. Boy would that suck. "Suffocated by lake gas" is not the best way to go, I'd imagine.  Sleepytime soon. I'm wired from driving back at 80 mph listening to techno. So maybe when that wears off. I don't think I go out to clubs enough, I gotta try and squeeze that in a little more.

      Oy vey what a week. My life is an emotional and academic rollercoaster, man. Sometimes it seems like I'm just treading water in all parts of my life, but of course that's not true because every day I'm one day closer to a law degree. But there are so many unresolved questions, like what the hell am I going to do this summer? Part of me wants a law job, but another part of me doesn't at all. And I'm rapidly running out of time to have a say in the matter, since despite it being February these jobs will be full or unavailable in the next few weeks.  So I try not to think about it too much, and rather just concentrate on classes and other various things. Other various things being nothing because all I do is go to class and then, when not in class, talk to people about class or read about the next class.  Woo.  Tonight is trivial pursuit at Jaime's, though, so that should be a brief distraction from the monotony of my life. Tomorrow is nothing, and sunday it's (wait for it) back to reading and talking about class!    Speaking of class (haha!) I got called on twice this week. In Civil Procedure I did a fair to mediocre job, simply because yet again I was called on to discuss a case that we had read for the LAST class, which meant that I had actually read it approximately a week and a half before. But after a few stumbling blocks I managed to do okay. Then yesterday I was called on in Torts, which isn't a big deal because it's just Torts, but the cool part was I was right and I stuck to my guns even though Ursin kept trying to get me to change my vote (True, when like 3 other people were going with False - it doesn't matter about what). And then he revealed (they love to do this) that actually I was right to stick to my guns because it's both True and False. And my reason for saying True was a good one. So was the reasoning used by the False people, but they were just parroting Cindy who started the False Answer Uprising against me. ;-)  So yeah, laundry time!  It's a beautiful day for Tide and fabric softener, I tell you whut. Adam if you read this send me an email so I can know that you weren't anywhere near that horrible R.I.  urlLink club fire .

      Alright I can only take so much.  urlLink Steely Dan  is one of the greatest artists of all time. Steely Dan can display more talent in one song than pretty much all the other Grammy nominees combined. The one shining moment of artistic clarity in the long and sad history of the Grammy Awards was when they gave Steely D the best album award.  Speaking of music, I find it amusing that the song used in that mLife commercial (it  is  mLife, right?  I can't remember) with the girl and the guy on the bus is Toxic Girl by Kings of Convenience. Yeah, the final verse used in the commercial (She'll talk to you with no else around/But only if you're able to entertain her) seems harmless, but the song is really about unrequited love. It's really pretty depressing - You're waiting in the shadows for a chance/Because you believe at heart that if you can/Show to her what love is all about/She'll change.  The guy and girl in the commercial don't seem to be having a problem of that nature. But maybe their relationship goes deeper than I believed.  Also the song in the car commercial that talks about being young is "Forever Young" by Alphaville. It's kinda pretty. And the Mitsubishi ad with the bald black guy living his life through scenes in a car has music by Telepopmusik (Breathe).   I'm a regular public service, I am.

      So I was trying to order something online, and for some reason it asked me when my driver's license expires.  Why that matters when trying to buy a cell phone from Cingular is beyond me. But I found out that my license expired on the 31st of January! What is that all about? Granted, it's a Virginia license and I'm not in Virginia anymore, but still - I thought those things had 5 year lifespans.  So I've just finished taking the online California DMV test, because for some dumbass reason California doesn't honor other state licenses; they make you take a written test first. I think that's a violation of the Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution (states have to honor each other's laws, sort of) but I don't plan on bringing that up at the DMV. I think I'll pay them a visit on Wednesday or Friday.   Anyway I just found that amusing. Expired license for the last 17 days! Watch me get pulled over tomorrow or something. That'd be hilarious.  I also spent the afternoon playing with online personal ads; I've decided that the Onion, of all places, has the most creative and interesting personals. They have probative questions to answer, and since most of the people there are probably Onion readers, it's automatically a more interesting group. Not that I've put an ad up; but  urlLink check it out.

      So the local news keeps running a promo about a salad chef who's going to be on the show this week.  One of the lines the anchor says is "...and he'll toss YOUR salad, tomorrow at 5!"  Does nobody at the station know what that's slang for? Because that's a little too raunchy to be a purposeful double entendre. It's not like Chris Rock is a fringe comedian that nobody's ever heard of...

      I guess we're all snowed in!  Of course, by "snowed in" I mean it's 68 degrees out.  Brrr!  West Coast reprezentin!  So I have to miss the whale trip today, because I just have too much work to do. That's kind of sad, but at the same time the whales aren't going anywhere. Well, actually they are, they're migrating.  But I'll be here next year at this time as well, so whale on!  Of course they're also going extinct. But probably not by next year. But I have to compile our group property paper into one uberpaper for submission tomorrow, so that's a pain. But everyone has done their part so it's really just a matter of cutting and pasting. Or so I tell myself, having not done any of it yet. Then there's reading and reading and writing and reading to do.   Then, dinner with the parents. Then they attempt to go home to DC tomorrow, which, considering the gobs of snow currently being dumped on the area, isn't exactly a sure thing. I can't imagine BWI will still be closed tomorrow, and even if it is that won't stop them from flying out from  here ; just from Chicago when they connect. :-p  I'm heading back to the library for my marathon sunday session after I get some breakfast/lunch (or as I call it "brunch" - feel free to use the term).  Sometimes I get the feeling that there are people in my life that I'd really like to see more often; the kicker is that some of those people are people I see almost everyday already. Go figure.

      The parents are in town, tomorrow is Valentine's day, I have a paper to write and a moot court exercise to do by Monday. Also it's raining. Still.  And I'm watching "Are You Hot" on ABC because I want my brain to shut down all higher level functions. Whereas "Meet My Folks" has a kernel (albeit a small one) of merit in that there are parents involved, Are You Hot is completely devoid of intelligent life. So no ranting beyond that.  Anyway. The weekend will be busy, but on the upside, maybe that will give me some interesting stuff to put in this here word hole.  Oh yeah!  urlLink Vegas pic!  Not that it's terribly interesting. But look now before Marek wigs out and takes them offline. Note my weird, non-reflective eye. I'm dead inside, apparently. Well, half dead. Also I slouch way to much.

      Yeah so it's raining pretty hard out here on the Left Coast. You'd think we were having earthquakes and tornadoes with locusts in them the way the news reports something as simple as rain. "Oh my god  it's raining  and it might not stop until  tomorrow !"   We're actually supposed to get a couple of inches, which is big news around here and really highlights the poor sewer and runoff systems that most San Diego roads and residential areas have. Since it never rains, and when it does it drops about a quarter inch over 2 days, none of the drainage is very efficient. So now there are big standing puddles of water, and even mild flooding in the valley areas. I live on a hill, sort of, so no worries. Plus I'm on the third floor. Plus I'm not crazy.   In other news, this week is a giant pain in my ass. I have lots of research to do (like everyone else) and I don't really have time for anything else. The people in school who are dating non-law students are all having huge crises, because their significant others are starting to complain about the total lack of free time. I think that's crap, and that if you're going to be with someone you need to accept them for what they are (and by extension, what they have to do). It really goes to the credit of my recent ex that I'm certain she would have been much more accepting than most of my friends' current dates.   The stormy weather (it's really windy, too) outside makes me feel like I'm back home. It upsets the locals, because they're nimrods, but this is what I imagine going to, say, Harvard law in April would be like. There's something very comforting about the library or nasty days like this. Speaking of, I need to get back to work.

      People who don't update their blogs for 11 days annoy me. Because how else will I know what's going on with them?   Talk  to them or something?  Not bloody likely.  I am a social and emotional leper. ;-)  Today was the field trip to the Court of Appeals in downtown SD. We found the only place in the entire city where people regularly wear suits. I call it the Lawyer District. It's like Chinatown, except for less Chinese folk and more lawyers. But maybe that was obvious from what I call it.  Anyway, it was very interesting and enlightening. Chiefly because it proves that to be a successful lawyer, you don't really have to be an orator worthy of McCoy ("they're stonewalling!"). You can just be some schlub with a degree and a law firm - because that's what most of these guys were, with a few exceptions.   One case was a person suing Hilton hotels because they have a service charge for room service that actually refers to no specific service. Another case was a woman who got hit by a cart at Wal-Mart and received about $850 grand (Wal-Mart appealed, obviously). Another was about doctors refusing a gay woman treatment, and the last was a big pain in the ass Contract dispute between the City of San Diego and some construction people who built a tunnel to Tijuana.  All the cases were entertaining, especially the Hilton one which was downright funny. It made me much more interested in actual practice, now that I've seen it in action.  Back to research!

      You know what?  Valentine's Day isn't  all  bad. I mean, overall it's a fairly useless holiday that is primarily for those who are just starting out in relationships. And not even JUST starting out - that's too early. But a few months in, maybe. Everyone else in a relationship shouldn't need a holiday to express how they feel -- if you do, you need to work on that little problem instead of anxiously planning a romantic night simply because the calendar tells you to.  That being said, there's nothing wrong with acknowledging V-Day in a minor way. Big grand gestures are overrated. Oh, and don't worry about the 49% of the population that happens to be male; we don't care what you do on V-Day, as long as you like whatever we do. Seriously. Don't put much thought into a guy's Valentine's Day gift/card/whatever, because for the most part we could care less.  I've tried the big (well, at the time they were big) gestures, but they've never worked out correctly. Surprises, flowers, whatever - never seemed to get the reaction I was hoping for. So really, that makes the entire day a big wash. I'll probably be spending the bulk of this year's February 14 with my parents, which sounds sad but since I honestly don't give a rat's ass about the holiday, I'm not going to worry about it. ... I spent a good portion of the day in the library today, reading 3 classes' worth of homework. Now I'm prepared all the way through noon on Tuesday, which leaves me feeling accomplished but bored. Luckily I still have laundry to do!

      So the guvmint is going to give me back all the Federal taxes I paid last year, thanks to something called the "Hope Scholarship Tax Credit" which gives up to $1500 in tax credits. Since I only worked for about 8 months last year, my total taxes withheld were almost exactly that.  And now, big fat check for Sam! The tax credit is from an act passed in 1997, and I'm going to thank whatever administration was in charge at that time. Hmmm, which one was that again? Oh yeah, the one that wasn't trying to destroy both our economy and the world in 4 short years.  In other news, I'm going to a Court of Appeals session on Monday, so that will be cool. Then on Wednesday some lawyers are going to come in and scare the crap out of us by describing how hard it is to get a good enough job to pay off your student loans.  Yay!  The then 'rents are coming in on Thursday, Friday is Valentine's Day (thought that won't have any significant impact on  my  life) and Saturday is whale watching. Or maybe Sunday, I don't remember.    Brief rundowns of my week are both fun  and  informative!

      Yeah I got nothin right now. No updates = nothing new. The parents are coming into town next weekend, which will be nice. But then, having anything to do is nice.   I'm working on my resume and such for this summer, but I'm not so sure I'll get anything. Backup plan: summer classes and a part-time job of some kind. Backup-backup plan: abroad somewhere. Backup-backup-backup plan: beach bum.  Right now I'm leaning towards the third. ;-)  I promise to be more interesting in the future, so that there will be more to talk about. I have lots of Oral Argument work to do, so maybe some of that will be fun. Except that I have to say "Oral Argument" a whole lot, which sounds dirty.

      Met some B-Section law students last night at a party. Marek's connection and all. They were very nice, but the whole experience left me feeling sort of weird, like they were alternate-universe law students. It's hard to explain, but overall they were pretty cool.  We watched the Matrix, and I hadn't seen it in forever so yay to that.  Also our host had the same Ikea black futon thing that I have, but hers was put together, um, correctly. So I came back and now my couch looks much cooler and far less ghetto. Than it did before.   Now I'm off to the library to read some Property and do some research for the oral argument project. Good times (he said sarcastically)!

      Well here's a sad day for space exploration. The more I think about it, though, the more it seems apparent that this isn't terrbly surprising. It's sad, horribly sad, but I read somewhere once that because of the complicated nature of spaceflight, odds are 1 in 75 that something will go wrong. That's staggeringly high when you consider that "something going wrong" is pretty much equal to death for everyone. There's no "we barely survived" at 13,000 mph. Thus, as it has been reported, the astronauts all know about the bad odds when they go into this, and I look at it as a job akin to voluntarily joining one of the armed forces. Yes, it's sad when they die too, but you know what? It's part of the job. I don't mean for that to sound as cold as perhaps it does, because I really and truly am sad at both the loss of life and the implications this may have for stifling future exploration. But I don't think the astronauts themselves would be as sad as the public, since they know the risks, and the reward - travelling beyond our planet - is worth it. That's courageous and worthy of our respect and admiration.   I'm glad it's not terrorists, but now that it's all been established I don't want to watch the news anymore. MTV and the Travel Channel today, because everything the news reports from this point on will be crappy conjecture; it will take NASA & Co. months to determine the precise causes of the accident, so Brian Williams and company can just sit on it for a while. They won't because that's not how news goes these days, but it's frustrating to see so much non-news being reported.  Anyway, back to outlining for Property. I think I'm going to a Chinese New Year party tonight, which should be cool or very awkward since I don't know anybody.  Once more into the breach!

      Whew.  Got tired of my blog format, and I think it has been ages since I changed it. So ta-da, another new one. I spent like 30 minutes customizing it, mostly because I'm a huge dork and sometimes I miss doing stuff with HTML and scripting and such. So, -10 cool points for me. As soon as I stumble across a page with a better background color, I'll be changing this one. I'm also thinking of shelling out the like, $15 to get the stupid banner removed from the top of the page, because hey why not. I hate banner ads and it disrupts the nice template that some guy made and shared with blogspot.   Still hot, in case you were wondering. Not 85-hot, but hot nonetheless. I've got laundry to do so I think I might do it and then wait by the pool while it runs.   It's weird to think (and then find out) that people are talking about you. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but just the fact that somebody is talking to somebody else and my name is mentioned astonishes me. I've generally been of the opinion that people forget I exist as soon as I'm out of sight (and sometimes even when I'm not), which is maybe a bit unlikely but it keeps me from getting a big ego or something. When you don't think anyone remembers you, it's easier to not get pissed when they actually don't remember you.  No more details because it's just too nice outside. Oh and  urlLink hooray for opening day!  Congratulations to the Tigers on another fine start. Sigh. I need to adopt a new, less sucktastic team. The Cubs are crushing the Mets right now, 15-2, and the lame-ass Expos smacked Atlanta around 10-2 earlier in the day.  Look at that, no need for ESPN, you can just read my blog.

      Well the practice argument went fine. She said I spoke a little too quickly (of course) but that my style was conversational and very easy to follow. I made some minor errors in word usage ("reasonability" is not "reasonableness" under the Fourth Amendment, I guess) but overall I'm pretty pleased with how it all went down.  The rest of yesterday was a very interesting series of events which I'm not going to get into here, suffice to say it was fun.   Boy howdy is it hot out in these parts. Powerful hot!

      Practice oral argument today!  I shouldn't be nervous, after all it's ungraded and only in front of my teacher and her TA's. But still, I plan on going in a firey ball of crap.  Details to be posted here in excruciating detail!  ;-)  But hopefully after that is taken care of I can breathe easy for a few days. The next big thing is the Actual Oral Argument (in front of Judges Who Will Scare me to Death) but then it's all classes until finals. And right now that seems almost comforting.  Weather today: 81 friggin degrees!  And forecast says  88  for the whole weekend. If you're not familiar with San Diego's usual climate, that's oh, 15 degrees higher than normal.  I think I'm going to say "Hot enough for ya!?!?" a whole lot, which is usually really annoying. And I will be no exception.

      There seems to be a lot of conflicting opinions regarding some of my previous posts. I feel I should clarify something, so listen closely:  THIS IS  MY  BLOG.  I can say what I want, when I want, about whatever I want. If I really wanted it to be "to" someone in particular, I know how to work the email program just fine. I use it all the time, actually.  But this blog is my thoughts on a huge variety of topics, some of which may be more personal to me and some of which are global in nature. But it's always my call, and just like every other pseudo-publication (or just publication in general) you don't have to read it if you're not happy with what it says.  About politics, about relationships, about law school.   But if you ARE going to read it, then you need to accept a few things: 1.  Nothing  I write is intended for one person, unless I specifically say so in the blog. Example: "Jason, you suck."  ;-) 2. I tend to rant sometimes, and later I change my mind. This may or may not be reflected in the blog, depending on whether I feel like putting my thoughts down in electrons at the moment. 3. Everybody is entitled to their opinion; this means you can hate me and my blog. It doesn't mean I'm going to apologize or change anything I write.  4. Apparently it does   mean I will defend myself, because, well, I just did. Or tried to.

       urlLink Heads up, Washingtonians.  Georgetown: exploding manholes and sinking streets since 1732.   I got a haircut today in celebration of... well of being done with my damn paper, I suppose. Now I have to work out a script-ish thing for tomorrow's practice oral argument.  But that should be much easier because 1) it's practice and 2) talking is easier than writing.  This week has been bloody hell, man. In the library for 5 hours last night (capping off a full day of work, mind you). And of course I have to try and squeeze in reading for all my other classes AROUND the oral argument and brief writing stuff.   On the other hand, however, the weather is becoming quite spectacular. There's supposed to be a Santa Ana this weekend (hot wind from the mountains) which will push the temperature past 75 and dry the whole place out. Not that drying out is good, but hot weather isn't too bad. At least for the weekend. :)  And by the way, my semi-complaint about "all I ever do is write" didn't mean people shouldn't write me. I LIKE writing emails and this blog. It wasn't an attempt to get you all to shun me. I don't like being shunned. I get enough of that from so-and-so and whats-her-name. ;)

      It seems like between emails, my argument paper, and this blog, I write a LOT of crap these days. Not that I'd really call my paper "writing" - it's more like an exercise in fact regurgitation. And my emails are basically stream-of-consciousness crap. This blog ain't much different, though I usually try to start every post with a general theme. Otherwise it's all ellipses and random thoughts and run-on sentences.  Well okay, run-on sentences I have anyway. But I don't do the "..." thing too much, which I think is best for a blog. Reading... stuff like this... just makes me want to... I dunno... shake the person until their head snaps off. ;-)  Blog posts about blog posting are weird. And now it's a blog post on the topic of blog posting about blog posts. I'd better stop before the universe caves in on itself.

      Just FYI, I decided to remove one of my earlier posts because it came across much harsher than I had originally intended. Or maybe I had intended harshness, but now I don't feel the same way. Also, it would appear to the layreader that it was directed towards one specific person in particular, when in fact it wasn't. Although it had it's origins in specific places, I really meant it as more of a general opinion-commentary thing, not a prescription for any one person to follow. So bam! Gone!  Such is the power of self-publishing.   It's amazingly beautiful here today. Check out the weather if you don't believe me - 70+ degrees, sunny. Not that that's horribly unusual for San Diego, but compared to yesterday's crapapalooza it's nice. I got home too late to take advantage, however, since the sun has now moved far enough west to put the pool in shade. Still nice to be out on days like this though. :)  Also makes for a better mood, so no weird ranting today.  If you haven't read  urlLink The Onion  yet this week you should get on that. Funny stuff, I tell you whut. I especially enjoyed the Point-Counter Point. It reminds me of arguing with Republicans. :)

      So what do you do when someone you care about is unhappy?  You help them in whatever way you can. But what do you when their unhappiness is largely (though not entirely) as a result of things that you did?  That's a stumper. You can't fix it, you can't apologize enough, you basically can't do anything except step out of the action for awhile, and hope that they figure out how to fix it themselves. It's frustrating to no end, to know that it's not just that you CHOOSE not to do something to help, but that literally there is nothing in the world that you yourself can do that would provide any comfort. Perhaps that's not entirely your fault, though - if someone is in pain because of something you did, but they refuse to help themselves and instead just decide that the universe is against them, there's really nothing you can do except feel bad and then move on. People can't get better if they don't allow themselves to do so.  Maybe everyone just has bad days. It sure seems like there's a general funk in the air these days - and not the good, P-Funk kind. More like a man-is-this-all-there-is kind of thing. I see it in my friends both here and back home, to varying degrees. I can see where the law school people get it, because I'm in that. And others may be having job troubles or relationship problems (or both), or be like me where you have all 3 in a big mixed bag of crap. But maybe it's just the "spring gloom" or something. Winter is pretty much finished, but the warmth of summer isn't here and even in San Diego the days can be pretty gloomy.   Or maybe it's just Monday, which at last count was hated by approximately every human being on the planet.

      I watched my first full episode of "Gilmore Girls" tonight, mostly because it was on and nothing else was. I must say, if I were a girl I'd watch that show all the time. As it is, I'm already pushing the limits of my own heterosexuality by watching things like Buffy and Friends (and generally ignoring blow-em-up shows like Fastlane, or 24, or Alias), so I have no room for another chick show or else I might grow girl parts or something. But that show is pretty well written - fast and quick, sort of like the dialogue in West Wing and even Buffy at some of its better moments. Sometimes they have such a fast back-and-forth that it seems almost over the top (like, hey I'm the writer and look how many clever sentences I can string together in 8 seconds!) but still. I found it amusing.    Also, I drive a girl's car and know all the words to "Tiny Dancer" so really, if it weren't for my acute sexual preference for girls I'd just throw in the towel and be gay. But then I'd have to work out more and care about fashion. Plus I'd probably have to shave more often, and screw that.  Can you see that I don't want to go read Contracts? The blog just continues and continues! Maybe next I'll go write pointless emails to people.

      There was supposed to be a law school thing tonight, but I have been effectively "stood up" so there goes that. I think I've decided that's one of my pet peeves - people who make plans and then don't keep them AND don't bother to let you know when things change.  Because honestly I don't have a problem with changing plans, I change my mind all the time. But when phonecalls don't get returned, I start to get mad. It's not hard to call and say "Something's come up, I can't make it" and that's it. I always try and keep from getting too angry because you never know what it might be - something really serious, for instance - and I don't want to be angry when it turns out there was a really good reason.  Hrmph. In better news non-law school prospects are looking up, I won't elaborate because there's nothing to elaborate on right now. Suffice to say if law school weren't in my way, maybe I wouldn't have to rely on my flakey law-school friends as my only social outlet.  But, I have a ton of work to do. And that's fine, it's what I signed up for, and I'm still enjoying it and everything, so no worries.

      I'm pretty sure I had a weird ass dream last night, but now that I've woken up I can't quite remember it. I think it involved Kim's family (?) and cats. I REALLY don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean, and now that I can't remember much (I think there was a kitty line-up at some point), I'm not even going to guess.  Yikes.  Off to the library for some quality paper-writing with Hil. Writing papers is such a pain in my ass. It's like law school knows that just having 4 hard classes would be too easy, so just when you think "Man, this workload is tough but I'm managing" they throw on a huge friggin paper to try to break you.   urlLink Clinton Threatens to Drop Da Bomb on Iraq  - an oldie but absolutely relevant goodie, from The Onion.

      Met Marek's parents tonight, in our continuing study-group saga of meeting the folks when they're in town. Mine made the appearance back in February, Jaime's were... earlier than that. Last semester?  I can't believe it was, but now I can't remember. Cindy's are forthcoming, I think. Maybe when she's less stressed out about life.  Anyway, it was fun. Marek's dad is alot like mine, they're both sort of ex-hippie types and such. Of course after that, the similarity is gone but they have similar worldviews, I think. Marek's mom is kind of overshadowed by his dad, but she seems very nice. I can see where alot of Marek's traits come from.  Today was boring. Civ Pro wasn't much to talk about, and then we did like 4 hours of Property studying. Whew! But then dinner was nice, and I'm going to try and relax for the rest of the night and do minimal work. Tomorrow and Sunday are big work days. Though tomorrow night is the Law School Luau thing, so I may go to that. What's a roasted pig between friends? :)  No real comment on the continuing war. I decided that although I agree that the official purpose is a good one (Saddam is a crazy bastard and really should have been taken out years ago) I'm still having trouble getting past Bush's total lack of diplomacy in getting to the place we are now. If and when this war has a productive end (like Saddam's death) then it might help, but until then I'm still livid at how we've pissed off pretty much every person in the world.  Okay that wasn't "no real comment" but since when do I do what I say I'm going to do? ;-)

      I found the best way to watch all this war crap: the BBC, courtesy of CSPAN2. I wish I got the BBC all the time, because man do they do a better job of  actual  reporting. Yay Brits!  Why am I so freaking busy all of a sudden, hmm? I have a massive paper due next Thursday, then a practice argument on Friday, then the real argument (in front of real lawyers, maybe even a real judge) the Friday after that. That may not seem like a lot but preparation for oral arguments is very time consuming. You pretty much have to work without extensive notes, because although it starts as a sort-of speech, the judges interrupt early and often, and wave bye-bye to your outline at that point. But I'm actually sort of excited - I understand the issue, so I say bring it on, judge-man!  All this work is good, it distracts me from the other parts of my life that are lacking (read: social) but I'm starting to feel the tinges of burnout. Fraying at the edges, and so forth. I just wish summer wasn't so full of anxiety (no job! no money! yikes!) so that I could truly look forward to it. I know I can always do summer school, but the last thing someone who's starting to burn out wants to think about is a whole summer full of school.

      Yeah so the local WB actually did air Angel last night. They broke away from covering the complete lack of news at 9 on the dot, and it was one of the best episodes of Angel ever! I love crossovers.  I think maybe that's a bonus of being on the west coast; the prez went to bed at 8pm our time, and Condi went home at the same time. The media eventually got the message: nothing else interesting until tomorrow! Except for NBC, which stubbornly refused to return to regularly scheduled broadcasting and instead had talking heads on the screen all the way until Leno.   In other opinions, I'll say this: I think it's great we're asking/telling the Iraqis to lay down their arms and not fight, because then we don't have to shoot them. But if they do fight, I'm really not going to hold that against them. If someone told OUR military to lay down its arms so that a foreign government could kill or banish or president, I'd... hmm. That's tougher than I thought. But really, we're all supposed to "join together in times of war" and support the Big Cheese - who can fault Iraqis for doing the same? I disagree with almost every single policy Dubya has put on the table (just like I would imagine many Iraqis disagree with Saddam's torture and murder policies), but if we're supposed to back our president in times of war, shouldn't we allow for the Iraqis to back theirs?   Granted this doesn't cover committing war crimes - but if an Iraqi general launches some Scuds to Kuwait, and we eventually capture him, I say cut him a break. That's his job, to blow crap up. It wouldn't be a very interesting operation if nobody ever shot at us. And getting shot at is what the U.S. troops signed up for, so while I'll be sad when the inevitable U.S. casualties come in, it's also  their job  to get attacked.   Right. Longer post than I had originally intended (like about 90% of what I write on here). So now it's Civ Pro time!

      Another "I Hate Lawyers" episode of CSI tonight. Sonofabitch. If I were an actual lawyer I'd file suit for mass defamation of character. But then I guess  I  would be bastard lawyer.  Still, let's just back down a sec. Maybe they should think about putting a good lawyer on a cop show for once. It's not always "Cops vs. Lawyers" you know.  If this seems familiar then you've been  urlLink reading my blog for a long time .  CSI is on my shit list, too bad it's so entertaining or I'd just stop watching.

      You know, just because we're "at war" (and we're not, really, by the way) doesn't mean they should be pre-empting ma stories on the picture tube. Maybe the war will be over by 9pm, so I can watch Angel.  It's not like anything's really even happening. Kaboom!  And then 3 hours of news about how something went "kaboom". Then the president says "Tonight we started making things go 'kaboom' in Iraq". And now, 5 more hours of news recapping the kaboom from various angles and with the opinions of every retired military officer on the eastern seaboard.   That's not better than watching Bernie Mac.  Better than American Idol, though. So I guess it's all about perspective.  License update for the curious: I still don't have one. Haha!  I'm so illegal it's not even funny. Except that it is!

      It just took me like 20 minutes to find "Seven Nation Army" (White Stripes) on iMesh. Why?  Because every damn song on there is a fake - just the beginning of the song, looped over and over, to thwart, well, people like me.  I don't really mind - if they want to make it harder then I say go for it. But it annoys me that because of the nature of file-sharing, that wouldn't work if the dumbass punks who download the looped versions didn't  keep the damn thing around for others to download . I mean, how hard is it to check and see if the song is full or just a plant? I personally deleted all the crap copies I downloaded. Of course I don't share anything because I'm a bum.    So perhaps I should stop whining. ;-)

      No go on the speech!  As usual Murr rambled on to long about our papers and so we only had like 2 minutes left when she finally stopped. So now I have to forget and remember to do it like, next week at some point. Sigh.  Also Torts was cancelled, because Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is in town giving a talk at our school (and then being a Moot Court judge tonight - I will be watching the webcast because I couldn't go) so Prof. Ursin undoubtedly went to that instead of to us. That was cool, except I had to stay (with about 30 other people) to wait for our Lawyering Skills class an hour and a half later. But I got some work done, and hung out with Cindy while she ranted about how hospital patients get the shaft when it comes to nutrition and whatnot. I only understood about half of what she said, but FYI don't disagree with her on dietary issues.  She'll kick your ass.  Not that I disagreed - but somebody told me once that they knew someone who got Diabetes from drinking like 8 cokes a day for 3 months. Turns out, according to the wise learnedness of Ms. Adams, that's not really possible and you only get diabetes (Type 2, that is) if you let your weight balloon out of control. Type 1, of course, is that bitch-ass kind that is genetic or something. Or maybe it's the other way around, I forget.  Either way, drink up!  I personally have stopped carrying soda in my apartment, and will now limit consumption of that liquid to meals outside the home only.  That should cut down my intake by about 4%.   Prof. Heiser made fun of Bush today in class. I love that guy, man. He's like the anti-Smith (who is, as he calls himself, our "token conservative professor"). But I like Smith too - he's funnier, but politically I'm more in alignment with Heiser. The one unifying aspect is that both their classes have the ability to bore me silly.

      I'm specifically not commenting on el presidente's speech last night, because there's really too much to say and I don't have the energy. I'll just say I disagree with about 75% of what he said. But, I have homework to do and haven't given it my full attention, nor will I for another 7 weeks or so.   I have to give a short speech in Lawyering Skillz today. Kind of a preview of the oral argument we have to give at the end of the month. It's only 3 minutes but of course I'm nervous and will probably fuck it up. Yay public speaking!  It's on vivisection (animal testing) but I don't find out what side I argue until I get to class. That's sort of annoying.  Class!

      Alright I just spent like 30 minutes combing my damn apartment for a 3 1/2 inch floppy disk. But in this day and age, guess what?  No dice!  EVERYTHING I found came with a CD only. Nary a floppy to be found in the 7 cubic feet that constitutes my living space. No exam registration today!  Don't ask why, it's both a complicated and boring story.  Oh yeah, today's St. Patrick's Day. Happy Irish day, my Gaelic brothers and sisters. I think I might have an Irish ancestor or two, but then again who the hell knows. Or cares! St. Patrick's Day on a Monday = non-event.

      You know that joke that involves the law firm of "Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe"?  Well don't ever tell it. It's a lame, lame joke and it's not funny. You should especially not tell it around lawyers, who fully believe it's a lame joke and will not laugh. If they do laugh, they're only being kind, like when you laugh at a joke that a 6-year-old made up.  Unless it's a funny 6-year-old.   It's the kind of lame joke that my dad would tell, except that's being to harsh on my dad, who despite his penchant for bad jokes (asking the waiter if the restaurant "do you all take Mobil? haha!") probably wouldn't use the Dewey punchline. So do yourselves a favor, faithful readers, and expunge that particular punchline from your memory banks.    Another good rule is, don't tell jokes of a certain category to a person in that category, unless you're REALLY sure it's new and they haven't heard it. And that they have a sense of humor. Examples: telling blondes Blonde Jokes, telling lawyers Lawyer Jokes, telling priests Pope Jokes. The list goes on. You also want to avoid telling Pollack Jokes to Polish people, and in general don't ever make a joke about a person's name, because they've heard that before. No matter how witty you think you are (you're not) they've heard it before. Trust me.  Just doing my part to make comedy more sophisticated.

      Haha, Mr. Falcon. I forgot about that. Hehe. Why must movies insist on bad dubs, when they can simply mute the objectionable word? Because it really detracts from the essence of a bad guy when he calls people a "mother humper" and tells them to "flip off".   Work out time!  Then the post office, then laundry, then CivPro which I didn't read in the library because I'm weak-willed and wanted to come home.  I used to be with it, then they changed what it was, and now what's it seems weird and scary to me.

      That saying that "50% of all marriages end in divorce" is inaccurate. The only way you get that is if you take the number of marriages in a year (say 100,000) as compared to the number of divorces (50,000). Yes, that's half, but it's not half of the people who just got married. Those 50,000 divorces come from the gigantic pool of already married people, which is much larger. So technically, if the trend continues for a very long time (multiple generations) then yeah that will be the result. But right now it's really just a statistic that people use to scare other people.  I just thought I'd toss that out there. I've heard that particular phrase maybe 3 times just today, so I figured it warranted comment. Especially since nothing else interesting happened.

      Sunday = library day. Perhaps if you're lucky I'll post something about my entirely boring life from the library directly, thus cementing my status as Most Boring Person Alive.   "Well it's a well-known fact, sonny jim, that there's a secret society of the five wealthiest people in the world, known as 'The Pentaverate', who run everything in the world, including the newspapers, and meet tri-annually at a secrect country mansion in Colorado known as 'The Meadows'." "So who's in this Pentaverate?" "The Queen, the Vatican, the Gettys, the Rothchilds, and Colonel Sanders before he went heads up. Ah, I hated the Colonel, with his wee beady eyes and that smug look on his face - 'oh you're gonna buy my chicken, ohhhhh!'" "Dad, how can you hate The Colonel?" "Because he puts an addictive chemical in his chicken that makes you crave it fortnightly, smartass!"  There. I just needed to get that out there. Library ho!

      I'm a wuss. It's only 11:45 and I'm beat to hell, but then I've been out since 5pm so maybe that's okay. At least, that's what I tell myself.   Brief recap: hung out with Hilary, first at Moondoggies to watch the UNC/Maryland game (UNC won, the fuckers), then to dinner at a fairly nice Mexican place the name of which I have forgotten. Started with a G. Then to a bonfire on Fiesta Island, but it turns out the island closes at 10pm so, because we got there at 9:30, it was "grand opening, grand closing!" and we headed back to Hilary's apartment complex and hung out at her South African neighbors.   People with accents are inherently funnier than people without. It's just a law of nature. Especially British or Australian or (in this case) South African. They can be hard to understand if you're not listening, but their way of speaking is itself very funny. I learned that you should pretty much never travel to South Africa because the crime is like, Detroit X 1,000.   Anyway, a pretty fun night, though I felt a little too quiet. Hilary's friends are fairly gregarious folk, though (like her) so I tend to pull back a little and let them do most of the talking. I guess I'm a wallflower at heart, but it makes me wonder what people say after I've left - that guy was weird? Quiet? Or maybe they just don't say anything at all. Either way, at 25 I'm not too concerned about such things anymore.  Bedtime! First: girl scout cookie snacking, courtesy of Mom via Aunt Lisa as executor for Cousin Taylor.

      Okay, so. Jason and Adam were here for something like 5 days (if you count the arrival and departure days, 7) and that was really cool. It was nice having something to do for once, and I probably would have gone insane over spring break without someone else around. Pretty much everyone around here has been AWOL, although we did go out with Marke and Jaime and Marek's roommate Matt on Tuesday, so that was cool. Worlds collide and all that.   That was also my first trip to a karaoke bar, which was actually by mistake (I didn't know what it was 'till we got in and sat down and went "why does the voice in the music seem offkey?") but also alot of fun. Of course I didn't do any singing (yikes) but it's interesting to see the "regulars" who are all serious about their karaoke. Some of 'em weren't half bad, either.   We also went up to L.A., and to the zoo, and to the beach, twice. L.A. is like it always is, not quite how you expect. I saw the biggest friggin record store ever (that was the primary purpose for going) and finally saw the Hollywood sign (belated apologies to Kim 6 months late - it was just a little farther down Sunset than we had originally travelled) and Mulholland Drive. The Chinese Theater and "star walk" are pretty overrated, though - talk about a pointless tourist trap. You really have to care about celebrities to see any value (above mildly amusing) to those stars and handprints and such. Still, good to see and check off on my mental to-do list (3,532 entries and dropping. slowly.)  The zoo was the zoo, although not as crowded as when I went last summer. The animals really came alive in the later afternoon, the gorillas especially. The hippos were cool too, and if Adam puts up pictures from his digital camera I will of course link to them. Got some sun that day, and then some at the beach so I'm on my way towards looking a little more like a San Diego person, instead of a tourist who forgot to go home.   Overall, a good time. Made me miss having some friends around than have the same exact sense of humor as me, though. Hilary's pretty close, I can make her laugh at least. And of course everyone is very nice and cool, etc. But nobody is on quite the same wavelength as Jason and Adam. Of course that wavelength can be tuned into just by watching obsessive amounts of the Simpsons, Seinfeld and a handful of key movies, so it's not like we're all that unique. :-)  Gas costs about $2.15/gallon out here right now. I've heard it's the most in the nation. Take that you SUV-driving piles of crap!  Must suck to spend $40 filling up the tank on one of the behemoths just to fill it again at the end of the week. Haha!  Of course I spend $20/tank now, which is harsh but that's the price you pay when you drive. I wouldn't mind if prices topped $3.00/gallon, frankly. Anything to stick it to the American consumer. ;-)

      So I got bored today (what with no school work and nobody around) and I went out and got a game. Yeah, I know I'm too poor to be doing such things. But I hadn't even played anything besides solitaire for probably a month (because I would always feel too guilty) so I figured what better time than now. I'd been hearing good things about "Age of Mythology" (kind of a sequel to Age of Empires) so I nabbed that (and, full disclosure, I got SimCity 4 as well but haven't installed that yet).    AoM is very cool, and LONG as hell. I'm pretty sure I've barely scratched the surface, but I've played it all afternoon. Most games these days don't last nearly as long; that's why I didn't get Unreal 2, which is pretty but short as hell. I need something that will be there for awhile (hence the SimCity, which technically has no ending). Even though after spring break I won't be playing it again until May or so. I'm crazy!  The Peace Corps sucks, just FYI. My sister was "deferred" or some dumb shit for like 2 years. Their reason? She has a slight thyroid problem (perfectly controlled, not dangerous, her endocrinologist has given her a clean bill of health) and they're all scared or something. WTF?  When the DOCTOR says it's okay, that means it's okay! Peace Corps shouldn't be arguing, they should just be letting people who want to  volunteer  do so. Pisses me off - are there THAT many people trying to give up their lives for 2 years that the stupid PC can be so selective?  I seriously doubt it.  They just suck. They better hope I never get any power or I will bust some heads.  Bed soon. Can't decide if soon = now. I'm not tired. But I have to get up and do the cleaning that AoM kept me away from. There. I just convinced myself. Amazing to see my brain in action, isn't it?

      Spring Break!  Everyone has bolted out of town for the weekend except me, while I wait for Dumb and Dumber to get here tomorrow. Haha! Just kidding. Jaime and Cindy are both going to Vegas (different reasons), Hilary's heading up the coast with her special friend, and Marek's going to Fullerton to do a school thing.  I'm slightly envious, but staying put gives me a chance to do some mild cleaning and try and figure out what we're going to do for 4 days. I gots some ideas (hookers) and possibilities (blow).   Weather is nice again, there's still a chill in the air but the sun is muy caliente so it evens out. It was only supposed to be at about 70 for the weekend, but apparently God loves my east coast visitors because now the forecast is for 70 degrees all the way through Wednesday. Nice!

      Slight change to the sidebar there (along with a name change earlier this week). Given that me and "the mouse" aren't talking anymore, I figured I should do the gentlemanly thing and stop linking to her blog. It's not like I won't still read it (bookmarks, people - learn how to use them) but for now maybe it shouldn't be so accessible to the hordes of people that read my blog everyday. And by hordes I mean me.   Also I added a link to Dave Barry's, because damn it's funny, and my dad's, which is probably never going to get off the ground but I'm showing solidarity.   In other nudes, only one class left before the end of the first half of the second semester of the first year of law school. I'm pretty exhausted from this first half, for lots of reasons (both law-related and not) but I'm looking forward to the second half. But then, I'm in a good mood today so maybe that's why I'm so optimistic.   Except that stupid Fox has reset their syndicated Simpsons episodes, so for the next week or two I have to sit through all the unfunny early ones (that I have on DVD anyhow). Everyone's going out of town this weekend, so not much to do tomorrow night, except pretend to clean my apartment in anticipation of the mongol horde descending on Saturday.   And.... Scene!

      So I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping these days. Well, after I get to sleep it's no trouble, but despite an exhausting day I won't fall asleep in bed until nearly 2:30 a.m. I'm not watching TV or anything, I'm just thinking too much. But it's keeping me up, damn it.   I need to find a way to get closure on a bunch of things so that I don't stay up for 3 hours everynight having conversations with people in my head. It's neither therapeutic nor applicable to real life, so what's the point?  Sigh.   Angel was good last night. I think I'm starting to enjoy it more than Buffy, although Buffy is still good. I hope they don't cancel Angel this season, it's really entertaining and with Buffy gone it stands to get a boost in ratings (Buffy viewers will need  something  to latch on to). Maybe they should stop moving it around and just settle on a damn timeslot (it's gone from Tuesdays to Thursdays to Sundays to Wednesdays).   urlLink Ahhhh California.  Makes me wish I still had a stick (better gas mileage).

       urlLink A great article  on something I had long forgotten about - Nintendo Power! If you don't know what that is, you weren't a male age 5-13 during the 80's. Man did that magazine kick ass (at least when it first came out). Now it just seems kind of amusing - it really was just a gigantic ad - but back before there was an Internet or even "game magazines" Nintendo Power was like the holy grail.  I stole this from  urlLink Fark , by the way, which you should be checking out daily.

      Okay I take it back, there is  urlLink something good  worth reading on the web today. Maybe it's because I'm a law geek, but the Supreme Court Dispatches on  urlLink Slate.com  are truely brilliant if you're looking for a common-sense analysis of what the Supremes are up to these days. It's both easy to read and thorough, something you don't see very often in law. Especially the "easy to read" part.

      Second times a charm for flying back east, Dad is safely in the air at this point, on the way to sunny Chicago. Well, Chicago anyways.  My new plan is to try and do more of my supplemental school work. Outlines, note-cleaning, etc. I've been pretty lax these days - I take notes like a champ but once my reading for the next day is done, I just veg out in front of whatever electronic device suits my fancy. So now, I will actually start working on some outlining - I think Torts and Contracts first because those are the two classes that are the least formal (and thus my notes are a big mess).   Civil Procedure and Property, on the other hand, are well structured and creating an outline will not be as huge a chore.  Still a chore, but one that can wait a few more weeks. After spring break, there are only like 6 or 7 weeks of classes left, and then summer. The summer where I have no job, to be more accurate. But I make take some classes if I don't find something worthwhile, job-wise.  No good links today. The web has bored me silly. New Angel tonight, plus West Wing is a repeat so I won't have liberal guilt over missing it.  Outlining Bonus #1: you can do it in front of the TV

      So once again snow has kept my parental figure from returning home. :-) Dad stayed around another day because Chicago was all snowed in. That's cool though, it's kind of nice to have company and I don't have all that much work to do, anyhow.   Today was a pretty good day. No real discernable reason why, but everyone seemed to be in good spirits and looking forward to spring break (next week, for those who aren't coming to visit).  Last night I watched "Miracles" for the first time (ABC, 10pm, I think) and man did that show freak me out. I tell you what, if you want to scare people or just give them the general willies: dead kids who talk. Dead kids who appear dead and then their eyes pop open is even worse. Dead kids standing in a crowd staring at you is the worst. Anyway it's a good show, scary kinder notwithstanding. All that pseudo-religious mythology has always interested me - part of growing up Catholic (we have an end of the world scenario that tops pretty much everyone else's) I suppose.  That is all!

      I know that  urlLink this  is just using some probability chart to guess what number I'm thinking. Really, I do. But it got like 8 out 10 right. I'm no mathematician, but it sure is freaky when you don't know how it's done.  I have like 3 hours to kill - homework?  Naaah. I haven't played GTA (or any game, other than spider solitaire) in over 3 weeks, so maybe it's time to brush the dust off that bad boy.  Or maybe just solitaire.  That way I can MP3 it up at the same time.  And find more strange web oddities for you folks.

      Finished that damn paper, although I can't say it's my best work ever. Seems a little uneven, but I was out of ideas of ways to fix that. Now it's turned in and out of my mind for a week or so.  I woke up late and showered late and got out the door late this morning. I turned in my 1 "unprepared" pass in Property (we get 1 per semester, means she can't call on us) because I didn't read anything. Then she told us that Property is cancelled for Wednesday (woot!). Then in Contracts, Smith was sickly and only kept us in class for about 45 minutes before declaring that he either had to pass out or end class. We voted to end class. Jaime is sick too, and maybe Cindy who didn't show up to either class today.   Something going around? I was unwell on Saturday but feel fine now. I hope I don't get sick for Spring Break, that would suck a nut. Vitamins and freebasing keep me on the up-and-up!  Dad's still in town though at his conference - I will probably go downtown and visit with him tonight, unless he's uber-busy. He heads out tomorrow afternoon. Good having the old man around, even if his snoring is louder than the trucks downshifting on 163 outside my window. Impressive!

      I'm 70 percent done with that damn paper, but it's been a long damn haul. And that's only like, 70 percent on the first draft. Then I have to go back and rewrite everything because I'm pretty sure it all sucks. I shouldn't even be writing a blog entry, except that I just cranked out a good chunk of paper and I'm on my break, dammit!  I frittered most of the day away because I woke up with a bad headache a stomach that was doing flips. Didn't actually get sick or anything, but for about 6 hours I couldn't read or write or do anything besides lay down and keep my eyes closed. It was kind of like having a hangover, except without the good time the night before. Ironic considering the night before was the farthest thing from good a person can get.  Also this morning I was sending this huge long email, but right when I hit send I think the email crashed and now I'm pretty sure it didn't go through. It's not the kind of email one can rewrite, and thanks to the wonders of web-mail there's no copy of it left in existence. That's even more frustrating than losing a long blog entry, I tell you whut.  Gotta go pick up pop (that sounds like a Dr. Seuss book) from the airport in a couple hours. His flight is delayed though, which sucks for him because he's on East Coast time and that means he'll be hittin the hay at my place at approx. 2am. Haha! Lots of visitors out here these days, dad tonight through Tuesday and then Jason and Adam next week for like 5 whole days. I hope I can think of enough entertaining stuff to do during that time - watching me play GTA can only last so long. ;-)

       Sam vs. The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles: A Story of Mutual Disgust   Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water... bam! Turns out Virginia still has a problem with letting me get a license out here in California. This time it's  really  weird. Turns out they think they asked me to prove that my car was insured, and I never did. Simple enough, right?    Of course not! Turns out they want proof of insurance on my OLD car, and they need proof that it was insured on May 6, 2002. Why that date I have no earthly idea. The fact that 1) I no longer live in Virginia, 2) I no longer own that car, and 3) I had perfectly good insurance at that time - these are facts that do not faze the Department of Motor Vehicles, no siree bob.   So now I'm on the phone with Geico, they're trying to figure out why Virginia has such a stick up its ass about my insurance, especially considering that according to them I've been fully insured since I signed on in 2000. The nice lady who handles Virginia told me Virginia is one of the worst states to deal with regarding motor vehicles, and that half the time there's a problem it's the complete fault of the DMV, not the driver.   Long story short, I'm still waiting to hear from Geico. Tomorrow I get to call Virginia and yell at them some more. Hopefully I won't have to go back to the CA DMV, but who knows. Virginia better pray I never become President, because now they're on my shit list. I will throw them  right out  of the Union, if given the chance.

       Bonus Celebrity Jeopardy Update   Vivica Fox has the brain power of a dust mite. And not even a smart one. Ashton Kutcher is smarter than he looks, which probably isn't hard to be. But I was still surprised. And Wayne Brady, despite being one of the most annoying men on television, is pretty brainy as well. Poor Vivica got smoked. Celebrity Jeopardy is always entertaining and the questions are usually about as hard as those used during High School week.

      I forgot to mention - last night I dreamt that  urlLink Raf  and I were holed up in his (dream-world only) 1-bedroom apartment somewhere rehearsing scenes for a play or a movie he had written. Also with us: Daryl Hannah (my acting partner) and a young Susan Sarandon (Raf's). I don't really remember much, it wasn't the most scandalous dream ever, but weird. Why does my brain think Raf can write a play? I think it needs another beer or seven.

      We had our final Lawyering Skills class for the semester (and year, and, if you specify Lawyering Skills I, my life) and it was lots of fun. Our professor is very cool, she took us to a pizza place out on Friars road an we had beers and pizza and some pretty good ceasar salad. She also gave out awards, some serious (like "best oral argument") and others not so serious (like "funniest line"). I actually got one, which was surprising and cool. She called it "Best Creeper Argument", which sounds strange but basically means the best argument that, at first, none of the judges really bought it, but by the end I had them all. Well, not all, because I only got 2 out of 3, but the judges themselves seemed pretty surprised that they were on my side on that particular issue.   I thought that sounded a lot like how I meet women. At first, I'm annoying, almost off-putting. But eventually you can't get me out of your head (like "Co-stanza" in that episode of Seinfeld). I guess my oral arguments work the same way. ;-)  Either way, I got a gift card for Jamba Juice, which I've never been to but now will go and see what the deal is.   In other news, the DMV is still not done with me. They called today and said I need to come in for something, but didn't say what. I'm a little bit unnerved, like it's a scam and the cops are going to arrest me when I get there. But then I realized they know exactly where I live, so why would they do that?  The nice part is I don't have to wait in line, I just go to the front counter and ask for "Karen". I better get a damn license. I also have to call the U.S. Attorney's office and give them a reference for Emilie (Lee's wife) which I haven't been able to do yet because of class and the time difference.   Now it's time for outlining and then a new Buffy. Life is good. ;-)

      Today, I got home from class and I had no power. That was because the idiots at SDG&E lost the nice fat check I sent them about a month ago. Needless to say I was pissed, because what the hell can I do without power? Nothing! I'm all for a Thoreau-esque living environment, but not when I have outlining to do. Long story short, I paid them again (and will cancel the first check) and my power was turned back on an hour later. I have to pay like, $30 in fees though. Stupid postal service and/or mailroom.   Today was my last Monday of classes for my First Year at law school. That may not mean much to you, but... well it doesn't mean that much to me either. Still, worth noting simply because I can.    Last night on Law & Order: Criminal Intent, there was a scene where whatshisface, Vincent D'Onofrio's character, was "sort of" searching this guy's apartment. The guy wasn't there, but his dad was, and his dad was staying with him and had been for 5 years. Vince sees that the apartment owner's door is closed and, although there is a second lock, completely unlocked. He encourages the dad to see if it's open, and when it is Vince goes strolling on in (although not having opened the door himself) and looks around. Of course, the first thing I thought of when I saw him eyeing that interior lock was "does the dad have apparent or actual authority to consent to a search of the bedroom?"   ...and that's when I finally had proof that law school is destroying my brain. If I ever say to you (whoever you are) "that would never happen!" like really annoying people do during cool shows, just punch me in the nuts.

Not that I'd be at a Marlins game in the first place, ew.

      I am happy to report that I have finished my Property homework for the rest of my life. Well, unless I fail the class and have to take it again. But that seems unlikely. I read ahead all the way through Wednesday and can now put that beast to bed, and concentrate on the outline or just on other classes. Since Property is the first final (a week from this Wednesday!) I'm betting I'll spend most of next weekend on it and thus should concentrate on other classes up until that point.   Like, say, Civil Procedure, where I still don't have any idea what the hell interpleader  really  does. Chances are if you're reading this blog, you don't either. Consider yourself lucky that you don't have to find out.  I'm mentally arguing with myself over whether seeing X2 next weekend would really be SO bad. I should be studying nonstop, but a little break never hurt anyone, right? :)

       Roxanne (from the new movie The Real Cancun) talks about her inevitable post-movie fame: "I'd rather be known for this instead of being smart or something. There's a million people who are smart. There's only 16 of us who were in Cancun together."  (courtesy  urlLink Time magazine )  I don't think she needs to worry about being reknowned for her intellectual gifts.  I will be interested to see how famous the people in that movie truly turn out to be. The cast members of the normal Real World tend to have more recognition because their "moment in the sun" lasts longer - 13 episodes or whatever, filmed over 5 or 6 months. No matter what you think about the Real World, the resulting show is more provocative because you can see how people meet, interact, and change over a long(ish) period of time. Here, movie-goers will only see a week's worth of debauchery, and only in a 90 minute movie, after which they will promptly move on with their lives. There's no "stayed tuned for next week" - when it's over, it's over.  So we'll see just how lucky Roxanne and her "For Display Purposes Only" brain are when it comes to how long her 15 minutes actually are.

      While walking back to my car after class this morning, I saw this weird pile of giant ants on the ground ahead of me. Then, I realized some of them were flying around the pile. Then, I realized they weren't ants and were in fact bees. Fortunately my brain figured this out well in advance of me walking through the swarm, but I was taken aback. I've never seen a swarm of bees before, they were just  loving  something on the sidewalk and that was all the information I needed to keep clear.  Then on the way back from the grocery store (sometimes I think I drink my weight in milk every month) I saw a billboard that was simply yellow-on-black text and said "Wife Wanted" with a personal ad and phone number underneath. I didn't get close enough to read it (except that it said white male, but then I had to turn) but I figured I'd mention it because hey, you don't see giant billboards asking for marriage proposals every day, do you?  Maybe in Vegas.  So yeah, that's my morning. Bees and Billboards. Southern California is a strange, strange place.

      So, today in Property we discussed "common interest communities", which are basically the gated communities that have a load of rules about what you can and can't do with your property. When you buy a house in these communities, you sign a deed which says you will abide by the restrictions put forth by the Homeowner's Association. Then everybody gets to live in a nice neighborhood where none of the houses are painted in eye-watering shades of purple and nobody has junked cars on their lawns. Because if they do those things, they'll be heavily fined by the HOA.   So the question in class was, what restrictions should be allowable? The current state of the law is that most courts give a great deal of deference to the restrictions that exist, and a rule will need to be grossly unreasonable or against public policy to be struck down.  I was just incensed at the entire idea of "common interest communities", to be perfectly honest. There is a tension between freedom to do what you want (within the boundaries of the law) and freedom to associate with who you want (which may necessitate an abridgement of your constitutional rights). My personal opinion is that restrictions for planned communities are a load of crap. When you purchase a house, and own the property in fee simple (that just means own it outright, no strings attached) you should be able to do whatever you like with the house and the land within the bounds of the government's laws, NOT within the bounds of some randomly chosen association bylaws.   There's a reason we allow government to create and maintain laws - government has the resources and the bureacracy to do so. If a law is no good, then the courts will strike it down, or it will be vetoed by another branch, or it will be overruled by another law from the law-making body. Where are these protections in the tiny little planned community dictatorships? There are no courts, there is no executive branch; sure the people on the Board are elected by the residents of the community, but is that enough lip service to the democratic process to allow the hugely unconstitutional restrictions those Boards then apply? I say no.   And another thing (since I'm ranting): one of the basic attributes of the human condition is that we will interact and share ideas with one another, thus hopefully learning and improving our collective lives. But if you insulate yourself into a hegemonic community of people who only think and act a specific way (and they have to, because otherwise they'll be heavily fined or even have their house taken away) how much are you contributing to the ideal of positive human interaction? I  want  to live near the crazy old man who doesn't mow his lawn very often, and the weird couple that put out pink flamingos on their lawn, and the even weirder old woman who puts up so many Christmas lights in December that 747s mistake the street for an emergency runway. I know that lowers property values; and maybe some people want to live in an idyllic utopia of perfectly manicured lawns and absolutely no individuality. But those people, in the end, are missing out on the cultural experiences that come with living in a community of mixed personalities.   /end sermon. Whew.  Although here's a necessary postscript: I don't think HOA's that deal with common areas, like a common pool or park or trash service or other such things, is a bad idea. In fact I think that's a good idea, because then everyone can have the benefit of such things without having to buy them themselves. It's when the powers of the HOA cross over into restrictions on personal property that I begin to take issue.

      For some asinine reason, USD's window for registration for classes is one day. Today. Tomorrow, the forms for Fall registration are due. So all the thinking and strategizing about what classes I want to take must take place in the span of the next 24 hours.   Just for the record, I really object to being railroaded that way. I like to simmer on these things, but now I have to make 1,000 decisions tonight if I want to stay in law school. And of course I do. I'm just bitter. :)   So it looks like I'll be taking Evidence this summer, and then Constitutional Law, Professional Responsibility, Intro to Intellectual Property and Comm. Law & Policy. And something else. Probably something else. I can sign up for 16 credits (those listed are 12) but I only want to take 13 or 14, so I'll drop something if necessary. I  could  take Corporations this summer and push Evidence to the fall (dropping Comm Law out) but part of me really wants to get Evidence out of the way soon.   Anyway, I'm also sad that it seems really unlikely that I'll have too many classes with my friends. Right now (a quick recap if you don't know) we're all in all the same classes, which I enjoy. There's a reason they're mine friends, after all, and it's much more condusive to study group if the same people can talk about the same classes. Next year, however, all the sections go to hell and everybody's intermixed. I don't necessarily even want to mix with the mongoloids that make up sections A and B. ;-) Alright enough of my bitching, a Buffy repeat is calling my name. And I have to research some more class possibilities.

      I'm tired of doing Civil Procedure (and I'm done with the reading) so I thought I'd take a break. I don't have much to blog, but I've heard of an interesting thing called the  urlLink "Friday Five"  which provokes some mild introspection. They put up 5 questions every week, similar to the kinds of questions that are found in those emails ("what's your favorite book?") that people send around from time to time. Anyway, it's not Friday but like I said, I'm bored.  So without further ado:   1. Who is your favorite celebrity?  I don't think I have a "favorite" celebrity. There are actors that I like, and talking heads that I think are smart, but... okay Sarah Michelle Gellar is pretty hot.  2. Who is your least favorite?  Well, I may not love them but boy do I hate a lot of famous people. :-) I don't like Catherine Zeta-Jones that much. Seems too aloof.  3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?  Nope. Well, Steven Soderbergh that one time. And I've met a few reporters, but they're only "celebrities" if you're from the DC area and watch the news.  4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?  Sure. I think I'd make a pretty good famous person. Not too many skeletons in my closet or weird, deviant behaviour patterns.  5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  Freddie Prinze Jr. See #1.

      As much as I respect other people's points of view, there's something about proclaiming yourself "child FREE" instead of "childless" that smacks of desperation. I would never look down on someone for not wanting/having children, but looking down on people who  do  want/have children is just as bad.  And do they really need a   urlLink website  to do so? The Internet is a funky chicken, my friends.  That does remind me though, a guy in my law school class brought his 4 or 5-year-old daughter to class the other day, and she was the cutest thing ever. I was shocked that he even had a daughter that age (he's younger than I am, and not married) but for a moment or two, which I watched her quietly playing in her seat, I really felt comfortable with the idea of having kids. Not even "some day" but soon. Of course, I would need to have a bunch of other things first so there's no danger of THAT happening. It was just an odd but strangely familiar feeling.

      Well today was exhausting on every front. Spent 3 or 4 hours in the library working on my Property outline, and even though I focused far better than on Saturday when I did CivPro, I'm only about 30% done. If that. I didn't end up eating dinner until almost 10 because of things that came up which left me even further drained. Sigh!  But on the upside, Boomtown was good. I'm sad that it was the season finale, though the reapeats will be cool since I've only seen a few episodes anyhow. Tomorrow is Property at Jaime's, which will be good because I like being able to talk through some of the tougher parts. I really need to do that with CivPro, though I'll take what I can get.  So, Easter and all. Like most years, it didn't really enter into my radar much, except for noticing all the well-dressed asian folks walking to church this morning. I live in a predominantly asian neighborhood, if I haven't mentioned that. I don't just notice asians. ;-)  Anyway, sometimes I miss the feel of the church, though not as much around Easter as I do around Christmas. Although I disagree with all the politics and even some of the moral standards put forth by The Church, I've always been fascinated by the mysticism and old-testament mythology that goes along with Catholicism. If they still performed mass in Latin, I'd probably go more often. I like the solemnity of it all. But, they don't do that. And they're always preaching about abortion and homosexuality and birth control, and their views are 180 degrees from where I am. So, I talk to God on my own time and I don't worry about the technicalities. I think it's working out fairly well. :)

      Just a technical update: the comments thing was slowing down my page, so out it goes until I figure out why.   Happy Easter and whatnot to all who notice such things. I will be celebrating by doing my Property outline, possibly even in the library!  I got my first cell phone bill, and got more than a little to' up by some of the calls. I have plenty of minutes but I need to remember that 2 hour conversations at 4 in the afternoon are going to cost me an arm and a leg. :) But that's why God made credit cards, and why He died and was risen again to save us from our sins.

      As a general rule, I don't like MTV that much. But right now I'm half-watching a marathon of that show "Punk'd" and man some of that is funny. I generally don't like Ashton Kutcher all that much either, he's not that good an actor. But he does have a pretty good sense of comedy timing, especially in these hidden-camera things. Sometimes hidden camera shows aren't that funny, but playing jokes on celebrities is actually quite amusing. Some of them seem so nice, like Mandy Moore and Seth Green, that you almost feel bad when they're getting made fun of.   What's really interesting is how long they stay on the celebrity AFTER they tell them it was a hidden camera. Some of them react with good nature (even Justin Timberlake) but others, like one of the Backstreet Boys, had so little screen time after they "found out" that you HAVE to know they were super-pissed and not terribly amused. If the show needs anything, it's less of the set-up and more of the reaction, because that's really the most interesting part.   I'm half-watching because I'm also slogging through my CivPro outline. And sending out an email or two. And eating the 348 tons of Easter chocolate people have given me. :)  Thanks everybody!

       urlLink    What's more fun than 3 hours at the DMV? Nothing, I tell you. I forgot to bring reading material so I had a nice long chat with Mom while sitting in the waiting room. That was cool. I thought about calling other folks but I didn't have much interesting to say, so I figured that it would be silly to bother people obviously much busier than me. Hopefully now my DMV visiting days are coming to an end, I actually got a somewhat-valid license today (it's paper and lame, but "official"), which means my two and half month stint of illegal driving has finally come to a close! Now I can finally return to speeding, tailgating, and otherwise acting in a manner that skirts the boundaries of acceptable vehicular behavior.   This weekend is all about studying, so I'd better get to that. Today is Civil Procedure outlining! Tomorrow is probably Contracts/Torts, and Sunday is Property. Monday is when I throw it all out the window and decide to buy a shack in the mountains and whittle for a living.

      Raining again! That's twice in the past 3 or 4 days. I think that's a bad sign.  Revelations 6:12-15: "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; 13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. 14 And in San Diego it rained for the second time in but a few days 15 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."

      So I added a comments thing. It took like, 10 minutes to do so if it sucks that's probably why. I don't have my own webspace, really, so it's courtesy of some nice folks at  urlLink Enetation . Seems to work pretty well but it's a little slow, probably because it's based out of the U.K. Those crazy Brits! What will they think of next?  My friend  urlLink Marek  has a much better comments system because he's a programming god, but that's what inspired me. No more idly sitting by while I rant at the world!  Anyway, now anyone who stumbles by can comment. Hopefully you will. If you don't then I'll just hang myself for the 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back. ;-)

      Apparently I'm in a "bad mood" today. I really object to being labeled that way when I'm not, because it's self-fulfilling. It's like telling someone they look sick; you do it enough and yeah, they start to feel ill.   But despite that I still have lots to do, like write an essay for the Moot Court people on "Why I'd be a Good Addition to the Moot Court Board". It's only a page, so I'm not going to put to much effort into it. Besides, any reader of this blog knows that it takes almost no effort (and little actual thinking!) for me to fill up a page of text.   I wish I had more to comment on these days - having a blog is supposed to be more than "let's see, today I'm doing laundry, and then working out, and then..." because who the hell cares about that? But I really have to reach to find non-personal, interesting items. I've decided that personal items, at least past a certain point, should be verbotten. I don't mind theorizing on relationships and friendships, but when I start approach the whine-stage (or I'm only pretending to "theorize" and am actually talking about me) that's too much.    Jason's blog reminded me that Buffy was pretty damn good last night. I think it had been 3 or 4 weeks since the last new episode, but last night's made up for it. The new guy, Caleb, sure is a crapweasel. Plus if he's human why the hell is he so strong? Watching Faith re-interact with the whole crew was amusing, especially with Spike. I really hate the whole Buffy-Spike thing, so maybe Faith (who seems much more his speed anyway) will put an end to that. I doubt it, but I can hope. Buffy/Spike is almost as disturbing as Cordelia/Connor over on Angel, and that got resolved when we found out it wasn't Cordy, it was an evil demon thing. New Angel tonight!  I could rant further on the whole Buffy thing, but that would probably alienate half of my readers (2 people) so let's hold off on that, shall we? It's time for lunch anyhow.  Clarification Because I Can't Help It: I like Buffy as a character, and I like Spike as a character. I think they're both great. But the idea that she should be in love with him is just so far beyond the bounds of realistic relationships (note I didn't say reality - it's a show about vampires, after all) and feelings that it just makes me cringe. It smacks of desperation by the writers, who are torn between providing a "happy ending" for the two of them and the far more realistic portrayal of their purely physical relationship from last season. Last season made more sense, says I.

       urlLink Jason's  saying he has font size and setting problems, but I think it looks pretty good right now. At least the gargantuan headline problem has been solved. ;-)  Speaking of problems, I meant to throw my 2 cents into the ring regarding "take a break" conversations and raised voices: perfectly normal. Especially if it has been 6 months, which is a milestone and can prompt questions that aren't necessarily indicative of changed feelings, but rather are just introspective. Some people are just more uncertain about their lives in general, and have trouble thinking ANY relationship, even spectacular ones, can keep going. It's something you learn to deal with so that you don't go making big mistakes based on one or two bad days. That, I've had to learn the hard way. ;-)  Seriously though, anyone who says that a relationship isn't work of some kind is either delusional or mentally incompetent. It's when you don't think the work you put in is worth the relationship that you get out that you have an issue.   I'm on quite the soapbox today! I'll shut up now because lord knows I could rant about this stuff until the end of time.

      Have you ever had a friend that, after awhile, you couldn't figure out why they were your friend? Not so much that you don't like him or her, but that you can't see why him or her bothers hanging out with you, when they don't seem to respect or care about anything you say or think. I think the phrase "absence makes the heart grow fonder" can apply to friendships just as easily as to other relationships. It can be very easy to take people for granted, I know I have in the past, but I also think I'm especially easy to take for granted because I'm generally very easy-going and non-confrontational. It's dumb to purposely avoid people you consider a friend, but at the same time it's depressing to think that a friend finds nothing you say even remotely interesting.  On the other hand, maybe that's why you have good friends. You're supposed to be able to take them for granted sometimes, to know that they'll be there for you even when you're focus is somewhere completely different. It may be only when it becomes an established trend that it's time to seriously question the friendship. I know some people who have stuck by their "friend" even when that friend was anything but (and for a long time, too) simply because they had such a long history. But just giving someone space isn't "questioning" the friendship, so maybe that's a positive first step. It's not a test to see if they'll notice (because you shouldn't "test" your friends like that) but rather breathing room that probably both people need.  Perhaps I just hate Tuesdays. ;-) Lots of bad mood going around, in school and out. At least it's sunny out again, that 4 or 5 hours of rain and wind yesterday was really scary.  Actually it wasn't, but the almost constant stream of ambulances past my apartment to the hospital was a little bit disconcerting. Damn Californians couldn't drive in the rain if their lives depended on it. And guess what? Sometimes it does.

      Today is a rainy, windy San Diego day like we normally have. By normally, I mean once every three months or so. I think it's a nice change of pace, for the most part, but when combined with Monday (and with the law school doom of finals) it seems to sap the energy out of everyone. Me included.  But, in efforts to stave off those effects I am going to be proactive today by resuming my workout schedule that I halted about 2 weeks ago because of the Oral Argument and other various activities that made me busy. Besides, if we end up going to Catalina after finals are over, I'll need to be in shape because that's a beach-type activity. I have embraced my natural paleness as inevitable and unchangeable, but there's plenty of room to work with in other areas.   I was fixing (or trying to fix) Lisa's bumper yesterday and it got me thinking about how crappy my old car was, but how much I missed all the little eccentricities. Yeah it was slow, ugly and needed numerous repairs, but it was also a manual transmission and the first car I ever "owned".   Then I remembered that time my horn did that thing, and I laugh and think "good riddance". I haven't told that story to the San Diego contingent yet, I have to remember to do that.

        I saw "Old School" last night, mostly because I really wanted to go see a movie in an actual theater and it was literally the best thing playing. I don't know what that says about what's playing right now. But it was actually pretty funny, despite what Hilary told me, and so I give it my thumbs up recommendation - although it might be better suited as a rental, because it's not really $9 funny. More like $4 funny, but then you can rewind and watched Will Ferrel in action again and again.   Of course now I'm in the library about to read some Property, followed by a little Contracts and maybe a smidge of Civil Procedure. It's basically crunch time now, at least in my mind. Su Casa and hanging out last night were the unofficial last acts of freedom before I immerse myself in the joy that is Finals. Next weekend is a 4-day "holiday" (I use the term loosely) that I will spend reading, outlining, re-learning, and outlining. Did I mention that I'll be outlining? I wish I had someplace else to go for the weekend, though, like a relative's or a cabin in the mountains or something, so that I could be sure to focus. The library is just too intense and my apartment is filled with stuff I find entertaining. If I had more money I'd rent a hotel room or something, but rent's going to be tight next month as it is so that's not so much an option.  Back to the studying at hand!

      Oral Argument Celebration Redux was fun tonight. Got quite a crowd together at Su Casa in La Jolla, so props to Cindy for managing to snare so many people. Most law school-related activities, if not mandatory or sponsored directly by the school, have only fair to mediocre attendance, but I think at the peak there were a dozen folks.   It was a good time, for the most part. I still have a bunch of energy for some strange reason (it's already 12:30) but what can ya do. Actually I can't believe I'm impressed with myself; 12:30 on a Friday isn't exactly the wee small hours. But then I'm getting old, not just in years (obviously - 25 isn't old) but just mentally. I have neither the urge nor the mental endurance to hang out in loud bars all night. Of course, tonight is an exception because it was with friends (and not in a loud bar), but I realized I just like hanging out and talking or watching a movie. Last weekend was fun, too, but staying at Moondoggies until it closes was a bit out of the ordinary for me. (full disclosure note: Moondoggies, while a great sports bar, closes insanely early - 1:30 or so)  Anyway, it struck me at one point during the evening that although part of me is really looking forward to this summer, another part of me is saddened by the fact that I'll won't have all these people in my life everyday. Many of them I won't see for the entire summer. While I plan on having a great summer here in San Diego (exploring California is the plan, along with school and/or work) the idea that most of my friends out here won't be able to share that kind of sucks.

      There seem to be some pretty cool (and by cool I mean stuff explodes or there's slow-motion) movies coming up shortly, and it surprises me how quickly the summer movie season has approached. So as a public service, because we all know my taste is better than yours, here's what looks good and what doesn't.   Definite  X2 (May 2): X-Men 2 obviously has great potential. I'll be there. The Matrix Reloaded (May 15): Sweetness. If finals haven't eaten my brain, I'm seeing this after we get back from Catalina.  The Hulk (June 20): You saw the trailer, it was awesome. Plus I'm obviously a sucker for comic book movies. Terminator 3 (July 2): This really should be under the maybe category, because I'm not so sure, but the Definites were looking slim. If anything it promises to have explosions and whatnot. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (July 9): Another sort-of comic book movie. But this has Sean Connery, so 'nuff said. Wonderland (July 31): A movie about porn-star John Holmes, starring Val Kilmer. What's not to like? Well, maybe a lot. But it sounds like it could be really good, if a little light on the explosions and gunplay. It's still about a real-life murder.   Maybes  Bulletproof Monk (April 18): has Chow Yun-Fat; downside is that it also has Stifler.  We'll see. Bruce Almighty (May 23): Jim Carrey as God. Sounds like comedy gold, but you never know what they might screw up. His last movie sucked, but it was "serious" so this is worth considering. Prozac Nation (June 6): Christina Ricci is pretty hot. Also she might be naked in this, if I remember correctly. Legally Blonde 2 (July 2): I admit the first one was funny. So I wouldn't be kicking and screaming if I got dragged to this. Dragging would probably still be required, however. Pirates of the Caribbean (July 9): They don't make many pirate movies. Well, they do, but then those movies become the biggest flops in the history of cinema (Cutthroat Island, anyone?). Still, this could be good. Exorcist 2 (July 18): Scary is good. The original scared the bejesus out of me. This is a prequel so we'll see. Bad Boys 2 (July 18): Is it just me or are there a LOT of sequels this summer? Maybe that's every summer. The first one was entertaining, this might be too. American Wedding (Aug. 1): This is American Pie 3. I didn't see 2, but the original had a few funny moments.  A few. I should have put this in the "No Way" category.   I Don't Think So  2 Fast 2 Furious: The first one was entertaining. This one doesn't have Vin. Good luck with all THAT. Dumb and Dumberer: Again, why make a sequel (or in this case, a prequel) that doesn't have any of the original cast?  Because you're an idiot, that's why. From Justin to Kelly: Haha! Seriously, who greenlighted this? Crossroads and Glitter flopped, so why not make a movie using  unknown  pop stars?  Charlie's Angels 2: I didn't like the first one all that much. Pretty girls = not enough for me to see it in the theater. Unless they're Christina Ricci. ;-) Seabiscuit: Horse movie? I don't think so. Especially a horse named "Seabiscuit" which is just lame. I know it's a true story, I just don't care. It'll probably win Oscars though. Tomb Raider 2: What? Who let Angelina Jolie out of the mental hospital long enough to get this gem made? The first one was barely entertaining. This can't be much better.  In the fall, the explosions settle down but there are still some interesting movies in the pipe, like Kill Bill (Quentin Tarantino, remember him?) and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (the follow-up to Desperado),  another  Matrix movie (Revolutions), and of course, in December... Return of the King!  Man I love the movies.

      Wow, I missed a whole day of blogging!  Yesterday was quite productive, in an academic sense of the term. Contracts is in better shape than it was before, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of finals building up behind me, and probably this weekend it will bust loose and I'll really start preparing.   I think I'm leaning towards school as my summer activity, rather than simply temping or getting some other menial job that would pay the bills. There's a good chance I'd be able to do both, since school (at least at first glance) would only take up a small part of my day. But I don't think I can just let a whole summer go by with no "improvement" being made other than achieving a mildly higher level of financial stability.  On another note, I went on sort of a rant against the Greek life (not the country and its people, the college system) last night which surprised even me. The person I was ranting to was part of that life and, at least in my opinion, it had some ill effects that she is still dealing with today. I've never understood much, if anything, about the mental state that goes into wanting to join a fraternity or a sorority, but I try to not hold it against people simply because I don't understand.  But so much of the things that go on seem like a complete throwback to an unenlightened time, where "tradition" dictates that misogynistic attitudes are not only acceptable, they're encouraged. Of course, like any other stereotypical view, I have numerous friends that have gone that route and emerged as unscathed, as it were. So perhaps the only conclusion I can reach on this point is that I'm glad I didn't go that way.   To the library!

      Without the crushing, soul-consuming weight of the oral argument on my mind, I'm now free to return to thinking about items of lesser importance, such as what that mysterious tupperware container in the back of my fridge might contain, or the fact that I have my tax refund (state) still uncashed in check form on my kitchen table. And of course my damn license, which is now starting to hamper my social life. Bars don't like expired licenses, it turns out.   But instead of remedying those particular situations, I'm going to clean the apartment and basically screw around today, because 1) it's nice out and 2) I will be re-consumed by the soul-crushing weight of finals preparation shortly.  Are we still at war?  Didn't we capture Baghdad or something last night? Is that why "Cheers" wasn't on when it normally is?  Methinks I should write more of my posts in haiku format. Though to be accurate, a true haiku must be about nature in some way, so yesterday's wasn't really a haiku. I'll do better next time.

Of course we still won, but :-p

      Oooh, now Uruguay is getting in on the act. Welcome, my South American brethren!  Except by "welcome" I mean piss off. Who knew that Sao Paulo was a hub for southern South America.  And for that matter, who knew anyone in Uruguay had a computer?  Heh. U R. Gay.

      I just checked my router's incoming access logs (I'm taking a talking-to-myself break) and I have folks from China, Poland, Russia, and of course the good old U.S.A. trying to sneak into my home network through a variety of ports.  I'm quite glad I have a router, it's so much easier to keep all those entryways closed that way.  Not that there's anything to steal on my computer, but I don't need people screwing with it, either. Scary stuff.    Oh and mad props to  urlLink Visualware's cute Java program  for clueing me in on the locations. I could just do it with bland old tracert but it's fun to watch that blue line dart all over the globe. Silly hackers.

      Well now I'm done with class for the week, but the Big Oral is tonight. And if you've been reading recently you know that's not the fun thing it sounds like.  So it's... t-minus 6 hours, 35 minutes until I show them my O Face, and I'll probably spend the afternoon talking to myself ("practicing"). And maybe playing a little Jedi Knight 2 when I get too worked up.  All of sudden got the urge to play a few days ago and now I'm all back up in that shiznit. Go figure.    Let the incoherent rambling begin!

      I've called the Virginia DMV probably a half dozen times since my little "licensing problem" was discovered, and EVERY SINGLE TIME I get a message saying "we're currently experiencing a high volume of calls!  please try again later!" followed by a hang-up.   First of all, the time difference has totally cut down my options. If I call at 9am my time, it's noon their time. "High-volume" noon, I should say. If I go to class and come back at 2, that's it. They close at 5pm on the dot. I could try and get up at 6am to call, but you know what?  Screw them.  In contrast, I had an excellent conversation with the Arlington County Treasurer, who was 1) a live person and 2) actually said he'd check into something and call me back  and he did, 10 minutes later . I was floored. From them I managed to find out that yes indeed they had put some kind of stop-notice on my Virginia "identity" (which basically means all government services in Virginia would be denied to me until I paid my car tax) but that since I did pay it, the nice human at the Treasurer's office was removing the stop.   Off to a meeting about child advocacy work, then the always entertaining and mostly pointless Torts class! Tonight I have to make sure my suit still fits in preparation for The Big Day (oral argument) tomorrow.

      In entertainment news,  urlLink Michael Jeter died . :( He was that funny looking fellow in, most recently, the Green Mile (the prisoner with the mouse). He has been in a ton of movies, but he had HIV and well, that's the end of that.  Sad. I think he was on that Evening Shade show, but I never watched that.   Also, Spike from Buffy is probably going to be on  urlLink Angel  next season, if 1) Angel has a next season and 2) they don't kill him in Buffy's finale. I keep my ear to the ground, yo.  And finally, Steve Buscemi is going to play a recurring character on the Sopranos soon. I don't have HBO anymore, but that sounds completely awesome if you're a Steve or a Sopranos (or both) fan.   Still sick, by the way. Feeling slightly better than I was this morning, but we'll see how the rest of the day treats me. I'm heading back to campus in a couple hours to do practice oral arguments with Jaime and Hilary, then (if I'm not too sick) out to dinner tonight.

      So I'm kinda sick, or something, My throat hurts and I sort of ache all over. I don't really need that right now, but I can't be too upset since I haven't really gotten sick in like, 10 months.   Still, I'm supposed to be preparing for my Oral Argument on Friday but I can't because I'm just too exhausted. I hate it when my joints hurt, and not because I worked out or anything.   Other than that, things are going well. ;) Well other than being exhausted; last night I was hoping to get a crapload of sleep, but when my throat started hurting I woke up every damn time I swallowed. I'm sure tonight won't be a walk in the park either.  Yay for bitch-session blogs!  :) That chick on Real World just found out her sort-of-boyfriend slept with some chick (yeah it's a repeat but I just saw it now) but she was sleeping with a guy while in Vegas. So how is she all "I hate you!" and whatnot?    I figured I should toss out  some  kind of commentary on  something  or else this entry is just lame. Too late! ;)

      I forgot the Friday Five again. In fact, Friday was the first day (aside from being out of town) in a long time that I didn't post a single thing. Making up for it by posting 3 things today? Perhaps.   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?  I'd like to be remembered as a good friend, son, and brother. I'd throw "boyfriend" on that list except, who am I kidding? I don't think I was ever a good boyfriend.    2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?  Defining your personal outlook on life by using another person's mildly witty saying is lame. There are many quotes I like, but my outlook is mine and is not reflected by anything Kant, Gandhi, or JFK have said.    3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?  Getting into law school. Or, surviving the first semester (and, fingers crossed, the second). Guess what I'm  not  proud of?  Go on, guess! ;)   4. What about the past ten years?  My work at  urlLink Fight Crime  was quite fulfilling. I was always proud to be part of that team, and I hope that I played at least a small part in some of the achievements they made during my tenure.    5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  Be yourself, and even if that doesn't seem to do much for you at first (grade/high school), you'll be a stronger human being when you get into the real world and meet people who will appreciate who you are. It only gets better.  Those sucked less than  urlLink last week's .

      I keep forgetting to link to a couple (well, 11)  urlLink pictures from the trip to Catalina . I don't remember how much I said when we first got back, but it was definitely a good time. I've filtered out the crappy pictures and the landscape shots, since most people find those emminently boring. I'll add a good one of the city, though, since it's striking in it's own way.

      Alas, my old car is no more. Watch  urlLink Kim's blog  for more details. The important part is that there were no injuries.  The funny thing about the weekend is, it's not really a weekend if you haven't been doing anything all week. Except that when I go outside in the middle of the day, there are a lot more people in my way.   My friend Marek is in Russia right now, and since my blog is boring I'm going to refer you all  urlLink to his  for exciting Slavic updates.

      A side-effect from not having much structure in my life right now is that I get to watch a LOT of daytime television. Not soap operas, mind you, but around here they put on Elimidate and The Fifth Wheel on  all the freakin' time .   So I'm watching Fifth Wheel, and there's this chick who says at the outset that she doesn't even kiss on the first date. Okay by me. The show moves on, she stays a little reserved, and they introduce the fifth wheel, a guy who  openly admits  to being a complete player.  Armed with this knowledge, and the later revelation that he's only in this to "get both [of the girls], even though neither are that interesting" what does this girl do? "I think Jason is really a sweet guy, he says he's a player but inside I think he's just nice!".  Cut to Jason: "Yeah she's okay. I'm just going to make her want me." But in the end, she got burned because she made out with him and of course, he didn't pick ANYBODY.   Sigh. Girls like that are the reason guys like him still operate that way. On the other hand, the other girl was much goofier and saw right through his game immediately and didn't try to "see the inner sensitivity" simply because he had nice abs. In summary, then: Men - 0, Women - 0. A draw.   The thing about guys, that everyone (not just women) should remember, is that we're NOT that deep and brooding. If a guy is truly a sensitive-nice-guy type, he'll reflect that fairly obviously. That doesn't mean he cries at the English Patient, but if he  specifically says  he's "very smooth, and a player" then please, don't try and find that "inner sensitivity". It ain't there, and if it is, it's not worth finding.

      Apparently I live near some kind of massive NetFlix hub, because although I signed up for the thing on Wednesday, I had movies in my mail on Thursday. That's quick! I remember Adam somehow returned his movies when he was out here in record time as well. That bodes well for NetFlix. They may actually be worth paying for if they're this fast.  Although, on the downside, one of the movies starting skipping badly in the last 20 minutes and so I haven't seen the end. I will check the disc out but that's sort of a pain.   I'm going to go brave the shower with my sunburn. If you hear me screaming, that's why. Owch!

      And thus we bid adieu to Hilary this evening. She and her east coast friend Virginia (haha - Virginia from the DC area) are leaving tomorrow on their Cross Country Trek. I think she will have a great time, and I will probably get a few postcards. :) That leaves Jaime, Cindy, and Lisa as my west coast friends. Obviously there are a few other people I know, and when summer classes start I can reconnect with a few of them, but as far as  good  friends, that's it.  Anyway, enough sad bastard writing. Today I went to the pool while doing my laundry, and figured it'd be alright that I don't have any suntan lotion because hey, it's only like 50 minutes while the laundry goes. Turns out I'm an idiot, and I'm pretty burned, at least on my chest. But now that I know about the wonders of aloe vera lotion, I'm not too worried. Ouch! This burn isn't even in my Top Five Worst Burns of All Time. Those honors belong to (in no particular order) Virgin Islands, Miami, Miami Redux, Michigan 2001, and Post-Prom Ocean City. Good times!

      X-Men 2 has been the best movie thus far this summer. Of course, it's only competition (for me) has been Matrix Reloaded, and I'm with Jason; it was entertaining and good but not great, and not as cool as the first. But perhaps when Matrix Revolutions comes out, it will tie the series together and thus improve the middle act.   I bit the bullet and signed up for  urlLink NetFlix  tonight; I was so impressed with the ease and cheapness (and Adam's recommendation) that I bit the bullet. Plus, I can cancel by June 4 if I feel like it. Probably won't, though. Movies at my place folks!

      Memorial Day, come and gone! Jaime's family had a big barbeque-type thing, so I headed on down Mexico-way and had a hamburger or 4. Some of their friends were there, including one family which (although I didn't confirm this) was made up of almost all foster/adopted kids. And by my count, there were 3,203 of them. That may be a bit off, but boy do kids fill up a house quick. :) I learned two new card games and remembered how Uno works. Kids are fun, I look forward to one day (August 26, 2011) having my own.   Now that everything is in repeats for summer, I've decided to recreate movie night. First, starting with just the DVD's I own, and eventually I'll get around to Blockbuster or maybe even that NetFlix thing.  Tomorrow: the pool! The weather is supposed to be hot hot hot!  Less exciting: laundry.

      It seems like life is really just a serious of interpersonal relationships, and men and women simply bounce from person to person. It's how many people define themselves and the phases of their lives - especially after school is over. When you're in highschool, college, and if applicable, grad school, you tend to think of your life in those chunks. But afterwards, life becomes more defined by your job and those you associate with. Not necessarily intimate relationships only, but every kind - business, friendship, family.  I think that's the best way to live. Your life can be your job, but eventually you will need more. Right now I'm in the thick of continuing my education, and so I look at my life more in terms of semesters. But I could also define it by my friends: who has come into my life, who has dropped out, and who has seen their status change (from friend to "more", or vice versa). It's an interesting way to view things - sort of like putting your records in autobiographical order instead of alphabetical.   I think I'm going to go watch "High Fidelity" again.

      Well moving day for Hilary (at least my part) is over, it's sort of sad to see her pack up her stuff, but of course she'll be back in a few months. Met a couple of her friends from back east, they're very cool. Hilary always has very interesting and entertaining friends. Even if one of them was a girl named Sam (argh!) - she was still pretty damn cool. Moving Hilary's stuff made me think of how much I don't mind moving, but that I really hate packing. I don't mind the day (or two) of heavy lifting - that's satisfying. But there's something about packing up all your stuff just to take it 2 or 3 miles and unpack it all again. Maybe that's why I just throw everything into drawers and skip the whole "boxing it up" part.   I'll be doing that later this summer!  Probably in late July, roundabout. I would like the cheapness of a 2BR, but I need a roommate I can get along with. If anyone reading this blog would like to be that roommate, come on out! :) But I think a studio/1BR will be fine, I'm a poor law student and probably shouldn't try and live too far beyond my means anyhow. But frankly, anything less than $800/month would be a step in the right direction.

      Friday Five again. Because my life is so boring right now I need to look to others for inspiration. And I'm aware that it is no longer Friday; I was hoping you east coasters would just chalk that up to the time difference.   1. What brand of toothpaste do you use?  I think it's Crest. Boring, utilitarian stuff. It may even have "Tartar Control".    2. What brand of toilet paper do you prefer?  I think the theme of this Five is "questions I don't care about". Let's just go with whatever's cheapest right now.   3. What brand(s) of shoes do you wear?  I have some Nike tennis shoes, but most of the time I wear my brown (designer: unknown) shoes or my Timberland sandals. Or nothing - going barefoot is one of life's small pleasures, unless you live near Hypodermic Beach or Shattered Glass Way.    4. What brand of soda do you drink?  Pepsi or Coke. Occasionally Dr. Pepper if I'm bored with those, sometimes an orange drink if available and the mood hits me. In college, Minute Maid and a cheese steak from Owen's was my standard meal.   5. What brand of gum do you chew?  Winterfresh, when I chew gum. Got a whole huge pack of it from Costco and I'm still working through.  That list was pretty lame. I promise to do something exciting in the next few days so that my blog doesn't become a total wasteland. Maybe when I help Hilary move, a biker gang will give us trouble and I'll single-handedly kung-fu their asses. Check back soon to find out!

      I just watched "Regis and Kelly" do a segment on cooking sausage on the barbeque. There was so much unintentional sexual innuendo I laughed out loud 3 or 4 times. The funniest part is that Regis and Kelly are so damn wholesome I don't think they even know. Well they might, but their audience sure doesn't.

      Today was more eventful, I helped Hilary pack up some of her stuff and move some boxes around. Of course, there will be more of that this weekend because she has to move all her stuff into storage by Wednesday when she leaves town. I've always enjoyed helping people move, I'm not really sure why. Glutton for punishment, I suppose. Of course when I helped Jason move like, 1,430 times in 6 months, that was pushing it. But that was 3 years ago. ;-)   Hilary's also fun to hang out with because she gives really good advice and (even more importantly) listens well. And boy do I have a lot to talk about these days, so having someone to put up with that is always good. Plus I get to hear about all the Section C gossip that's been going on now that school is over. It's a lot like high school, I hear about the cool kids but never actually hang out with them. The only difference is, this time I'm not very envious. Well maybe a little, but only because I've had so little to do this week. Boredom makes strange bedfellows.  Tomorrow I venture back to campus for the first time since last Wednesday. Sell some books, check on my financial aid (a little birdy told me it might be in already), look into some work study possibilities... a nice full day!

      I have absolutely nothing to report today. It was hot hot hot, I went to the pool and got a little sun. That's about the most interesting part. Didn't watch American Idol or anything, but I saw on CNN (what the hell?  slow news day) that the big dude won. Good for him. I'd rather see the giant man than the freaky looking white guy.   Life is a little bit strange right now; the transition between school and... less school has been surreal. I like having more time, but I'm so used to not having any it has been tough to fill. And, though I've said it before, I miss my school friends. I know I can be a pain sometimes, and so can they (sometimes) but I had gotten very used to having them around, and even though it has only been 4 days since I saw a few of them...  This summer is going to be very interesting, to say the least.

      During Finals week (well, week-and-a-half) I was a little stressed but generally okay. One thing I didn't have were dreams about Finals, even though there are probably thousands of anxiety-inducing possibilities.  Then, all of a sudden last night, I had not one but TWO dreams concerning finals. One was going to a study group but bringing every single wrong book with me. Another was going to my Torts final and not bringing any books or my laptop.   I found that odd. The other dreams I have are all of one type and for some reason refuse to go away. I can't recall a time I ever had recurring dreams like I am right, now it's quite odd. And no, I'm not getting into it here. :)  Today's plan: maybe run some errands? I look like a leper (sunburned face is peeling) so maybe not. Final Buffy ever tonight!  That makes me sad but... not terribly because Buffy always stops around this time of year. Summer and all. Check out the most excellent  urlLink Washington Post article  on why Buffy is/was so cool.

      And now... the summer.  I have at least a whole week of nothing "official" to do. I'm still working out the logistics in my head, but basically all I have are errands and loose ends (though to be honest, quite a few loose ends) to tie up. Top of the list is figuring out my summer employment options - I just need something that pays a few bills so that the summer doesn't completely drain my resources.  Unfortunately with a class (in a couple weeks) that limits my ability to do "full" time work. So I'll be reaching out to a few places looking for possibilities - if any of you know of anything, be sure and clue me in.  Saw "The Matrix Reloaded" last night. I've missed going to the movies, but between that and X2 I'm back in the swing of things. Short and sweet review: it wasn't too bad. Not as good as the first (too much exposition and blathering on) but the fight scenes were still wicked cool. Does anybody else get tired of listening to Morpheus speak?  Is he ever just normal?  Joe: Hey Morph, pass the carrots. Morpheus: Do you believe that I can pass the carrots, or that I am actually giving you a bowl of carrot-like substance? Or is it simply that you cannot begin to comprehend the complexity of your life inside what we now know is a world created for the singular reason of corrupting our minds and all minds that are without the clarity of Zion and all that wil be in existence in the future as is foretold by the prophecy of The One? Joe: Also the bread.

      Back! And apparently anytime I go out of town for a couple days everybody gangs up on me  urlLink via blog . Haha! I am glad Jason learned to spell "missus" correctly (misses? what the hell?). :)  Anyway, I'm tired (driving) and sore (hiking) and a little bit sad because I'm gonna miss hanging out with those folks this summer. I mean, I'll probably see them a few more times before they all head to their international programs (I count San Diego as "other worldly" and thus am hanging around here) but not everyday like during class.   But Catalina was fun. I have many digital pictures, many of which suck, and I'll try and find a way to post them, perhaps with Marek's FTP help. In any case, I'll post more later when I'm not so exhausted.   Although I did snag Vice City on the way home and played for a bit. It's nice to be back in GTA-land, but it's sort of a pain to learn the layout of a new city. Funny and even more risque than the first. Also the motorcycles are pretty damn cool. Tomorrow: Matrix sequel!

      No regular updates for a couple days - I'm off for my mini-vacation with the study group kids. It should be an interesting couple of days.    Then when I get back it's all about Vice City and The Matrix Reloaded. So I may never update again. ;)

       Done and Done.   Unless I've failed all my finals, I am now officially 1/3rd the way through law school.   There's not much more to it than that, so no elaboration is necessary.   In other news, actually  urlLink Jason   is  creepy, just not in any way  urlLink Kim  has noticed yet. Well, if she meant the same Jason that is. :) He's also a damn liar for not updating his blog on sunday OR monday as was stated. Bollox!

      This is why I hate the  urlLink RIAA . What a bunch of punks. I can't wait till I'm a lawyer and can sue the hell out of the record industry.  Good times!  Speaking of becoming a lawyer, one final left tomorrow!  Had what I thought was a very productive study group today, I feel pretty good about Contracts for the most part. Plus, the test is only multiple choice (although closed-note) and I kicked its ass last semester. All good things.  New Buffy tonight! Second-to-last episode, too! Check out the interesting perspective on  urlLink Salon.com . I've always thought Spike was cool but... somehow didn't fit in with the rest of the characters in the way that the writers were forcing him to. My 2 cents.

      Three down, one to go. Finals are like Chinese Water Torture, I tell you whut. From now until 1:30 Wednesday, I'm all about Contracts Contracts Contracts. So if you have a contract send it to me and I'll tell you what the deal is. :)   That reminds me,  urlLink U.S. News & World Report  released their new "rankings" and I'm proud to say that USD is in the  urlLink Top 100!  This doesn't mean that much because rankings are a bunch of hooey anyhow, and this is the first year they've dismantled the 2nd Tier (USD's previous home), but I was still glad to see USD higher than my alternative prospect, Rutgers. Take that, New Jersey! :)    urlLink Adam  posed an interesting question in his blog today: which Democrat (if any) should I back in 2004? Lord knows I don't have any confidence in the Dems to knock Dubya out of office, but I always vote and thus must choose SOMEbody to be the sacrificial lamb. My vote, however, is not with Lieberman, primarily because of the massive stick he has up his ass concerning censorship and violent video games. It's scarier than people think, not only does he lean in the direction of banning violent video games, he was a huge proponent of doing so back when it was the "in thing to do" (i.e. post-Columbine, pre-GTA3 hysteria). Lots of people in the game industry hate him with a passion because of his nonsensical views, and he has made video and computer games a scapegoat for problems that are rooted in parenting, not entertainment.   That being said, I sort of like one of the Johns (Kerry or Edwards) and would totally love Howard Dean if I thought he had a snowball's chance in hell. Alas, he doesn't, and the rest of them are sort of milquetoasty (like always). Maybe  I'll  run... wait you have to be 35. Damn.

      I had a dream last night that Raf told me a car drove through part of his (my old) apartment, into the kitchen. Some other stuff happened, but the key part was that I told him if he wanted to sue, he could sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress (since he had no uncompensated damages otherwise).  I'm  so  glad that I dream about negligence cases now. Today's uber-review probably won't help the situation.   It will be nice if I remember to take a look at this Thursday's  urlLink lunar eclipse . Lots more common than a solar eclipse, sure, but still cool to see.

      The current state of copyright bothers me intensely. Most notably, the enormous (and expanding) time limit that authors/artists enjoy. The original purpose behind copyright was to ensure authors and musicians the royalties from their creations  for their lifetimes . Thanks to lobbying efforts, primarily from Disney and other large media conglomerates, that time limit (somewhere between 14 and 28 years) has been expanded to a grossly unfair  70 years . Unless you write a book when you're five years old, it is unlikely that any author will even come even close to outliving his or her works. So why is Disney pushing (and very close to getting) another extension to 150 years? For the obvious reason: Disney isn't going anywhere, and Disney holds thousands of copyrights.   Perhaps the founding fathers didn't foresee the development of essentially immortal copyright holders. The entire purpose behind copyright (in my opinion, that is) is to give authors an incentive for creation while limiting the inheritability of such creations. Aside from strange contractual obligations, copyright is one of the only areas where the heirs of a "creator" hold so much power. We don't let the children of CEO's simply slide into the seat when their parent dies; we don't give professional athletes' kids a spot on the roster simply because the athlete died before his 70 year contract was over. The heirs will argue that they should be allowed to reap the profits of the ancestors, but they already do - they get the estate money just like the rest of us. Unlike the rest of us, however, copyright heirs also get the rights to new publications of books and music written long, long ago. Publications they had no part in creating or developing whatsoever. This is because of the spectacularly lame 70 year protection. If copyright were only for 30 years, then after that time the works become public domain and nobody has to pay to reprint them. That's why the works of Charles Dickens are reprinted by 12 different publishing companies every year - they don't have to ask for permission anymore.  Maybe therein lies my problem with copyright. Music and books are, to a high degree, intangible commodities at the core. Sure, you can go buy a book, but what you're paying for are the ideas and stories within. Once you read that, you could tell those stories to whoever you wanted. And unlike other commodities (like oil, lumber, or nerf footballs) the using of the commodity doesn't take anything away from the original. 10 people can read one book, and all have shared in the commodity without detracting from the book itself. A million people could - but if a million people tap an oil deposit, the deposit will soon run dry. With this in mind, it seems absurd to try to restrict use of such intellectual property beyond a reasonable period for recoupment of expenses by the creator. If your book is wildly popular, then you'll make a mint and your kids can see some of that someday. But instead of allowing your children to rest on your laurels until the end of time, a limited copyright would give authors a much stronger incentive to create something new. Stephen King would be exactly as rich today under a 30 year copyright as he is under a 70 year copyright. The difference lies in how rich his children's children will be in 50 years. And in my socialist-leaning view, they shouldn't get squat for the creativity of their long gone ancestors.  This may be why I'm a huge fan of the so-called "death tax" as well, but that's a post for another day. :) Oh,  urlLink here's what set me off  in the first place.

      Hey I'm actually doing the  urlLink Friday Five  on Friday for once. It must be the apocalypse! This one is more appropriate to my life than usual, so I figured it was worth doing. Also I'm procrastinating because I hate Torts.   1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  No. Well, maybe. I forget to pay bills, send out birthday cards, and other such things. That's not very organized. But I try to keep some parts of my life organized as best as is possible.  2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  I use Outlook on my laptop, I have my calendar and to-do list on there. I only see it when I bother to a) use my laptop and b) open Outlook. Since I don't use it for mail, that's not terribly often.  3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  Lord no. My desk is a mess. Also it's just a computer desk, so what do you want from me?  4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  Sometimes. When  urlLink Adam  was here he put my DVD's in alphabetical order. That was nice. And although it's not the same, some who know me best know about my infamous List of Movies. I won't get into that just now.  5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  My outlines, especially the Property outline. What a bear that thing was.     "Nine hundred dollary-doos!? Tobias!" The Australian episode of The Simpsons is truly one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

      Two down, two to go. The tough(er) ones are now out of the way, and I'm going to take a few hours this afternoon to (gasp!) not think about school. It's been about 3 weeks since I've had that opportunity. I think perhaps some SimCity is in order.  I could go "outside" to the pool, but it's still a little too chilly for my newly Californized blood. I'll leave the pool/beach-going for the vacation period (which is only 6 days away now!).  Also: except for Thursday morning (getting up early to go to Catalina) I don't  have  to wake up before noon again until... June 10th. How sweet is that?  Note: I will, of course, get up by 10 everyday, as that is how my biological clock is now set, but still.  It's the thought that counts. All you working stiffs can suck it down!

      So, sometimes I'm too opinionated about certain things. Well, scratch that, I'm opinionated about many things. As a general rule, I try not to theorize about things I have no experience with, and I think that has generally worked out well. There is a flip side, however, because although some people (friends, family, etc.) have realized that most of what I say is just an opinion, there are others who, although I consider them dear friends, haven't picked up on that exactly. Sometimes what I say is seen as preachy, or patronizing, or even like I'm giving orders.  Although I don't believe it has  ever  been my intention to actually preach, patronize, or order, I have also been of the opinion that "if you can't see that, that's not my fault." Well, it's time for a change. I have a number of dear friends that, although we see eye-to-eye 90% of the time, they misunderstand when I disagree with them on the other 10%. And although I do believe I am both entitled to my opinion and within my rights to express it, it is also my responsibility to keep misunderstandings to a minimum. Therefore I will be making a conscious, concerted effort to keep my opinions to myself unless expressly asked for. Because even though I think part of being friends, especially good friends, is sharing what you think, if that sharing is misunderstood then it is more of a burden than a benefit (oops, a little Property snuck in there).   Of course this doesn't mean I expect others to refrain from giving opinions; I hope most people will continue to do so because I have always felt quite blessed to have the input of so many very intelligent and observant people. But until I can find a way to return the favor without offending, that'll be a one-way street.  Civ Pro Final in... 9 1/2 hours! Keep those fingers crossed for me.

       Boys of Summer Update:  At least the pathetic Tigers are  urlLink kicking the ass of my hometown team.  I used to hate the O's like I hate the Redskins (i.e. with all the depth of my soul) but they've been so bad for so long that it's easier to just pity them. At this point I don't hate them anymore, but the Tigers have won 4 straight (since starting 3-25) thanks to the boys from Baltimore.  FYI - I still hate the Redskins with a passion so great they will write epic poetry about it. Not that they're not pathetic, it's just... different. That's a whole 'nother post.

       I don't watch American Idol as a generaly rule. That's because, as a general rule, there's always something better on (and by better, I mean even a test pattern). But tonight, I can't find a test pattern or Cops-esque show to waste time while fixing my outline for CivPro, so I figured "why not give American Idol a shot?"  So with that disclaimer in mind (that I'm new) I have a few questions. Is that militaryish guy supposed to still be on the show? Is he the one Kim mentioned as having a horrible voice, because if there's someone worse than him  in the universe  then I have to believe that God is dead. Also, the other skinny guy - he's just about the freakiest looking person I've ever seen on television (and I saw Deliverance on TV once). I couldn't decide whether he was male or female (I'm still not sure - I was guessing about the "guy" part). I have yet to see him actually sing so I reserve judgment on that part. The big dude is pretty good though. Did he eat the other contestants?  That is all!

      One down!   I love that I've never left a test in law school feeling all that great about my performance. I don't end up doing too badly (at least, as far as one whole semester of grades can tell me) but it's unusual to go through 30+ multiple choice questions and realize that you were really only  sure  about, oh, two of them. Le sigh.  And now it's on to Civil Procedure, which will not kick my ass as much as Property because I won't let it. Also it's open note throughout. Also I am better at CivPro. Also I'm going to cheat.  Haha!  Not that last one. Cross your fingers for me (and keep 'em crossed until next Wednesday).

Nevermind that I don't want to be licensed to drive in Virginia, I don't own a car in Virginia, and I don't live in Virginia. Man when Finals are over I am going to write them the angriest letter you have ever seen. I feel bad for yelling at the poor phone guy, I know it's not his fault but he was like "there's just one more thing, you need to pay us for no reason."  I'm gonna bust a verbal cap in the DMV Commissioner Ab Quillian's head.

Today I'm all about the practice exams and note review. I think I'm gradually getting more and more prepared, so that hopefully tomorrow by 1:30 I'll be sittin' pretty!

      Working out only once a week is hard on the system, man. This week my goal is to work out almost every day, I need to get back in the habit. After all, summer's coming and there's a slight possibility I will want to go to the beach at  some  point. I do live in one of the top resort areas in the western hemisphere, you know.  Special note to all you blogging freaks: update more often! I would think that with me setting the bar for entertaining and informative posts so low, everyone else would feel much better about their own blogs. However with that in mind, here are the (as always late) Friday Five:   1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.  Anything by Michael Jackson. His early stuff, that is. Like Smooth Criminal. And of course those 70s/80s power ballads (i.e. anything famous by Journey or Foreigner).   2. Name two songs that always make you cry.  Yeah right. There are songs that I associate with sad things, and while they can make me quite melancholy, they don't make me cry. Puh-lease. Nevertheless, those songs might be "I Believe" by Stevie Wonder, "Wild Horses" by the Stones (and/or the Sundays), and "Warning Sign" by Coldplay.    3. Name three songs that turn you on.  I don't think so. "Let's Get It On" is sexy, as are many Barry White tunes. And a certain pop idol's first single, while not directly turning  me  on, now makes me think of other people being turned on.    4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.  "Tiny Dancer", "Everloving" by Moby, "White Wedding", and... the James Bond theme.    5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.  "Fade Into You" (Mazzy Star), "Freebird", "Lovesong" (The Cure), anything by REM... this isn't really a fair question as there are many songs that I will always want to have around.  On retrospect that's a pretty weak Friday Five. Oh well. Off to the library!

       urlLink   So I was a huge comic book geek in my formative years, and I still have quite a bit of random X-Men information floating around in my skull these days. X-Men 2 put my brain to the full test, there were cameos and references and all kinds of awesome goodness that made my memory light up. I won't get into any of it now (because spoiling movies sucks) but I was quite pleased with the overall tone and plot of the movie. The pacing was better, there was more action but the same amount of character development (it's nearly 45 minutes longer than the first, I believe) and the ending really surprised me, but in a good way.   I hope X3 gets made. I may go see this one again after Finals is over.  And, of course, after I see The Matrix Reloaded. Hooray movies!

       Done and done! I have finished all my classes in my first year of law school, which is worthy of... well recognition. Of course, the hard part is yet to come - Finals start on Wednesday and go for a week.   Right now I'm also signed up for a bit o' summer school - Evidence, a 4-credit course that meets (hold your breath on this one) Tuesday through Friday from 8am to 10am. Talk about your early summer mornings!  The upside? I have my day wide open after that. While I expect Evidence to be difficult and thus require a great deal of reading, that's still a good deal of time in which to relax by the pool or the beach, or (more likely) play the hell out of GTA:Vice City.   First things first. It's crunch time so I need to get back to my study plan for today. Wish me luck, or, in the alternative, please do not wish me any specific harm. Thanks.

      I went and bought a digital camera, since I figured why not and I got a good deal at Gateway. It finally showed up today after an eternity of UPS limbo, but I have nothing interesting to take pictures of so the world will have to wait.  As of this moment I have only one more class in my 1st year of law school (though I do have 4 finals over the next 2 weeks) and while that's nice it makes me almost nostalgic. I'm going to volunteer at orientation for the newbie 1st Years this fall, because I'd like to impart some wisdom that I wish I had been privy when I was starting out.   Now it is time for the Festival of Pain: Finals Edition (Part Two). I'm going to make up a study plan that details all the studying I have to do until the very end, and I'm going to try my damnedest to stick to it. Is damnedest a word? Anyway, aside from a break this Saturday to see X-Men (I caved into my visceral side) I will be a shut-in until May 14. Of course I'll still update the blog, because it's easy to do, but maybe not often because not that many interesting things are bound to happen between now and the end of the year.   Oh but I did get my tentative class schedule - I'm in all the classes I  urlLink mentioned earlier  except for Professional Responsibility, which is no big loss. Instead I've tossed on Corporations, but right now that gives me 16 credits so we'll see if I really stick to that. FYI, 16 is the maximum allowed. But Corps. is a 4 credit course, so I didn't have much choice. It's being taught by Prof. Smith (my current Contracts teacher and the guy who gave me my highest grade last semester) so I'm still interested.   That was simply fascinating, wasn't it? I don't know why Adam's so concerned about having boring stuff in his blog when, compared to mine, his is Pulitzer material. Perhaps that whole "brevity" thing isn't as overrated as I thought.

      Man if you want to visit San Diego, this is prime-time, baby. Beautiful weather, the wimmins are out and dressed in the minimum amount of clothes required by California state law (8 square inches of fabric) and the mens are shirtless, if that's your thing.   Downside: if you live in my apartment, you spend the majority of the afternoon in sauna-like heat. Some day I might be persuaded to turn on the ol' A/C but for now I make my non-existent guests suffer.   Had dinner with Jaime tonight to give her a proper send-off; she leaves for Oxford-by-way-of-London tomorrow, thus rounding out the study group summer abroad. Bon voyage I say! I know she will enjoy it, as I believe everyone else is.   I'm gonna go sweat off some more pounds just by sitting. Yay San Diego!

      So  urlLink Dennis Miller  has gone Republican, but I can't decide whether to be annoyed or unsurprised, because he hasn't been funny for years. I don't remember the last time I heard one of his bits and laughed, so perhaps his turn to "the dark side" is irrelevant.  That being said, when he was being funny he was equal-opportunity scathing. Republicans, Democrats, whoever - Miller skewered stupid behavior, and I can back that. But now he's performing at GOP fundraisers? That's a bit less "equal" if you ask me.   For my money, the funniest and smartest comic around right now is Jon Stewart. If you're not watching the Daily Show, you're missing out on something huge. Now that I have cable again, and with it Fox News and CNN, I'm remembering how much I hate the media these days. I also remember how much I miss having a good ol' fashioned debate with a conservative, like I did in college.  In other news, the power went out last night on a routine "scheduled outage" - except that I'm an idiot, and when I read the letter that said "12:01am Sunday to about 6am" I, being of unsound mind, assumed that was Sunday night (not Saturday). Right in the middle of Terminator 2, bam! Lights out, thanks for playing! I need to learn how to read.

      Finally got my California license! The long,  long  battle with the DMV may have finally ended. Of course, I'll be changing my address next month, so I'll have to talk to them again. Sigh. Also SDG&E turned my power off again, but this time it was their fault, not mine. I still had no power for an entire Friday afternoon, which was inconvenient. The upside was it gave me an excuse to go and finally finish  urlLink The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay  by the pool. Good book!  Now I need some suggestions for another book to read - Evidence gives me plenty of work, but not so much that I can't read for pleasure this summer.   Caught an episode of MST3k this morning. Man have I missed that show, so funny! Too keep this flow of random thoughts complete, tonight I'll be having Chinese food, which I haven't had in approximately 5 months. Hooray for old things revisited!

      I wanted to mention yesterday - the Supreme Court is currently in the throes of decisioning (not a word) and while I won't be commenting on the cases (because I'm not remotely qualified), you should check out  urlLink this discourse  on  urlLink Slate.com . Two extraordinarily intelligent people, both of whom hold opinions quite similar to my own leftist view. Dahlia Lithwick in particular is a wonderful writer and one of the reasons I went to law school. Seriously! Anyway, check it out for some good discussion on the affirmative action case, the library porn, and today, the Texas sodomy case.  If you can't commit sodomy in Texas, where  can  you?

      If anybody gets a virus from me today, I apologize profusely. I never open those unknown attachments, but this time it was from someone here on campus that I was expecting an attachment from. Damn you Internet! Of course immediately it starts sending out emails because that's what these virii do - they replicate, being more annoying than damaging. I think Norton was catching most of them as infected (where was the AV when I downloaded the email, hmm?) but if something gets through, my apologies to those unfortunate enough to be in my address book.   urlLink Adam's story about pee  is pretty funny, even if only in textualized form. I've been there. Well, not peeing-all-over-myself-in-a-parking-lot there, but having to go really bad and not having a single place to do it. Ouch!  Sorry for the lack of updates yesterday, but as you blog-types probably noticed the system was down for an upgrade. I haven't had a chance to tour the new look, but hopefully it will be more stable than before. I might consider dropping some cash if it is.   Last night's dream: Courtney Cox and dental floss. That's all I'm saying.

      Interesting article on the effec that the Internet has had on  urlLink Copyright laws.  As you all know, I hate copyright law as it stands and is interpreted today. But I won't rant about it right now, I'll just let you read the article.  Sun came out today! I look forward to when it comes out every day. That should be soon, from what the locals tell me.

      Damn, I missed a day! From the lack of a Sunday update, you might believe that my day was so chock full of busy-ness that I was unable to find the time to blog. You fool! In fact my day was as exciting as burned toast. Assuming you don't like burned toast, that is.  In the past few days, I have watched American Pie 2, Amistad, Igby Goes Down, and The Score. American Pie 2 was just as funny as the original, which is to say I didn't think it was very funny. Once again, however, there was a single moment that made me laugh out loud. In the first one it was when Jason Biggs falls down while running home to be with the foreign chick; in the second it was at the very end. See if you can guess what it was! First prize is a big wet kiss.  Amistad was on ABC saturday night, and while I had planned to watch The Score I got caught up in it despite the many commercials. It was unedited, however, which was appreciated, and parts were pretty disturbing. Djimon Honsou (or however it might be spelled) is a great actor. Speaking of good actors, everyone in Igby Goes Down was pretty great, even though I found the film a bit uneven. Still, good to see one of those Culkin kids not selling oranges by the side of the highway.  The Score was entertaining but had a very weak ending. Standard Movie Plot, Slight Twist, Slight Twist, Huge Twist Immediately Revealed to be Fake, The End! It's funny to see Marlon Brando in anything, the man is just out of his gourd. In The Score, director Frank Oz had trouble shooting him below the waist because Brando refused to wear pants. I think I'll do that this week (refuse to wear pants). You know, just to mix things up.

      There's an interesting split between those who believe the judicial system exists to provide justice, and those who believe it exists to enforce the law as written. Jaime was reading a book today called "Justice v. Law" that brought up a case directly on that point. Those who believe in justice feel that courts should bend, stretch and, when necessary for justice to be served, even break the rules that have been set by the legislature. Those who believe in law are stricter in their reading of statute and rule, and feel that legislature should craft the law and the judiciary should simply interpret those rules and apply them to particular situations. The difference between the two sides are at once both eerily similar and starkly different.   While this may sound all well and good, most law students and many people can tell you the law and justice do not commonly meet in the same place. While it may be "the law" that a father who shoots his child's murderer is himself a murderer, justice often tells us the opposite. That's why there are many exceptions and nuances to law, quirks that afford people like the vengeful father a chance at a reduced sentence. For while we cannot completely condone such actions, there are loopholes and procedural rules that a judge can choose to follow strictly or leniently, depending on where the judge's sense of "justice" falls.  The second problem is for every definition of "justice" there are a million others that are slightly or even drastically different. Whose definition do we follow? Are there really some issues on which justice is clear, or is clarity only a cover for the majority opinion? We find the same problem in defining what is moral. This is one of the reasons that, at least in my opinion, the law should be followed over the concerns of justice. While this may seem offensive at first, it must be remembered that the law is crafted  to serve  the interests of justice. Unfortunately, this requires a degree of faith in those who craft the law, and in these trying times our faith in those may be sorely tested and waning.   Of course, I don't have a solution or anything, but I wanted to lay that out for my own brain's sake. I could be horribly wrong, it has been known to happen. Still cloudy out in San Diego! I would really like the summer to come back. I think next summer I'll try and take a month-long break in June and go to Miami.

      Slow day. I played a little online Half-Life for the first time in about 3 years, which was nostalgic and fun. Although I had some trouble remembering how things worked, by the end of the 2nd hour I was kicking everyone's ass again.  Hulk comes out this weekend! So far I'm hearing good things, so perhaps it will avoid the fate of Daredevil (i.e. sucking complete ass). I probably won't see it this weekend, though.  The cable guy just came to my door to check on my channel availability. They've been having some problems with people not getting their full set. When I told him I only got the basic 24-channel set, he told me he could give me all 76 channels for just 10 bucks more. I made sure he was a real cable guy and then said hey why not! Should provide a bit more company during these lonely summer months. :) Comedy Central, how I've missed you!  The nicest part is I don't have to get the stupid digital crap - which was all they wanted to give me when I first moved out here.  The cosmic ballet goes on.

      My little  urlLink love note to Samantha Brown  is resulting in a number of hits from people who searched for her and/or "Great Hotels". I find this very odd because my little ol' blog is like, 34th on any search you do of those topics. Who goes that far down the list?  Tell me, you internet wanderers! The funny part is, this post will only perpetuate the situation.  In other news, I still love her. Haha! Today was the first full-length Evidence class, which surprisingly went faster than I thought it would. Our hippie teacher is quite good at keeping everyone interesting and involved. After class I spent 2 hours in the library reading for tomorrow, and I still had time to come home and finish playing through Half-Life: Opposing Force. And it's only 3:30!   Later this week I will start looking for a new apartment. It's about that time, although maybe a bit early to look, but when it comes to moving on a deadline (July 31) sooner is better. The goal: cheap, safe, and convenient. Not necessarily nice, though I would kill for a washer/dryer or a dishwasher. Seriously, tell me who to ice.

      I forgot to note,  urlLink 1,000 hits!  It's less exciting because the milestone must be tempered by the fact that it counts my visits as well, and since I check my own blog at least twice a day (after posting, to check for errors or to make sure formatting is correct) I haven't had  exactly  1,000 visits. I'd give an award to the 1,000th visitor, except that it was me.   Also I've only had this counter since April, not since the beginning of the blog. Today is Haircut Library Day, so wish me luck.

      I've heard that the next Real World is going to be in San Diego. Who thinks I should apply?!? Free housing for a little while, and I'm practically new to the area anyhow. We used to joke about what it would be like for Adam, Raf or I to be on a season of the Real World, no matter where it was...  (Linkin Park playing in background) Housemate: We need to call a house meeting! Raf (staring intently at computer monitor): Can't do it. I'm totally kicking this guy's ass. Housemate 2: Rafael c'mon! We need to decide what to do about Generic Good-Looking Midwestern Guy and Sassy East-Coast Bisexual Girl! Raf: HAHA! I totally just killed him with grenades and stole the documents!   Housemate: Sigh.  Well, I don't think I'm going to try out, but I will make it my mission to hook up with one of the cast members. Or TP their house and mess with the show, ala the citizens of Seattle (or was that New Orleans?). Either way, watch for my small-screen debut! Other than the time I was on CNN while at the Tibetan Freedom Festival.

      I'm not sure how exactly I stumbled across these, but there are a couple blogs that I check now that are (gasp!) written by people I don't know. But they're so entertaining, I've actually gone back for more. Go figure! Anyway, you people (you people being the 5 or 6 regulars and the 5 or 6 occasional readers) should check them out if you're bored.   urlLink Ari Goes Down  updates a few times a week.  urlLink Fish Bicycle  is a little more frequent. I think both of them live in Manhattan (edit: or Boston), so maybe that's the allure. I don't have too much interaction with "fast-talking east coasters" out here. Hell I don't have much interaction with  anybody  out here these days.

      What a completely useless day, and not even in a good way. More of a I'm-bored-and-the-summer-will-suck-if-it-stays-this-way sort of thing. Nothing else to say, except everyone I know pretty much refused to call me back today. That's just one of those things that bugs me, even though it usually turns out that most people have a good excuse. Still annoying when it happens 3 times in one day though.  That's all.

      I think I'm in love with the Travel Channel's  urlLink Samantha Brown , host of "Great Hotels". She defines the term "cute as a button", which up until a few days ago I had never seen in a grown woman. But then I watched 2,304 episodes of Great Hotels (this is what happens when you have 12 channels to choose from) and I'm smitten.   The downside: she is, of course, a girl named Sam. And as we all agree, girls named Sam are the devil's succubi. I'd make an exception for her, though. I think she has a boyfriend but I can ignore that if she can.   In other news, I finally got my financial aid for the summer, and it's a significant bit more than I expected. In fact, I think it's about what I got for the entire spring semester. This is odd because I only need to pay rent for 2 months before getting my financial aid for fall. But hey, I'm not complaining about too much money. If it's really too much, I can give it back at the end of the summer. Not that I'd actually DO that, of course. I also fixed my phone, finally. No more battery-that-lasts-8-minutes!   Note to  urlLink Dad : Yes, that is communism. But good luck!

      Wow, both David Brinkley and Gregory Peck got  urlLink knocked off  in the last 24 hours. That's pretty sad, both were giants of their respective fields.  To Kill a Mockingbird  is one of the best movies of all time.  Not much else to report today. Lisa's getting screwed by Geico, that sucks. I won't go into details, but once they say "you're hired" and you give your 2 weeks notice at your current job, you shouldn't have to worry about things changing. Stupid Geico. I'd change insurance companies in protest, if I thought anybody would notice. Makes me want to go into employment law, except that if you fight on the side of the little guy you can pretty much guarantee yourself a tough life. Also it bores the hell out of me, most days.

      Our new Evidence teacher (the one not dying) is pretty cool. She's funny and seems to have a good way of teaching about her. This whole "getting up early" thing is rough but I'll get the hang of it. I got roughly 7 hours last night, and although 7am is always painful (no matter when you go to bed) it wasn't too bad today. Two more days! Then the weekend. Then 6 more weeks. Then... another whole semester.  Then another. Then a summer of working. Then another semester, and another. Then graduation! Then the Bar exam, somewhere. Then I toil and sweat until I turn 65 and/or die.   A quick recap for those just joining us. I need to think of a new theme, like "Law Fact of the Day" but, less complicated. Evidence doesn't really lend itself to that anyway.

      Summer Classes: Denied!   I slept badly, being neurotic and worried about missing a disasterously early class today, but woke up at 7am and dragged my ass to campus for my first ever Evidence class.   Our teacher, however, did not do the same. He has a good excuse - he went back to Missouri because he's having "major medical problems" and thus can't teach Evidence this summer. The administrators are working on a replacement and they are "fairly sure" they'll get one.   If they don't, I'm up a creek. I need to take something else this summer, but my options are limited to Professional Responsibility and Tax. Tax is at 5:30 at night, so I'd rather not do that. Professional Responsibility is the more likely candidate, but the whole point of that class is to take a test at the end (a real test - not a final, it's related to the Bar exam) and I have a travel conflict. I could take the test any other time, and so that's what I may do, but damn yo! I'm still hoping they work out this Evidence snafu. I really wanted to get that class out of the way this summer.  At least I don't have any homework tonight. Guess I'll play Diablo for an hour or six.

      Is this right? According to MSN's detailed analysis, this is who I am:   Element : Earth  Mode : Cardinal   Ruler : Saturn  Color : Black, Dark Green, Cherry Red   Strengths : Ambitious, authoritarian, calm, demanding, diligent, diplomatic, efficient, focused, genial, loyal, patient, pragmatic, profound realistic   Weaknesses : Calculating, despotic, indifferent, inflexible, moody, schoolmasterly, severe, skeptical, opinionated, rigorous   Capricorn, the tenth sign of the zodiac, represents discipline, ambition, and rationality, making you the most determined and persistent sign of the zodiac, Sam. Since you have such an unshakable faith in your own power, you have an extreme capacity for hard work and endurance.   Saturn, the planet of challenges and restrictions, is the ruler of Capricorn. Saturn is sometimes associated with bad luck; however, without the obstacles of Saturn we would never grow and evolve any further, which makes this planet the one that makes us tough, because it teaches us to develop patience and staying power.   Sam, Capricorn is the third earth sign, which means you know that you cant live on inspiration alone, and therefore, you have become a down-to-earth realist, and are willing to take care of the daily chores. For that reason, stability and consistency are very important to you.   You, Capricorn, rule the tenth house of the horoscope, a sector associated with career, social standing, and personal aspirations. Furthermore, this house describes your ambitions and goals in life, as well as your public image and your reputation in your social circles.   Capricorn is a cardinal sign, meaning that you dont wait for others to take action - you charge right in making full use of your qualities of pragmatism, efficiency, and diligence.   My Analysis : I forgot I don't believe in astrology. So never mind about all this. I like the idea that I'm "despotic" though, maybe I'll buy a monocle and a cape with a big red fist emblem on the back and start my own secret cabal of world-domineering psychotics.

      I was chatting with a  urlLink friend  who is a waitress last night, and it occurred to me that most guys have no idea how to correctly act when interested in Your Server This Evening.  So, here you go:   How to Ask Out Waitresses  The biggest thing to remember is that inherently, wait-people don't like you. I don't care how nice you are and how nice they seem, they're at work and they'd rather not be, just like the rest of us. You may be having fun with your friends, but your waitress is trying to make enough money to pay the rent next week. Thus, the first (and most obvious) rule is Tip Well. Even if you don't want to go out with your waitress, tip her well. If you don't, she may mention that to the hot waitress you DO want to hook up with, and that'll put the kibosh on your plan. Anyway, after that it's a matter of patience. Become a regular so that she knows your name, and after a friendly interaction has been established (friendly is key - if you're a regular asshole, or a regular drunk who gives her trouble, being "regular" isn't that helpful) wait for a night that A) you know she's working and B) will be slow. Then, and really ONLY then, do you have a shot at success. There are exceptions, of course, and the mathematical equation is that Your Attractiveness is inversely proportional to Time You Must Wait. So if you're Brad Pitt, go ahead and ask her out the first time you visit. But if you're Joe Shmoe, you'd better wait.  There are other alternate strategies as well, like going back at closing time which could be seen either as sweet (that you'd come back) or scary (you stalker freak). It's a gamble. Also, this theory is sort of applicable to other service-oriented professions. Adjust where necessary.  Next week: The Perils of Online Dating.

      For the record, I'm not joining a kickball team. No matter what blog-related  urlLink peer   urlLink pressure  I might be subjected to. I'm busy enough with all my sun-soaked honeys! :)  That reminds me - Friday Five a day late, anyone? This one is particularly introspective.   1. How many times have you truly been in love?  Truly? At least once. Maybe twice, but the second time was so much stronger than the first that it's hard to call them both "in love".    2. What was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most?  She was kind, smart, beautiful, and put up with me for a lot longer than she should have.   3. What qualities should a significant other have?  Passion! About something/anything, because if you have passion about your work, your hobby, or something else, then you at least have potential passion in a relationship. And that's key.   4. Have you ever broken someone's heart?  Unfortunately I think I have. I'd much rather have mine broken than do that again.   5. If there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be?  That why we fall in love is a complete fucking mystery, and you can't control it or stop it. It's part of life and living and meeting people, and if you try and hide from it you'll condemn yourself to a miserable existence.  That's for making me depressed,  urlLink FridayFive ! Combine that with the cloudiness and the rain in normally-sunny San Diego, and you've got a brilliant weekend.

      Grades! Hmmm. How to put this exactly... I will still be in law school next year! I won't get into details but I did pretty much average. I did not do as well this semester as I did last semester, and I'm not really sure why that is, but I did not do horribly. I believe the operative term is "nothing to write home about". :)  Last night I went to the gym with Jaime and Cindy, and pretty much got over my hatred of gyms and such. I realized that the reason I avoided gyms was primarily based on experience in college with the college gyms, and none of those experiences translate to commercial gyms like 24 Hour Fitness (a west coast gym chain). So, with that in mind, I may just go join up next week, especially if I can lie and get on Jaime's membership as her brother. It's not really lying because that's what the gym guy was going for. I had to shoot him down (because today I am poor and I like to think about this stuff) but we'll see. I think also that since I'm pretty tight with money these days (well, compared to when I was working) paying for a gym membership would push me to go more often. As would the fact that if one other person is there, I can still use the machine (currently not the case with our low-rent, apartment-provided weight "room").  Right!  Also bought books and scammed a better parking pass for the summer. Classes start early, early, early Tuesday morning. Today: Staples! Must repair stupid home phone. The battery now lasts approx. 10 minutes per phone call. wtf? It's weird when your cell phone battery lasts 2 hours, and my home phone battery lasts 45 seconds. Black is white!

      My Dad did those 30 questions as well. It's kind of interesting to see how some of the questions play out from a non-young person perspective. I wonder - when I will no longer be considered "young"? There's always somebody older, that's true (unless you're that Chinese guy who's like 114 years old. In which case Welcome to the Internet!), but I'm now on the sunset side of my twenties (yeah yeah, just barely). Am I still a "young person"? Or must I relinquish my membership card for that particular subgroup of pop-culture and just be some guy? A twenty-something? Closer to 30 than to 20 is a scary place to be, folks. Wait till you see the nervous breakdown I have on Jan. 3, 2008!  Anyway, check out  urlLink my Dad's answers  if you haven't already. See if you can spot any similarities.

       urlLink Round 1  of the sure-to-be-remembered-for-ages epic series between the two absolute worst teams in baseball has gone to the boys from Motown! The Padres, being my adopted NL team because I live in San Diego and because they're horrible (obviously a prerequisite for me liking a team - see Lions, Detroit and Red Wings, Swept in Playoffs) are just not as good as the Tigers, who will win the World Series in 2018, or possibly in 2074 when baseball is played strictly on the moon for the gravitational benefits.

Granted, "the world" in this case is about a dozen or so people, only 2 or 3 of whom read on a regular basis, but it's a start. Anyway, I'm waiting to maybe go to lunch with J and so I'm going to be a sucker and do that list thing that K put up late last night. I remember these from back in college, I did a few then too... onward and upward!  1. LIVING ARRANGEMENT? A fairly nice studio in a fairly well-maintained complex in a fairly bad neighborhood in San Diego.  2. WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING? I've been reading "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" since last summer. Damn law school! 3. WHAT'S ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? Don't have one. Optical mouse doesn't need it. 4. YOUR FAVORITE BOARD GAME? Monopoly. I'm a holy terror, and I always win. I cried once because I bankrupted my own mother. I was 10.  5. FAVORITE MAGAZINE? The only one I still get is Time, it's not bad. I enjoyed Wired and Esquire when I got them. 6. FAVORITE SMELLS? A woman's shampooed hair. Is that how you spell "shampooed"?. 7. FAVORITE SOUND? Music of all kinds. A good song/beat/whatever can completely take me away. 8. WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD? Yeah, loneliness. But I've been blessed to not have any immediate family members/good friends hurt or killed, so that may trump loneliness if it happens. Knock on virtual wood. 9. FIRST THOUGHT WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING? Right now it's "I wonder if they've posted grades yet", but usually, it has something to do with the recurring dreams I have. 10. FAVORITE COLOR? Blue 11. HOW MANY RINGS BEFORE YOU ANSWER THE PHONE? I no longer count rings. Infinite if it's a telemarketer, as soon as I reach the phone if it's not. 12. NAME OF FUTURE CHILDREN? I still like Jasmine. Although it was tainted by a scary character on "Angel" this season. And Katherine or Kate - it's a classic. For boys, Jeeves and Troy Thunderhew (I want to map out their lives well before they have cognitive thought patterns). 13. MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE? Finding someone(s) you can spend the rest of your life with. Whether that be friends, family, or the more common Significant Other, all other things will flow from that. 14. DO YOU PREFER VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM? Vanilla doused in chocolate sauce. 15. DO YOU DRIVE TOO FAST? Definitely. Not around here, though, Californians drive like their hair is on fire, at least on the highway.  16. DO YOU SLEEP WITH A STUFFED ANIMAL? She'd object to being called that. Haha! No. 17. STORMS - COOL OR SCARY? Very cool. I miss them here in the land of 71 degrees and partial cloudiness. 18a. WHAT TYPE WAS YOUR FIRST CAR/TRUCK? A Dodge Colt. That car sucked but it sure gave me some interesting memories. 18b. ULTIMATE CAR/TRUCK?? Porsche 911. New hotness. 19. IF YOU COULD MEET ONE PERSON DEAD OR ALIVE WHO WOULD IT BE AND WHY? Franklin Roosevelt. He did more for this country more than most of the other Presidents combined. 20. FAVORITE ALCOHOLIC DRINK: Beer! I'm not a huge liquor fan, it messes me up. I have a liver thing, it's complicated. 21. WHAT IS YOUR ZODIAC SIGN? Capricorn. This question is lame. 22. DO YOU EAT THE STEMS OF BROCCOLI? Yes. So is this one. 23. IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY JOB YOU WANTED WHAT WOULD IT BE? A lawyer for a small anti-copyright firm. Or, a bartender in South Beach, Miami. Or a writer. I suppose if I move to Miami I could do all of those, theoretically. 24. HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL? Half empty. 25. FAVORITE MOVIES: Shawshank Redemption, High Fidelity, Roadwarrior, Raising Arizona... that's just way to complicated a question for me. 26. DO YOU TYPE WITH YOUR FINGERS ON THE RIGHT KEYS? Yup. And I'm damn fast, too.  27. WHAT IS UNDER YOUR BED? an empty box or three, my keyboard, and probably a bunch of those stupid magazine postcard-sized inserts. I toss 'em down there. 28. FAVORITE NUMBERS: Don't really have one. 3 is pretty good for many reasons. But 2 is the best in certain situations. 29. FAVORITE SPORT TO WATCH? On TV? Football (NFL primarily, but college if I care about the team). In person? Baseball. There's nothing like the baseball stadium on a warm summer night.  San Diego Potential Tourist PSA: Do not visit in early June. It has been overcast for 3 or 4 days now, ever since June started. June Gloom?

      This is the first time I've ever felt like being in the military  urlLink might have been a good idea ! Actually, I saw a thing on HBO about the "Moonlight Bunnyranch" (at least I thought it was HBO) and those chicks were pretty nasty. Legalized prostitution is one of those really difficult issues that I'm not going to get into now, suffice to say my view is much like my view on legalizing drugs.   Grades: still AWOL. Will update and/or join merchant marines when finally posted.

      Financial Aid for summer classes is still in Administrative Limbo. Fortunately, I deferred payment until "whenever" which means I get to go to school free for a few days next week.  I'm not sleeping very well these days, and I'm not sure exactly why. I fall asleep very slowly, probably because I'm having Conversations With People In My Head until all hours of the night. Which is weird, because I know how to stop that (have the conversation with the person in Real Life, not in My Head) and yet I fail to do it. The weirdest part is that for the first time that I can remember, it's not one person - it's a number of different people. Or maybe I need to start seriously working out again. That will get my energy up during the day and probably help me sleep better. Let's do that. :)  Side note: this AFI Heroes & Villains thing is pretty entertaining. Good background noise, at least, while I play Diablo.

      The U.S.S. Constellation has pulled into port, and if you didn't know already, huge military ships coming home is  major news  in San Diego. I don't mean that to be nearly as derisive as it may sound, although I'm definitely more than tired of  every  local channel covering the event. See, if you really care about the battle group returning home, shouldn't you be  at  the base to greet them? Why would you want to watch it on TV? It's only 10 minutes away!  Perhaps if I knew someone coming home, I would feel differently. That's unlikely, because unless it was a loved one of some kind (as opposed to a friend) I'd just pick them up at wherever they needed to be picked up. And then we'd go get drunk and talk about the horrors of war.  Although I imagine that with this last skirmish, the most horrifying tales probably involve being out of cell-phone range, or the boredom that comes with having everyone surrender to you.  Oh don't look now, but somebody's eaten all your popsicles!

      My day of cleaning is over. Well, it wasn't really a whole day - I do live in a studio apartment, after all. But my few hours of cleaning was fairly productive. My bathroom sink looks like something out of a Home Depot showroom. You could eat off of it! Not that you have to, I have a kitchen table.   Tomorrow begins my last week of nothing before classes start. Also grades should pop up sometime later in the week, so if I drop off the face of the earth it's only because I've failed out and moved to Tijuana to be in that act with the chick who shoots ping-pong balls. In what capacity, I have not yet determined.   I hope some more Netflix movies come tomorrow; summer is pretty weak as far as television is concerned. Except for the Law & Order: Real Law Stuff show, that's pretty cool (but maybe only to me). I want my Road to Perdition!

      Saw a coffee-house band last night that was at once both competent and completely derivative. They had skill, I give them that, but they suffered from a lack of creativity and "every-instrument" disease. This is a disease I have invented which occurs when every member of the band plays on every song every single time. End result: completely superfluous electric guitar riffs, and barely audible acoustic guitar.  The lack of creativity came through mostly in the lyrics and song titles. "Beautiful Eyes"? "Mr. Belittle", which is mildly more creative but the song was a complete letdown. And I'm not even sure they  played  Beautiful Eyes. We never found out the name of the band, but I'm betting it was something either intellectually lame (like "The Chomskys") or completely random ("Puppydog Watermelon Takes a Drive").   Still, as lame coffee-house bands go, they were cooler than most. That's just not saying much. It was as if Nirvana and DMB had been in a gene-splicing accident, and the new creatures that emerged were dorks that wanted to play pop music. Also the bass player was NOT the coolest member of the band, thus breaking my streak of 36 consecutive acts where this is in fact true.   Overall, they were no Sonic Death Monkey. I wouldn't have written so much on them except for the fact that it's something to write about, and this blog has been sorely lacking in interesting source material for a few weeks now. Although finding out that Cindy had a crush on Henry Bigg from The Littles cartoon (I looked up the name - I'm not a freak) was pretty scary.   He looks like a punk to me.

      Is it  urlLink DNA , or is it society? Tough call, though the basic point that "men want more sexual partners" is pretty much a given. But why is that? I would tend to think it's more societal than genetic, simply because for a long, long time (forever?) men have been encouraged to sleep around, whereas women have been discouraged. Even among the "enlightened", there is a tendency to say that boys will be boys, but girls should remain chaste.   I don't know much about the scientific method, but I wonder whether the attempts at ensuring privacy and anonymity could ever be enough to really control for internal beliefs that have existed since early childhood.   Oh yeah, Evidence Final: Day 4 of 4. The final is tomorrow! T-minus 17 and a half hours.   DSL's back. Not that it means much, my IM buddy list is surprisingly bare these days. Lots of people out of town or "between connections" I suppose. I'm glad to be back online, though. You don't really realize how convenient it is until you go for a week without. Luckily, I had Splinter Cell to keep me company. Also, I played through Quake 2 (retro gaming!) which only took 3 or 4 hours, max. Good times! Also, I still had moving in to do, and digital cable, and a couple of good books. Oh, and that pesky "studying" thing, which I managed to squeeze in occasionally.

He's like a little Rory Calhoun.   ...  Sometimes I think I alienate the other 98% of my blog readers when I post stuff like this. Then I remember that I only HAVE 3 readers, and I stop worrying. :)

      Evidence Final: Day 3 of 4  I don't know why I'm still noting the Evidence stuff, except that my focus is primarily (though not completely, to my dismay) on Evidence these days. Anyhow!  I'm overjoyed to see that the Transportation Security Administration issued an airline alert a mere... 6 days before I'm set to fly across the country. I really didn't want to have to wrestle terrorists to the ground in a Steven Segal-esque display of my hand-to-hand combat prowess, but you do what you gotta, right?  Holy crap it just started raining. First time I've seen that in... about 2 months. I miss thunderstorms! If I don't see one while I'm visiting I will be a bit put out. People are so unaccustomed to storms around here (because it never, ever happens) that I bet if the wind ever picked up significantly, half the town would fall apart.

      Evidence Final: Day 2 of 4  Had dinner with Christopher (a friend from Evidence) and his wife and kids tonight. That was good fun, they're not much older than (Chris is 5 months older) but they have two cute kids already. They're Mormon, which probably helps explain that to a degree. But on the other hand, I'm 25 years old and it's not exactly out of line that people that age have kids.   Anywho, the kids are great and it really made me realize that having kids is no longer a completely foreign concept to me. Just because, they weren't wretched or annoying but rather quite cute. Not overly cute, still realistic, but... not intimidating. Chris' wife is also very nice, and the food was tasty. Hooray for an evening out!  Now I'm going to bust out on some more Evidence for the evening. Though for the next 20 minutes I'll be watching the rest of  urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  on Bravo. I've learned so much from those lovable blokes! Like how to match your clothes properly, and decorating techniques that, for now, I'm filing away until I can purchase an abode that consists of more than a single room.  Oh, and if someone called me at 6am this morning from DC, please tell me what was so urgent. I didn't pick up (because, like most sane people at that hour, I was asleep) but I'm curious as to the purpose of the call. For many reasons, which I won't go into now.

      Evidence Final: Day 1 of 4  Not much to blog about last weekend, I watched a lot of movies on cable and got that out of my system, and now I'm primed for some Hot Evidence Action in the library for the next 4 days. Today's goal is to finalize my outline and my rule sheet.   Nothing else to report, unfortunately. The apartment is still good, it's definitely growing on me and I'm becoming more comfortable in the surroundings. I found out my DSL should (theoretically) be active on Thursday, so that's nice too. At least it's well before my trip back east (leaving August 5th for Detroit!). I like to have that stuff in order before bolting out of town for 8 days. I haven't seen my relatives in ages (going on 2 years, I believe) so I'm really looking forward to it. Then back to the DC area for a brief tour where I'll see how badly my friends have screwed up their lives without my knowing, guiding presence. Ha!  Alright back to work on Evidence. More later when something happens (if a pack of ravenous coyotes descends from the hills and run amok, or perhaps a long-lost pirate ship finally finds San Diego harbor and begins bombarding the Gaslamp District, I promise to report it here first!)

      Well,  urlLink the Friday Five  is lame this week so I'm not going to spend  my  valuable time doing it.  I'd rather just thrill you with my witty remarks and insights!  ...  Anywho, no more Evidence except for the final. The last class was this morning, and I was almost late for the first time. But I wasn't! I didn't miss a single class, and when you consider that each one started at  seven o'clock in the morning.  I deserve an award!   So that's over with, and I'll be taking a day or two to reflect on that before busting out on the massive studying. You should take a moment, too! Take the day off tomorrow, or Sunday, and tell people it's in honor of Evidence being done with. They'll understand, or they won't. Either way you still get a break, right?

      Look at that, I go out of action for a few hours and all the blog kids are attacking each other. Down boys! Just for the record, Jason is frequently indecipherable without any help from others, and Adam is nowhere near as strong as Kim. If you're looking for moving help, the order goes Sam, Kim, then a koala bear, then bacterial meningitis, then Adam. Then TV's Michael Chiklis, who won't lift anything except his gigantic skull (which is really an accomplishment in itself).  Since three of those are hundreds, if not thousands of miles away, another will kill you, and another is a felony if removed from the National Zoo, I would go with Kim.   In my own less nonsensical news, I have digital cable but am forced to use Earthlink for Internet access, which is an experience akin to being tweezered to death. So.... slow. Digital cable is nice, though. He gave me HBO and Showtime for like, $6 extra, at least for a few months. I assume the idea is that I'll be addicted at that point and will pay the standard $18 once the offer is up. But the joke's on them because I'll be in the thick of school and will probably welcome the subtraction of a major distraction.  "The Subtraction Distraction" would be a good name for a mathematically themed band. Perhaps one that plays on PBS. Is 3-2-1 Contact still a show? It should be, damnit.   I'm off to the old apartment for a few more minor things (practically empty now) then it's back to my palatial estate in Hillcrest. Well, Hillvalley, really. What's halfway down a hill called?

      Tired, sore, and feeling a little shell-shocked. But the move was a success, although not officially over until I start putting things in the right places. I also have to take the truck back, which is a pain in the ass when you have to get someone who works to come get you on their lunch hour. :( I suppose I could hang out with the U-Haul guys all day, but Miramar isn't my kind of place.   Cable, phone today. Then I will be back in action, except for DSL, which is due to be installed in approximately 3 years. See ya then!    Oh, and pictures when I get stuff set up. Until then, use your imagination - it's smaller than Mesa Palms, but still has a separate kitchen and bathroom. The closet is about 1/6 the size, but that's okay because I'm a guy. It's MUCH quieter without good ol' 163 roaring by my building, and at night it's quite dark.  All in all, I am pretty pleased with my find.  Did I mention that it's $150 cheaper? :)

      Moving Day!  May be incommunicado for awhile, since I won't have DSL until August and won't even have phone until Thursday.   So probably minimal blogging until then, and no pictures of my new place until I can upload them on a non-modem.  Or if I just get really bored and don't mind taking 20 minutes to do each one.

      Monday! No updates this weekend because I was busy getting a new apartment.  Hooray! You can see a picture (of the outside, at least) of my new place  urlLink here  (my door is the odd-man-out dark brown one).   Unfortunately they haven't finished painting like promised, so I may be delayed in moving a day or two. That is especially unfortunate because my phone service cuts out on Thursday, along with DSL and Cable. So I'll need a new place. The plan is to move in tomorrow, but if they still need to finish painting then perhaps Wednesday is best.  Anyway, because of my loss of Internet access (it takes them 2 bloody weeks to get me DSL in the new place) I will be online less, so don't think I'm shunning you. I'm just using a modem and therefore not browsing much because I hate modems.  For the rest of today, I will be:  - doing laundry - packing some more, once I get boxes - admiring my sparkling kitchen floor; so clean you could eat off it! - muttering under my breath about rental agencies that I hate - oh yeah I still have that Evidence class or whatever. perhaps cracking the textbook is in order!  More pictures of my new pad when it has been painted and I've moved in.

      Hey  urlLink Friday Five  on the right day again!   1. When was the last time you cheated?  Cheated at what? I cheat at computer games daily, after I've beaten them the "legitimate" way. Never cheated on a person. Cheated on a test maybe once or twice back in college, but never in law school.   2. When was the last time you stole?  Well, if downloading MP3's is stealing (and until I get my hands on some statutes, it is) then yesterday. I don't recall ever having stolen any material goods, however. I "stole" a movie once, by sneaking in. That was like 9 years ago, and it was me and Raf and Jon Maer and I think we snuck into True Lies. At the $2 theater, so you have to wonder what the point was.   3. When was the last time you lied?  I prefer to call it "embellishment". I have a bad habit of dramatizing events of my life that were probably not terribly interesting the first time around. I've tried to cut down on that, however. I've told a few white lies lately, though. Who hasn't?   4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?  I don't think I've ever done those things. Not a big fan of property destruction, I've had my car broken into far too many times to see the logic behind that. Although I think I broke Steve's chair at my old apartment. But that thing was a piece of crap.   5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?  Not too recently. Depends on what you mean by "loved one" - because it's either last January or as far back as a year or two ago. I try not to hurt the ones I love, at least not often.  I think those were kind of weak. Not specific enough to elicit truly informative or entertaining answers, and I'm not in the right zone to be full of wit. I have to go sign a lease!  More on that later...

      I'm sure you'll hear about  urlLink this lawsuit  fairly soon, but it certainly is messed up. This is one of those reasons people hate Metallica. I've forgotten more about copyright than Lars Ulrich could ever hope to comprehend, the little bastard.  Of course, by writing that I'll probably get sued by Metallica as well, since they have yet to master the concept of "responsible litigation".

      Tonight there was a police helicopter circling and yelling things in a loudspeaker at the apartments just across the highway from my place. It was very exciting and a tad spooky. Somebody was misbehaving. Watch for me on Cops sometime soon! I think it was a sign from God that moving is a good idea.  Speaking of moving, I have a nice lead on a place that's just outside of Hillcrest, that's more than $100 cheaper per month, and that's almost as big. Of course, no pool. And the neighborhood, while far from bad, is... weird. It's a place that seems like an afterthought, it has no real feel to it other than "weird". Let's put it this way: the closest commercial enterprise to the apartment I may rent is an Oriental Rug Refurnishing store. And that's it. The next closest establishment is probably 1/2 mile down the road.  Life is strange. I think it's time for a new template on this bad boy, but we'll see if I give up and go to bed first.

      The Great Apartment Hunt continues. Drove by a bunch of places and left a lot of messages today, and later this evening I'll be checking out some Hillcrest spots. Both are small studios (and my dreams of a 1BR in a nice neighborhood fade away) but may be worth it if the location isn't bad.  The only thing is, at this point I almost have too much stuff for a studio. My current studio is quite spacious, and though technically only 1 room, everything fits nicely. Now, I've seen 1BR's that wouldn't hold me, which is something I thought I'd never say.  Anyway, the hunt continues and updates will be infrequent while I look. Lots to do between schoolwork and driving around this heat-blasted city. Gosh it's hot!

      Some  urlLink sad news  about Metro in Washington. I'm not going back if they refuse to expand any further.   I have some fairly good shots at 1BR's here in San Diego (more specifically, in the North Park/Hillcrest area) but will keep looking today and tomorrow to see what other "gems" turn up. At some point I probably need to tell my apartment manager here at beautiful Mesa Palms that I'm out the door.  Mesa Palms: where 35% of your rent goes to purchasing Bird of Paradise plants and pool cleaner.

      'Twas requested that I stop forgetting to do  urlLink Friday Fives , and so for possibly the first time ever on a Friday, here it is!   1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  I believe that would be... Jeff Talmadge. He was the son of the woman who babysat my sisters and I during K through 2nd grade, before we moved. He was an alright guy, though his mother was a little bit crazy. She thought The Smurfs were a tool of the devil. And while I happen to agree, I do so for reasons unrelated to a major religion.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  Nope. Lost touch when we moved, or perhaps when, right before we moved, Jeff went to live with his less psychotic parent. I can't remember, I was awfully young.   3. Do you have a current close friend?  No I'm a social leper. Of course!   4. How did you become friends with this person?  Well it depends on which close friend you mean. A couple are from high school, a couple from college, maybe one from here in San Diego.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Well I've always been curious about what happened to certain people. Tony Hilton, for example, who moved away after like one year. And Jeff. And I have no idea what Chance is up to right now but I bet it's either hilarious or frightening.  There you have it! An extraordinary friday five in an otherwise uneventful week.  Relish the goodness!  Thought of the Day: If I were british, I could say things like "bollocks" and "pisser" without looking like an ass.

       urlLink Adam  is really trying to make a point about his Visa balance.  Pay attention or he may say it a third time!   The Moody Blues sure are goofy looking. But not as goofy as the perennial hipsters from Boston!      Wow! That afro is like a black hole, sucking in talent from all who venture near!

      No updates for a few days, because nothing is going on. I'm apartment hunting like a mofo, though. I'll toss some more news up when I find something. Promise! Unless somebody wants to give me something to write about.

      Also: in the car yesterday, a Moody Blues song came on the radio and I said "Ooh, great song!" which is exactly what my dad would have said. Sigh.

      In the past few days/weeks, I have found myself saying things that should more appropriately come out of  urlLink my father's  mouth. It's a pretty scary thing, and I always want to stop and take a moment to realize how odd that is. None of them are sayings or acts unique to my father; I expect many people out there have fathers that do them.  At dinner, I said "No, don't get dessert, I have plenty to eat back at my place."   When driving, I suspect I channel all Bristol males when I give other motorists "tips" on how they could better utilize their vehicles on the open road.   And as anybody who has called both my father and me on the phone can tell you, I seem to answer in the exact same way that he does. Yellow?  I won't get into the ways my handwriting, irritation at political figures, or general physical appearance are slowly creeping in the same direction. The whole situation gives me the heebie-jeebies, and not because he would be a bad person to transform into. Rather, it's simply startling to have the power of genetics, which had until now have remained the distant background noise of future possibility, thrust into your daily life.   I'm not growing the goatee back anytime soon, that's for sure.  :)

       'Twas pointed out that I forgot to mention the best part of the fair - the demolition derby! I had never seen one live (once or twice on a TV show) and boy was it cooler than I expected. It's amazing to see cars smashing into each other, and to see how much punishment a good ol' made-in-the-USA automobile can take. It was quite a sight!  The 4th was fun, though uneventful. I learned that from my balcony, you can "see" 6 or 7 fireworks displays. The downside is that by "see" I mean fireworks that are so far away they are only just above the horizon, and thus most are obscured greatly by the lame-ass palm trees that pepper the grounds.  That's it for me! Tomorrow is library day, and Monday it's back to looking for a new place to live. Yay!

       urlLink This is the suck.  So many great hits, so many great appearances. Remember when he was on The Simpsons?   Went to the San Diego Fair yesterday, it has been on the news every day for the last month and it shuts down this weekend, so I figured I'd better squeeze it in. It was much like other fairs (Fairfax County Fair) but had its own distinct flavor. The best part was I got to eat one of those mammoth smoked turkey legs!  Mmmm.  Hope everyone's having a great Independence Day! Oh and Jason, no I wasn't with you, last July 4th was when Kim and I came to SD to scout for apartments and check out the whole "west coast" deal. Good times!

      I just finished watching  urlLink Dark City , which was pretty entertaining. The most interesting reflection I have, however, is how similar some of the plot points were to The Matrix. And Dark City came out the year before... hmm.   Now I'm not saying The Matrix wasn't a kick-ass movie. But if anyone out there has seen Dark City, then you probably know what I'm talking about. John Murdoch  is  Neo.  I can see fireworks from my apartment every night at about 10pm. That's nice. Mostly I can hear them, which is less entertaining. Maybe I'll just stay here...

      Apartment hunting sucks. I'll just put that right out there. Rental people are mean and treat me like a moron, and I'm not a moron. I've lived in 4 different ( very  different) apartments in my life, and while that's not a huge number I know what to look for.   First of all, everybody in San Diego apparently waits until the last possible minute to advertise, which means every apartment in the paper is "Available Now!" and that's just annoying. I have less than a month to go in this place, and all I ask is that July 15 or 20 be my move in date. But if I want that, apparently I'll need to call July 15 or 20.   Secondly, I hate calling people. I really do, especially when I'm asking for something (as is the case here). I don't even like calling people who I consider to be my friends, because I feel like I'm imposing on them. The funny part is, I never feel that way about people who call me, so you'd think I'd stop worrying about it. But regardless, just getting into the mindset to call a bunch of curt real estate people is an exhausting effort. I need an assistant, or a secretary. One of the nicest things someone (you know who you are) ever did for me was to help me call around in San Diego to find the place I'm now living in. And by "help me" I mean she called places, just because it takes me 10 minutes to get up enough nerve to make each call.   Oddly enough, my current introvertedness in this matter is much better than how I used to be, before graduating college and before moving way the hell out here.  But I still  hate  doing it.  I found out my final for Evidence is August 1. Which is very cool, because that means I have an entire week from the last day of class to prepare. Also cool: no other finals.

      My first day off! I have no class on Thursdays (and only one tomorrow) so it's nice to wind the week down this way. No big plans for the 3-day weekend, except perhaps to organize myself and maybe go to the beach, if the mood strikes me.   So, my Communications Law & Policy class is very interesting, to me, but it's the first time I've been in a class in law school where the "Know-It-All" contingent has made a showing. These are the people that in a technology-oriented (or even just related) class, cannot help correcting the professor or injecting "helpful" facts into the discussion. I find this annoying. I believe it's a by-product of two things: the social ineptitude of many who have worked in the technology sector, and the rapidly evolving nature of technology itself. Because of the speed at which technology advances, it's very hard for any teacher to ever stay completely on top of every development. It's much easier for a student who studies the field simply out of interest.  The end result is when the professor says (merely giving an example - none of this is testable material) that AT&T broke up in 1983, someone immediately (and usually without even raising their hand, which is another issue) says "Actually I think it was 1984." Of course that doesn't matter  at all  to the professor's example, but it gives the geeks a chance to show their prowess in the area. This may only be impressive to other geeks, but speaking for the group I can honestly say it just annoys the crap out of me. In general, this doesn't happen much in law school because unlike some undergrad teachers, every professor is far more informed about their field than any possible student. But add a little something about the Internet, or computers, and all of a sudden a geeky minority feels emboldened to add their unimportant and irrelevant 2 cents.  And that's my 2 cents! But notice I didn't subject an entire class to it. That would have been lame.

      I lost my sunglasses a few days ago, and with classes starting and all the busyness that goes with that, I haven't had a chance to get new ones. This is not exciting, but it's the longest I've gone without wearing a pair in such bright sunshine in... probably years. I think it makes me look like I'm scowling at everyone, and of course I lose the ability to subtly check out boobs and such, but other than those drawbacks it's interesting to see the world without UV protection.   Oh and my email is down, so if I'm not replying to email I apologize, but I've got no access. Interestingly, when on campus the only thing I can browse is sandiego.edu and related sites; but off campus (like now) I can browse everything BUT those sites. The cord has been cut! Wait that wasn't interesting at all.  Law School Year 2: Day 2 was good. Constitutional Law is almost as boring as watching paint dry, but perhaps that was first-day madness or something. Communications Law was cool though, although I have to wait approximately 5 hours between classes. That won't be too bad when I have loads of work, but today it got a little mind-numbing. Especially considering I couldn't ever mess around on the Internet (see above).   This feels like the longest week in the history of recorded time. The upside: I only have 2 classes left. The downside: they both start before 11am.

      Law School Year 2: Day 1 - Success! In that I was not killed or even maimed too badly. Had some reading to do tonight, but it turns out it was just the Constitution, and since I'm not even sure what the point of that thing is, I just gave up and watched TV.  It's sort of hot in here. I'm sorry, in "herre".   I'm fairly excited about my Public Interest class, it should really be interesting. I'm not even going to try and explain what goes on, because it would instantly put the entire Internet to sleep, but  I  find it interesting. Intellectual Property may also be cool, but it's too soon to tell. I don't like not knowing people again, it's frustrating. I had a good system (or "rut") going last year, I had friends and sat next to people I knew (for the most part) and now I have to carve out a whole new groove. Tomorrow: 2 more new classes, and then I'm set up for the semester.   Also tonight I finally got to see "Comedian", a documentary about Jerry Seinfeld. I think Adam may have clued me into this gem at some point, but it was absolutely hilarious. For good, or for awesome. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing and go rent it. You have to put up with about 30 minutes of crap about some annoying comic that's not Seinfeld, but the rest is fabulously entertaining stuff. Fabulous! PS I'm not gay, it's just an appropriate word.

      Big day! Class tomorrow! Hoo-ah!   I turned in my law review write-on "attempt". Whenever you are rushed to complete something (and how could I not be, with only 5 days to do it), you can never feel too positive about the quality of your work unless you're stupid or incredibly self-assured. Well, maybe if you're just confident, but what I lack in confidence I make up for in  really  lacking confidence.  Anywho, some prep remains for tomorrow, so I bid you adieu. Besides, a shorter update after yesterday's rant is probably for the best. I've got it together now! Good luck to everyone else who has a first something tomorrow (class of the year or job).

      I often wonder if perhaps there is an "ivory tower" mentality in America today. I'm usually very surprised at the number of people who support things like Justice Moore's stand regarding the  urlLink 10 Commandments  (link goes to Marek's page, in which he sums up the issue better than I could). Then, after my surprise wears off, I remember that there are numerous "unenlightened" people in this country, people that neither want nor accept the views of those on the coasts.   Is it better this way?  Is it better that the handful of people in universities, in the media, and in politics rule what is undoubtedly a much larger contingent of people in the "fly-over states"? Most of those who rule are smart, and though they are not all of the same idealogical cloth, they advance their particular views articulately and with passion (Ann Coulter notwithstanding). But should those who are focused on "lesser" things, such as jobs and kids and making dinner, be without representation? Does anybody  really  speak for them, or is it, as I suspect, merely a parade of politicians who claim to represent the vast middle majority but who in reality do no such thing?  On the other hand, maybe I make no sense. It's difficult to grasp the thought process behind much of our creationism-seeking, bible-thumping, salt of the earth brethren. And perhaps in trying to do so I seem patronizing, which I probably am, but not on purpose. It seems to me that the older people get, the more reasons they have to promote their own self-interest. Marriage, and kids, seem to transform once liberal people into much more self-serving individuals. Can you blame them for that? Who doesn't want their kids to go to the best school, have the best clothes, and receive the best opportunities? The NIMBY response ("not in my backyard") does not have to apply only to power stations and municipal waste dumps; it can also apply to kids and family, almost in reverse. Parents who oppose a school voucher system on principle may have dire need for vouchers for their own kids. Families that once despised tax cuts for the rich may find themselves in that category and now strongly favor them. Does this happen to everyone, and will it happen to me?   Maybe I just need to go outside more. I'm 2/3rds done with my paper (due tomorrow!) but I fear that it is not very good. Classes start on Monday, I have yet to buy my books because I'm lazy. For those keeping score, I'm taking Introduction to Intellectual Property, Constitutional Law, Public Interest Law & Practice, and Communications Law & Policy. I was hoping for Professional Responsibility, but alas the class is very full and I'm far, far away on the waiting list.

      Busy times! I'm working on the write-on competition for law review, and it's tough but fair. Just like Mr. T. There's no outside research to be done (they give you a massive packet with everything you can use) so that's a plus, however it is still difficult and due on Sunday at 5pm. I procrastinated away about a day and a half, and am now getting into the real meat of it.   At least it's only a 10-page paper. I'm also working on my class schedule, which is either a pathetic 12 credits (minimum for full time!) or a robust 15 (if I get into Professional Responsibility, which I probably won't). I decided against a 16 (maximum allowed) credit semester because I don't like work. Also, since I took Evidence over the summer (and we presume I at least passed) I have a 4-credit buffer anyhow. I got into Public Interest Law & Practice, which is very cool but only 3 credits so it doesn't replace Corporations (which I am now avoiding because Tom Smith was mean to me on my Spring final exam. Which is to say I did poorly.).  In other news, it's good to be back in the thick of things but it will take some gear-shifting to properly reaquaint myself with school. All the new 1L's are wandering around campus with dazed looks, and it's a source of unending amusement. I'd say "if only I knew then..." but actually, I don't remember being all that scared about school, more so about having no friends nearby. Anywho, good luck to them I say. They have an easier schedule than we did (bastards!) so I don't feel too much compassion right now.   Final Thought: "Two Weeks Notice" is a bad movie. Well, not Battlefield Earth-bad, or Gigli-bad, but it's not good. It's no Notting Hill. Try again Hugh!

      I heard someone arguing outside my apartment (actually inside another apartment) so, being the nosey little creep that I am, muted the TV so to try and make out the conversation and figure out what was up.  Woman: Look, you love me don't you? I love you! Man: Of course I love you, but it's not that simple! Woman: Why not, of course it is! Man: Well, honestly, it's a really big problem that you're not Jewish.  At this point, I thought "Holy cow! I can't believe he just said that!" and continued listening. The woman's voice started to sound familiar, and then so did the man's.  Then I realized it was "Keeping the Faith" with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman.   I am such a tool.  post-script: Jenna Elfman, when you don't see her and don't recognize the voice as hers, sounds very unattractive.

      So at about 11:45 last night, my cable stopped working. No real reason, the box simply began displaying "Unauthorized Settop Box". So I was annoyed and this morning I gave them a "ring" to yell.   But it turned out (as reported by a very nice lady at Cox) that some moron customer service agent didn't verify a person correctly and somehow THAT guy got MY service turned off. Bastard!  Anyway, all fixed. I helped Hilary move today and her apartment is about 2 or 3 points below absolute perfection. Dammit! It's WAY cooler than my new place, although it is a 2BR and thus not in my range anyhow. Still, it's in a great location in Pacific Beach, just a few blocks from both beach and bay, and has a porch and huge windows and parking and... sigh. It's quite nice.  Anyway, laundry tonight and then early to bed. Tomorrow I watch my former landlord crap all over my immaculately cleaned (except for the tub, which I gave up on) former abode. Then, I hear how hard it will be to write-on to Law Review but will attempt anyhow. Fun times!  Note: one of these days I'm going to see what will be the "straw on a camel's back" story about our dear little Recall Election, and I'll probably fill a page or two ranting angrily about that. Watch for it!

      Bunch of  urlLink new pictures  from my trip, mostly from Detroit and Port Huron. Probably not exceedingly interesting to those outside of my family, but for those who ARE in my family, take a look!  Good stuff.   I didn't post any of the pictures that my sister Katie took that were pseudo-pornographic shots of my other sister. Because yikes.

      Pants are back!  San Diego is as I remember it, possibly because places do not change significantly in 8 days (or even 8 months as the case was in Virginia). Nice and warm, with no humidity!   Lots to do, however, because 8 days away makes cable bills unpaid, Financial Aid in flux, and altogether mucks up other various banking services. Also, I left two key items at home: new shoes which I have been enjoying, and glasses (for the eyes, not for the drink) which aren't used much but are obviously important to survival on weekends when contacts are unnecessary.  More later when I sort out whether anything "interesting" has gone unreported.

      Well, the Tigers lost but it was a close one, 4-3, with a great rally in the 9th (they were down 4-1) that fell just shy of a win. On the upside, the Lions won their exhibition game and actually seemed to perform pretty well. Three cheers for Mooch (is that really what they call Mariucci? Michigan should honor him with a better nick) if he can get us a respectable season.  I haven't slept well or much in 3 days. On Friday night, I woke up, alert and wide-awake, at 3am because somebody was scoping out my dad's house for a break-in. Actually, I woke up 2 minutes before, but it was bizarre and surreal. On Thursday night I just slept poorly, and last night I just didn't get very much.   I'm back in Northern Virginia, and while so far it's great to be at my parent's house and see the few people I've had a chance to see, it's all very odd. Sometimes it's as if I was frozen in time, and everyone here has aged and moved on while I sat idle. I know that's not true, but not being in constant touch with the kids back home makes me feel slightly out of sync. Odd, I know.   I also saw my sister's new apartment, and my friend Jason's. Katie's is very cool, I am jealous because it is a great place for someone who lives in the DC area, although it's a little bit pricey in my opinion. Jason's, which he shares with his girlfriend Dawn, is possibly the greatest apartment any of my friends currently occupy. That even includes Raf's (my old place) which has the downside of being managed by a drunk and rented out by a greedy bastard. But Jason's is spacious, in a nice neighborhood, and actually quite reasonably priced. Hoorah for Jason and Dawn!   No more news tonight, meesa tired. Next time I blog will probably be back in sunny SD, unless I achieve spiritual oneness with the cosmos and my mental and physical form dissipate into the very fabric of the space-time continuum. If that happens, no more blogging.

      Saw the whole family (mom's side, at least) yesterday, all my little cousins (I think there are about 482) are growing up and are less scared of me now. My mom's family isn't really very tall, so I'm easily the tallest person in the house, by a large margin. The wee ones don't seem to understand that and generally get quiet and wide-eyed when I'm in a room.    But now that most of them are past that 2-4 year mark, that seems to have faded. Now they just ignore me like most girls. Hah! My trip out was good, the flight stopped in St. Louis and the usually-1-hour leg from there to Detroit turned into 2 because of storms in the Detroit area. The pilot just sort of flew around for nearly an hour, banking and gaining altitude, then dropping again, etc. I thought he was lost until we got into Detroit and I saw hot soaked everything was.   On the first leg of the trip some guy got wretchedly drunk and started asking everyone if he could use their cell phone. Everyone said either 1) I don't have one or 2) it won't work up here. He didn't really like those responses, and refused to believe that it wouldn't work (nevermind that you're not even allowed to try, per FAA regulations), eventually becoming a bit put-out that we were denying him his God-given right to make drunk calls to ex-girlfriends at 2 in the afternoon.  Air Travel: Experience the Magic of In-Flight Cocktails!  Today will be relaxing and then it's off to a Tigers game (worst in the nation! Quite possibly worst record in the history of baseball if they don't get at least a few more wins!) tonight. Then I'm in the car for a few (read: 9) hours for the drive to Virginia.

      Well I'm getting all packed up for the trip, I've got a book ( urlLink People's History of the United States ) my plane tickets (more frequent flyer miles from  urlLink American Airlines !) and no clothes. So today will be laundry day, as soon as the laundry "room" is free.   Saw  urlLink Pirates of the Carribbean  last night, much better than expected. That Johnny Depp, he's dreamy! A bit overly long (it's 2 hours and 13 minutes) but worth your time for the action and not-terrible story. Also, if you've been on the ride at Disneyland/world, you'll better appreciate some of the "homages" to the theme park. Definitely the best pirate movie I've ever seen, but that's hardly saying much.   There was a preview for another upcoming movie - "The Haunted Mansion" (with Eddie Murphy). It is, you guessed it, based on the ride at Disneyland. I think I'll just wait for the Teacups movie. Hold on to your hats!

      Done! Done with Evidence! The final was tough but not too tough, I hope that I managed okay. It was a strange final, she gave us too much time (!) so I'm concerned that even though I used the bulk of it, I didn't use it all. But my god, 4 hours? That's a lot of finaling.   We're not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe.  So now it's packing and relaxing and getting ready for the Main Event -- Law School Year 2. I think most of those Euro bastards get back next week, but the joke's on them because this time  I'll  be out of town!  Haha! I forgot what my point was.

      Two new kick ass movie trailers, for your viewing pleasure.  urlLink The Return of the King  is out, and it's pretty awesome. Possibly the best LOTR trailer I've seen (and I've seen 'em all!). Also, the  urlLink Matrix Revolutions trailer  is out as well. Also quite good, as trailers go. Better than some previous Matrix trailers, which are just confusing or bland.

      Well, somehow  urlLink they did it.  The Tigers avoided breaking (or even tying) the Mets 120-game record for losses in a season. Even though 6 games ago, they needed 5 wins to avoid the record, they actually managed to win 5 games!  It's funny how much celebration occurs on occasions like this. Too bad the Lions got beat yesterday, but on the upside, it was close and it was against Denver (they're good).   More later, maybe. I have to get to campus to turn in my cite-checking assignment. I almost screwed up royally - but enough about me! How are YOU doing?

      Adam posted this  urlLink tribute to the woeful Tigers  in his blog, and I'm blatantly stealing because hell yeah!  I know my boys suck the big one in overall playing ability, but I was thrilled to find out that, among other things:   - they have turned more double plays than any other team (that's while fielding, not hit-into - they've hit into the second-fewest in the AL) - they destroy baserunners who steal; Maroth (a pitcher) has picked off the most in the league (tied with 7) and Inge (a catcher) has thrown out more runners than anyone in the AL  Yes they suck. Yes, they may set the record for most losses. But for the worst team in baseball, they sure have played a tough season. And they did it without corking bats or whining about salaries or otherwise behaving like little girls.  post-script: No, I don't know any little girls that cork bats. It's just an example.

      I'm not much of a wine drinker (some kind of allergy gives me huge headaches after just a couple of glasses), but many friends are, especially those here in California*. That's why I was so amused to read  urlLink this article on Slate.com , which pretty much tears apart our local wine establishment. It's not all bad, but the best compliment Slate pays to California wines is: "Though these wines tend to flow across the palate with all the subtlety and grace of the Soviet Army rolling into Prague, they do have a certain burlesque appeal, and they have been undeniably popular in recent years."  I've had slightly more (read: a glass or two) wine recently, and I've enjoyed it. I curse the genetic anomaly that won't allow me to have it more often (without paying a painful price). Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough!  It has been a weird week, I tell ya whut, some parts good, some bad. I'm glad it's the weekend, but sad that I haven't gotten more done in some areas than I would have liked. I'm currently in the library avoiding my duties as cite-checker. You'd think someone smart enough to write articles for a Law Review would have better footnotes (or at least hire more capable students to review and correct the footnotes), but alas, that is not the case. Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!  post-update: I forgot to properly note my wine commentary, as a good cite-checker should. So: *  See also  Marek's Wine Reviews,  urlLink www.marekadamo.net  (April, 2003).

      I've had a noticeable increase in search engine-related traffic this week, and I'm not sure why. 2 or 3 hits every day from Google or Yahoo, and for odd, odd topics that I don't remember talking about. I won't mention them (because that would just drive up the search results) but if you're curious you can  urlLink see what I mean . There are waaaay too many people searching for a certain young actor without apparel.  West Wing premiere last night was okay, a little bit maudlin for my tastes (especially that long musical montage scene at the end) but still pretty good. I like the new President (well, he's entertaining), especially because I keep thinking he's Big Dan Connor and that he's gonna start prattling on about Becky and Darlene any second now. That little dog sure is annoying though.  T'will be a shame when I'm forced to begin choosing between Angel and West Wing (next week), but I think unless Angel goes to hell (not the character, the show) I will be on the WB. My kingdom for a Tivo! At least I'm mighty quick with the remote.  Back to cite-checking...

      Every so often, I have nothing to blog about. Not because life is bad, but just because there's little to blog about. Things are good, actually, in many areas. My topic proposal is pending, cite-checking is moving along nicely, classes are slightly stuffy but manageable. Social life is... ;)  So, a post for post's sake.   I will mention this - there's a guy in one of my classes who speaks up infrequently but is quite the budding Libertarian. He amuses me to no end, and when he starts talking it has gotten to the point where I can predict exactly what he'll say before he says it. Those wacky folk! I give them almost as much credibility as the Greens, which is to say very little. Although I have to say I respect some of the Green Party ideals more than I do the Libertarians, who are really just Republican Anarchists. If that's possible.  You know what IS possible? Bedtime! Adam, update your damn blog or I'll be forced to actually email you for information, and lord knows neither of us wants it to come to that.

      I was visited by the Ghost of Workouts Past tonight. Voluntarily, that is. I decided to attempt a battle with my old nemesis, the ergometer (or as the laymen call it, the "rowing machine"). 24 Hour Fitness has a couple of Concept 2 machines, and I saw some chicks rowing (with really bad form) and it sparked my interest (also I wanted to show the gym how to actually use it). I had already run a mile and half and done some upper-body lifting, so I was beat and decided on what I thought was a small amount, 1000 meters.   I had forgotten how hard rowing is.  Combine running, bicycling, and weights, and you have rowing. I can't believe I used to row 2000 and 4000 meter races. Anyways, I'm as exhausted as I was the first day of working out (with a trainer) so I say, mission accomplished.  As for you, Concept 2 - I'll be seeing you again soon. And next time I shall be the victor!

      How about another Friday Five, Sam-style? That means on Sunday night, while I watch "Freshman Diaries" on Showtime.   1. Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?  Tough call, I have many. I wish Bjork would put something new out, she's awesome.    2. What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?  Haha, also a long list. I can't stand musicians that have little discernable talent other than a mildly competent voice. Especially when they don't even write their own music. Also I hate anger rock, like Limp Bizkit etc. Well, let me clarify - anger rock with a message (Rage Against the Machine) is much better than angry-because-it-sells.    3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?  Well, I don't know him/her as a person, so how should I know? I guess people like Eminem, who I respect as an artist, I would probably hate as a person, but that's an assumption based on the media and his image (which may or may not be true). I do hate Fred Durst though (see above).    4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?  What kind of mongoloid hasn't been to a concert? Good lord. Best show ever was probably seeing Bjork at the formerly-named Capital Ballroom in DC. I don't go to all that many shows, though, so that's just in my experience.   5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?  Oh please. The RIAA is a piece of crap that has no concept of long-term market effect. You'd think they could afford better analysts, who would tell them that the dam has broken and downloading music is here to stay. Find a new business model you idiots.

      They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but I think imitation of imitation is the highest level of flattery, or at least a testament to someone's accomplishment.   What do I mean? Take for example, Dana Carvey's Bush (I) and Ross Perot. After he made his mark on SNL imitating those guys, every other human being stopped imitating Bush or Perot, and started imitating Carvey imitating Bush or Perot. The same can be said for almost every imitation that Will Ferrel does (especially Harry Carey, Bush (II), and James Lipton), and Darrell Hammond. I think if I were those guys, I would put a lot of stock into the fact that they've made those "impressions" into independently imitated acts. I know that whenever I try and do Sean Connery, my chief source material is Darrell Hammond's "Celebrity Jeopardy" skits from SNL. And my Jimmy Stewart is Dana Carvey's. I have no original material!  Good fun last night, Mark and Lindsey had a party at a club in La Jolla (that's "La Hoya" for you east coasters), and I had a better time than I expected to have. And that's all I'll say about that. :)

      Saturday mornings are all about MST3K on the Sci-Fi Channel. Yeah, they're reruns (they'd have to be since sadly, nobody makes MST3K anymore), but my god they're funny. Especially the Screaming Skull episode.  No updates lately because there isn't much to update about. Plus, half of my readership was being battered by a hurricane and possibly lacked power. I believe they've all survived nicely, though. The storm wasn't quite as powerful as it could have been (60 mph winds? I can drive faster than that!) but hey, it's still a hurricane. Life moves on like normal around here; I'm just about finished with my topic proposal (big surprise: it's about copyright!), and otherwise things are going fine. Congratulations go out to  urlLink Marek , who made it to the final round (!) of Moot Court competition. If anybody remembers (you don't, trust me) Marek was on the team that I had to argue against for lawyering skills, and he was awesome. Moot Court can be very tough, too - judges barraging you with questions, especially in front of other people, is never easy. Though if I remember, the "other people" part fades away when the judges lay into you.  Back to mystery science theater!

      It's situations like  urlLink this  that really point out how insane copyright law is in this country. I'm not a huge fan of Eminem, but he should be able to use a 24 second bit of music in an otherwise wholly original piece of music without being sued. Why is he sued? Because some woman inherited the rights to that bit of music when her husband died 15 years ago. The music itself was composed 33 years ago for a movie.  First: I have no doubt that the deceased composer was paid for his efforts in creating the music. Second: He's dead, and clearly does not need any residual royalties. Third: Even if he wasn't dead, he was already paid for it.  At this point, I'm pretty sure that copyright should be limited to something tiny, like 15 or 20 years. I've heard some say 5, but even to my flaming liberal mind that seems too small. The entire point of copyright is to give a creator a monopoly on profit from his or her creation; this is justified (normally we hate monopolies in America) by forcing the creation into the public domain after a specific period of time has passed.  Congress has broken that agreement, however, by allowing not 20, not 50, but  70 years  of protection  after the author has died . This is insane, and there is absolutely no reason why a great artist's work, like the recently passed Johnny Cash, should not become publicly available within the next decade. What is the use in keeping Cash's songs restricted until 2073? Simply so that the license holder can make money, at the expense of the public good.  I don't care what I write, or compose, or program in the next year - it should be free to anyone who wants it by 2023 at the latest. I have yet to hear a compelling argument to the contrary, so if anyone has one, step on up to the plate.

       Hurricane Shmurricane   I have received good news for the east coast! Courtesy of a head's up from my mom, I have learned that you all have little to fear from Isabel, because God's chief enforcer is on the case:  "Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson prayed on his Christian Broadcasting Network, based in Virginia Beach, that Isabel would turn from the coast. He asked God to put a 'wall of protection' around Virginia Beach and the East Coast. 'In the name of Jesus, we reach out our hand in faith and we command that storm to cease its forward motion to the north and to turn and to go out into the sea,' Robertson prayed on 'The 700 Club.'" ( urlLink WTOP )  Crisis averted! Although, if memory serves me he's also praying that the more liberal judges on the Supreme Court will die of horrible diseases, and so far they continue to spread their noxious progressive ideology. Perhaps storm preparations should continue...

      Interesting study on what your  urlLink sleeping position  reveals about your personality. I think I go through a number of positions, but the default is probably on my side, thus: "Sleeping on one's side with legs outstretched and arms down in what Idzikowski refers to as the log, indicates a social, easy-going personality."  Well alrighty then! What strange assumption can be made about YOU based on your nighttime sleeping habits? I found it interesting that so many (51%) women sleep in the fetal position. Maybe it's because I'm tall, but I can't see how that'd be very comfortable. I don't think I've ever personally seen anybody sleep that way, but maybe I'm just not observant. Or maybe I need to break into more people's home and watch them sleep. Or let more chicks sleep in my bed. Which one is less immoral?

      Well I didn't sleep very well last night, which was disappointing because I went to the gym, and expected the strenuous activity to quell my active brain. Yet around 1am I was still going fairly strong. Stupid adrenaline. I feel like I crammed a lot into yesterday, I was busy most of the day and yet still managed to work out and watch the Conan O'Brien 10th Anniversary Special on NBC.   Of course, now I'm in the library cramming to finish a draft of my topic proposal, so maybe I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. Fortunately, it is a draft in every sense of the word, and the final topic proposal isn't due until the 22nd.   I hear there's a big fat hurricane bearing down on you folks back east, which sucks but is very cool at the same time. Though some of you will be in Rome, others in a plane to Austin, and still others in basement apartments in DC, I'm sure everything will be okay. And by okay, I mean very awesome - we don't get big huge storms like that around here. There are typhoons, I suppose, but they never come to San Diego. Maybe I'm cursing myself by saying that! One can only hope the curse isn't negated by the fact that I think it would be totally sweet, and by totally sweet I mean totally awesome, if a typhoon did come into town.  Back to the gym thing, because I lack knowledge of a narrative flow or a basic understanding of structure in writing. I tend to run a little, then lift some, then run again and go home. Is that right? The lifting exhausts me but I haven't been very sore yet, so I must not be doing enough. I think I need to tag along with someone who knows what they're doing so that I can get a better sense of how to work out. Someone with all the knowledge of a personal trainer but none of the yelling at you. Maria, my mighty heart is breaking!

      I have just concluded what I believe is the final major offensive against the rebellion that was rising among my dishes in the kitchen. The food that was once mere bits and pieces from left-over meals had achieved a state of near sentience and, I'm fairly certain, started plotting against me. This morning I was sure I had a banana left, but in fact it was gone. I suspected the dishes in the sink were responsible, so I took decisive action and attacked.  60 minutes and 2 pruney hands later, I declare victory. The rebels have been scattered and forced into hiding, and the only remnants now are a few glasses and cups on whom I bestowed mercy. Little do they know that they'll be attacked at a later date - probably October. I don't like doing the dishes, but sometimes you have to do what's best for the apartment.

      Well I was beat to the punch by Kim (I call time zone advantage!) but as everyone knows by now, both John Ritter and the heretofore invincible Johnny Cash have shuffled off this mortal coil.   I know it's just me, but it seems like more people are croaking these days. Everybody says that, especially when two highly notable people pass away. But in just recent (i.e. blog) memory, we've lost Jam Master J, Edwin Starr, James Coburn.. um... that other guy... (edit: Charles Bronson! Dammit. Thanks Emily.) Well alright it SEEMS excessive. But then, death always seems excessive. Nobody ever says "John Ritter died, eh? Yup, that seems about right."   On the topic of John Ritter, he really was an underrated actor. Maybe back in the heyday of Three's Company he was overrated, but since then I've seen him in multiple arenas and he has always been quite appropriate. The William H. Macy movie "Panic" (with Neve Campbell) springs to mind, as does the Buffy episode where he played crazy robot boyfriend Ted. In John's memory, I hope to participate in innuendo-laden escapades and several sexually-charged double entendres.   Remember that time in Three's Company when Jack and Chrissy were talking about something in the kitchen, and Janet/Mr. Furley/Mr. Roper/Larry was listening outside the door and thought they were engaged in some lurid sexual act? Good times!  I won't even get into Johnny Cash's death, which is slightly less unexpected (he was aged) but if you don't know why Cash's death is sad, or about his influence on music, then you suck and stop reading my blog you ignorant bastard.

       Sadness Follows   Here we are, 2 years later. I hope everyone realizes that, barring a calendar-altering act from Congress, we will continue to have Sept. 11 every year until the end of time. I understand that for some people, the grieving process is better served in a group setting. People who can identify and sympathize can be a source of strength. I'm much more interested in the historical account, in remembering everything that happened that day and remembering everyone who died, but grieving on a personal level. Nobody I know died on Sept. 11, and I've been fortunate to never lose anyone extremely close to me, but when I grieve I prefer to do so privately.  I watched The Two Towers last night for the first time since I saw it in the theater, and it was just as good as it was in December. At 3 hours in length, though, it was nice to be able to pause it for a bathroom or ice-cream Drumstick break. Also took a break to watch parts of Angel (Willow visited!) and that nail-biting West Wing episode where Zoe gets abducted. Hooray for DVD!  I got out of being trained yesterday, and got to do my own thing. That was nice, though now I feel paranoid that at any second she's going to pop up behind me and say "You're not supposed to be on this machine today! Chest is Friday!" or something. I worked out my legs on the 2 or 3 machines that I knew how to use, and then I ran, so I figured (and felt like) my legs were exhausted. But today, I'm only mildly (very mildly) sore. Damn it! I want sore!

       Parking Lot Jousting   From my near-permanent seat in the library, I am allowed a fantastic view of the constant jockeying for position in our law school parking lot. Actually, let me clarify that: it's only called the "law school lot" because it's situated between the Law School and the Law Library. Not, as any sensible person would think, because it is for law students only. Because that would be far too convenient for those of us that keep odd hours to have a small lot to ourselves.   This should probably be part of a larger "why I hate the undergrads" rant, but I haven't the energy for that right now. There are just too many reasons to list!   Anyway, thanks to a poorly conceived parking plan and the recent shutdown of a major parking area, the parking here at USD is crap. You can't get a spot on campus after 9:30 in the morning, and it doesn't start opening up again until the late afternoon (though Fridays are slightly better). The kicker, of course, is that now that "Fringe" parking passes have been abolished, I am paying $185/year to park in the same damn place I parked last year at $25/year. Granted, I have the "ability" to park in the good spots with my new pass, but what good is that when the good spots are always taken? Give me back my $160!   Perhaps I'm just grouchy today. I have to work out with my trainer again and I don't want to, she's nice but I don't like being "trained". Also, I don't have time for it this week - I need the flexibility to go whenever I can squeeze it in, not a mandated 3pm time. Blast! I won't even go into that commenting fiasco over on Kim's blog; it's far to exasperating, and arguing with some people is like trying to argue with a 2-year-old.

       Tuesday Afternoon   The nicest part about Tuesday is knowing that, by lunchtime, I only have 3 classes left for the entire week. The worst part is having to get up at 8am to go to one of them. Yesterday I cornered my IP professor and got her to be my faculty advisor for Law Review. That's nice, because I'm hoping to write something in that arena, and some people haven't had the chance to get an advisor who specializes in the area they wish to write about.  The next part, however, is much harder. I've got to find a topic, a very specific topic, that is current but not decided. Even that makes it sound easier than it actually is - fortunately I have until Monday for a first pick. I'm still having trouble really gearing up for school (note especially that school has been going for 3 weeks now), but I'm far less distracted by other parts of my life right now so that's a good thing. I'm enjoying the drama that other people take part in, without having to be involved myself. It's like watching a play!  RIP  urlLink Warren Zevon . Underappreciated genius, says me. Well, maybe he was appreciated, but not by the general public, who only knew about Werewolves and not the rest of his work.  And lest ye think I've forgotten, football season started with a bang! At least in my book - any Sunday where the Lions (yes, the Lions) score the  urlLink second-most points  of any other team (San Francisco clobbered the Bears with 49) is huge. Even against the Cardinals. It's too soon (and they are too weak an opponent) to make any long term predictions, but if Harrington and the rookie keep playing that well, it may be a good season after all!  The Houson/Miami game is a good example of why sports betting is truly a sucker's endeavor. Stick to craps or roulette! I miss not having any fantasy team this year, but I forgot all about it and my  urlLink usual connection  didn't remind me. Slacker!

      Well, the  urlLink Friday Five  didn't completely suck this week, although I completely forgot it. But as is tradition round R&R, here it is 2 days late:   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?  So many to choose from! I dislike doing the dishes and doing laundry, but I do both when absolutely necessary.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?  Haha, no. I don't mind general straightening up, or vacuuming, but otherwise cleaning sucks.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?  As needed. And, as anyone who has lived with me or visited on a regular basis can attest, my definition of "needed" doesn't always square with the rest of society's.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?  Only that once you try and clean something, you really clean it. I'm picky that way - no half-assed dishwashing or laundry. It's all or nothing in these parts!   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   Myself. Prior to that, I washed two knives yesterday so that I could make a PB&J sandwich. Why two? Because why wash just one knife! That'd be  crazy .  Also: Happy Birthday to  urlLink Raf , who is a whopping 25 today. Welcome to the first day of the gradual slope downward into old age and senility!  And: Credit goes to Cindy and Lisa, who did not punch me last night while we were discussing why older men are creeps for dating younger women. I tend to get quite loquacious when I've had a some wine (not drunk! just enough to make me fiery), and I always want to give anyone who puts up with me and my ranting a commendation.

       Red Wine is the Devil's Creation   Well, that's a little dramatic. Good time at Hilary's last night, warming her house (and attempting to fix her DSL) and such. I always try to mingle and meet some new people, and this was no different, but I also end up talking to those with whom I already have a good rapport. Hilary and Becky still have a really nice apartment, at a great location (walking distance to the bars in PB). I should spend more time there, it's so nice.   Sunday, as some of you may remember, is library day! So I will be hitting the books, though maybe not actually AT the library, as my head hurts and I'd rather not go outside in the bright, unforgiving sunshine of San Diego. Mild hangovers rock.

       Warmest Regards   It's been awhile since I bitched about the heat, so here we go! The time is 11:50 in the p.m., and the temperature in my apartment is currently 84 degrees.  I have to go to a meeting tomorrow for law review. Yes, tomorrow. Saturday. At 10 a.m. I still have no faculty advisor, it was impossible to find anyone today because the power was out on campus for a couple of hours. So now I'm down to one day, which is scary but I think I'll manage. I have to spend most of the day chasing professors around the building, but by God I'll nab one of those rascally critters.  Oh, and I now officially open the door for any suggestions on a topic to write about (for Law Review). It needs to concern a very recent and narrowly-defined legal development. I'll give you a shout-out in the notes if I end up writing about it! Blatant solicitation for ideas: finished.

      Training Session: finished  Trainer: hot chick from Alaska (!)  Status: badly out of shape  Recommendation: getting more than 750 calories a day  On the upside, my body fat analysis was lower than expected (I am "in shape" for a 25 year old) and I managed to actually DO all the exercises. I see the benefit of a trainer, actually, because she really does know how to make me more tired doing less things. Alas, if only I could afford it. I have one more next week (still free) but after that, who knows! I learned a few new things, though she made me use that lame-o ball thing that I hate and now I feel like a girl.   Off to campus to continue my day of humiliation, this time academically.

       And the beat goes on   Last week seemed like it would never end. This week seems to be passing at a snail's pace as well. I hope the semester picks up some speed, otherwise it will take me 5 years to get to December.  I don't mind deadlines, but I don't like having to rely on other people when deadlines loom. It's hard to wait for a professor to give me thumbs up/thumbs down, because I don't even feel like I can ask more than one at a time. Combine that with a sensible waiting period for response and a due date of Monday, and you have a big green stress pickle.  My complimentary training session at 24 Hour Fitness is in an hour. I should probably take another vitamin or do something to get some energy. Also, must prepare anti-trainer mantra "I am a poor law student, I have no money for training sessions." Bring her on!  p.s. new layout day. woot!

      Well, partial mystery of my life partially solved. After yet another weird late-night phone call (which may or may not be related but it got me thinking) I decided to find out what was up. I kick myself for not thinking of it before, but I simply googled my new phone number and voila! I have received a couple strange messages and actually spoke to one or two people who seemed embarrassed to have the wrong number, and now I know why. It's the old number for a place in Hillcrest called "Gaymart"! Hooray for me!   So that explains a few things. I dunno exactly what Gaymart sells, but apparently people feel comfortable calling them at interestingly late hours. This also explains (sort of) why the gay bookstore in DC called me the second day that I lived here. Still a weird coincidence, but not quite as weird.  To briefly sum up: - gay-looking car - live near gay area of city - lots of chicks as friends - phone number that used to belong to extraordinarily gay store - almost startlingly handsome (haha! i just threw that one in)  And yet, I'm straight! You need only take a peek in my closet to make that determination. For now, I will simply take the odd calls with a grain of salt and mild amusement. Bring 'em on!

      Quick weekend recap, now that I'm more coherent than 9a.m. was allowing.   Socially, it was uneventful. But I was busy so that's okay.  Personally, it was okay. I bought a crapload of stuff at  urlLink Ikea  (including a rug, a CD tower, and a DVD shelf that I can't mount without proper wall screws) and a few things at Lowe's. That was an abuse of money, I tell you what. Today, I finally bit the bullet and joined up at  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness . They were having a deal, however, and I actually saved a bit of money and got the any-Fitness-club membership at the same time. Hooray for that! I'll try and go tomorrow or Wednesday, at least once before my complimentary "training session" on Thursday. I expect that will be depressing when I find out I have a body-fat index of 112% ("hey, no eating in the tank!").   Academically, it was actually quite good. On Sunday night someone from  urlLink USD Law Review  called and, in what I'm sure will be revealed as a practical joke at some point this week, told me my write-on entry was accepted. I wasn't quite sure if "accepted" was Law Review-speak for "weakly argued and poorly constructed", but before I could ask what she meant she started in on what I had to do to prepare for this week (meetings, etc.) and I was convinced for the duration of the phone call. So, it appears that until otherwise notified, I'm on Law Review. There goes the neighborhood! The other fairly good news was that I got a B in Evidence for the summer. Not the A I was knocking-on-wood for, but respectable nonetheless. And at 4 credits (and a key class), it's also my best permanent grade thus far in Law School.   So, when all was said and done, not a bad few days. That's about as much praise as I'll ever give anything, ever, so remember where you were when you read it!

      Well  urlLink this is just a shame . Of course, he was much older than I had thought, so it's not quite tragic. Still, no more Death Wish movies?? At least his death will have no effect on his presence as a source of humor on The Simpsons.  Charles Bronson 1922-2003 "This. Ain't. Over."  In other news, it's 9:50 in the a.m. and I'm still tired so no more updating. Later when thoughts less jumbled and incoherent. Raspberry rollercoaster waterbed.

       Behold the pale horse. The man who sat on him was death, and Hell followed with him.   Death is inevitable. There are some who devote significant portions of their life towards fighting against it, but it is the one constant in our existence (you don't have to pay taxes if you don't want to). It sometimes strikes me as amazing that throughout the history of mankind, the only thing that every single human has in common with every other human is that he or she will die.  I don't mean any of this to sound depressing, or even fatalistic. I see the inevitability of the future as a challenge, a test of how much living one person can cram into their life. Immortality is only fascinating because we're not immortal, because we can easily conceive of living 10 lifetimes but will not, no matter how hard we try, be allowed to do so.  Of course, that's assuming that like me, you don't believe in reincarnation. I don't know exactly what I believe lies in waiting for us when we enter that long dark sleep - maybe that's all it really is. Nothingness is a scary idea, to those who are conscious. But how much does the idea of nothingness scare you when you're unconscious? Isn't it strange that the idea of oblivion is much scarier than oblivion itself, which because of the very nature of the idea, means you can't really "experience" it. I suppose that death might bring a sort of "half-nothing, half-consciousness" whereby we can still perceive and think, but have nothing to perceive or think about. Now  that  is a scary proposition - trapped in a featureless void for eternity, with only your thoughts as companions.  The good news is, that seems highly unlikely. If there is a creator or higher being, I'm sure it wouldn't put all this together just to strand everyone in hell for eternity. And if there isn't a God, then biologically speaking at death we should all simply lose consciousness, and that's that. And that's not so bad, because it's not like you'll know you're dead.   The finality of death on one's own consciousness is the most severe event a person can experience, I think. There is no coming back from that, and given the nature of sentience (we're all alone/existence is only in your mind/etc.), every person's death is the complete annihilation of an entire universe - the universe created in and by your brain. No wonder we're not rushing towards it. Even though we all know death isn't the end of everything (because we're not dead, and others are, and we're still here), on an individual level it  is  the end of the world, as far as the dead guy is concerned.   So what's my point? I'm not afraid of death. I don't know how original or unique that is (probably not at all), but at some point in the past 10 years, I reached a certain clarity concerning my own demise. I'm not exactly in a hurry to get there, but when it happens it's not like I'll know, or will be able to sit around saying "Well that sucked. Now I'm dead!" And if I can do that, well hey that sounds like a pretty sweet deal too. This doesn't mean I'm fearless by any stretch of the imagination. I'd rather not get shot, stabbed, or run over by a bus. I'd rather not get a debilitating illness, or be sent to the electric chair. But those are simply means to an end, and while the means are avoidable, the end is not.   Or, maybe when you die you end up in Tucson, AZ, for eternity. It's not like I know.

      Figured I'd do a quick FF since it seems relevant to today's spookiness.   1. What was your first Halloween costume?  I can't really remember, but I'm pretty sure it was something like Spider-Man, or perhaps a cowboy or something. My parents would be better folk to ask.    2. What was your best costume and why?  Hmm, best? I've never really felt like I had a kick-ass Halloween costume, I'm not sure why. Maybe because I end up being something lame because of a lack of proper inspiration. Those vampire teeth I had once were pretty cool. But honestly I haven't had a  real  costume in years.   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?  Nah, but only because I stopped seeking treats before I fully understood how to trick (or that it was my God-given Halloween right, nay duty, to do so). I remember being shocked when my friends took all the candy from one of those idiotic "Help Yourself" bowls that less-bright homeowners set out.   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)  Well we carved pumpkins, sure, but that's not really special. Other than that, no, most of our family-specific traditions are Christmas-related.    5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!  Well I'm not going to  share  it - my favorite scary "stories" are always the ones based around Christian mythology (like Omen), simply because of my background. They always seem the most "realistic" or possible scenarios (at least compared to ghost stories and such - not compared to Real Life).  I kind of like Halloween, but not because of the dressing-up part, which is more of a stressful endeavor than what I would call "fun". I like being scared, or scaring people - but I mean real scary, not "boo! haha you suck!" scary. I've always thought the underlying pagan-ness of the holiday was cool, and creepy, and that's the Halloween I've always looked forward to.  Later today: a treatise on death and the afterlife, unless I experience it due ot the sheer boredom of ConLaw.

      Today's Sky: Stormy Today's Smell: Normal, Except in the Library, Which Smells Like Burning Today's Goal: Write 5 Pages of Comment  Haha! I lied. No long rambling tirades about anything yesterday, or today for that matter. I'm back where I belong (the library) and scrambling to catch up on my work. It's gonna be a long day, and unless a meteor hits the parking lot (which I can see from my spot in the library), there won't be any updates after this.   Unless I feel like it. I'm quite the dictatorial overlord when it comes to this little slice of the Internet. Kneel! Kneel before Zod! I mean Sam!

      Today's Sky: Simply Gray Today's Smell: Whiff of Smoke Today's Sanity: Not Quite Tom Hanks in "Cast Away", But Getting There  This fire is starting to rob me of good blog topics. Without going outside, even just to school or the library, I am robbed of the opportunity to participate in oh-so-many wacky adventures and colorful situations. Perhaps today, my loyal readers will be blessed with an essay (rant) or seven on more philosophical topics (life, love, meaningful employment in an era of material wealth, etc.), which I haven't really had in awhile.   But that will need to wait until after breakfast. My brain doth not philosophize well without sustenance.

       This Is Getting Silly   I appreciate the fact that the air has a certain "black lung" quality to it, but they've now cancelled Wednesday's classes. I don't know how we're going to make this all up, I officially have only one more class this week. The most annoying part is that the library is closed - I can live without classes (who can't?) but I need to get to some books so I can complete my assignments.   Level of Annoyance... rising.

      Today's Sky: Blue(!)-Gray Today's Smell: Morning in the Woods Today's School: Still Cancelled  So the smoke is clearing nicely, air quality is still quite poor in all areas, which I believe is why we still have school cancelled. Not that we hold classes outside (I wish) but better safe than sorry, I guess. The fire itself is still raging, but now focusing its considerable wrath on the eastern front, which is sparsely populated.  In other news, I slept weird (or something) and now my neck is in great pain. Sometimes you eat the bear, and, well, sometimes the bear... he eats you. Since school is closed (which means the library isn't open) I'll be spending a third straight fun-filled day in my apartment writing my comment. On the plus side, I only have two classes left this week (as long as they don't cancel class tomorrow).

       Two Things   1. School of Rock is pretty good. It was a movie with kids that didn't suck, and wasn't overtly sappy (or even remotely sappy). Jack Black was funny as always, and those kids could play like you wouldn't believe. All in all, worth seeing, though perhaps on video. It starts a little slow.  2. My street has turned into a river, from some busted water main. Just now! It sounds like it's raining, but alas the firefighters aren't that lucky. Instead, they're getting screwed because hundreds of thousands of gallons of water are flowing down the hill, well away from any actual flames. This probably means I don't have any water pressure at all. The water company has been called.  Odd that I've seen 2 movies in theaters in 2 days, and before that hadn't seen one in 3 months. Okay, not odd, just a sad reflection on a busy law student's life.

       Cancelled, part II   No classes tomorrow, either! Hooray for fire! Wait... okay not hooray, but that's cool. The downside of course being that they will find a way to reschedule these classes, somehow - taking away our study days before finals, perhaps? Law schools are bound by the American Bar Association to keep the hours of class time strictly monitored - you can't just cancel repeated classes, because the ABA will come along and discredit your institution.  Of course, natural disaster is probably an exception of some kind. More time for writing my stupid comment which I am slowly growing to loathe.  I forgot to mention earlier - I saw Kill Bill this weekend, finally. It was very good, I thought - the violence, as much as it was talked about,  was  intense, but it was also quite stylized. Not quite tongue-in-cheek, but also not "ultra-real". Three and a half stars (not four because it wasn't a whole movie).

      I would much, much rather be  urlLink here  today. Then again, I'd much rather I was there almost every day. Do you think secluded resorts need on-site lawyers?  Possible downside of tropical paradise: volcanos.  I'm now debating whether I should bother driving over to school to drop off my cite-checking assignment. It's due by 5 p.m. today, and it's done, but with school being closed I'm not sure if I should bother. Our editors, always the helpful fellows, haven't bothered to send out an email or anything. Way to be on the ball, guys!  p.s. I wouldn't have minded being  urlLink here , either.   p.p.s. (3:00pm)  urlLink CNN.com  is finally covering the fire as their "top story" - now that it has burned 200,000 acres and killed a dozen people. I understand that explosions in Baghdad is an important story, but I really think they've dropped the ball on this one.

      Today's Sky: Yellowish Today's Smell: Campfire Today's Football: Moved to Arizona  Looks like I'll be spending the day holed up inside, working on my law review comment. No pesky class to get in my way! The fires are still going fairly strong, the biggest concern now being that the winds will pick back up (as they often do during the day) and reinvigorate the blaze.  Fortunately I made a trip to the supermarket last night (the fire and brimstone was suppressing the picketer turnout) and now have plenty of Chips Ahoy to make it through the next few hours. The next few hours of continual news coverage, which is wearing thin but hard to turn off. I don't want to miss something if the fire suddenly surges 10 miles westward, because I don't want to find out about danger by seeing my car explode.  I hope my hiking hill (Mt. Cowles) is okay. Not that a mountain can burn down, but it will be less interesting to hike if it's a scorched, blackened rock.   Silver Lining Update:  The smoke-filtered sunlight makes me look really, really tan.

      Well, classes have been canceled for tomorrow. Not that USD is really in any danger (at least right now), but the fires aren't under control and I think they want people to chill out at home tomorrow.   It's times like these that make me wish I lived in a dorm-like setting, or at least had a roommate. Someone to talk to, at least. On the other hand, I'm sure all the people that have roommates and have been inside all day are getting sick and tired of them. Grass is always greener!   Still, classes may be cancelled tomorrow but I'm gonna go crazy if I have to stay in this damn apartment all day. I'll find something to do (besides being cooked alive by the raging conflagration).

          It's the End of the World As We Know It  And I Feel Fine.    I woke up at about 9:30 this morning (having unchanged the clocks, so 8:30) and the light coming in the window was pure orange. "That's odd," I thought, and went back to sleep. At (real time) 9:45 or so, I got up and noticed it was still orange. "Perhaps that's not a 'sunrise' effect," I thought, and looked out the window to see a dark orange sky and a blood red sun. "Well, I should get dressed and prepare for the Four Horsemen," I thought.  Fires! San Diego is on fire, in the eastern county. For any who are wondering, that's nowhere near me (well, nearer than L.A., but probably 15 miles from my apartment), but the ash is falling everywhere. If people weren't dying it would be pretty cool. The firefighters are a bit short-handed because they sent extra men/machines up north to the L.A. area a few days ago to deal with those fires, and now... bam! There are six different fire fronts in east San Diego, all moving in random directions, and we sort of need those firefighters to come back.  I may have missed out on the hurricane, but now I get my own State of Emergency because everything's burning down. It's California's answer to lightning storms! Perhaps I'll take some pictures to share.  Edit: It's  urlLink orange  out here. And a  urlLink few others .

      It's a beautiful day out, so I'm celebrating by confining myself to the library for hours of thankless work. Especially thankless because it's all for law review, which gives me no grades. I'm trying to get some actual writing down on my soon-to-be-due Comment, but it's exceedingly difficult to make the transition from outline to actual paragraphs. Especially when I use up all my creativity on this blog.  Anywho! Went bowling last night for the first time in a couple of years. It was fun, but it turns out that, as Marek put it, bowling is not like riding a bike. You can't be "not bad" and then go 2 years without touching a ball, and then be "not bad" immediately. I only broke 100 once (the last game), but really bowling is more about hanging out than it is about competition. Says the man who lost every game.  Back to the paper. I think I'm getting a little burned out on Intellectual Property these days - what with a class (Intro to IP), my paper (copyright law) and cite-checking (currently an article on trademark), that's a helluva lot of IP to digest. Onward and upward!

      Have you seen those new AT&T Wireless commercials? The ones where people are on the go/stuck in traffic, and they use their cell phones to talk to their kids? I find them oddly touching. The one where the guy is in the hotel, then the airport delayed, and suddenly his daughter appears and they talk about her day is especially sweet. The whole point (that the phone is so clear it's like your loved one is right there) is sort of secondary to the idea that talking to your kids can really make a tough day/situation seem better.  That's all for now. It's been a long day and I need to rest.

       Public Service Announcement:   Don't ever, ever try to represent yourself in criminal court without a lawyer. Ever. No matter how smart you think you are, no matter how many years of post-graduate education you might have - hell even if you ARE a lawyer, it's not a good idea. People who represent themselves pro se (without an attorney) are basically putting up no viable defense. It's almost a waste of a court's time, because pleading guilty would probably get you to the same result, only much faster and more eloquently.  It's not that you're stupid, or lack the abilities to follow the court proceedings (though most defendants who go pro se are, in fact, morons), it's just that lawyers have far more training than you do. It would be like asking to remove your own gall bladder, or pilot your own Delta flight to Newark. Just because you watch ER every week and have seen Top Gun 32 times, doesn't mean you're qualified to actually do those things. And thus, watching Law & Order or reading John Grisham books likewise has the same effect. The only difference is, our judicial system will actually let you try if you really want to (and you're mentally competent).   That's a little bit crazy, if you ask me. And you're more than a little bit crazy if you put your freedom in your own hands. As noble as it may sound, take it from someone who knows - the judicial system is far too complicated to be successfully navigated by a layman.  (This message brought to you by  urlLink John Allen Muhammad , who made the first correct decision in years this morning by rehiring his attorneys)  ps.  urlLink Elliot Smith ?  What the hell, man? I wasn't a huge fan (well, except for Miss Misery, though everybody likes that one) but damn son. Also, stabbing yourself to death? Weird.

       Sam Bitches About the Weather #9,301    We're havin a heat wave, a tropical heat wave.  Not quite tropical, but it gives me something to blog about momentarily. Tonight I was out driving around (for fast food, because the grocery store strike is keeping me away from buying cookable food - but that's a separate story) and it was just about 6:30. The sun had set, and the air had taken on that cool, twilight-induced feeling that comes in San Diego after an especially hot day. When the sun goes down in the desert, the temperature drops significantly, but there's enough warmth left to keep the windows down. It's almost like the day is over, and the night is a separate enough entity to instill that "brand new day" feeling, only without having to wake up from a comfortable sleep.   There's just something about that time of day - it's one of my favorites, but I can't quite explain why. Perhaps if I were a better writer. And if wishes were wings, we'd all fly.

      I just watched a particularly strange edit of a scene of "The Big Lebowski" on Comedy Central. Normally such movies are a waste of time on network or censored cable, but I was curious to see how they'd handle the "Confrontation of Young Larry" scene.  Suffice to say, the repeated line "This is what happens when you f--- a stranger in the ass, Larry" becomes (for the most part) "This is what happens, Larry." Except for one key moment, where they actually replaced the line with (to the best that I could hear): "This is what happens when you fight a stranger in the Alps."   Um.  What?  I know it can be hard to make sense of parts of the Big Lebowski, but really Comedy Central probably shouldn't even TRY to show the movie. It's really a disservice to the movie - and how come they can't just bleep stuff?  It doesn't matter. But the movie really takes on a surreal quality when viewed on broadcast (or equivalent) television. Yikes.

      Every year the Lions have a really, really bad game. A game that reminds you how utterly awful they are, a game that expresses clear doubts about their ability to even function as a professional football team. Today is that game.  As I write this, it is the end of the third quarter and the Lions have racked up an astounding  63 yards of total offense . Not only that, but the defense has allowed the Cowboys (who, in all fairness, have been quite good this year) to score repeatedly. I'm not really going to get into it much more, but suffice to say I actually feel physically sick when I see such a bad performance. It's one thing to get beat (see every game following their first) but it's another thing to embarass yourselves to such a high degree. I was hoping for mediocrity this year, but it appears as though that was too lofty a goal. Why can't any of MY teams have a "Cinderella" year? Hell, Tampa Bay was the NFL's whipping boy for ages; same with the Patriots. They both went on to bigger and better. But the Lions? Mediocre from the start (no Super Bowl titles or appearances) and now a laughingstock, as far as I'm concerned.   No other news. I'm in the library, and will be for the bulk of the afternoon I imagine. Besides lunch, of course, which is rapidly approaching. First, we finish reading copyright theory. Woo.  ps. Mike McMahon replaced Joey Harrington as QB and has yet to even complete a pass.  pps. He ended up completing 6. Of course, one of those was to the other team.

      I've always know the New York Post was trashy and tabloidesque, but now we know  urlLink they're morons , too. In some alternate (better) reality, the Sox are in the World Series. Unfortunately for those of us in this dimension, the Yankees (current level of hatred: above bad drivers, below Hitler, and rising) can be assured that their deal with Satan is secure.   Marlins-Yankees World Series? Color me bored. Remember when the Diamondbacks beat the crap out of the Yankees that year? That was the only World Series that was remotely entertaining in recent memory. That was pretty awesome, too.

       urlLink   Forgot to mention earlier, I went hiking up Mt. Cowles again with Jaime, and this time I brought my camera. Only mildly interesting pictures, but since I'm uploading them for J, I figured I might as well share with the group.  urlLink Have at it , will ya!

       There's No "Stupid Retard Fan" in "Team"   Too bad about the Cubs, eh? But I guess that makes my last post (agonizing over who I should root for) moot. I think the fuss over that fan who messed up the foul ball play is extraordinarily silly - it would have been the 2nd out (not the 3rd) and it was not at the end of the game. Yeah, it was annoying, but did that fan then put on a Cubs uniform and misplay an easy grounder to short? Nope, that was the Cubs. Did he take over the pitching duties and allow the Marlins a high-scoring inning? Nope, that too was the Cubs. Lastly, did he take over the organization and tell every player to let Game 7 go? Not at all - he just messed up a foul ball. Leave him alone, Cubs fans, and worry more about why the Cubbies let the Marlins walk all over them for 2 games straight.  Kind of reminds me of Buckner's mistake in Boston (Buckner is the right name, yes? Boston fans?) - lots of people forget that yeah, he blew that game, but there was another entire game after that! Buckner certainly screwed the pooch, but the whole team lost the next game. This is sort of why I never blame the individual in team sports - there's something to be said for messing up morale, sure, but overall the situation could always have been averted had the team say, scored more points earlier. Kickers are often blamed for such losses in close football games (when they miss field goals), but guess what? The team wouldn't have NEEDED that field goal had the offense scored more, or had the defense kept the other team at bay.   I got a wholly unjustified parking ticket yesterday, which I'm appealing. Might as well put this law school education to good use! I'm arguing lack of notice and entrapment. I'm also getting started on my Official Law School Comment That Will Never See The Light of Publication, the first draft of which is due in a couple weeks. I probably should have started earlier, but if you know me then you know starting with 2+ weeks until the due date is pretty damn good.   Someone remind me to call Verizon in Virginia and cancel Raf's phone service. No, not out of spite, they're moving. I probably should have changed that over to Raf's name about, oh, 14 months ago, but I'm lazy. Verrrrry lazy.  ps. I hate the Yankees. The Marlins are boring. Please, Baseball Gods, let the Sox make the Series interesting...

      Here's the thing about the Red Sox.  I've been hearing some (still wishful) talk about a Sox/Cubs World Series. Everyone asks, "Who do you root for? The lovable loser Cubs, who always suck but seem so good-natured about it? Or the angry, bitter Red Sox, whose fans will burn down a good portion of the northeast corridor when/if they lose (or as all Sox fans put it, 'choke')?"  Allow me to inject my own thoughts, as this is my own blog. I like the Sox. This is chiefly based on one primary emotion: fear. Fear of Red Sox fans. Instead of asking, "who deserves to win it all?" we should be asking "who can take a loss better?" And I don't think I have to convince too many people that the Cubs fans are in a far better position to get shot down than the Boston fans. The Red Sox are, and have been for quite a few years now, quite good. They just keep missing out on the big time - because of a curse, poor coaching, morale, who knows - and coming up short. The Chicago Cubs, however, suck. Not this year, no - they made it to the playoffs fair and square. But overall...  not so much. While it may not be what the Baseball Gods had in mind, in this particular case the Red Sox seem the more prudent choice for a blessing.  And, the Red Sox fans are bitter. I know because I lived with  urlLink one of them  for a couple years. Putting aside merit, history, luck, and fate, I would like to see them go all the way for a single reason: I like to imagine my friend Adam  isn't  having an aneurysm.

       Annoyed at the World   At approximately 5:30am, I awoke to a call of nature as people often are. At 5:35am, just minutes after snuggling back into warm, comfy bed for at 2 more hours of wholesome sleep, neighbor's alarm clock goes off. It's set to "radio" and stays on for nearly 15 minutes at high volume. It stays on, I can't get back to sleep. 15 minutes after it's finally shut off, neighbor's cell phone starts ringing. And ringing. And ringing. Voicemail, where art thou?? 15 minutes after that, radio goes on again. Thankfully only for 45 seconds, but enough to completely wake me up.   Repeat ad nauseum until 7:45 when my alarm goes off, which I absentmindedly turn completely off. No snooze for me! 8:20 comes, and uh-oh, somebody's not up! Record-setting morning routine goes into action, and I'm out the door by 8:30.   Morena Blvd. (easiest way to campus) is under construction. While it has been under construction for weeks, today some brilliant tactician had decided that a guy with a "Slow" sign is necessary. Cue huge backup of traffic coming off I8 (apparently "Slow" is most important sign since "Warning: Tire Damage. Do Not Back Up."). Rewards for oversleeping/traffic: Crappy parking spot, no chance to review last night's reading.  At least I wasn't called on. All whining aside, it's not that bad, I'm just exhausted from only 5 hours of quality sleep, and I'm about 10 minutes away from calling it a day completely and going home. I have a class at 3:30, but lord knows I don't have enough work (that I actually want to do) to fill the 4.5 hours between now and then. And I can't just sit here and blog all day, because I would bore even myself (I assume everyone else will attain total blog boredom... now).  ps. I got a parking ticket while returning to SDSU for more library work. I hate them.

      Twas a good weekend, all in all. Friday night was spent hanging out with someone that I see far too infrequently. Cheers to that! And I checked out a new bar that reminded me of a couple that I've been to in the midwest. Good fly-over folk, they is!  Saturday was a social wash, but I visited SDSU (see previous post) and then spent an easy evening watching movies at home. In bed before midnight! On a Saturday! Oddly enough, I didn't mind that much. Sunday was fun, I hung out with Hilary and we went to the beach (visiting, not laying out) and marveled at our lucky fortunes at living in such a city on such a fine, fine day. Being from the east coast, I think we have a bit more perspective on that type of thing than the locals, who take it for granted.   Also I bought new sunglasses, ending my record-setting 6 week streak of going glasses-less. Glassesless? Glassless? Forget it.  And of course, let me congratulate certain somebodies on a certain something. I don't wanna steal anybody's blog thunder, so go  urlLink read about it  yourself.   Go BoSox!

      San Diego Library Tour 2003 has officially ended (for this week), as I have now visited all my required libraries and tracked down all but a pesky two of my cited sources for law review. San Diego State University was today's final stop, and boy did that place bring back memories of my alma mater (Virginia Tech). It's huge! It's like an orange on a toothpick!  It also made me appreciate our undergrads slightly (very slightly) more than I have. Not because SDSU's kids are inferior in any way, but simply because at least the undergrads here at USD are  my  undergrads. Vapid? Sure. Vacuous? Definitely. Rich? Very. But they're still USD, so at least in a bar fight with SDSU punks, I'd back them up. School pride stirring at last? I wouldn't go that far, but I'm glad to be here and not at the monolithic SDSU.  So to summarize - the best library in San Diego is still the Legal Research Center here at USD. Then, Copley library (the undergrad library at USD). Both are very well laid out, and have nice furnishings. Third place goes to SDSU, but only because it's huge and contains most (if not all) the books that the other libraries don't have. Fourth goes to CSU San Marcos, but it was a squeaker. It was just too small and too... public library-ish. Bleh. Not to mention the university has a grand tradition of academic excellence dating back to last Tuesday.

      I don't believe I have ever put the remote control down in a place that, when I return to the TV, would be conveniently accessible. Ever, in my lifetime. It's almost always across the room, or in the kitchen (!?), or something. I usually try and use the Force to recall it to me, but for the most part my lack of Jedi abilities precludes any progress during such endeavors.   Manly  urlLink Friday Five  this week. Sports sports sports sports! Marge, Bart sits in front this week because he's a good guy at sports.   1. Do you watch sports? If so, which ones?  Sometimes. I watch NFL football, and Virginia Tech if they're on TV. I will go to any sports event, though, because I think they're fun and entertaining, even if I'm not a huge fan (example: basketball).   2. What/who are your favorite sports teams and/or favorite athletes?  Sigh. The woeful Detroit teams, who lately could not find a championship if it walked up and kicked them in the groin. The Tigers (see my many previous laments) are the worst team in all of baseball, and probably worse than many farm teams. The Lions are having a lackluster season, despite the new direction of Mariucci. They have promise, though. The Redwings really blew it last season, but usually they're quite good. Do the Pistons still play? I have no idea.   3. Are there any sports you hate?  Depends. I hate watching golf, and I'm not a huge fan of playing it either. Tennis is also boring (to me).  4. Have you ever been to a sports event?  Of course, I'm not a shut-in. I've been to NCAA Football games, baseball games, a couple basketball and hockey games. Never a professional football game, though. I've always loved going to baseball games - the atmosphere of the ballpark is one of those rare gems in life.  5. Do/did you play any sports (in school or other)? How long did you play?  Not anymore, though I rowed for the crew (team) in highschool. Thought about it in college, but they were too disorganized and, well, not very good. I was used to winning, so I wussed out and haven't been in a boat for about 7 years now. Some of my fondest high school memories are from our days on the water.

      I found  urlLink this article  quite amusing. I will admit to having only two of the 10 socially-destructive habits/hobbies, though to be honest of one of them has fallen to the wayside for lack of time/money.   Besides, even at my worst I never dressed up or went to conventions or got into huge arguments with other ner-- ahem, devoted fans.   Should I see Kill Bill when it comes out (this Friday, I think)? I might have time, but then if I do, should it be given to a movie by Quentin Tarantino?  Life is full of tough choices.

      It was a beautiful day in my neighborhood, today. Not that it isn't regularly beautiful, but with fall comes cloudy skies on a daily basis, but today it was spectacular. I spent a good portion of it driving up to San Marcos to steal books from the Cal State University in the area. Unfortunately, the books I wanted to steal ended up being useless.   San Marcos is an interesting area, though. Much what I imagine the non-coastal areas are like in California; hilly, but barren and hot hot hot. The university itself looks brand new - I kept expecting to turn a corner and see styrofoam peanuts flowing out of a building. And for 2:30 in the afternoon, it sure wasn't crowded - but then who goes to San Marcos for school?   In blogging news, I added a couple more links to the left there, chiefly because there are a couple non-friend blogs that I read (I mentioned them both a few months ago) and I figured why not share the mirth. They're both highly entertaining, and I get my fix of east coast attitude every time I read and enjoy. Every so often, the entire blogging crew lurches into action and adjusts things. It's always fun to watch.   My own links area is starting to look like the cast of a screwball comedy. Maybe they need renaming...

       The End Is Nigh Update   It's over, and the big lunk won. Okay, it's not "over" but for statistical purposes, it has been Yes on the recall and Yes on Schwarzenegger. By a wide margin, which just confirms my suspicions that the people of California are complete boneheads.  You elected an action-movie star with no clear policies, no intelligent goals, and a history of sexual assault to governor of the 6th largest economy in the solar system.   And you did it by using a recall election, which is such a crock of shit it pains me to think about it. On the upside, we can start recalling Schwarzenegger tomorrow, right? Let's never have a real election again! Why not just buy elections at the whim of any wealthy car alarm magnate!  Sons of bitches. I'm going to bed. Then, I'm moving back to the east coast where (with the exception of the southern states) we don't engage in such asinine behavior.   (postscript: here's a  urlLink map of who to blame  for this mess)

      On a completely non-Recall related note, I have been meaning to mention how effective that Do Not Call list has been for me. I already have a number of wrong-numbers each week because of my infamous number (I believe I mentioned it  urlLink back in early September ), but now all the "No Information" (almost always a telemarketer) calls have ceased. Before: 3 or 4 calls every night. Now: 0 calls! Hooray!   Wait, maybe that's bad. Nobody calls me. Well, you win some, you lose some.  The cool thing is, the DNC list isn't even official yet (is it?) because the courts are still wrangling with the constitutionality of it. Yet it scares the telemarketers enough to shut them up already. Three cheers for fear as a motivational tool!

All he needs to do now to secure the win is come out against cancer and nun-beating.   Vote Schwarzenegger: If You Were Running for Governor, He'd Vote for You.  Just for the record, if I can figure out where to vote tomorrow, I'm voting No on the recall, and then for Bustamante as the lesser of 130+ evils. Anyone who votes for Arnold hates democracy, as I see it. And kittens.

       Blog Correction   So I forget to mention awhile back that  urlLink this story  was a complete hoax. At the time, I was too filled with piss and vinegar to mention that it was slightly unbelievable, and I didn't see any follow-ups until today. But, as it turns out, Metallica is not that lame. They're lame enough in their legitimate endeavors without adding fictional threats of litigation to the pile.  Today in Intro to IP we started Copyright, which coincides nicely with my comment for Law Review. My first draft is due at the beginning of November, and even though it doesn't have to be the entire paper (just about 1/3 of it, I think), I still have to get crackin'.   Not today though! They're replacing my door (and hopefully, my DSL) as I speak, but lo, I am in the library with Hilary reading. Later, I'll be in the library reading. Then, it's off to the library for some reading. Then class.

      No DSL repair until Monday at the earliest. But this way, I'll at least get a credit of some kind on my account. Annoying not to have DSL on the weekends, especially given the lack of anything entertaining to do. I needs me some Internet!  Guess I'll be spending even more time at the library than originally planned. At least it's temperature controlled; my apartment dropped down to 65 last night! Don't read that as a complaint, though, I got to pretend it was "autumn" and that the weather was "turning cool". These are phrases that most native San Diegans are unfamiliar with.  Friday Five is all car related this week, and that bores me because I care little about cars. I watched "The Fast and the Furious" the other day, and while it was highly entertaining, it also made me a little bit embarrassed to be... I'm not sure, male? American? Not that most hobbies aren't pointless time wasters, but since I've never been interested in cars or racing, I find the entire street-racing, car-modifying subculture mystifying. Why not donate those thousands of dollars to charity, or go work for Nascar? Why endanger lives and waste hundreds of thousands of dollars on pimping out a Honda Civic? Honestly, I'm asking - is it just the speed thrill? The technical endeavor, the difficulty of the mechanics involved?  I suppose that's not much different from being a computer engineering geek (same technical/mechanical thrill), except for the danger part. Not that I can count myself in that category - I'm strictly a user, not a builder. Same goes for cars, actually. I will say this - Fast and the Furious made me miss my stick shift.

      Cite-checking is exponentially harder this time. Ironically, I have "half" as many to do (10 cites vs. 22 last time) but the 2nd citation contains about a dozen different references (and each one must be checked independently). I really dislike string citers, because they always throw in far more references than are necessary. To add insult to injury (or is it the other way around...) about half of my cites are nowhere to be found in the LRC. A couple are over in the non-law library (which means I have to associate with undergrads... the skin crawls at such an idea) and the rest of the missing sources are scattered around Southern California. So tomorrow or Sunday, I have to drive to SDSU and CSU San Marcos (I don't even know where that is) to find books.  Enough whining. It's not so bad, and I have another entire week in which to do this stuff, so it's not the worst thing ever. Not like being without DSL for 3 days (and counting!). Looks like I'll be getting some fresh air this weekend, if they haven't fixed it yet. Bah. Speaking of fresh air, I went hiking to the tallest point in San Diego yesterday with Jaime. It was quite fun, though because of the natural composition of San Diego (desert!) the trail consists primarily of dust and brush. Despite the poor foliage, it was still a good hike and provided a fairly nice view of the area. For about 5 minutes yesterday, I was the tallest thing in San Diego County. Hooray!  Now it is noon, and at noon, we lunch. Adios amigos!

      The thing about  urlLink this entire situation  (link goes to latest Post story) is that journalists seem to have forgotten their purpose. Yes, it's important to protect your source - when the source has a story. But if the story IS the source, things are different.   In this case, leaking the name of a covert CIA operative is a far more important story than the actual name of the operative. In fact, that story is better left untold - but the idea that someone would leak such information? That's huge, and should have been (and should still be) reported by the journalists that have that information.  Just my two cents. Journalists need to remember who they serve - the public, not their sources. And if burning a source is necessary to inform the public of a huge scandal, then burn your source and suffer the journalistic consequences. Lawyers have an obligation (sort of) to do the same thing, but I'll go into that later.  When I have my DSL back. Goddamn SBC. Bring it back!

      My DSL crapped out at about 7pm last night, and hasn't come back yet. That burns my muffins, I tell you what, because it's just annoying. If it's still out when I get back from class this afternoon, I'll have to make a call, and I absolutely abhore doing that, because they rarely help the situation. Not that there are too many people I talk to over IM anymore, but just in case anybody wonders (I know you don't).   Happy October! My how time flies when the Earth continues to revolve around the Sun. It has been a hectic month, to say the least, but I realized this morning that I've been waking up in a good mood for about 2 weeks straight now. That's pretty rare for me, especially since most of those days I have to go to class or the library or some otherwise unpleasant place. But things are looking up, in general.  Except in the area of Netflix, where I continue to doggedly hold on to the 3 movies I currently have out. I've only watched one of them (Two Towers), but I have seen one of the other two before (Thin Red Line, when it came out). I really need to bite the bullet and send a couple back, so that I can dislodge myself and start watching movies again. But then, things like the season premiere of Angel (tonight!) always get in the way. Tomorrow is dinner at a friend's, and Friday... well actually Friday is probably wide open. Sadly.  I'm also enjoying this October weather, because while the hot sunny San Diego is great, it's not often we mix it up around here, so the upcoming (as far as the weatherman says) "gloom" will be a nice start to autumn. Note: anybody who constantly feels "cold" all the time should probably consider changing locales to, say, sunny California. Or sunny Arizona. :-p  Oh, and I'm leaving law school to follow  urlLink this guy  around the country. To the Big Rock Candy Mountain!

      When I was but a wee lad, my parents divorced. It was all for the best, and that's not even hindsight talking. I thought it was for the best when it happened, and after a few sessions of obligatory post-split therapy, they were convinced that I really was okay with everything. Looking back, I wouldn't change a thing, mainly because I'm grateful on an almost daily basis for being raised the way I was.  In those days, my family called itself middle class but I'm fairly certain we were, if anything, low-low-low middle class. But despite what I'm sure were some difficult financial situations, I never really noticed. My mom always managed to give us a good Christmas, and while I didn't have nearly as many of the newest toys as my friend Paul (whose parents were engaged in a bidding war for his love), I don't remember feeling poor at all. Part of that, as I look back now, was because my parents are so levelheaded when it comes to activities. We went to the museums a few times (far more than most kids growing up outside DC), but we also went to parks, and took long walks, and flew kites. Our vacations weren't to tropical isles but rather to visit family in the swamps of Brooksville, FL or the lakeside of Port Huron, MI. Okay, a lakeside vacation is pretty good, but that was just luck - if my grandparents lived in Ypsilanti, we would have visited them there.  I guess my point is, thanks mom & dad. I may have been a colossal pain as a kid, but looking back I'm supremely grateful to have avoided being spoiled beyond recovery. I hope that, whether I have money or not, my kids can grow up the same way I did.

      I forget to mention the ultimate highlight from yesterday, the Lions'  urlLink 22-14 win  over the Packers! That'll teach Brett Fav-re to mess with us. As good as he is (and that's damn good) he is always hot-or-cold against the Lions.  Around now an argument usually surfaces that it is unfair to let the Lions play at home every year on Thanksgiving. It's an automatic advantage, there's no rotation among other teams (just in who plays the Lions), and in short it's an anomaly in the NFL schedule. All I have to say about that is: tradition! (cue Fiddler on the Roof soundtrack) Plus, the Lions suck, so who cares? Tradition!  Next week, the Lions play the Chargers (who also suck) in Detroit. So I get to watch 2 games in a row! Of course I'm rooting for the Lions instead of my adopted town, but that's fueled as much by my loyalty as it is by the Chargers' evil owner, who is now  urlLink suing the city of San Diego  for some reason. Boo!

      Had Thanksgiving "dinner" (at about 2pm) with a semi-pro ballplayer, a retired cardiologist, 4 or 5 lawyers, a Harvard 1L, and a couple fellow 2Ls from USD. Needless to say it was very entertaining and a very good time. Didn't quite stuff myself silly, but drank enough wine to make the ol' allergy kick and an cause a big fat headache later on in the evening. Surprising mainly because usually I need to get tipsy off the stuff for the headaches to start, but in this case I didn't have nearly enough to warrant such a reaction.  Enough with the sick-talk! It was still a great time and I'm very glad Hilary was able to swing me an invitation. Last night I also watched "Bruce Almighty" which, partially because of my headache and partially because of the movie, I was supremely (get it?) unimpressed with. There were some moments, to be sure, but overall I didn't really like it much until the very end. I laughed more during the DVD outtakes than the rest of the movie, and that's saying something.  I also saw (deep breath) "Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World" (whew!) which was as good as its title is awkward. Definitely the best 18th-century naval warfare movie I've seen in my 26 years, but then I'm not sure how many there have actually been. Worth checking out, though, if only to see a hobbit at the wheel of a British ship. Hilary liked it too, and at matinee prices (I was helping her skip class) it's a pretty good deal.  That is all!

      The latest entry over at  urlLink It's My Life  got me to thinking about what it really means if a person is deficient in character. I've never had a huge urge to send out things like Christmas cards, and I don't even think of "welcoming" new people to town (mostly because I think "who the hell am I to welcome you?"), and the only birthday cards I send are to those I think would appreciate it (and when I remember).  But on the other hand, I try to be someone that will do anything for my friends and family. Lots of people may go through life firing of Hallmarks every week or two, but when the chips are down will they be there? Even if the chips aren't down, will they help you move, or drive you to the car repair shop, or pick you up from the airport? These are things that, if possible, I would do for almost any friend I have. I'm fairly certain that doesn't go both ways, but I don't really care about that because it's not part of my mental equation. It's not about getting something in return, it's about being reliable and someone people can count on.  Fortunately (or as I sometimes see it, unfortunately) my friends don't take advantage of this personality trait very often. I'm not sure how many friends actually know the extent to which I'd go out of my way to help, and those that do know, don't ask me to. Since I'm not very good at expressing myself in other ways (cards, flowers, intricately-woven homemade quilts, etc.), I think it sometimes makes me come off as uncaring or aloof, and that's a shame.   In case I forget, Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate it. Go Lions!

      I know I link to  urlLink Slate  frequently, but it really does have numerous intelligent columns that you should be reading weekly. Today's  urlLink Ad Report Card  is quite amusing, and anyone who watches TV with me will probably see why Seth Stevenson and I might have been separated at birth.  Slate also covered  urlLink the KFC commercial  that dubiously claimed fried chicken is healthy. Who knew!

      Yes, no update for a few days. I'm busy, that's why! You're not the boss of me!  I'm quite swamped with end-of-the-semester work (which consists chiefly of attempting to outline and failing miserably) so the blog may be a bit quiet for the next couple weeks. Quiet, of course, meaning once every few days instead of every day. It's not the lack of time so much as it's the lack of thought-provoking outside stimulus.  Today we have this: if you're ever thinking of breaking into a significant other's email account, stop right then and take a big step back. Yes, reading someone's email is a big violation of privacy and blah blah blah, but my point here is that if you feel you need to take that step, the relationship may not be worth jeopardizing. Either you don't trust him/her, which is a pretty big problem, or you have exceptionally good reason not to trust him/her and need confirmation, which is just as bad.  Either way, skip the privacy violation and dump his/her ass. Or, god forbid, talk about it.   By the by, this isn't a response to anything in particular - nobody's reading my email. Nobody's really interested enough right now. But it happens often to others, and that's bloody disrespectful, mate.

       Quick Hits   Funny story about the practice of  urlLink attacking a candidate's home state .  "The Cat in the Hat" is apparently  urlLink the suck . Not that I was planning on seeing it anyhow.  Natalie Merchant is a  urlLink much better songwriter  than any current blonde pop star could ever hope to be.  That  urlLink kid from SeaQuest  and some other crap killed himself. Probably not because of SeaQuest being crappy, but still. Sad. I think I went to high school with a guy who had the same name.   And finally, a quick  urlLink Friday Five  just for the sake of hearing myself talk.   1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.  Successfully finish this semester of school; write my damn CPIL papers; um... okay so I don't have too many goals other than that.   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.  "Lost contact" is a broad term - I haven't heard from a couple people in a while, but I wouldn't say I've lost contact with them. But actually, some highschool friends like Chance, Mark, Rebecca, and Patty are mysteries right now. It'd be good to find out what they're up to. Oh and to make five, let's just say Kate too.    3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.  Just five? Let's see: speak Spanish, fly an airplane, play the drums, ski, rock climb, play craps, walk on my hands, throw my voice, cliff dive and practice law. That's just off the top of my head.   4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).  Give everyone I know a nice tidy sum of money. Pay off all my law school debt and the debt of most of my friends. Create a scholarship here at USD for academic underachievers, donate substantial sums to a wide variety of non-profit organizations (including my old group,  urlLink Fight Crime: Invest in Kids ), and buy a couple DVDs I haven't had the money to get just yet.    5. List five things you do that help you relax.  Sleep. Listen to music. Watch TV. Work out at the gym. Go to the beach (weather permitting).

      Next semester, I'm all lined up to take 14 credits of lawyerly-goodness. That is, of course, so long as I get the classes I requested and don't decide to give it all up and move to Tahiti to build schooners.   Along with Public Interest Law & Practice and Constitutional Law (two full-year courses), I'll be diving into Tax (yikes!), Legislation (an elective) and Employment Discrimination (because Employment Law isn't being offered until later). I find all of them interesting, and will call on various friends and family (Jenny and Mom, not the rest of you lunkheads) to explain portions of each to this feeble-minded law student.  Law Review work should simmer down a little next semester, because the full paper is due Jan. 5 (the main reason I have to come back to SD so early), although I assume the cite-checking continues. I'm pretty sure they're going to be sending me cite-checking assignments when I'm 72 and living in Del Boca Vista. Speaking of Law Review, I got my editor's comments back on my first draft, and it was surprisingly well-received. I'm not sure if he just didn't have time to read it closely or if it's actually that unoffensive to the sensibilities, but it's a weight off my shoulders. Now I just have to triple the size by January!   All in all, I'm feeling pretty positive right now. Good times!

      I forgot to mention that everyone should have a LOT more fun with  urlLink this bad boy  now that Governor S. is on the beat.   I promise this is the last Arnold-related post for a few days. But this one is more fun.   Saw Matrix Revolutions today. I was sort of unimpressed. Well, let me qualify that - it was full of action and fun stuff, but after it was all over, I left unfulfilled. There was closure, sure, but it didn't close well. I won't spoil it for anyone (Marek!) who hasn't seen it yet, but I think they could have explained slightly more.

      I was browsing our new Terminator's website, and I noticed this  urlLink little gem  of a page. You can apply to be appointed to the various governmental positions...  online .  You know, I don't mind the cashier at Best Buy getting a job via an Internet application, or even low-level functionaries such as DMV employees and the like, but I would really prefer that the Director of the Office of Emergency Services not get the job  because he happened to be surfing the web.   In all honesty, this may be the way the Davis administration operated as well, in which case boo on them, too. But since that website has been obliterated by the new guy's, I can't be sure. Either way, I find it disconcerting that any administration would seek candidates in this way. Are they too swamped to think of people on their own? Are they lazy? Or are they just indifferent about the importance of the jobs that need to be filled? I would like to see the bar for agency directors set a little higher than "is his browser IE-compatible?"  That's all for now. I'm going back to Comment research, reading for Con Law, and my application to be Director of the California State Lottery.

      Now that California is my adopted state (for the near future, anyways), I feel I am obligated to make a post about our (as of today)  urlLink new Governor. *  Arnold's first act was to recall the massive car tax increase, and while I commend him for sticking to his promises, the actual promise itself is completely asinine. For me, California's fiscal problem was put into light when I attended the Medical Board of California board meeting two weeks ago. Because of the massive fiscal crisis, there is a hiring freeze on all government positions (except those that are absolutely necessary) and there have even been layoffs. Government layoffs! The Medical Board escaped layoffs because they have a special fund, but they haven't escaped the hiring freeze or the position cuts (a few months ago, all vacant positions in the government were "deleted", i.e. they will never be filled because they no longer exist).  The Medical Board's "raison d'etre" is to protect the consumer. They do so by licensing doctors and by policing them. Now that their staff has been significantly cut, they are unable to follow up on any complaints save for the most grievous (like "My doctor shot me."). This means fraud, incompetence, and other such problems are going uninvestigated.  What does this have to do with Arnold? His first act was to further California's mounting debt by eliminating a perfectly useful tax increase. Tough times call for tough measures, and as is usual with Republicans, Arnold has stepped up and pandered to the most basic (and fiscally irresponsible) group - the "No Car Tax" crowd. I saw them sweep another Republican into the governor's mansion in Virginia a few years ago, and am saddened that "enlightened" Californians have done the same thing.  Yeah this is a bit of a rant (Arnold -> Medical Board -> Car Tax?) but it just pisses me off to witness the short-sightedness of voters. Please, cut my car tax! I don't need police, or fire protection, or any other essential government services if I can pay $100 less every year!  *I hate the San Diego Union-Tribune, so I tend to link to better (better meaning "readable") papers if possible.

       Can't live with 'em, can't bury 'em in the backyard.   It seems like many of the women in my life are experiencing some interesting phenomenon in their respective love lives. I'm not sure if it's the season for strife and fluctuation, or just a coincidence, but I'm leaning towards mere chancery simply because each person is having highly different experiences. The only common bond is that there is a guy involved in all of them (my lesbian friends are pretty content right now).  Needless to say I won't be getting into any specifics, but from my own perspective I find it odd that there are so many different kinds of guys out there, and they all seem to be matched with women who are a) smarter than they are and b) better equipped to deal with relationships. There are guys who are moving too fast, guys who are weaseling their way back in, guys who were never in to begin with and are delusional, and of course guys who are moving too slow.  It may be that my perspective (as friend and brother) is skewed, but it seems like most of these guys are barely able to figure out how to work these relationships correctly. Some are better at it than others, but in some ways it almost seems like they're matched up incorrectly. If I could just play God and rearrange the relationships so that neuroses matched, would that be better or worse? Is the guy who refuses to commit better suited with a girl who is the same way, or is that part of his appeal that would be lost on someone of the same mind? Similarly, is the guy who wants to settle down better suited to a girl looking for marriage, or is the mix of opposites what provides that oh-so-crucial spark?  They say one woman's stalker is another's prince charming, and right now that seems to be very true. But I think that analyzing these behaviors is a little bit like seeing shapes in the clouds; it's fun, but ultimately useless to do so. The bonds between women and men, in all relationships from the serious to the casual, go much deeper than can be studied with a macrosociological-type approach. But that forces us to deal with each relationship as it exists, and while not having any sort of manual or guidelines may be frustrating, it's probably the best way to live.  I'm pretty lucky to have so many female friends, I think, because it gives me the opportunity to reflect on my own behavior, past and present (though present is mercifully drama-free right now). Whether this "insider information" will ever prove beneficial while in the throes of a difficult relationship remains to be seen, but for now I'm pretty content to just listen, reflect, and offer to beat the bejesus out of anyone who hurts the people I care about.

      Well the Friday Five is lame this week, so no canned post today. I have dubbed this weekend my "last weekend of freedom" primarily because after this (and really, starting today) I'll be working straight through until... well probably until Jan. 12. But I'll take a few breaks during the Christmas holiday.  Last night I finally saw "Lost in Translation" which was absolutely awesome. I don't think I could have enjoyed it more, although I would hold of from recommending it to "everyone" because it really is a  film . If you're looking for escapism, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a funny (dry-funny, not comic-funny) and really interesting 2 hours, try Lost.

       Seasonal Schizophrenia   What I love about San Diego, and am sometimes mildly annoyed by, is how the seasons change on a daily basis. Yesterday it was raining, cool, and almost Winter-like. If you define Winter as "not hot as blazes". I was bundled up, eating a slice of apple pie, watching TV at 9:30pm and I noticed how very seasonal it all felt. Almost (but not quite) Christmasy.  Contrast that with today, as I sit at my computer in a gradually overheating apartment, the sun shining brightly in a deep blue sky, the sound of lawnmowers and hedgetrimmers at work outside. Hell, the ice cream man just went by!   So there we are. Winter, Summer, tomorrow will probably be Spring, and then by Monday we'll have landed nicely back into Winter again. Lousy (but endearing) Smarch weather!  In other news, I braved the DMV again today to fix my car's registration problem (it wasn't) and despite having to sit in the waiting area for approximately 3 and half months, the actual process itself was painless (unlike my previous trips wherein the DMV tried to extract my soul). Oh and just to provide closure, I did get all my laundry done Tuesday night, and yesterday afternoon I went to the gym (finally). I was on a good gym regimen until those damn fires, which messed everything up and backlogged my workload so much that I have been only twice since the county stopped burning. Yesterday while I was running, some chick came up and got on the treadmill next to me, and started running insanely fast for a person her size (shorter person = more steps per MPH = tired faster). I finally peeked to see that she was going 8.3 mph, and so I adjusted my own speed up to 9.0 and almost killed myself. Moral of the Story: don't try and keep up with crazy short girls who sprint on the treadmill.

      Last night I had two goals: do my laundry, and go to the gym.  Tonight I have two goals: do my laundry, and go to the gym.  Somebody was using my building's sole washing machine and dryer for about 5 hours last night, thwarting me from completing phase one of my master plan. Because of the scarcity of clean clothes (both to work out in, and to change into afterwards), phase two was similarly frustrated. Damn you all, denizens of apartment A!   Today in Constitutional Law, discussion was dominated by a few people arguing over the merits behind destruction of sacred Native American ceremonial grounds. It was a stupid discussion (nobody's in favor of it) that could have been avoided had the students involved remembered what law students are so quick to forget: there are Other Branches of Government. Not every problem needs to be solved by the judiciary! Congress, despite generally behaving like a swarm of recently escaped colobus monkeys, is actually quite adept at providing legal exemptions on land, people, and people who buy gargantuan SUV's. The trend in law school is to think completely within the "How can the Supreme Court fix this" box, instead of simply realizing that a bill from the legislature is likely to be more efficient and, to be honest, more legally sound than anything the Supremes could weave.  Completely Separate Topic:  urlLink Adam  should totally open a record store. If I were a rich lawyer already, I'd be a silent partner! Alas, I am in the red and will be until sometime around 2048.

       urlLink Elf  was quite the charming and amusing movie, I must say. It had alot of funny, and of course a nice "hooray for Christmas" message at the end. But neither the message nor the humor were overly bland or smarmy. 3.5 stars (out of a possible 4).  I'm trying to buy plane tickets for the holidays but it turns out plane tickets are really expensive if you want to go anywhere near where you live. I really detest flying into BWI, but it's almost $150 more to fly to National or Dulles. Son of a crap! Also, San Diego is a really expensive place to fly out of or in to - I was looking into getting one of those little commuter flights to LAX, and flying to DC from there, but the added cost is just too much. Damn you airlines! Maybe I'll just  drive  home for Christmas. That wouldn't suck or anything.

      How about a late  urlLink Friday Five  for ya'll?   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  I eat a number of things that my more health-conscious friends would gape in horror at. Processed cheese slices, hotdogs (though I buy the good kind), chewy chips ahoy, taco bell...   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese, though that's ever-so-slowly changing.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  I really don't see the attraction to Penelope Cruz. She looks like a wasp that took human form.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  Well that's tough to say, because most famous people are fairly attractive (unless you count politicians). It's the nature of fame, I suppose. I've always though Ani DiFranco was sort of hot, though objectively she might not be.    5. What popular trend baffles you?  All of them? The popularity of "anger rock" (though that seems to be slacking these days), the hyped-up sexuality of kids in junior high (stop having sex you creepy little bastards!), and of course the country's apparent shift to the political right.  Last night's "Trivial Pursuit Night" at Jaime's was very fun, although I must say there are far too many questions in the edition we used that have the answer of "Geri Halliwell" (3!). No winners this time, as the actual playing sort of disinitegrated around 10:30 or 11pm and we ended up just reading questions and randomly yelling out answers. Didn't stay terribly late, because I had to get up at 6:30 yesterday morning, and I was plum exhausted by midnight.   The Medical Board meetings are done until January, so that's nice. It was interesting to be back in the "wake up early, dress nice, work downtown for 10 hours" mode like a real person. I wasn't a huge fan, though, so I guess I'll have to find a job in law that doesn't make me get up at 7 a.m. I was also struck by how passionately misinformed some people seem to be; they don't understand that in dealing with something as influential and high-profile as the Medical Board, compromises must be reached. Yes, few people like the California Medical Association or the insurance companies, but like it or lump, it they have a great deal of influence and must be considered in decisions.  Time to go to the store! I hear Ralph's isn't picketed anymore (they're "the least horrible of the three" chains, so their picketers are all over at Vons) so I'm gonna go stock up on food.

       Just Like Back Home!   This morning I woke up slightly before my alarm went off, all cozy and comfy in my warm bed, and realized that although I was wrapped in a comforter, I wasn't sweating my ass off like normal. I rolled to an unused part of the bed and sure enough, it was like ice. It was 60 degrees in my apartment this morning! Now, I am aware that I have some sort of heating contraption disrupting the aesthetics of my apartment, and that perhaps I should engage it to keep my apartment from dipping into the 50's. But turning the heat on in San Diego? That just seems so wrong. My neighbor said that a Santa Ana (the hot wind) was coming back, but I'm not so sure that setting the entire region on fire again is really the best solution to the cold.  I realize that, depending on the situation and the individuals involved, I refer to as many as four different places as "home". That's a little bit odd, perhaps, but it usually fits. When I'm burned out from school and tired of breathing soot, the East Coast is home. When I'm back east and tired of freezing my nuts off, San Diego is home. Occasionally, Michigan or my old apartment in Alexandria is home. Well, not the latter anymore; that apartment no longer houses anyone I know, so I'll just cross that one off the list. FYI Raf - when I called to cancel the phone service, I told them to list your new number under "Glen Carrington".  Tomorrow and Friday I have to spend large portions of the day downtown for Medical Board of California meetings. It's part of our Public Interest Law work (which I'm sure I've mentioned) and I'm lucky enough to have meetings that take place in San Diego. Some of my less fortunate classmates have journeyed as far as Oakland. In any event, it will be highly boring and will give me little to blog about. Unless Cindy goes nuts and starts killing doctors, in which case you'll hear it here first!

       Heroes? Really?   I've long wondered exactly how much credit to give to those who serve in life-saving professions. It's a given that they save lives, and for that I'm sure we're all very grateful. However, are they all "heroes" just for doing what they're paid to do? If that's the case, then perhaps those that help people indirectly are all heroes, and those that help their family by working crap jobs are heroes, and so forth.  urlLink This article on Salon.com  has an interesting take on the now routine practice of calling any firefighter that fights a fire a Hero.  The same sentiment can be extended to those in the military, and perhaps to police persons and EMT's. Unless we reinstate the draft, everyone in the military is there because they chose to be there. So when they head overseas, and are (sadly) killed by hostile forces, I'm not going to jump to calling them heroes. Not that military folk can't be heroes; I would simply rather see that term reserved for truly heroic actions. Saving your entire platoon from enemy attack might make you a hero, just as rushing into a burning building to save a family might as well. But showing up for work? Not that heroic, in my book.  Perhaps "noble" is a better word for some who engage in these professions. This entire line of thought coincides nicely with my thoughts on those who are killed while serving in the military - that while it is sad when someone dies, it is certainly not sadder when they are killed in combat, and in fact maybe it's less sad. After all, you know what you're getting into when you join up to Serve Your Country; if a war breaks out, then your job is to go and, if necessary, die. It's not tragic, it's what they signed up to do.  Maybe this seems like a cynical viewpoint, but I would stress again that it doesn't mean I have any less respect for those who work in such risky areas. But we should reserve our greatest titles and deepest sorrows for occasions that truly deserve it.

       Weekend Football Recap   Well, some might say it was a mixed weekend for football, but not me. Let's add it up, shall we?  -Virginia Tech won big. -The Lions managed to smack Oakland around. -The Redskins lost to their hated rivals, the Cowboys.  Those are all plusses. On the minus side (maybe), Michigan beat MSU. That's only a minus if you're my dad, but it's a plus if you're my sister. Since Kate cares less, we'll put it in the minus column. Still, though, with VT and Detroit winning, but the Skins losing (as is God's plan - they're the Yankees of football as far as I'm concerned), I'd say everything worked out nicely.  On the Law Review front, I've managed to squeeze out 10+ pages of paper to turn in, though I am unsure as to the quality of the work. I guess that's what "rough drafts" are for, but the idea of turning in part of paper (the draft must be 10 pages - but not the first 10, or last 10, just 10 pages) makes the hackles on the back of my neck rise. Oh well, it's done now, and I have a little breathing room to work on, well, everything else I should be working on.

      Happy November!  Proof That God Hates Law Students: I have a rather large paper to finish writing, and there is a Simpsons marathon on FOX showing  every single  Treehouse of Horror (well, through XII).  I think I'm going to take the hint and work on my paper from home today. You know, to honor All Saints' Day.  As a public service, here are some of the better ToH quotes. "Your eyes will burst, and some horrible stuff, possibly your brains, will start coming out through your nose." "Hey man, we own you. Let's see some blood!" "Anyone from a species that has mastered intergalactic travel, raise your hand! Alright then." "Well if you wanted to make Serrak the Preparer cry, mission accomplished." "And our country isn't called 'America' anymore, it's... 'Bonerland'." "The kick is up, it's looking good... the ball is turning into a fat, bald guy!" "Bad corpse! Bad corpse! Stop scaring Smithers!" "We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt, which I call 'Frogurt'." "The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!" "Hey monkey, you want a peanut? I said ONE!" "To enter, send me your parents brains. Or write 'Parents Brains' on a 3x5 card, and send it to..." "'Dear Homer, I owe you one emergency donut, signed Homer.' Bastard! He's always one step ahead!" "Mr. Simpson, don't you worry. I watched Matlock in a bar last night - the sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it." "Me mule wouldn't walk in the mud, so I had to put 17 bullets in him." "Oh Lisa, you and your stories. 'Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells.' Now, lets go back to that building thingy where our beds and tv... is." "But don't be readin my mind between 4 and 5. That's Willy's time!" "Don't make us poke your eyes out, dad." "You've mastered a dead tongue! But can you handle a live one?" "I am Clin-Ton. As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me and obey my brutal commands! End communication."

      Currently Reading:  In a Sunburned Country  - Bill Bryson  Everything's Eventual  - Stephen King  People's History of the United States  - Howard Zinn  How to Be Good  - Nick Hornby  So what book, faithful reader, am I curling up with on this blustery Tuesday, you ask? Why, it's none other than  A Whole Crapload of News Articles and Reports About the California Medical Board ! And to my despair, most of what I have is nearly useless for the task of writing a report on the aforementioned Board!

      I finally got some not-crappy work done on my Comment this weekend (and today. okay mostly today) and I'm in good shape to dive into the not-at-all lovely world of Public Interest report writing. From what I hear it's an experience much like sitting down on hot needles, and although I've never done that I can imagine.  The weekend was fun, finally saw some folks I'd been meaning to see for a week now, but otherwise I sat around and pretended to work on papers while at the same time doing the Post crossword puzzle and reading  urlLink the Onion . Oh, and the football...  I thought it was supremely hilarious that the wretched Lions and the possibly-even-more-wretched Cardinals played the biggest spoilers of the weekend in NFL action. And as much as I love the Lions (I'm a masochist), I have to hand it to the Cardinals for not only beating a playoff-bound team, but  knocking them out of the playoffs  in the process. I've never liked the Vikings (Randy Moss is a prick and they're division rivals of the Lions) so watching them lose to the Cardinals of all people was pure bliss.  For their own part (if you haven't heard) the Lions smacked the 12-4 Rams around like they were a junior high intramural squad and won, 30-20, thus denying the Rams home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. That's not nearly as exciting as denying them the playoffs outright, but I still enjoyed it.  And I say "boo!" to all those who snidely point out that in winning games to finish a losing season, the Lions (and Chargers and Cardinals) are simply wrecking their position in the draft. Technically, yes they are, but a win to finish off the year is so much more important than the position in the draft, for morale reasons. My 2 cents and all.  Anyone interested in my opinion about Tech's spectacularly awful performance on the 26th can just read the comments below. I'm glad I'm a few years out of school or else I might have had a complete mental breakdown during the game.

      Well another Christmas Day is winding down, and it has been fun hanging out with the family all day. I beat my sister in a movie trivia game, watched an Eddie Izzard DVD, had a big turkey dinner (how Rockwellian!) and then watched most of Raiders of the Lost Ark (which I now own on DVD).   All in all a good Christmas. Tomorrow I will attempt to work a little more on my law review comment, though I have some other tasks to complete as well. I'll try not to sleep until 11am, that's for sure. The more I think about it, the more I detest having such work hanging over my head. Le Sigh.  Hope everyone else's holiday has been good! It's nice to reconnect to family and friends, though I am admittedly out-of-place here now. It's not about belonging, but I think I'm built to consider only one place "home" at a time, and when another place tries to take that title as well, things get fuzzy.  Back to "The Bourne Identity"!

      Been back a few days now, and I have this to report:  1) I don't like the cold 2) I do like Christmas with the family 3) Return of the King is long, but quite good.  I hope to get started on my Law Review revisions tomorrow, but we'll see if that really gels. I do have most of next week as well, and my procrastinating nature may win this particular fight. But I'll try, I swears it!  Not much else worth mentioning; I don't think anyone I know would have even felt that earthquake near San Luis Obispo today, so no worries there. The weather here today was still far colder than San Diego, but everyone here thought it was "warm". They're nuts, I tell ya!  Oh, and don't call  urlLink Kim  mean, or you risk severe ocular damage. Send all ideas concerning a meld of digital and brick-and-mortar commerce to  urlLink Adam  (I'm thinking!). And tell  urlLink Marek  that he's right about stupid check-writers and their ludditesque (not a word) aversion to a simple check card.

      Who knows how much I'll update while back east, but knowing my ability to become bored quickly, it will be often. Sometimes I forget that everyone has those, what are they called, "jobs" so I'll have plenty of long, cold days to fill.   With paper writing! But I'll squeeze in a blog update or two as well.  Happy Holidays!

       urlLink Note the caption  to the accompanying picture. Courtesy of the drug czar himself!  Everybody's crapping themselves over the Return of the King, which makes me more excited to see it even if it's  three and half freakin hours long.  I don't really care about movie lengths, but why haven't they reintroduced the idea of an Intermission? I'm sure there's somewhere in the middle that would allow a 5 or 10 minute break, and since the damn thing is already clocking in at 3+ hours, it wouldn't be that much of an inconvenience to theater owners.  Rather schizophrenic post today. I gots lots to do, packing for Virginia and cleaning the apartment and compiling the stuff I need for paper-writing over the break. I almost decided to rant about the idiocy of "Scarborough Country" (an O'Reilly-ish show on MSNBC) but it's too lame to convey via print. Regardless, I will say that when Bernard Goldberg is your "media commentator", you're not exactly straddling the line between balanced and fervently anti-liberal anymore. Maybe it's not supposed to be unbiased, but good lord is it poorly done. I also caught a bit of the master himself (O'Reilly) on FOX late last night, and if it's possible, he's gotten stupider than ever before. He attempted to argue with a priest about Jesus, and then with Madeleine Albright about foreign policy.   Dear Bill,  You're so far out of your league, watching your rebuttal is like watching a monkey throwing feces at the zoo. Please return to having brain-dead guests that you can threaten into submission.  Thanks,  Everybody.  PS. I find it sad that Albright even came on The Factor. Sad days for Maddy.

      Well my last final is tomorrow, and I'm moderately prepared. I tend to go through this process like Goldilocks went through the Bears' house. I found I was ultraprepared for the first test, and horribly unprepared for the second, but this test should be juuuuust right.  I worked out today, too, for the first time in a week. You'd think that having no classes would allow for more time to do things like go to the gym (after all, it gave me more time to play Diablo), but then you remember that going to the gym takes an Effort, whereas sitting at home does not. Also, on Thursday I twisted my ankle on Hilary's stairs so I used that as an excuse for a few days. It's better now.  This whole Saddam thing is still bothering me. Headlines like "Dean's Toast Now" are just stupid. First of all, the American people are very much what-have-you-done-for-me-latelies. While I'm sure we'll all remember that Saddam is in custody next November, the euphoria felt by slack-jawed yokels because of his capture will have faded by late January.  Second of all, Dean has a perfectly defensible (and smart) position: he didn't want to go to war in the first place! At least not without the UN's backing. He never said it was because the military wouldn't catch Saddam, or that Saddam belongs in power. Anyone who thinks that the anti-war types have been dealt a huge blow by this development is a complete moron. This is just a step, a step in an unjust military action that was started incorrectly (and possibly illegally) but must be seen to completion to avoid screwing the Iraqis like we did last time.

      So they found Senor Hussein, that's nice. Seems largely irrelevant to the United States' interests in combatting terrorism, but it's nice. He was, after all, a fairly evil man that should have been run out of town a long time ago. Me, I would have preferred he was run out by his own people (as all bad dictators should be), or at least the UN, but I suppose once we made the mistake of charging into Iraq, the least we could do was topple his regime. I guess it puts a little karma back in the U.S.'s possession; our previous international machinations (Iran Contra, Gulf War I, our outstanding work in Cambodia and Chile...) have certainly been bad moves, especially in hindsight.   I don't see this changing anything in the near future, though. Sure, Bush is likely to get a political bump out of this, but most people know that Saddam wasn't behind 9/11 and that Osama is still out there. Frankly, I'm not sure why catching Osama should lead to an increase in political clout, since any President who had to deal with the horrors of 9/11 would be hunting him like a dog. If he's caught while Bush is in charge, it's not really because Bush single-handedly tackled him to the ground. Similarly, if he's caught in 4 years and someone else is President, it won't necessarily be because of anything THEY did either.  On the other hand, perhaps a future President would change strategy - unfortunately for Bush, it's his prize to lose. Future leaders can say they increased pressure/men/resources to find Bin Laden (and thus did a better job than Bush), whereas if Bush finds him it will be (in my mind) the natural outcome of 9/11. He can't really say he's looking harder, because if he is then why did he just start now?  I've often wondered (and this will be a rant but hey, it's my blog so why not) what the best approach to international diplomacy is. The United States is quite powerful, so are we being negligent if we refuse to step in when other countries/leaders do bad things? Or are we being arrogant when we do step in? I'm of both minds, because sometimes it seems the practical thing to do is stop mass genocide when it occurs. Places like Rwanda, Somalia, and the Congo all witnessed hundreds of thousands of deaths (millions?) but we did little more than attempt to send aid and work with the UN. We stepped in to fight Saddam, but he was brutal on a smaller scale. Why haven't we sent massive forces to Africa? I'm not so cynical as to think it's entirely about oil, because that's far too simplistic an answer to a conundrum that has spanned multiple presidencies and worldviews.   Maybe stopping mass murder is what the UN is for, but unfortunately the UN is toothless without America's support. And if we give our support to one operation over another, isn't that just a way of masking our own actions under a cloak of UN authority? Perhaps this is why foreign affairs is such a contentious issue - there are so many nuances that it makes finding an "exact" solution difficult at best.  Still, there's something to be said for sovereignty. We wouldn't want Iraq coming in here and deposing our President, no matter how much some of us might despise him. We may be in a better position to control our destiny than the people of Iraq, but isn't that still fundamentally their choice? Isn't the United States a better world leader if we set examples of how democracy can work, rather than bomb the hell out of those who have yet to work it out?  That is all for now. Oh yeah, 3 finals down, 1 to go. Then I'm outta here!

      Weighing in on recent Iraqi developments, I think that  urlLink our latest stab at foreign affairs  has proven to be about as successful as, well, every attempt at diplomacy undertaken by the current administration.   Is it just me, or is it wrong that only those who participated in the destruction of Iraq be allowed to rebuild it? Maybe I'm missing the nuances of the plan, but if there's bidding to be done on parts of reconstruction, shouldn't we consider opening it to, say, all who are qualified, and not just U.S. cronies?   This is hardly shocking, given our recent history of snubbing every possibly ally we've ever had, but it's still depressing to read about. Watching Bush say "friendly coalition folks risked their lives, therefore contracting is going to reflect that" casts the entire conflict in the shady light of commercial opportunism. No surprise at all, but it still stings to see it on parade, especially since the ignorant public tends to endorse Bush's snide attempts at retribution. "I hates me some of them French guys too! Stick it to 'em, Dubya!"  Did you know that "bookkeeping" is the only word in the English language with 3 sets of double letters? It's true  and  fun!

      One final down, three to go! That's the good news. The bad news is, the one I'm done with was worth zilch (or zilch + 5%) and the rest are difficult. The good news is, I spent most of the day studying with Hilary and Jaime and I'm feeling pretty good about Constitutional Law tomorrow. I also managed to score some presents for family online. Two people down, four to go.  Short, boring update today, because I'm exhausted. Victory is mine!

      The problem with political ideologies is that they tend to skew heavily in one direction or another. Something is "completely wrong" or "absolutely right", and anyone who disagrees is evil. This trend used to be more obvious among conservatives, who are big fans of Good vs. Evil, but I see it more and more on the left these days, as well.  I have yet to decide whether that's terribly wrong (I'm leaning towards "It is.") but I believe the cause behind this polarization is the current militarized state of the world. The last time we had a huge global conflict, it was fairly clear to most people even during the conflict that there was a good and an evil. Nazi Germany was taking over most of Europe, there were reports of death camps, and the Allies were trying to stop them. Looking back over 50 years, it seems easy to make the distinction, so perhaps I'm assuming more clarity than actually existed. But nowadays, we have no such clarity beyond "killing people is wrong". But the terrorists in or from the middle east - they have some fairly significant grievances against the United States and her allies. Of course I'm not saying it excuses anything, but the entire situation (Israel and Palestine, for example) is very murky and difficult to slog through. You can't just label someone "the bad guy" and have it stick. There is no Hitler, no Mussolini, no Axis.   The end result is that people want to feel emotionally charged in "the war on terror". But you can't become emotionally charged when you're not sure exactly who your friends and enemies are, or what your goal is, so you make those things up. And then, in the spirit of artificial line-drawing, you demonize those who oppose you. Anti-war protestors thus become cowards and traitors, and war supporters become war-mongers and terrorists.   My point? The black and white days of WW2 are over. It's nice to reminisce about an "easier time" when the bad guys wore swastikas and did monstrous things, but we must leave that in the past. Trying to shoehorn the current state of the world into a model created 50 years ago is like trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole.   Oh, and for the record I'm against the war but now that we're in Iraq, I think we need to stay a long, long time. I don't have any idea about what should be done in Israel, nor do I know whether globalization is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. I believe in room for argument and for disagreement, but maybe tolerance is exactly what some people would like to see less of.

      I find Christmas shopping to be difficult but fulfilling when I manage to find the right thing for the right person. Unfortunately, that "perfect gift" is all too often elusive, and I end up getting some less creative gift like a CD or DVD or something. Not that there's anything wrong with that - but I've always liked the idea of getting something meaningful, not just checking off one item on a list.  But this year (like last year) my gift-giving time period coincides almost perfectly with Finals, and I end up spending much less time thinking about gifts. In the long run, I guess that's important, but I hate doing a half-assed job when it comes to gifts for friends and family.  That's all for now. Today I managed to get my sister a couple things, but I'm starting to think I'll have to wander aimlessly through a mall when I get home to get things for everyone else. Malls at Christmas... I shudder at the thought.

      Or, Zone Coverage is an Ineffective Defensive Strategy  The Lions lost to the Chargers today, and while the score reflects a mediocre but fairly close game ( urlLink 14-7 ) the real story is far different. The Lions, in a word (or five), are the Worst Football Team in America. They lack so many different elements essential to even a functional football team that it's beyond sad. Rather than go into their functional shortcomings (defensive secondary, wide receivers, running backs, quarterback, special teams except kicking...), I'm going to address another, deeper problem.   Heart . It's a very overused cliche to say that one team "came to win" and another team didn't, but in watching two back-to-back games (one win, one loss) I can tell you that despite their lack of any big-name talent, the Lions are capable of pulling a win out, or at least fighting a tough game. But the difference in their level of play on Thanksgiving (in front of a nationally televised audience) and today (in front of San Diego and Detroit audiences) is huge. The Lions are so mired in their own crap that they don't seem to even try anymore. The play calling is horrible, the players themselves don't do their jobs (I've never SEEN so many missed tackles and dropped passes), it's like watching a bunch of guys who were forced to play in the park on a Sunday afternoon.   The problem is, these guys are  professional football players!  They get PAID to play a GAME, and they do it with such a piss-poor attitude, you'd think they were digging ditches on a chain-gang in Alabama.  Also I'd really like to see them get a break, like the Chargers got with Tomlinson. He's exceptional, and despite being surrounded by a mediocre team, at least he's a bright spot for the Chargers' future. The Lions have no bright spot - Joey Harrington has the markings of a good, solid QB but he will need a much better receiver core (and a running back with some talent) to get there. If Az-Zahir Hakeem drops one more perfectly thrown pass I swear to God Almighty I will drive to Detroit and burn his house down. The defensive line is the one bright area, but an offensive line does not a winning team make.   Okay, rant mode off. This is why I don't watch football involving teams I care about. I get too worked up. I was much angrier earlier, but blogger was (maybe fortunately) down and I couldn't update.

      It's a wee bit cold in here, if I do say so myself. Of course, it's not snowing like it is on some coasts, but we can't all be wrapped in bitter cold for 3 or 4 months of the year.   Classes are done; my first final is in 5 days and my first important final is in 6 days. What does that mean for you, the average blog-reading citizen? It means I should be updating my blog less and studying more, but in reality I will probably update much more frequently because I'll be procrastinating heavily.   I will also jump headfirst into the online shopping community for Christmas presents this weekend, since buying things in malls is both annoying and impractical considering my locale. Yesterday I was in Fashion Valley for lunch, and that was just about more mall than I can stand for the week.   Uma Thurman looks very, very tall on TV. Turns out she's like, 6' or some crazy tall height (for a woman). Now that Gwyneth is eating for two, I need a new leggy blonde to fill Ms. Paltrow's roster spot in my mental list of hot women I'll never sleep with. Sure, her bun in the oven doesn't necessarily hamper our imaginary love affair, but I would feel bad for going behind Chris Martin's back like that. Call it "fantasy ethics".

      I've only got one class left this week (that pesky Friday morning Con Law) but for all intents and purposes, my class-attending semester is over. A recap, for those keeping score:  Number of times I missed class: 2 Number of times it had something to do with wearing a tie: 1 Number of times I was just in a bad mood: 1 Classes where someone mispronounced "brouhaha": 1 Games of Spider Solitaire played in Intro to IP: 45 (give or take) Games of Text Twist: 2 (one is still going!) Classes with former "study group" friends: 2 Classes in which I talked to no one the entire semester: 1 Number of times I fell asleep in class: 1 Number of times I woke up discreetly and didn't embarass myself: 0 Finals to take: 4 Finals that count for more than 5% of my grade: 3 Papers to write by 1/5/04: 3 How much I dislike having to write papers over my break (scale from 1-10): 864  So there you have it! A successful semester, if I do say so myself. Of course, I have yet to be graded in anything, but that's really a formality in the second year. I've already established my strong academic mediocrity and nothign I do from now until the graduation will put much of a dent in that, one way or another. Like Cindy says, at this point it's all about passing the Bar. ("But you've never passed a bar in your life!")  There was a mini coup attempt in Comm. Law the other day, as most of the class suddenly decided that a take-home final would be much better. Normally this would have no effect on a professor, except that in this case our professor conceded that it wasn't a bad idea (and it's not). However, finals are very strictly regulated around here (anonymous grading, schedule conflicts, honor code stuff) so trying to change the layout or administration of a test, especially after the last class has already been held, is nigh impossible. And while I wouldn't have minded a take-home final, it really does seem a tad unfair to any students who missed that last class or liked the idea of a Saturday exam (Maybe it fits their schedule best that way! Who am I to say otherwise?). The end result is, most people in class were a bit annoyed that it wasn't going to work that way, but I was a bit annoyed that they had the presumption to be annoyed. If this had been a valid concern, they could have said something weeks ago when the exam schedule was first announced. To whine now is sour grapes.  My 2 cents. Welcome to flavor country!

      Interesting story about  urlLink dating preferences  courtesy of data compiled by Match.com.  Question 1: does it matter that this is only based on people that use the Internet for dating possibilities? Not that I disparage such things at all, but I wonder if that should be taken into account.  Also, I'd like to note that apparently San Diego's new motto should be "No Fat Chicks". I might have guessed that on my own, though. We are a fit and shallow group out here (and by "we" I mean "they").

      It's 12:45 in the a.m. and this is Perspectives. I'm your host Lionel Osbourne.  I can't seem to sleep this evening, but I'm not sure why. Nothing on my mind besides the usual (school), but I did work out so perhaps it's leftover endorphins or something. Most days that I work out at night (8-9pm) I end up staying up late, despite the initial exhaustion. Also HBO was having a mini-marathon of Band of Brothers, a fine miniseries that I've never seen (aside from a random episode or two).   This is the last week of classes, next week there are 2 days of study period and finals start on Wednesday. My first final is Thursday, and then I have one Friday and Saturday and the following Tuesday. That 1-2-3 punch is gonna send me sprawling to the canvas, but I should be able to get back up before the last one.   Let's not forget the 3 papers I have to write before January. Also I'm teaching a class on maritime tax laws next semester and I've got to prepare a syllabus.  Okay that last thing is a lie, but the rest is true. Fear me and my insomnia!

      Yet another example of why copyright law is  urlLink far to protective . First of all, the NFL chooses to use broadcast television (not cable) and broadcast signals are the  public domain . Granted this doesn't change the fact that their broadcast is intellectual property (although that's a stretch, too - it's only because there's a grain of creativity in an NFL televised game).  It  should  be the case that anything broadcast over the air is loses its public performance right, period (one of the rights guaranteed by copyright is the right to publicly perform -- and to restrict others from performing -- your works). It's not like pay-per-view boxing, or pay-per-view concerts. The people who want to go to Superbowl parties  can see the game anywhere.  Clearly, the admission fees for those parties are for the atmosphere, the food, and the other accomodations, not the game itself. So Fuck You, NFL.  And goddamnit, why can't we get some sensible copyright legislation in this country so that these insane corporate monsters (I'm looking at you too, RIAA) will stop harassing every single consumer in existence!

      So much of life is timing. If not for timing, many of our most significant events might not have occurred, or would have occurred differently. Many jobs are won or lost through the mere timing of it all, which can be frustrating to people. On the upside, when timing prevents something from happening, you don't know that for sure - but when timing is on your side, it can be easy to see and give it all the credit.  My point? I'm not sure I have one, except to say it's been coming up in a variety of ways the last few weeks, and it's just something to think about. Most people, I think, talk about timing in those two big areas - employment and relationships. As noted above, it can be hard to see when you miss out on a job because of bad timing. But often times, relationships are just the opposite. Whether you characterize it as "bad" or "good" timing is sort of subjective (because "bad timing" could have put you in  or  out of a relationship, but you'd only say that if you weren't happy about it or the eventual outcome), but you can spend a lot of time pondering the subject. More than most probably should.  Because timing, you see, is irrelevent. We only get one pass at life - at any given situation, any given year - so discussion of missed opportunities or "bad timing" is almost useless beyond simple nostalgia. It's not "timing" -  it's what happened . This is also why I don't believe in fate, by the way. Timing and fate imply that things could have gone another way, and while obviously it could  have gone another way, it didn't. Nothing goes two ways because life is linear, and the next opportunity, no matter how similar is never the same.  This is not meant to be depressing, because even though fate and timing are bogus, if there's a connection, or a reason for two people to know each other, then even if you miss out on the first opportunity (or feel like you did), a true bond or connection will give you alternate "bites at the apple." It may not result in the same type of relationship (friends instead of more-than-friends, for instance), but the phrase "meant to be" can mean many, many things.  The end result, in my opinion, is that you really must seize every opportunity to the utmost of your ability, because there are no second chances. There are other chances, but if you miss the first boat, the second one will always be different. The "seize opportunity" idea doesn't always have to mean action, however. An interesting thing about hindsight is that it's not always "I should have acted!" but rather in some instances "thank God I didn't do X." And that's exactly why timing and fate are crap: for every "missed opportunity" or instance of "bad timing," something good will happen that, with the introduction of hindsight into the mix, means all "bad timing" was oops, good timing! Because if what you had wanted to work out had actually worked out, this "good event" wouldn't have occurred.  But nobody can see those things coming, so in the end all you can do is live, and stop worrying about what should or shouldn't have happened.  ps. Sacramento is a pretty nasty city. Boring and cold!

      I'm bored and I don't like posting too much in one day, so I'm quietly posting this Back-to-the-Future style. It's the  urlLink Friday Five !   You have just won one million dollars:   1. Who do you call first?  My mom. I know, it could be any of you who read this, but... it'd be my mom.    2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  Tuition for next year. Unless it's dinner time, then I'd buy Wendy's.    3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  Man what wouldn't I buy for someone else? If it's only a million, my plan to pay off everyone's student loans wouldn't quite work (after taxes, the $130,000x4 would be a wee bit pricey). But cars and plasma TV's for all!   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?  Of course! My  urlLink former employer  would get a chunk. And then various charities and what have you. Also to friends and family, but see #3 for that one.   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?  What am I a moron? Of course you invest, you invest it all man. Especially if it's just $1 mil, which isn't nearly enough to live on forever. What I'd invest in is a separate question, though. I know little about such things. I hear there's a market, where you can buy stock(s), maybe I'd look that place up.

      I'm off to Sacramento early tomorrow (though not as early as previously thought) so probably no bloggage for a couple days while I'm immersed in the always-thrilling world of The California Medical Board. Who knows, if there's Internet access and I'm bored, maybe I'll toss one off, but I wouldn't hold your breath. Either of you.  On a completely unrelated note, tonight's  urlLink Angel  was pretty cool in that it featured some nice Buffy nostalgia (Andrew, slayers, etc.). But I take issue with the way it ended, it seems very out of character for the Scooby Gang to just declare Angel & Co. as "on the other side now." If they had problems with the way Angel was working, it seems they would have reached out, not simply passed judgment from afar. Granted, it's a TV show, but it bothered me. That is all.

      I just had a huge rant about the  urlLink Oscar nominations , and Blogger wiped the whole goddamn thing out. That just pisses me off. I'm not going to write it all over again, suffice to say it was a very witty and intelligent look at the nominations, who got left out (Scarlett Johannson and Sean Astin), and why the entire Oscar ceremony is sort of a sham (the collaborative nature of film, blah blah blah, honoring one person is a disservice and an inaccurate gauge of creative talent, etc etc). Also something about Johnny Depp being entertaining but not really "Best Actor" material for Pirates of the Caribbean. I forget why now, but that seems to make sense.  It was like three or four paragraphs, and I thought it was pretty interesting. Really. I see  urlLink people  complain about losing posts but it never happened to me before (outside of using BlogThis, which sometimes would hang because Java is a piece of shite).  This time, I'm copying the whole damn thing first...  ps. oh yeah, Bill Murray better win or I'll eat my legs in protest.

      I finally figured out what song that is in that cool OfficeMax commercial that's on these days. You know the one - the guy with the big afro is handing out necessary supplies to his office, to the tune of (wait for it...) " urlLink Rubberband Man " by the Spinners. It's a cool song and a well-made commercial. Maybe I'll go to OfficeMax more often.   Nah. Why would I do that?  Going to Sacramento on Thursday for a  urlLink Med Board  meeting. That will be... fun. If by fun I mean "mind-numbing," which I do. But perhaps the time away from the computer and cable will give me the chance to work on my Comment more productively. The free hotel room is... nice but I've traveled enough at this point that it's not as exciting as it might once have been.  I've noticed that I get a lot (well, a handful every day) of hits from people searching for "reversed and remanded". Thus it occurs to me that perhaps I should explain what that means, if it isn't obvious. It's a term that appellate courts use when they make a decision, reversing the previous court and remanding (sending it back) to that court for rehearing according to the new rules. Because sometimes when the Supreme Court (or any appellate court) rules, it doesn't just put the case to rest - more must be done, under the constraints now imposed by the new decision. So the lower courts receive the "reversed and remanded" cases and deal with them as necessary. Of course there's also results like "affirmed" or "remanded for further fact-finding" but those aren't the titles of this blog, so I'm not explaining those. Suckers!

      I don't have anything against sorority girls, in theory. I'm related to one, I've dated them, and in general the stereotypes fail upon any individual inspection. But where the stereotypes find most of their power is when they group together, as they are doing today at USD (possibly for some kind of conference, I'm not sure).  At first, as a red-blooded American male, I thought to myself "Alriiiight, it's a flesh fair." But that wore off about 45 seconds later when I saw literally dozens of stupid little Jettas, BMW's and SUV's decorated with soap ("We love our THETAS!" or some such nonsense) and parked as if they had been driven onto campus by students from the School for the Deaf and the Blind. One girl actually parked  perpendicularly across three spots.  I swear to God I almost bashed her windows in.   How absolutely narcissistic and hyped up on your own sense of self-importance must you be to park across THREE spots? Nevermind that the lot isn't filled to the brim, it was still quite full (plenty of other sorostitutes and law students). Perhaps I'm a parking nazi, but someday I hope to own a parking lot (reaching for the sky on that dream) in which I will tow the hell out of anybody who does not park like an absolute saint. Sorry SUV owners and big F150 drivers, this means you and your bloated, I-swear-someday-I'll-haul-something vehicles will be outta there.  This isn't really a rant against sorority girls per se, but rather a rant about bad drivers. But damn if they don't make it really easy to connect the dots. USD's undergrads are already a good deal more vacuous than most undergrad populations, so perhaps that's a factor as well.

      Because otherwise I'd be reading about Campaign Finance Reform.   At this moment, what is your favorite...   1. Song? "Miss Misery", Elliot Smith. RIP and whatnot. Also digging most of Coldplay's Rush of Blood to the Head CD, even though I'm so behind the times it's frightening.  2. Food? Grapes!  3. TV show? Angel, Wednesdays on the WB.  urlLink Scrubs  keeps getting preempted for asinine crap like that new Trump show, or extra-long installments of the  urlLink Gay is Funny  show.  4. Scent? Something a friend was wearing the other day - I think she said it was the J-Lo perfume, but despite that it was quite pleasing.  5. Quote? "Those without swords may still die upon them." From a  urlLink certain movie  that I watched last night. That entire exchange, between Aragorn and Eowyn, was full of good lines.

      Day 2 of my 4-Day Weekend. Last night I watched the Extended Remixed Uncut Supersized Ultra Version of "The Two Towers", and man is that bad boy good. I find myself usually in agreement with the editing body (whether it be studio or director) when watching most "Director's Cuts" and especially when viewing deleted footage, as most movies are better having lost those parts.  But Two Towers' extra scenes are more of a mixed bag. I found them all interesting, and their inclusion has the paradoxical effect of making the movie more faithful to the book, but less coherent as a film. So while they were all good, I found most of the end scenes (Pippin and Merry finding the food stores, especially) redundant and unnecessary. That being said, most of the extra Ent scenes were worthwhile, as were the minor Gimli-related scenes that had been added. I look forward to the Return of the King Uberversion, which by my estimate will be 3 and 1/2 weeks long and require a doctor's permission to watch in one sitting.    Note to self : stop watching these things late at night. I started Two Towers at 10pm and man if that bastard didn't stretch on until nearly 2am. Good times!

      Well, not really, but my ConLaw professor, in his infinite wisdom, cancelled our Friday class. This might not be significant to some, but it's the only class I have on Thursday/Friday.  Hence the above title.  Some might say that having a day off at both ends of the workweek is inappropriate and that I am undeserving. To those people, I say:  you  sit through 2.5 hours of Employment Discrimination and then tell me I don't deserve a break.  Yikes.  For now, it's bedtime. Despite my "day off" tomorrow, I'll still be heading to campus for some good ol' fashioned library work.

      No, I'm not really going to write a post about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That would just be silly! But it IS at the top of the page I've been staring at for 15 minutes, trying to read but failing miserably. I have turned in my two CPIL papers  and  my cite-checking assignment for this week (which, to be honest, was a cakewalk because most of the cites were uncheckable) and now I've forced myself into librarianaic seclusion to read all (ALL) my assignments for the tomorrow.   And by God I will read them!   After I finish this blog. And an email or two. And reading about the primary last night. And reading about what horrendous new ideas our commander-in-chief plans to reveal tonight.  Speaking of primaries (and because this blog has been hugely uninformed as of late), I have yet to decide who I think is the best Democratic candidate. Full disclosure: yes, I am a hardcore liberal. That being said, Hardcore Liberals don't win elections in this country, just as (I would hope) Right-Wing Nazis don't either. Dean is probably the closest thing (from the little I've read) to a liberal the Democrats have got, and I'm beginning to think he's on the downward slope of his campaign.  I must admit I've been taken aback by the popularity of Clark, who when he announced his candidacy, made me outright laugh. "Who is this guy?" I thought, "and why does he think Democrats would vote for a military man?" Well, spank my ass and call me Nancy, because damned if he isn't looking quite strong right now. The more I read, the more I like him, and not just because his background gives him a huge advantage in a campaign against Mein Prasident.   But, the primaries may tell a different story. Dean seems to be losing it, Kerry and Edwards are too boring, and I still don't trust the political leanings of Clark. Don't even get me started on Kucinich - I won't vote for someone who needs a booster seat to sit behind the big desk.  Back to Employment Discrimination!

      Wow, four days and no posts! You'd think I was off at a convention or having a whirlwind romance or comatose or something.  But in fact, I have simply been working my posterior off to finish two papers and a cite-checking assignment by Tuesday.  Well, and going to bar review on Friday. (Verdict: not too shabby)  And watching "Phone Booth" last night. (Verdict: better than I thought it would be)  Hmm, perhaps I am not as diligent as I supposed. But today, today I am all about finishing my work. The fates have made it interesting by closing the library (for MLK Day) and by shutting off email (for MLK Da... wait that makes no sense), but I will perservere and conquer these damn papers once and for all.   Consider yourselves notified!

      I've been highly enjoying classical music lately, especially selected works from famous operas. I don't know much about classical music, especially opera, but it really seems like it'd be worth seeing. San Diego is lucky enough to have  urlLink semi-regular shows  (they have seasons?) and at the end of the month, they're performing  urlLink Turandot .  Of course, I can't go see anything because it's a) way to expensive for me, and b) I don't think anybody within 250 miles would be even remotely interested in going with me. Opera seems fascinating to me, but I can easily see how not everyone would be similarly curious. But if I'm wrong, and somebody who reads this has $200+ to blow on Puccini, hey let me know!  In other news (I say that alot in this thing, maybe I should find a new cliched phrase...) I got a big cash windfall today in the form of my old "retirement" fund. I was supposed to "cash out" when I stopped working there (which was, let's see... 19 months ago) but it seems the financial company finally got tired of waiting for me to do that and just cashed out for me. They took out something like 30%, but it still worked out to be a nice surprise. No more Ramen for me! For now!  Before anybody points it out, complaining about being too poor for opera and then cheering about found funding  is  ironic., but unavoidable. I'm a human paradox!

      Everyone else seems to think this is hilarious, and now that I've stumbled upon a  urlLink picture of my gym  I figured I'd share it with you all and solicit commentary. Yes, escalators to a gym seem weird, but it's not the only "shop" on the second level. Yeesh. And let me tell you, that escalator is pretty sweet after you run 3 miles on the treadmill.   So is it really that funny? If so, I concede that I just don't get it. But I'm fairly certain it's not  hilarious.

      Warning: legal post ahead. Caution to all who are prone to drowsiness; Invitation to all who are prone to insomnia.   urlLink Brown v. Board of Education  Today in Con(stitutional) Law, we discussed Brown, which as most everybody (inside and outside of law school) knows is the landmark case that desegregated schools and, as a domino effect, the rest of the country as well. Eventually. We learned about Brown in highschool, if I recall, and again in college (if you had any sort of U.S. History or sociological class), but my Con Law professor pointed out quite astutely (he's very smart) that perhaps Brown is not the best opinion ever.  For reasons known only to lawyers, Brown is widely seen as a key, but Constitutionally unfaithful, decision in the civil rights movement. There is no constitutional basis for declaring "separate but equal" illegal, at least on the surface. You must dig deep into the theoretical interpretation realm, using "originalism" and "Framer principles", to find any basis for the decision. Of course, everyone thinks (and they're right) that Brown is correct in outcome - it's just ironic that such a bastion of historical jurisprudence is so weakly constructed.  While we're on the topic, it was noted in class that the social theory many people associate with desegregation - that segregation is wrong because it creates ideas of inferiority among those who are segregated out - is a rather morally bankrupt idea itself. It is often cited as the major reason that segregation is wrong (at least, the major concrete reason - everyone knows it's wrong on a higher, more ethically-grounded but logically barren level of thought) but such a proposition suggests that those who are segregated out are also more emotionally and mentally fragile than those who do the segregating. This is a position that is both insulting and demeaning to African-Americans, and while ideas of inferiority may have been created in individual circumstances, to imply that an entire group would consider themselves lesser is just as racist an idea as "separate but equal".   Assuming, as many did before Brown, that we can create "separate but equal" schools that truly are equal, what then is the driving force behind desegregation if we recognize that the inferiority reason is untenable? I would offer that rather than using desegregation as a way to help African-Americans, it is a way to "deracist" white America. That rather than balancing our moral obligation to desegregation on the idea that African-Americans would feel inferior, desegregation should instead be viewed as removing a not-so-subtle framework of white superiority from society, thus undermining the racist reinforcement that institutionalized superiority has on those who see and live in it. This is not, as it might first seem, a way to cast all whites as white-supremacists, but rather a recognition that ideas such as white superiority are harder to fight when they are reinforced by racist public policies like "separate but equal". Removing the system (as we did) thus allows for a more level playing field as we fight to educate and enlighten some of our more ignorant citizenry.

      With apologies to Alice Cooper.  I am one class into the Spring semester and not feeling much smarter for it. Perhaps that's because it was Tax, which makes me want to cry, but the professor is nice and I don't think it will be as bad as those who came before me report. Even if it's monstrously full and at 9 in the morning. Today's traffic was wretched, causing tardiness of a sort (technically not, it wasn't 9 and he started 2 minutes early) but it's really my fault for not having left soon enough.  Despite my delayed start, I'm back in the library (hooray! said Sarcasm) but to my quiet surprise (everything in here is quiet) I find they've installed wireless internet throughout. A truly excellent move that frankly should have been done last year. The end result is, I can surf anywhere near an outlet, whereas the rest of the law student peons will be forced to use the carrels that have wired access. Fear my freedom!  On a more introspective note, the obvious excitement that exudes from the previous paragraph concerns me a bit.  I've decided that none (of the four I took, to be honest) of my Vegas pictures would be very interesting for anyone outside of those who suffered my presence in Nevada, so no posting on the blog. Not much else to report, other than as of right now I'm $5,347 richer (minus $244 for 3 books) and no longer on the hook for jury duty until June 7. Excelsior!

      It may be January 7th, but that's never too late for a year-end wrap-up, right?  BOOKS Everybody knows all I have time to read these days are textbooks, but I did manage to work through a few non-school texts, and there are a couple that stood out.  In a Sunburned Country  - Never have I read a travel book so entertaining and so effective at driving me to go somewhere. Bill Bryson discusses Australia from a ground's eye perspective, without lists and pricing guides, and the end result is a desire to travel to a country that, until a few months ago, I hadn't thought much about.  Copyrights and Copywrongs  - Despite what it looks like, this was not a book I read for class. It is, however, a really interesting look at the history and people behind the formation of Copyright law in this country.  Unfortunately, those may be the only two (good) books I've finished this year - as noted earlier, I'm trying to work my way through a couple more, but I don't give a thumb's up or down until I've devoured the entire thing, cover-to-cover.  MOVIES I saw many movies this year (like most years) thanks to the glorious service that is  urlLink Netflix . I won't go into why each one was good (I don't have the time) but if you haven't, check out:  Big Fish  (though technically I saw it last Saturday, it's a "2003" movie)  Kill Bill Vol. 1   Lord of the Rings: Return of the King   Lost in Translation  (probably my favorite film this year)  Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World   Pirates of the Caribbean   X2: X-Men United  (yes it's a comic book movie, but I'll be damned if it wasn't quite entertaining)  More later when I can remember what came out in the earlier part of the year. I have such a bad memory for things like this... You'll notice that some of my choices are popcorn flics; unlike some who consider themselves fans of movies, I can appreciate "fun" movies as much as thinkers. And while I might like thinkers better overall, a movie's entertainment value is not necessarily inversely proportional to its quality. Onwards!  GAMES A series of poor financial decisions this year (i.e. deciding to stay in law school) have left me with the means to play fewer games than I would have liked. Still, some stood out as excellent:  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City  - graphic violence warnings aside, GTA:VC did nothing but improve upon it's predecessor (GTA3) in every area except graphics (which were already quite good).   Age of Mythology  - it can be difficult to do real-time strategy well; for every good (Starcraft, the Age series) there are many bad (the newer Command & Conquers, any Star Wars-based RTS, and others). This is one of the good, and thanks to Jason I'm now playing the Titans Expansion, which reminds me just how good the original was.  Knights of the Old Republic  - I just got this for Christmas, but so far I've played almost 20 hours and am getting the impression that I have many, many hours to go. That's so refreshing in these days of 6-hour games (Medal of Honor series, I'm looking in your direction...)  SimCity 4  - as always, a marked improvement over the previous incarnation (which itself was excellent). Now that I think about it, I was supposed to send this to Adam. You still want it Adam?   Text Twist  - the only thing that got me through Intro to IP this year.  THE BAD Disappointments? Sure, we've all got some. The  Matrix  movies were a let-down, in my opinion, because they added nothing new to the series and by the time they came out this year, the special effects were old hat. As briefly noted above, the  Medal of Honor  expansion packs (Spearhead and, so far, Breakthrough) have been too short and way to hard on my system. Much more engrossing and graphicly-rich games run far better, and it just pisses me off to see such poor quality in such a great series. Fortunately, I think I've dodge most of the other bombs of 2003. Or perhaps I've simply blocked them from my mind.   On a completely separate note:  urlLink Gibbs ? Really? Can he really still have the stuff after 11 years in NASCAR or whatever he was doing?

      Pictures from over the holiday break, anyone?

      Ah, the library. I've been hear about 5 hours now, and methinks it's time to go. They're only open until 8pm anyhow, and lord knows I don't have nearly enough staying power for that. My paper is in... some sort of shape, it's up to 25 pages and I have yet to write an introduction, conclusion, and the last few minor sections of actual content. Footnote-wise, I'm in worse shape, because I seem to have stalled at 100 footnotes (I need 150). Time to go insert "Id." everywhere!   I've never actually seen this place so empty, as I count there are 9 cars in the entire parking lot. Oops, make that 8.   Oh and for anyone who was wondering, I rented a car and drove home just fine yesterday. My bags were indeed at San Diego Airport, my car and apartment were in the same state as whence I left (appallingly dirty but otherwise unharmed), and the weather is just fine. Although I will note for your amusement that the high in Washington today was above the high in San Diego (last I heard). Enjoy it while you can, east coast!

      Okay  somebody  out there didn't wish me good flying and on-time arrivals. How do I know this? Because it is 12:15 a.m. Saturday morning, and I'm typing out a blog entry from a spacious one-bed room in the Atrium Hotel in beautiful (rainy) Orange County!  Yes, I got ripped a new one, travel-wise. Chicago was (as I should have known) buried under a pile of cloud so thick that apparently planes couldn't penetrate it. Thus, all planes were delayed. Thus, I miss my connecting flight. Thus, I take another flight which I book by calling a number that, although American Airlines gives it out to passengers, the voice on the other end belongs to a very articulate species of monkey which cannot properly book a flight to save its life. Thus, I get to OC and am told that despite what I may have heard ("they will give you a travel voucher in OC") they will not give me a travel voucher. This is not John Wayne Airport Staff's fault; they were flabbergasted that anyone would imply that such a thing existed ("that's like, a $250 cab ride!").   Which brings us to the present. I sit, in smelly travel clothes, in a not-too-shabby hotel near the airport (courtesy of American, at least) about to go to sleep and dream of tomorrow, when I will rent a car and drive my own ass home. Because if you want something done right, sometimes you've got to do it yourself.  If I find out who forgot to wish me well, I will end you.  post-script: I met a cute Italian girl on the plane. If I weren't stuck in Orange Country, that would be the highlight of the trip.  post-post-script: Also I have neither of my checked bags. Unlike me, I suspect they arrived in San Diego just fine.

      Well Friday is the big travel day, though going back to California is always easier because of the time change (I leave at 12:30, arrive at 5:30, and there's a stopover). It's been fun to be at home and to catch up with friends and fam, but it's about time I got back to the warm weather. :)  My papers are slowly coming together, but I've got some tough work ahead of me this weekend. I'd like to be done-done by the time Vegas rolls around, but I'm not sure I can resist the lure of all my new DVD's and video games for that long. I've already had to do it most of break (lacking a good computer and whatnot), and my resistance has been worn down.  Wish me good flying and on-time arrivals!

      So how about a relevant Friday Five, either 6 days late or 1 day early? I vote yes.   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?  Not failing out of school. Wait, I got on the Law Review thing too, that was pretty sweet. So we'll say that. But that time I ran 2.5 miles in 20 minutes was pretty cool, too.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?  Tough call. Some social situations didn't pan out as I wanted, but most of those were for the best. I wasn't terribly disappointed about much, to tell you the truth.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?  Lots of hot women. Haha! No seriously: lots of hot women.  Also, I'd like to get my summer plans nailed down, hopefully get an unpaid (I aim low) internship somewhere (DC, San Diego, North Dakota - whatever!)   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?  I don't really go in for that sort of stuff, I make resolutions left and right without the influence of a calendar, so I'll just stick with some of those. My resolutions tend to be along the lines of "I resolve to finally go to the damn dentist" and "I resolve to mail my rent today", so perhaps a more profound thought is in order.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   Over! But I went to a friend's for a party that ended up including a fire, strawberry's with chocolate, and Lucky Charms right out of the box. Good times! If I get around to it, I'll post the 3 or 4 pictures I took in the near future.

      Well they made me Executive Editor of the Law Review. One of them, anyhow (I think there can be up to four Execs).  What does that mean? Just that I get to edit, proofread, and  urlLink cite-check  my brains out next semester. Putting aside my natural modesty (ha!) for a moment, this is a Pretty Cool Thing, because being an editor is one of those things that goes with you your entire career. At least, so I'm told. But in all honesty, I don't think they had a helluva lot of applicants (even though there are plenty of law review members) so I take my position with that in mind. Law Review 04-05: We May Not Be the Best, But at Least We Showed Up.   On Saturday, Staples closes at like, 6pm or some lame ass time. New printer cartridge: denied!

      or, A Typical Saturday for Sam  What is it about listening to  urlLink Rush of Blood  that makes one stare off into the stacks of books, wistfully thinking that something more momentous should be happening? The melancholy, why-don't-you-love-me, life-moves-in-slow-motion strains of The Scientist just don't suit the tedium of editing a paper on copyright reform.  I've only been here for  3  4 hours, but it seems eternally longer on a Saturday evening. The only other people here right now are my fellow no-lifers and an odd smattering of armchair legal experts.   The armchair legalists are always amusing, because they come in all shapes and sizes and with as wide a range of purposes as the sea is deep. One guy is trying to find out if he has to keep paying child support "if his bitch ex-wife moves to England," and another, nicer woman is looking up sexual harassment statutes in California. I just hope they aren't making serious decisions based on what the information desk tells them, or even based on looking up cases in the ALR. You need a lawyer if it's serious! If it's not, Mr. Stained T-Shirt Guy, then more power to you and your deadbeat-dad proclivities.  Well, not  more  power. Slimeball.  Time for a visit to Taco Bell, and Staples? Yes! Life could not be more fulfilling right now (/end sarcasm).

      This weekend is going to be less fun than previous weekends. That is because of the heavy editing I continue to engage in on my Comment, which "has great structure but needs much more depth" (in the words of my advisor). I suppose great structure is nice, but I think restructuring a deep paper would be easier than adding depth to a well-organized piece.  Perhaps I'm just a pessimist. In any case, most of today, tomorrow and Sunday will be spent tucked away in the library, hunched over my laptop and some dusty copyright books like Ebenezer Scrooge and his ledger. If only I had one of those really high desks...  There will be a break on Saturday when I interview for a law review editorial board position (I have to find my suit, which is a pain) but that's more nervousness-inducing than relaxing. M's off to Palm Springs with a friend so (un?)fortunately the weekend is mine, all mine.  That's all for now, perhaps more after lunch or tonight when I take what I'm sure will be one of many, many writing breaks.

      Stumbled (is there any other way to find one?) upon a blog today,  urlLink Le Petit Hiboux , which although I haven't read much of it, strikes me as uniquely interesting.   urlLink One passage  in particular seems to say a lot of what I have fumbled about trying to say in this blog previously. Granted the specifics may not quite match up, and the gender differences remain, but how she feels about her friends is how I feel about mine. Exactly. And some of the same problems have developed in my life because of such excellent relationships.   I read blogs for two distinct (though they don't have to be) reasons: to keep tabs on my friends, and to  read . To read the kind of writing that gives me a chill because it's so good, or so earnest, or just so... passionate. The two aren't mutally exclusive, and some of my friends  are  can be gifted writers. But some blogs... some blogs make me wish I were better at this, so I wouldn't feel like a gate crasher when I stumble over the good ones.

      Yes I changed the layout. If any of you monkeys have objections, go ahead and lay 'em on me. I'll probably just ignore you, unless it relates to something being unreadable or broken on another browser. And by unreadable I don't mean "like what I always put up."   Wednesdays make my brain hurt. Too much class, too little time between classes. Well, except now - but my class starts in 30 and I should be reading, not posting. The eternal conflict.  I was thinking of posting some commentary on gay marriage/civil unions, but I'm not sure what to say. It just seems like such an obvious good idea (allowing civil unions, not prohibiting them) that I honestly fail to see the controversy. I've asked around for some sort of rational explanation, but my pool of mostly liberal friends isn't the best place to seek differing views. So now I ask you, oh anonymous Reading Community. Why is it such a bad idea? Does anybody  really  think it will weaken the institute of marriage any further than, say, all those reality shows, Las Vegas, or Carmen Electra? If there's an explanation out there that doesn't devolve into simple anti-gay hysteria, I've yet to hear it. So step up, Faithful Readers, and tell me what you think or what you've heard.   For an example of rational thought, I'd point out that while many highly religious people object to abortion, an argument about protecting potential life (whether or not you're a Christian) can at least be made to support the pro-life side. I may not agree, but I acknowledge the existence. Anti-gun control arguments often center on history, tradition or protection, and though it may be a mask for criminal paranoia it's an effective mask because there are some good arguments. But anti-gay marriage? Name me an argument that isn't directly supported by a bias against homosexuals, and I'll consider it a legitimate issue. Until then, I find this entire debate of questionable value because it is far too lopsided in favor of allowing civil unions.

      It has been a strange couple of days, but not in a bad (or good) way. Just sort of surreal, that been-there-done-that sort of surreal that's less surreal every time it happens.   No more generalized posts after this one, I swears it. Nasty hobbitses.  Instead, some weird random crap that deserves to be said, Larry King style:  - Happy Birthday to Emily (the wee sister) who is a big 20 today. That's the curtain call for the sole remaining teenager in the immediate family, which is an almost odd but ultimately unimportant fact. Happy Birthdays are in order, however!  - I cannot get over how unintentionally funny David Caruso is on CSI: Miami. He speaks in a comical "I'm having a series of small strokes" manner, and the writing is so full of cliches, so when the two collide it's laugh-out-loud funny.   - Christina Aguilera's impression of Samantha from "Sex and the City" was amazing on SNL the other night. I haven't heard such a dead-on impression of a female actress in years. Maya Rudolph is the only current female castmember who handles impressions well, in my opinion.  - Right to life? Right to death? Right to refuse treatment? All I know is, I completely faked my way through getting called on in ConLaw today. And I'm fairly certain Smith, in his emminent wisdom, was none the wiser. Or maybe he was on to me instantly. Either way, I made it.

      Rough weekend by all accounts. The weather has turned foul, thanks to a slow-to-die rainstorm system that won't leave San Diego alone. Most of my weekend plans turned to crap, not by the fault of anyone involved but just because of timing, coincidence, and under-the-weartherness (not my own).  Some operations were reexamined, some conversations were had. Some courses were changed, and destinations were acknowledged to be, for the time being, unreachable.   All in all, a normal weekend in Sam's life. Stick and move.  At least I remembered to back up my laptop.

      I blogged too soon, apparently. I was scrambling for a topic and resorted to using the Friday Five, but mere minutes later I read that the word on the political street is that Nader's going to run again. That's just screaming for comment (because it pisses me off) so two posts in 20 minutes!  1) Nader has less chance of winning than I do. Most Nader supporters (and I'm not sure how many there will be this time around) argue that he forces people to see the Democratic Party for what it is - just another corporately-owned machine of oppression. Or something. While it may be true that the Democrat Party is not (and has not been for some time) the party of the true progressive movement, it's completely asinine to pretend they are no different, idealogical or otherwise, from the Republican Party. It's also naive to a profound degree, and by supporting a completely useless candidate, Nader fans are putting millions of children, single mothers, poor families, and foreign countries at risk of another Bush presidency.  2) What did this accomplish last time? Nader's candidacy handed the presidency to an evangelical nutball with the IQ of a bathmat and a staff of hugely conservative idealogues. Is the country better off than it was in 2000? Are we more progressive? Are there more jobs? Are we a respected member of the world community? I think we all know the answers to those questions.  Kerry may have plenty of bad faults, but he's nowhere NEAR as bad as Bush, and anyone acting to undermine his candidacy is a traitor to the progressive cause, period.  3) "This wouldn't have happened if Dean/Kucinich were the candidate." Perhaps that's true. But if either of them become the nominee (unlikely now that Dean's officially out) then the Democrats would lose. What many fiercely progressive individuals forget is that politics is not about extremes. Dean is an extreme within the Democratic Party, and in the end he would have been routed by Bush. Kerry is much more centered, and even if his politics don't match up with most liberals, he's much more open to those ideals than Bush and Co. He also appeals to the Democrat-in-theory swath of America that votes Democratic but thinks like a conservative.  I would love for this country to be able to elect a far left President. Truly, I would. But elections are about majorities, or at least pluralities, and the majority of this country does not want such a person in the White House. I may disagree, and I may work to persuade that vast majority, but you cannot discount their voting power. That power must be wined and dined, and someone like Dean (and definitely Nader) cannot do that. Kerry can, he can actually win this election, and any liberal who stands in his way should be stripped of their tree-hugging badge and sent to Canada. Politics is a game of inches, of gradual change, and once liberals accept that fact, real change can begin.  /end sermon  Perhaps tomorrow I will tear into the anti-gay marriage crowd. But see how pervasive that movement seems to be? That's why we can't elect Nader, or Dean, in this country. Not yet.

      It's not Friday so perhaps I'll add one to make the  Saturday Six .   When was the last time you...   1. ...went to the doctor?  For health reasons? Going on 3 years ago, I'd imagine. He told me that strapping your men such as myself only need physicals every 4 or 5 years, though obviously if something is wrong I should come in. Was that just my doctor's subtle way of getting rid of me? I did stop by to pick up medical records before moving to San Diego, though.  Since August 2002, I've only been sick once (twice if you can't a nasty, nasty hangover one Saturday) and that was from food poisoning - but no colds, flues, or otherwise pain-in-the-ass illnesses. Knock on wood.   2. ...went to the dentist?  Ah, my definite weak point. I hate the dentist, and what's more I don't like new dentists. Thus, I haven't been in quite some time (let's just say it's my project for the new millennium). At this point it has snowballed so that I know if I go, I'll have like 4 cavities and need a root canal or something. Thus it is not at the top of my priority list...   3. ...filled your gas tank?  Earlier this week. Visiting a certain someone up in La Jolla on a regular basis has not been kind to my gas budget, but it's a small price to pay. Gas prices just went up, too.    4. ...got enough sleep?  Last night! Aborted Friday plans = bed at a reasonable hour and no distractions to keep me from getting a good night's sleep. I awoke refreshed even though I got only the standard 8 hours.   5. ...backed up your computer?  Good call, man. I keep meaning to do that, but I never have a CD around when my mental alarm bells kick in. Let's say... 4 hours from now when I head home. Perhaps now that it's immortalized in blog form, I will be spurred to action.   6. ...shot a man just to watch him die?  I am unable to comment on pending litigation.

      I've noticed an increasing frustration with California's drivers lately, and I've been struggling to determine where my road rage comes from. I've always been annoyed by bad drivers - everybody who's been in a car with me more than a couple times knows that. But it seems enhanced out here, and after careful (i.e. not at all thought-out) consideration, I have a theory.  California is home to Drivers. Everybody drives here, partly because the mass transit in most California cities is piss-poor (the exception being of course San Francisco) and partly because things are much more spread out. Out here, the distance to a friend's house might be the same distance as it is from Arlington, VA to Bethesda, MD (perhaps through DC). The massive highway system in California helps move that along nicely, so aside from the environmental issues (of which there are many) it seems to work speedily.  The flipside, however, is that anytime a California driver goes somewhere new, they drive. New restaurant tonight? New club? New park or theater or marina? Let's hop in the car with a Mapquest printout and find it! This is not a bad thing (or even unavoidable), but my theory is that it leads to many, many people driving around looking for things and thus making complete asses out of themselves (because they're going really slow, or cutting across 2 lanes to make an exit or a turn, etc.).  Contrast this with my theoretical vision of the east coast (or at least the DC area) where people often drive only to work and back, or don't drive at all. When I lived in Arlington, I used my car sparingly and most often only to go west (away from the city). Any adventures into the city were undertaken using the vastly superior Metro system. Even those who don't live very close often drive to the Metro station nearest their house, and then metro in to avoid the hassle of driving.   My final analysis, then? People in DC are jerks behind the wheel, but as a percentage of drivers more of them know where they're going at any given time than those who are tooling around Southern California. This is not to say that Californians are worse drivers; just that when given the opportunity to be lost or confused, most Californians do so while behind the wheel, whereas many (I wouldn't dare guesstimate a percentage) Washingtonians do so while staring at a Metro map or a grid of downtown DC.   You may begin punching numerous holes in my theory.

      Wednesday is usually a really rough day for me, but today a magical sort of thing happened. My 3-hour Employment Discrimination class (which is great but man, 3 hours would be long even if were Stripper and Video Game Law) was cancelled! So now I am home doing laundry, eating lunch and otherwise having a much better Wednesday than is normal.   Created quite the outrage by suggesting that Angel was a quality show. But you know what? Is! And I object to the hypocrisy of Buffy viewers not giving it a chance when honestly, who the hell tunes into a show called "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" without a great deal of prodding? Besides, the point wasn't to single out Angel, but rather to point out that other than the Law & Order series (and to a lesser degree, CSI) there isn't much fictional network television worth watching anymore. And since L&O and CSI are very formula-based, that doesn't leave a hell of a lot of room for creativity. Me = sad.   On the upside, last night I shook the TV monkey off my back because of above reasons (Tuesdays being particularly bad, except for Scrubs), and I actually read. Not to sound completely illiterate, but because of my class schedule and the inordinately high amount of reading I have to do on a daily basis, I just don't read for pleasure much anymore. But I realized that perhaps the craptacular state of TV was a blessing in disguise, so now I'm back into one of the 5 books I got for Christmas but haven't read.

      I don't watch as much TV as I used to. Part of that is because there's so little good television on these days - a common lament, I know - but what's worse is that it seems as though anything remotely daring or well-written gets axed and "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance" gets greenlighted for another 25 seasons. Now, I'm all for escapist television, that's what television is for, and I wouldn't normally express my disdain for anything that others enjoy. To each his/her own, that's what I think.  But I can't help but conclude that the huge rise in reality TV, and the subsequent drop in entertaining fictional television, is correlated. In the last few years, several entertaining shows have come and gone, including Freaks and Geeks, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Buffy, Futurama, Boomtown, and now (as you may have heard) Angel.  If you were a fan of Buffy and you don't watch Angel, you should be ashamed. Ashamed! It has turned into an easily equivalent and often times superior work, and those who complain about it being too complicated are just being silly. After all, if you can keep up with Buffy's convoluted and confusing mythology, Angel's is (was) a cakewalk. The damage is done, and I'm not so naive to think that any amount of new viewership could save the show (nor that I have any means of increasing said viewership), but I feel frustrated. Not for the cast or crew or anything silly like that, but rather because once Angel goes, I will no longer have Must See TV. I can remember back a few years ago when Buffy was crackling with energy, West Wing was on fire, ER was riveting, and even a number of sitcoms (Raymond, Scrubs, even Friends) were quite funny. Now? West Wing has lost its edge, ER seems soulless, and Raymond and Friends seem to be letting the clock run out so they can retire. Scrubs is still entertaining, but NBC moves it so often (it's on Tuesdays now, right?) that I expect it will also be cancelled or "put on hiatus".  And what replaces these shows? Average Joe: Hawaii. Or something about midgets dating. Or the Surreal Life (I'm looking at you, WB). I don't have a problem with such shows, even if I'm not a fan, until they replace the ones that are daring and creative. The networks often whine (though I suspect they know) that they're losing market to cable, but everyone knows why that is. The Sopranos, Sex and the City, even Dead Like Me (on Showtime) and The L-Word (which is basically just hot lesbians, but still more substantial than 90% of other TV) are far more riveting and more creative.  I don't suppose I have a point here, I'm just sad. Sad to know that Angel won't be back, sad at the prospects of another few years of reality TV upstaging quality work. Sad that although I enjoy Law & Order and CSI, neither show is particularly groundbreaking or innovative. Sad that the Simpsons is the only thing left, and that's a half-hour long.

      I am literally out of clothes. If I don't do laundry tonight, I'll be wearing formalwear and/or gym clothes to school tomorrow, because I have nothing. Since I just did laundry 15 days ago, I'm going to take this as a sign that I need to a) stop wearing so much clothing, or b) buy some more clothes. I think I may need a sugar momma for that second one, so perhaps adopting a nudist lifestyle is both a financially and strategically better plan of action.   Today is President's Day, though you wouldn't know it to see everyone on campus. USD does not believe in honoring our nation's forefathers, perhaps because they are a bunch of communists, or fascists, or Catholics. Wait, that last one sounds right.  My favorite ex-President (clearly he'd have to be ex, since I'm fairly certain that the current occupant is a shaved chimpanzee with a good tailor) is Franklin Roosevelt. Not only did he pull the country out of a massive depression, but he also put the country in the one war this century in which it was probably a good idea to participate. My choice is not surprising to anyone who knows me as a fairly dyed-in-the-wool liberal, but it is worth stating nonetheless. Also not a terribly bold choice, but given this country's history of electing on white, upper-class men to the office, I don't find myself staring at a rainbow of opportunity. Up until the 20th century (and even until today, though I believe the effect is lessened because of the media's watchdog role) the presidency was a place of corruption, and the commander-in-chief spent more time provoking class warfare than he did advancing the nation. That, or he was a doddering moron - I'm looking at you, Warren G. Harding.   My memory of Presidents past is fading, as I haven't had a good American History course since 1999 (and my attempt to plow through A People's History of the United States is almost stagnant at this point), but Roosevelt is probably the cream of the crop. Despite whatever errors in judgment he may have made (Pearl Harbor, Japanese internment camps, spending programs that eclipsed even my rather ultraliberal view of the scope of government power). Don't even get me started on Reagan.

      Well first off, Happy Birthday to Cindy! What's the point in having a blog if you can't do silly things like give people birthday shout-outs?   Second off, I'm a lazy bum and didn't go to the library today. I did some significant work at home, so I don't feel to badly about it, but boy am I lazy.  Stayed up too late last night, slept in too late this morning, and never really shook off that lethargic feeling. This is turning into a spectacularly boring post, so I will cut it short before my millions of readers are rendered comatose.   More tomorrow when I've thought of something to opine about.

      Than to be in San Diego today, where the weather is approaching balmy for once and I have worn short-sleeves for the first time this year. Tis an absolutely beautiful day, and if I weren't so damn tired I'd be out running around in it. As it is, I'm keeping watch over the library from my perch in the reading room, pretending to do cite-checking but not really getting anything done yet.  I have errands to run later, and for once they don't seem like a bad idea because it's so nice out. Have I belabored that point yet?   Today in ConLaw, our professor read a quote from someone criticizing part of a Supreme Court decision (Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in case you care) as having all the weight of a "drunken late-night declaration of affection" (paraphrased because the wording escapes me). The aptness of this analogy aside - and I tend to think it's humorous but wrong - it does make one reflect on how strangely true it is in real life. As the night goes on, the conversation deepens or the alcohol takes its full effect, and people are likely to say whatever they can to avoid going home alone. Then, when the sun is shining again, you realize that what you said last night was a pretty far cry from reality.   I don't think I'm just writing from personal experience, as it is obvious that at least myself and Nagel (the quotation author) can confirm this social phenomena, but as far as bad moves go it seems to be the least detrimental to personal health. Sure it can be embarassing (and if it leads to physical encounters, you have a whole new complication), but most people know that the "I love you man" speech is just a product of lowered inhibitions and a late night of revelry. Because of that, it's not sad or weird, but rather sort of cute when it happens.  That was a random tangent. Here's something for Raf:

      Valentine's Day is on the horizon again, so I'll go ahead and post a quick commentary on the day like pretty much every other blogging fool in the universe.   Valentine's Day is sweet and cute and appropriate for those who like that sort of thing. It's good for those who do not express their feelings often, because it forces them (mostly men, but some women too) to say how they feel rather than let their actions speak for them. I think both expressing yourself verbally and through your actions is appropriate, but I've never quite understood why it should be okay for February 14th to be the only day that occurs. If you love someone, really love them, you should be making that known in little ways every day, and occasionally in a big way, but not because the calendar says so.   Yeah, that's a bit of a cynical argument, but it's not because I'm bitter (I hope). It just seems like if I do something overly special on Valentine's Day, it lumps me in with all the shmucks who never do anything special unless it's mandated by a holiday. I want to give roses because roses should be given, to buy jewelry because she deserves jewelry, to go away for the weekend because I enjoy her company. But not because it's the 14th and I have to.  In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not doing anything on Valentine's Day and I'm okay with that. I mean, clearly I'm okay with that (see above) but I don't think there's anyone in my life right now who's not okay with that, so it works out nicely. If it's as nice as it was today, I may have to go outside!

      Starting to feel a little swamped again, between cite-checking, comment-writing, and applying for a Board position... waitaminute, those are all law review! Stupid drive to excel. Actually it's not so much a drive to excel as it is a need to not let opportunities pass me by. I mean, NOT applying for a position would be foolish, and even if I don't get one at least I tried. Part of the reason I'd like a spot is because I'm planning on being here in San Diego this summer, and it would help fill up my time - "worst" case scenario being that I'll simply be taking classes again. It's "worst" because it's still San Diego in the summer, and probably one of the top ten places (perhaps in the world) to spend summer.   Not much else to post about, unfortunately. Nothing for public consumption, at least - that doesn't mean I'm hiding things from you, Gentle Reader, but rather that some items still need cooking before they're ready to be released for your amusement and entertainment. It's an interesting dichotomy that forms when you have a blog - do I paste my identity all over it (because that's honest and upfront and people will know how to reach me) or do I use pseudonyms and nicknames and otherwise obscure myself so that I can be more honest about personal matters? As this blog's readership has grown (not to huge numbers, but admittedly more than the 2 or 3 that initially tuned in), I've switched from my personal rants about relationships and such, to a more reflective but less personally revealing mode of writing. Is that better? Worse? More interesting, or less?   Although this blog is mine and mine alone, it is obviously meant to be read by others (if it weren't - and many bloggers seem to forget this - it would simply be a diary), so I solicit your advice and comment. What, if anything, is not being mentioned in this blog that should be? Or, is anything being mentioned too much? Lay it on me.

      Upfront disclosure: this stems from a conversation, nothing more. I feel like I need disclosures these days or everyone assumes some exciting/bad/strange thing happened to spark posts like this. Nope! Just good ol' fashioned conversation.  A friend of mine was recently lamenting the fact that when interviewing for non-profit (or low profit) legal positions, the interview process is often quite unprofessional and sometimes downright crappy. Having worked in the non-profit world, I noted that actually this is quite common, and that (in my opinion) it stems from a conflict between idealists and those who want to "get the job done."   Idealism is where most non-profits start. Someone with a vision for changing the world. Visionaries are key to society, because it takes vision and idealism to bring social problems to the attention of the generally ignorant public. Difficulties arise, however, when the idealist realizes that orating from a box on the street corner of a major city may be personally fulfilling, but if you want to affect real change, you have to organize and create a system and a structure for doing so. The idealist must learn to compromise, and compromise is a difficult thing to master, especially when you believe so very strongly that your goals are just.   When I say compromise, I don't necessarily mean compromising in terms of morals or goals (though that may be necessary), but rather in putting together a team, an organization, a gameplan for changing the world. In doing so, you need professional people who can work the system, but professional people are often not idealists. It works against you to be idealistic, especially when engaging in politics, but the idealists who run the non-profit don't want to compromise and hire those who aren't 100% in-line with their goals. Instead, you get very smart, very idealistic and charming people who can't actually hold a meeting or write a letter to save their lives. They have no professional experience, nor do they want any, and in the end (because the top tiers of any non-profit are often filled with more idealists than professionals) they drive off employees who would like to help but feel ineffectual ("beating my fists against a brick wall" is a common complaint) in such an environment.   So, we end up at my friend's situation, which is just a window into that world. Those who go to hire law students are often higher-level employees, and because of that they are often ideal-driven and not practical. They don't know how to properly interview, or how to consider alternative viewpoints (even if those viewpoints differ on only minor points), and they end up losing out on very capable, intelligent people because those people don't want to work in such a stifling and startlingly inefficient environment.  There are exceptions to this, of course. My time in the non-profit world was quite good, and while some of the problems I've mentioned were common, the organization benefitted greatly from having a leader who was both idealistic and capable. But I've worked with many other organizations who could not have found their way into a congressional meeting with a map of the capital and an engraved invitation, simply because they had alienated the few people who knew how to make such meetings happen.

       urlLink Worth reading , if you're philosophically-minded. And also for the quote "The regime will be pluralistic, because Bush believes it, because nice men came to the Oval Office and told him so."  I dislike Mondays most of the time, but today's version isn't too bad. The week has promise, the weekend has potential, and onward we march unto the future. Of course that's all bound to change in a moment, since I'm certain I'm developing a new kind of manic-depressive disorder, called "upbeat-laconic" disorder. Now that I've labeled it, however, it seems not quite as serious as I first thought.

      It has been a good weekend, I think. Saw "Miracle" last night, which was good but... well obviously it was limited in its excitement level because everyone knows (or learned while sitting in the theater) that the U.S. beat the Russians in 1980. The dramatization of it was very well-executed, however, so it didn't matter too much that you knew the ending. At least, until the actual ending, which was obviously a bit anti-climactic.  Also, I thought Hilary was going to throw something at the screen when the Coach kept making the guys do sprints, after their first game.  "Again!"  Is it just me, or is "When Harry Met Sally" always permanently playing on some cable channel? Right now: TBS.   On Friday, bar review was at a hotel on the bay, and we went on a "cruise" around the bay. Although as far as cruises go, the bay is so placid and the boat is so big, we could have stayed docked the entire time and not too many people would have noticed. It was only an hour long, anyhow, but worth the $6. There might be more to report about that night, but it's not fit for public consumption so you all will have to settle for my boring, PG-rated version.

      After much (5 minutes) deliberating, I decided to toss the old commenting system out the window in favor of the more reliable and (crossing my fingers) stable Haloscan. Hopefully it will adapt better to my non-standard web browser so that I don't miss so many comments from now on. My next project will be to change the font so that italicized words don't come out so unreadable. Unfortunately my scripting abilities are at a nadir and I can't quite figure out how to do that - well, also I haven't been terribly driven to do it.  Of course this means that all your various witty and insightful comments are gone, gone from the blog. But hey, you were never THAT witty anyways, and sometimes a blank slate is better than being bogged down by the past.  You know what, I'm just going to say it: thank god it's Friday. Though I am still in the library, it's not as sad when I remember that it is indeed the weekend and I don't  have  to be here.  Today's ConLaw was all about abortion, but I'm not going to post about that. There was surprisingly little argument about most points made, and the class only grumbled once (it was sort of funny to hear, you could just tell that this one comment was rankling many people). I was sort of hoping for a more drag-out knock-down battle, but maybe we're just too civilized (and tired at 9am on Friday) to bring the A game.

      I don't have any classes today (because I'm weird, my off-day is Thursday), and I woke up at 8 a.m. this morning. EIGHT FREAKIN' A.M.  Why would my body do that to me? Granted, I was asleep before Futurama ended last night, but I was all hyped up to be "up" until the wee hours, reading a book or otherwise watching TV that normally I'm too tired to stay awake for.   Alas, I went down for the count and woke up  with enough time to get to class , had it been any other day than Thursday. This just boggles my mind, because a) I'm not that old that I should be waking up at 8 on my day off and b) I don't ever want to be that old.  Ah father time, what gifts you have bestowed on me. I also burned the crap out of my arm while getting dressed. It's an odd but unamusing story of clumsiness which can be boiled down to this piece of advice: don't try and put jeans on when standing up right next to your superheated wall furnace. Yowch! Now I look flame-broiled.   In the end, I blame the weather, which if it would stay above 60 degrees would mean I wouldn't even have to turn on the damn thing in the morning. But 58 is just too cold a temperature to get dressed. What are we, savages? I never thought I'd look forward to the sweltering heat of summer in San Diego, but I'm starting to miss is something fierce.

      Quick note: something about the browser I generally use ( urlLink Firebird ) is hiding comments from me, and I'm not terribly sure why. So just FYI, until I figure out why (or give up and switch to Haloscan), I might not be johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to noticing those things. It's actually a great browser - has its own pop-up blocker and everything - but there are some quirks that I'm still trying to fix.  That doesn't mean stop commenting you crazy bastards. It just means I'm not (usually) ignoring you if I don't respond.

      I used to think the phrase "haves and have nots" was "halves and halve nots," and I assumed it had something to do with math and people who didn't like sharing. I was only sort of wrong, I guess. I still see "halves" everytime I read "haves" so perhaps it's permanently etched in my brain.  I also read "celebrate" whenever it says "celebate," an ironic distinction to say the least. That's not something to celebrate about at  all.   I may try and run for an editorial position with law review, but I'm hesitant because of both the work that would be required, but also because I'm not sure I'm terribly qualified. One look at my GPA and they'll probably laugh me right of the interview room.  But I feel fairly strong in the technical editing area, so perhaps I'll at least apply. I may be the only law student on the face of the planet who likes cite-checking.   Congratulations go out to  urlLink Kim , who was visitor number 5,000 on the ol' blog. And probably without whom I would still be languishing in the 3,000's. Stay tuned for the next 5,000 when we learn just how long one person can keep writing such narcissistic yet self-flagellating material.   urlLink I would never need to fill 'er up again.

      By my estimate, this blog will receive its 5,000th visitor sometime tomorrow, earlier if all those Rubberband Man searches keep piling in. While 5,000 isn't terribly high, it's approx. 500 times larger than everyone who ever visited my disaster of a webpage in college. So thanks for reading, very occassionally commenting, and otherwise not signing me up for spam. Onward and upward!  As for all you who stumble across my wee blog looking for music from TV commercials, Samantha Brown from Great Hotels, and solutions to ants in your car...  I have just helped perpetuate your poor searching skills by mentioning them all again. Mwahahaha!

      It occurred to me the other day that I've got to start getting over the idea that nobody wants to "be with me." As a younger man, I was wretchedly awkward and unpopular, at least until the waning years of high school. College was fun because of the few friends I made, but as far as the opposite sex was concerned, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland (with a few notable oases). It's hard to say exactly when things changed, because I was in a long relationship for the two years after college, but now that I've come out here...  Let's just say things have turned around, and I'm not sure exactly what to do with that. It's not that I've met hundreds (or even dozens) of fabulous women, but at some point along the way my repellent quotient dropped far enough for more than a couple people to become at least marginally interested. I say this with as much candor and humility as possible, because I am in no way implying that I have any idea how this could have happened. Nor do I know what to do with it.  But I do know that for the first time in, well, 26 years, I have... options. And options in the dating world is about as foreign to me as speaking Arabic. I'm not trying to sound like I'm some sort of swinging bachelor, because this is Real Life, and so the options I have are all conditioned upon a variety of impediments. Some people live too far away, others are "coworkers," but the main problem is that I've yet to meet one that really makes me interested, beyond just a brief physical attraction or curiosity. Besides, this post is less about "meeting the right girl" and more about accepting this new trait. The same problems that everyone has still exist (attracted to those who aren't attracted to me, for one) but they're less demoralizing in light of my "options."  Sidenote: it may not be clear from the above, but when I say I've yet to meet one that really makes me interested, I mean meet a girl who is both a) interested in me and b) interesting. This clearly does not apply to the many interesting girls I currently have as friends, or to past girlfriends that I still talk to. You all know who you are.   Exit introspective mode. That's enough of THAT for awhile, eh? Back to the business at hand: telling you the random boring elements of my daily law school life! Sit back and enjoy...

      My Legislation class is currently discussing campaign finance reform and the justifications behind it. It is quite a heated debate (in law school class terms, that means more than one person speaks) and I had an idea to share but class ended before I could. Enter the blog!  Instead of having complicated statutory law and administrative agencies governing elections (i.e. the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, FECA, the FEC), why don't we just prohibit all campaign contributions? Bear with me for a second: there is an argument that donating money to your candidate of choice is akin to speaking, because you are "saying" that you support that candidate and his or her ideals. But if we decide that's crap (and I'm inclined to say it is - money is property; speech is speech), then we can restrict ALL campaign shenanigans. No more PACs and wealthy donors, no more corporate influence (at least around elections). One person, one vote, and that's how it's run.  Sure, you lose a substantial ability to reach the public. TV commercials are expensive, but (again my view) it seems to me that campaign commercials run because other campaign commercials are running and saying the opposite thing. If there were NO campaign commercials, NO fundraisers, but instead most public discourse occurred via news shows, debates, and newspaper articles - would we be worse off? Wouldn't that be simpler? We could require television stations to carry politically important programming -- something not remotely unusual, as such a system was in place for a long time until fairly recently scrapped -- and potential politicians would have to stick primarily to issues.   The downside (if you see it as one) is that the news media would be a much bigger player in campaigning, because it would be the primary source for candidate information (whether it be newspaper, radio, or TV). And as FOX News shows us, the media isn't exactly unbiased. But with so many sources of information (including the Internet, which would be instrumental) at our fingertips, I would almost argue that this system would leave a  more-informed  public, not a less-informed one. Instead of having to sort through attack ads, fluff pieces, and reams of 3rd party materials attacking or supporting one candidate or another, the entire process would be hugely simplified.   Lobbying, then, would be restricted to fully post-election occurrences. Since PACs and interest groups wouldn't be allowed to donate to, or even support, candidates for office, they'd be restricted to lobbying only already-elected officials on behalf of their interests. This would give the Voters a much stronger hand in government, because when allied with the media (and not confused by special interests) they might be more informed and thus less willing to stand for corruption in office. Although influencing elected officials post-election would still be challenging, the Voters would have a clearer trump card to play: the ability to vote bad politicians out of office. Without 3rd parties crowding the electoral system, such a trump card becomes the powerful tool envisioned by the Founders.  Or, perhaps I'm a communist. The freedom of speech issues in this theoretical scheme are clear - telling an organization they can't act to support a candidate is not only crossing the line, it's pretty much obliterating it, at least under current readings of the 1st Amendment. My only comment on that (since I'm no 1st Amend. expert) is that perhaps freedom of speech shouldn't be allowed to corrupt democracy itself, and if we allow speech to overrule election laws (even as draconian as my proposed laws) then scandal, corruption, and illegitimacy will pervade our society, and eventually we'll lose speech as well.

      The mantra of the San Diego-specific pages of weather.com. That, or Partly Cloudy. It seems our hot weather was but a freak occurrence that won't be repeated again in the next 7 to 10 days. No big loss, I've too much to do to be outside getting burned and dehydrated.   Muchos gracias for the suggestions on how to halt the fraying, they are all excellent. The light at the end of the tunnel is Easter weekend, of course, because we (meaning USD, a Catholic school) get Monday and Friday off. By then my $&%@! law review paper will be turned in (they want 13 copies! 13! Paper copies! At 45-50 pages each!) and I'll be ready to concentrate on other aspects of school. Like, you know, those pesky classes I've been attending and taking notes in but not at all outlining (or even contemplating outside of class).  Yesterday's ConLaw class was interesting because we began exploring Freedom of Speech. More specifically, we discussed the reasoning behind "Free Speech" as a right - why? Why Free Speech and not some other "right" like Freedom to Be Employed or Freedom to Eat at Denny's? My favorite argument was, as is often the case, the most philosophical: freedom of speech is a basic freedom because truth, and seeking truth, is one of humanity's most basic goals. The best, and only, way to determine the strength and validity of our ideas is to let them into the "marketplace of ideas" and watch them battle for supremacy over "false" ideas. In a free and open marketplace, truth will always win. Marek pointed out that this approach is a wee bit unrealistic, as there is no such thing as a marketplace of free exchange, especially when you reach the broadest audience.  While that is probably true, I still think Truth is the best goal to have. Everyone thinks their ideas are true, or at least more true than others, but the only way to make sure is to let those ideas out. As Justice Holmes pointed out, "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market." And only those who fear truth will shy away from speaking their mind.   I don't even believe that sometimes Truth is dangerous, at least on a large national or international scale. Sure, sometimes Truth is a bad idea (i.e. when it hurts someone for no reason) but that's not the same thing as The Truth about our foreign policy, or The Truth about our national security. The current administration doesn't seem to share this view, because in their eyes those who question their Truth are damaging society - this could not be farther from the reality of the situation.  I'm going to stop now because the word "truth" is starting to sound funny to me. You know how words start sounding incorrect, the more you hear them (or, as it happens, type them)? I've am afflicted with that particular malady now, so it's on to Tax Law where truth plays no real part in our discussion.

      I slept badly or poorly or wrongly last night, and now my neck hurts. Not terribly, but enough to make me feel crappy, especially in conjunction with my sunburn (getting better) and a weird random cough (that seems unrelated to any actual illness but appeared after Sunday's Hike of Death).   It seems like there's a splintering effect going on in my life, but I'm at a loss for how to explain it any further. Perhaps it's the stress of impending finals, or social-life-related stress, but I feel disconnected from pretty much everybody right now. It doesn't have much, if anything, to do with breaking up with M, but I'm sure that didn't help. To be honest, it's probably just academic stress - it's that time of year, after all. I just feel... frayed around the edges.  The on-deck solution to this feeling is to jettison aspects of my life that are unhelpful or overly complicated. Women, for example - unhelpful and overly complicated, at least when you date (or dated) them. Job seeking for the summer - fairly useless, given my academic record, and far more stressful than fruitful. Also overly complicated. Friends - helpful and not complicated at all. They stay, as does academia because, let's face it, I couldn't get out now even if I wanted to (don't worry, I don't want to).   So for those keeping score, School + Friends = My Life. Throw in a smattering of  urlLink Netflix  movies, fantasy base-ball, and bachelor-party brainstorming and you've got me in a nutshell. Help, I'm in a nutshell!

      It was completely uneventful.  Well, I wouldn't say completely - 95% of it was spent engaging in solo activities (think reading and watching tv, pervs) which is alright by me.   Of course, one small, roughly half-hour portion of the weekend was spent having  the best break-up discussion ever.  At least, the best had by me.   I knew she was questioning whether to go back to her ex. She knew I don't have much time for casual relationships these days. We both knew I was the Rebound Guy. And after not seeing each other in two weeks, something was simply not... "on" anymore. Henceforth a very mature, no-hard-feelings-whatsoever conversation was had. Some sadness, to be sure - it's hard to meet people you click with, even if the click only lasts for a little while. But because we were both extraordinarily open about things, it wasn't remotely uncomfortable or weird.  My only regret is that I never got a picture of her. Nobody will ever believe me when I try to describe how very, very hot she is.

      (on the hottest day in March)  It's very hot. And there's no cover because, this being San Diego, there are no actual trees. Just sage and tumbleweed and even a cactusy-looking thing or two. But nothing taller than me, except other hikers. And it would seem they don't like being used for shade. Spoilsports.  Regardless of the heat, and my absolutely disastrous idea that  running  part way was a good move, I made it all the way up the mountain (1.5 miles, approx. 1,500 feet) and ran out of water. The walk back down was definitely easier, but by the time I reached the bottom I was seriously contemplating strangling the girls in front of me who had used their abundance of H2O to have a  water fight . I know they had no reason to think I was a tad thirsty, but boy were they close to being emaciated corpses discovered by some other hiker, weeks from now ("It looks like they were beaten to death with their own REI water bottles...").  Anywho, that's my Sunday, still in progress. It's only 2pm in the afternoon but since I have to wait for my body to reboot, I won't be doing much else until later. Got a nice burn going, though! First sunburn of the season! Now we'll see if I can morph it into a tan...

      Sometimes the mood can strike you just right, and like the jolted-aware feeling that comes when you slam on the brakes to avoid a previously unnoticed pedestrian, you step outside.   Outside yourself, your apartment or home, your workplace or place of learning, your city, your country, and your world. It happens to everyone, some more often than others, and it's been said that certain mind-altering and illegal intoxicants can up the frequency of such occurrences.   What you see when you step out is never very predictable, at least to you. Do you see your life as it might have been, had you chosen to go away to Seattle for school instead of staying close to your home? Or perhaps you realize, for the first time, that there are millions of people who have never heard of Starbucks living thousands of miles away from the spot where a few minutes ago you complained that your coffee did not have enough sugar?   Maybe it's the simple realization that this is all there is. It's a realization that, at once, is both horrifyingly claustrophobic and calming. It's a feeling not unlike the one you get when watching a scene in a movie where the camera zooms out and moves in at the exact same moment.  Everyone should have one of those last ones. It reminds us that, beyond the day-to-day tedium of papers that must be turned in and appointments that must be scheduled and kept, life is pure opportunity. Every soul, from the man living in a hut in a third-world country to the woman working in a skyscraper in downtown Chicago, has the innate ability to do  anything.  There may be minor exceptions, like terraforming on Mars or playing point guard for the Knicks, which are available only to a select few, but the vast majority of human experiences are available to every single person. You just have to realize it.   Of course, that's not the hard part. After realization must come action, a seizing of one's own destiny, so to speak. But that's probably where 99% of the world steps back from the edge, climbs down from the roof and stops staring at the night sky. After all, you've got the cable bill to pay, a not-very-interesting social function to attend on Saturday, and a persistent headache that never seems to fade completely. Sure, at some point you'll write that novel, live in Tokyo for 6 months, spend a summer sailing to the Caribbean, and learn to play jazz guitar.   Just not today.

      Wednesday is one long mofo of a day, I tell you what. Though by the end of it, I will be nearly 6 hours of law school smarter, it wears me down down down. It's a burning ring of fire.  Last night, out of sheer boredom, I watched an episode of "High School Reunion" on the WB (I had forgotten that Scrubs, which is about 345 times better -- 342 times if it's a repeat -- is on at 9:30). I realized that while I have a fanatical and almost obsessive curiosity about people I used to know (mainly from high school, as I have a fairly good idea where all my college friends are right now), I don't in the slightest feel like I'm missing out or that I have any unresolved issues with anyone.  I mean, I'll go to my 10 Year Reunion if I can manage. Especially if I'm dating a rocket scientist turned beach volleyball-playing lingerie model like I hope to be. But I don't have any confrontations to make, or hatchets to bury, or anything like that. It strikes me that those that DO still have issues with decade-old acquaintances are a little bit pathetic, and probably not very happy with their lives at the moment. Maybe that will be me in 2 years, but somehow I doubt it. I'd like to see some of the girls I had crushes on, and the two that I dated (albeit briefly and very, very awkwardly). And I'd like to see how the guys that I wanted to beat the piss out of, had I any actual muscle at the time, turned out. But that's the end of it. No tears or drama for me, just good old snickering behind the paunchy football players' backs.  Unless they've all become lawyer neurosurgeon flight instructors or something. Then I'll just key their cars.

      I have friends of all types. Some, I can share 5 words with and my point is taken. It's mostly guys that communicate this way, and it suits our needs nicely. An entire conversation can be as follows: "Wow."  "Yeah, I saw."  "Damn."  "You wish."  "Shut up." "I used to date someone like that, but with less..." "Yeah."  Note the end of the conversation is heralded by the inclusion of too much information. This is not a bad thing, but guys have to take care lest they inadvertently reveal far too much (i.e. "I used to date a girl named Kate..." bzzzzt! Thanks for playing but I'm afraid you've exceeded your limit for today!).   In that I am simultaneously blessed and cursed with an abundance of female friends, I sometimes have the unique opportunity to have the same conversation in an entirely different format. This format includes many, many words, analogies, stories about previous experiences, and sometimes more than a few positive affirmations ("Well she's not as hot as YOU, of course...").  Each type of conversation has its strengths and its weaknesses. But the reason we have these conversations, that can sometimes differ. Some people don't like to talk about their private life, even with close friends. It's not a bad thing, it's just a personality trait. The key is to identify people who are like this so that you don't get miffed when they choose not to share. Others will share every detail of their sordid history with the guy selling coffee downstairs, because that's the way they are. I tend to straddle the line, in that I'm neither forthcoming (especially with people I don't know) nor secretive.  I don't know about the rest of you, but for me, a good conversation can put an entirely different spin on the day. Above and beyond that, a necessary conversation, if finally out in the open and held with the right person, can put a different spin on your life. I tend to bottle those sorts of conversations up, and either bury them in my brain, or have them in a "once-and-for-all" throwdown. I've been engaging more in the latter behavior these days, and it makes me much happier. Sure, it can be scary to have a "what are the two of us doing" conversation, but no matter the outcome ("We're doing what we do. Stop worrying.") I just feel 100% better about everything.   I don't know why I didn't realize this years ago. Perhaps it's more dependent on the person you're talking to than I think, and I'm just lucky that my recent experiences have been with someone I'm very in tune with. Just getting things off your chest, though - as long as it's focused towards the person it concerns, it can be very rewarding no matter what the result.

      Well Spreak is over. It was fun, to a degree, but also a bit nerve-wracking and not as fun as most spreaks should be. At least according to what I see on the MTV and whathaveyou.  But it had its shining moments. The parents are still in town, but for tonight only, as they head out tomorrow around noon. The weather has not fully cooperated with their visit, but that is in part because they refuse to go anywhere that's not ocean-adjacent, and thus they are subject to the very fickle whims of what we call "microclimate weather". This means that at any given time, and especially when people visit, the coastal areas will be completely clouded over (the "marine layer") because the desert is so frickin' hot that it creates some weird meteorological effects. End result is that while it is sunshiney-happy at my apartment, and points east, if you even  think  about going to the beach, you're usually in for some cloudiness.   We went sailing yesterday, though, and it was enough fun to make me realize that I would someday like to own a sailboat. I would also someday like to learn to sail a sailboat. Being on the water is nice, but being on the water without the horrible engine noise that accompanies powered boats is wonderful. We saw sea lions (they're like squirrels out here, you can't find saltwater without stepping over a pile of 'em) and some dolphins being trained by the Navy for what I can only assume are nefarious and underhanded covert operations. Then we had dinner in Little Italy (it's about 2 blocks long) which was excellent because I went home and watched Sopranos without absolutely starving for pasta during the entire show.  And now I'm in the library, wasting a wee bit of time. I finished cite-checking finally, but now am trying to distract myself from the fact that I have to give a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, dickless, hopeless, heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spineless, worm-headed sack of monkey shit presentation in a few hours.   It's possible that I'm unconvinced that such a presentation is a worthy use of my time. 10 minutes on the Medical Board of California! Go!

       urlLink Secret Window  is not a good movie. Not a good movie at all. And it's not even that scary, especially in retrospect. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that the "twist" isn't exactly a new one. Johnny Depp does an alright job, at least, and the movie has some funny moments, but overall it's not worth catching.   On the plus side, the movie did bring up an interesting legal question: is it still a violation of copyright law if the person accusing you of stealing their work is actually a subconscious delusional state manifested from repressed anger and traumatic memories? And would said phantom personality need separate counsel?  That's my report from yesterday. Oh, and the Hotel del Coronado is a very nice place. Went there with the 'rents and enjoyed the beach, which is much cleaner and less crowded than, say, Pacific Beach.   Today is unfortunately a day for the library, as I have to finish my cite-checking AND prepare a 10-minute presentation for Public Interest class. For Monday. Stupid class.

      Tonight I bowled a 144 and a 167. Possibly my best bowling outing yet, in terms of score. Perhaps that's because I didn't play that always ill-advised third game, which usually goes poorly because my hand starts getting sore.  The Flamingos "I Only Have Eyes For You" is one of my favorite love songs, but I've only just now gotten around to downloa... er, acquiring it. Yeah, that's the ticket.   It's all here--fast-kicking, low scoring, and ties?  You bet!  Punchy, 2 Hours of Sleep in the Last 48 Blog Post: Finished. Goodnight!

      In the grand tradition of not being Irish, but having no suitable national origin holidays related to my Euro-mutt heritage (Bastille Day? Maybe V-E Day?), I got pretty funky with my bad self last night.  First was Typhoon Saloon, with my harem of women (Hilary, Virginia, Jaime, Kelly, and Dana), none of whom I'm actually dating. So maybe harem is the wrong word, but either way I felt like either a pimp or, possibly, gay. It was fun but we started around happy hour, so it wasn't terribly crowded. Then we stopped by a very nice oceanfront apartment and chilled there until after 10, when we went to what I believe is the only Irish bar in Pacific Beach.   Long (and uninteresting for almost everyone who reads this) story short, I felt like the backseat floor of a taxicab this morning. Fortunately I didn't go all out nuts and so am not fully sick, and at this point (noon), I'm back to about 95% functional capacity.   Parents are coming in tomorrow! That will be fun, they can see my apartment (no longer new to me, but since I've had 0 visitors since I moved it's new to you!). I think they're also planning on visiting the aquarium, going for a boat ride on the bay, and perhaps buying me dinner a couple times. Should be a productive weekend!

      Last night, in the alternate universe accessible only via sleep, I was hanging out with John Kerry's campaign staff at my grandmother's house in Port Huron. Mel Gibson stopped by, and he was such a hit with everyone that Kerry began wondering out loud whether a Kerry/Gibson ticket was the right solution to the VP question. Every mumbled under their breath about Gibson "not being a Democrat" and such, and my mom (who was apparently working for the campaign) got up and asked me what I thought.  Before I could stop that train wreck, however, I woke up. So now, because I didn't speak up fast enough, some other dimension will be seeing a Kerry/Gibson ticket take on the Prez. Of course, perhaps in that world the President is Demond " urlLink Lamont Sanford " Wilson.   Now, I must return my attention to Dawson's Creek. Teenage angst is always fun. And Katie Holmes is hot as hell. Hooray for Spreak!

      It is Spring Break (or as I like to call it, "Spreak!") but today I will probably need to spend some significant time in the library. I don't really want to have to go at the end of the week, when my parents pop into town, or even tomorrow, if it can be avoided.   The weather continues to be weakly nice, and thus I'm not going to waste time going to the beach (because it's  cold  down there). It's sort of a shame, but then I remember that if I'm here all summer (odds are quite good now) I'll have no shortage of absolutely beautiful beach days.   Watched  urlLink XXX  the other night, and it wasn't half bad. I went into it with low expectations, but despite parts that were just laugh-out-loud silly, it was much more entertaining than  urlLink Windtalkers  (which I watched sometime last week). Made me want a cool tattoo, at least for a little while. Then I realized that perhaps cool tattoos are not the only thing keeping me from being like Vin Diesel - having arms the size of my thighs being a major secondary component.   No go on the bald head, though. Yikes!

      It's the in thing to do, and a good test of how many "interesting" things you can think of about yourself. So without further ado, I present to you  urlLink 100 weird ass things about me .  Yesterday: uneventful.  Today: Went to the beach, where unlike  everywhere else in San Diego , the clouds were in full effect. I watched Hilary and her friend attempt to surf, which was amusing and made me think maybe it IS within my realm of possible abilities.  And now? Sopranos!

      Well yesterday was just a big mess of a day. Not a terribly succesful start to Spring Break, as the weather was crappy and the day was crappier.  Today may be better, the sun is out so that's already an improvement. I was hoping to grab a game or two at Best Buy, but it doesn't look like there's anything even remotely entertaining out yet.  urlLink Unreal Tournament 2004  is coming out later this week, but by then I may have procrastinated on my law review stuff to the point where I don't have time to play again. That's just the way it goes, I suppose. I've logged about 80 hours in  urlLink Knights of the Old Republic , since Christmas, and that's impressive. Best game I've played since  urlLink Vice City , I think.  Geek post finished! I cranked out a "100 Things" as well, as was requested by  urlLink some , but I'll post that on Sunday night or Monday. Don't want all that hard listing work to just get  buried on the weekend!

      Spring Break is here! I've abandoned the library under the moderately sound excuse that I will have plenty of time NEXT week to cite check. We'll see how true that turns out to be...  In the meantime, how about  urlLink five ?   1. What was the last song you heard?  In my head? "Last Dance" by Donna Summer. Not my fault though, it's  urlLink Marek's . As actual sound, it was "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen, on the way to school this morning. Good driving song.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?  I watched "Windtalkers" the other night (not remotely good) and... I guess the last full movie before that was Cold Mountain a week or so ago.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Well, that'd be pizza, adhesive wall hooks, and the previously-mentioned arm-enhancing shirts.   4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Nothing! There is no weekend, the is only Zuul. Since I've got Spring Break, my weekend is approximately 9 days long. In that time I will, however, do laundry, cite-check, read for Legislation and Employment Discrimination, and go to the beach, weather permitting.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  Marek, Hilary, Lisa K., Melanie, and Lisa S. I only counted actual talking, not email or instant messenger. Otherwise there'd be a substantial shift in the lineup.

      I woke up, sort of startled, at 6 a.m. because of some weird dream I'd had. Something about working in a law firm that, oddly, also had 2 or 3 of my friends working there as well. I don't remember what happened, but for the second time in a week I was furious with someone (it doesn't matter who, it was a dream) and couldn't get back to sleep because of it.   Anybody else ever get that? Wake up angry at someone because of something they did in a dream? Besides Phoebe on that episode of friends (note to my little sister: that's pronounced "Fee-Bee" not "Poe-Heb"), I don't hear of it happening very often. Maybe it's my subconscious way of letting of steam without actually doing it in real life. I haven't gotten angry at somebody - in person, at least - in quite awhile now. Temper overflow valve need tightening?  In other news, read and enjoy  urlLink this sub-headline  at the Post. I'm just amused by the the irony capable of being created by the English language. And yes, I know that they mean to prevent  further  violence. Newspapers are fun.  Don't  enjoy  urlLink terrorist bombings in Spain , that's a shame. I guess now we know what an attack on a commuter train system would look like.   Spending most of the day doing cite-checking in the library today, so perhaps another update will follow. Or perhaps I will tire of this blog thing once and for all, and just dive into the world of illegitimate Internet auctions. That's where the money is!

      I never look good on Wednesdays. Granted, I have a limited palette with which to compose, but sometimes it seems to come together nicely and I don't look to bad.   Wednesday, though, is the Moriarity to my fashionably-challenged Holmes. Thwarting me at every turn, Hump Day makes innocuous dress (jeans and a t-shirt) lame and messes up what is normally a fairly easy-to-manage hairstyle. To top it all off, I spend the most time in class on Wednesdays and thus should, objectively, be looking my best. Tuesdays and Fridays I have one early class and that's it, but I inevitably find myself looking better on those days of low exposure than on days like today, when I see everybody and their brother.  Just to keep up the narcissistic theme, I bought undershirts in Target yesterday (wait there's more) and it turned out they were the sleeveless kind, like wifebeaters but not white. Gray and black, I think. At first I was disappointed, because I don't wear those (just out of habit) but I tried on the black one and MAN does it make my arms look good. I mean, there's no way I'll be wearing it out in public (muscles may exist in some basic form, but a tan does not) but my mind is now running through the various scenarios in which I could wear it under something but be forced to remove my outer layer, for some previously contrived reason. Preferably in the presence of some hot girls.   That's enough egotism for one blog. Tomorrow I promise a return to the "Why I Suck and Nobody Likes Me" genre of posting.

      Heterosexual men and women can't be best friends for very long, and here's why: eventually one or both friends will look either inward (at the friendship) or outward (at another person) to find more. To find, basically, the same qualities that you have in your opposite-sex best friend, only in a person that you can sleep with.   You will notice I did say "best friends" and I did that for an important reason. I'm a huge fan of cross-gender friendships, and in fact generally have many more female than male friends. I think having friends of the opposite sex can sometimes be more rewarding, because they give you insight into a thought process that is, at times, highly unlike your own. But you can never get too close, because the complexities of the female/male relationship make it much more susceptible to jealousy and bitterness than most same-sex relationships (and I'm not talking about gay relationships, I mean friendships). With anyone you get along with, to some degree, there will always be that question in the back of your mind that asks "what if...?" In many cases, this question is answered with a truly humorous imaginary relationship that is so awkward and so improbable that it immediately becomes a non-issue. But even if answered with confidence, the question still remains, tucked away, ready to jump out and create conflict when you least expect it.   This is not an autobiographical post in the slightest. I mean, it is to the extent that I have friends, but I am lucky enough to be (at least currently) avoiding the pitfalls described above. Hell, I even have a female best friend, but I'm not so naive to think that it will last forever. Perhaps that's the best way of looking at friendships in general. Everybody changes, and just because my female friends have one extra reason to grow apart from me (i.e. they meet a guy who draws them away) that doesn't mean it won't happen to me and my boys. But if you roll with those changes, if you embrace them as they occur and don't expect people to stay locked in a "personality stasis," then you will end up living a happier life, as far as your relationships are concerned.  Just one man's opinion, of course. But he has a blog so it must be valuable!

      I just cut my finger open on my Bluebook. Normally I'd take that as a sign from God that I should stop or start doing something, but I just can't square receiving subtle messages from the Creator with the extravagantly beautiful weather we're having (i.e. why would God need to cut my finger when it's clear He is capable of much more obvious displays of power), so I'm going to chalk it up to my own personal clumsiness and move on.  Althought I should be cite-checking. Maybe that's the intended message. One thing I've learned from all this Law Review crap is that while it may be very easy to use newspaper articles as resources for a for-publication paper, it's very very very hard to cite-check them. Who cites the Broward Business News Journal, anyhow? How am I supposed to get a copy of that? Bah, to hell with this!  The weekend was good, overall. Uneventful for the most part, as I spent a good portion of Saturday and Sunday pretending to work on papers but not really doing anything. Friday night was a party in Pacific Beach, albeit briefly attended and quickly abandoned in favor of appetizers and better conversation at Denny's. Sunday night was Thai for dinner followed by a not-remotely-legal race home to catch the Sopranos. Which brings us to today, Monday, scourge of the week and destoyer of morale!

      Because I'm continually amazed by excellent weather, so shall my blog reflect that. It matters not that I'm an idiot, and of course the weather is amazing.   Today is simply spectacular. It's made better by the recent spate of underwhelming temperatures, rain, wind and cold - things that rarely pop up in San Diego. Today the air is warm, the sun is shining, and... even the smell is like summer. I don't know how to describe it better than that, but that's what the air smells like. Summer.   I wonder if it's a big cosmic coincidence, or merely an adaptation, that right about the time I start getting fed up with the cold weather, the cold weather changes. And in September/October (well, November here in San Diego), right about the time I'm getting tired of broiling, the hot weather recedes. Are we hard-wired to only put up with so much before longing for a change in season? Or have we instinctually adjusted to wish only for what is imminent?  Spring Break's in a week. That's nice but ultimately useless, as I have nowhere to go and no money to spend to get there. Maybe a day trip up the coast is in order.

      I really have to thank ConLaw, and in particular Prof. Smith, for providing the inspiration for so many of these posts. On to today's!  It was offered in today's class that in landmark decisions by the Supreme Court, perhaps the goal of the justices is not to set legal precedent, but rather to provide a calming influence over the culture wars in general. Thus decisions like 2003's Lawrence v. Texas are less about striking down untenable laws like sodomy, and more about injecting a conciliatory decision into the public discourse. The problem, as noted by Prof. Smith, is that because these decisions rely mostly on decrying animus, they may do more to fracture society than to heal it.  Such decisions are often wanting for strong legal arguments, so the Court (especially in Lawrence) uses an alternative argument which says those who support such laws do so for immoral and unjust reasons. Any "legitimate" reasons for such laws are pretextual in nature and, at the end of the day, the only reason to have them is to discriminate against a politically unpopular class of people.  While this is an interesting argument, it relies on a proposition that I'm not sure I totally agree with. That proposition is that society is more fractured and polarized than ever before - hence the Court must exert a stabilizing influence to keep the polarization from completely tearing us apart. But are people really more ideologically separate than earlier in the nation's history? I think you can only go back as far as the industrial revolution to be fair, but were the 60's really easier than now? Is there a wider gulf separating progressive and conservative, Democrat and Republican, than ever before? I abstain from an opinion, simply because I don't feel like I know enough (nor have I lived long enough) to make a judgment on earlier eras - namely the early 20th century and the 1960's. It certainly  feels  like people are angrier and more vicious today, but is that because they are or because the media lets us see it more clearly?  In completely separate news, only one more week until Spring Break! Not that I'm going anywhere, but it will be nice to have some time off. I should probably work on some papers (since I have four), and if I can stay away from Best Buy's computer game department, I will. I hope nothing cool comes out soon, though...

      Well it's all about Kerry v. Bush, isn't it? The field has narrowed, the combatants named (mostly - no VP candidate yet...) and the stage is set for what will probably turn into a knock-down drag-out fight 'till November.  My thoughts (because, well, it's my blog)? I'm satisfied with Kerry. The more I consider the alternatives, the more I think it's the best matchup we can hope for, and probably the best chance of beating GWB. Edwards, god bless 'im, has plenty of time left to be President someday. Dean was, for me, too angry and too abrasive. He wouldn't have appealed to that wide swath of America that thinks presidential candidates should be boring and kind and kiss babies. Kucinich obviously didn't see the "You Must Be This Tall To Ride" sign outside the Whitehouse. Clark, that was just a silly idea. Also, as much as I respect all the alternative candidates' opinions, they just weren't pragmatic enough to appeal to a wide margin of voters.  So now we have Kerry, and the early anti-Kerry portrait is that he's a waffler, he changes his mind a lot. To me, this is a non-issue, because smart people change their minds. People who are idealogues and zealots have purity of focus, but intelligent people can be persuaded to consider alternative actions. I'm not saying that's why Kerry flip-flops, but to me it's not important. What's more important is that has the right ideas on a number of key issues. He opposes the death penalty, which I was shocked to hear. Edwards doesn't, which is unsurprising from a southerner, but Kerry's vocalized opposition was news to me. Good for him!  In conclusion, why not Kerry? He's the most presidential of the original nine, and while he may not be my perfect candidate (no member of  urlLink Skull & Bones  is) I think he's got a good chance of beating the guy currently holding office. And that's my number one goal for this election.

      Happy not-February everyone! The shortest month of the year always seems like the longest to me, I'm not really sure why. Valentine's Day, a plethora of birthdays, and more due dates than you can shake a stick at are possible causes. Another is that it's just not a very nice month, weather-wise, in San Diego. It's been rainy, chilly (I've learned not to say "cold" around east coast types anymore, lest I be berated for my insolence) and altogether unresort-like.   I'm in the midst of finishing off my Comment draft, so this will be a short post. Also because I've already reported my biggest news from the weekend, and other than that I've got nothing going on.   Oh, obligatory Oscar note: unsurprising, but fairly decent decisions this year. I'm glad LOTR got the props it deserved, even if there were no acting nominations (boo!). I still think (especially having now seen her performance) that Renee Zellweger's Cold Mountain performance is overrated. Not that she wasn't great - she was - but rather that the other actresses in that category were more deserving of an Oscar, and frankly Renee will probably win another couple (if not more) in her lifetime. Could we say the same about the other nominees (Diane Keaton notwithstanding)?  Now I'm really done.

      Classes are over for the semester.  The final resounding thump to my skull was administered by Constitutional Law, which featured one of our most lively debates of the year on the question of religion in schools. More specifically, on Evolution vs. Creationism. Although that's not really want I'm going to write about today, I will note that I was a bit taken aback by the number of people that seemed willing to thrown Evolutionary Theory to the wolves just for the sake of not having to deal with Creationism (i.e. "why teach any of it at all?").   So, religion. I've mentioned it before, I believe, but I'm too lazy to go back and find the post and reference it here. Today's class made me wonder: is an organized religion necessary? Is it just a pretext for assigning weight to human rights and morals that we want to live by? Or does it have some deeper purpose, does it legitimately fill a human need that is unfillable by any other means?  I grew up in an observant but not intensely devout Catholic family. It has always seemed to me, however, that the day-to-day activities of going to church, praying before meals, and otherwise being tepidly religious obscures the real purpose. If God exists, then (note: I just picked a pronoun, it happens to be male) He's extraordinarily powerful, probably omnipotent, and probably couldn't give a rat's ass what we individuals do here on Earth. Sure, if He's benevolent then He probably thinks it's best we don't go around knocking each other upside the head and running over puppies. But prayer is certainly not going to change anything, since God has no reason at all to randomly intervene in some lives but not others.  All that leads me to believe that God, whom I do believe exists in some form, would rather we figure things out for ourselves. Find inner strength, depend on friends and family, but for His sake don't look to the heavens for some kind of Divine Inspiration. Perhaps God really is just a tool to explain the unexplained and reason with the unknown. Maybe He exists to give us more self-confidence, to lend credence to inspirations that are wholly human in origin, but seem so insightful that we must attribute them to a greater omnipotent force.   On the other hand, I also sort of believe in demons, evil, and exorcisms, and how that fits in to the idea of God as a benevolent and all-powerful force, I'm not sure. Maybe that's my own need to believe in something unexplained, since in most other aspects I'm a fairly concrete I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it kind of guy. Or maybe I just watch too much TV.

      More minor changes to the blog, mostly on the nav bar over yonder. I got tired of my naming scheme and just gave everyone their proper titles. Well, almost everyone - I feel the need to explain my  urlLink father  (and because the word "coot" makes me shudder) and  urlLink some people's  change so often that I'm just winging it.   My class schedule is set for next semester, I'll be in Corporations, Intellectual Property Seminar, and probably Administrative Law (or perhaps Wills & Trusts, but only if I get up the energy to make a change). That'll be 10 credits, leaving me with only 8 to fill for graduation in 2005 (May 28th, you're all invited).   The laptop is acting quirky, and it makes me concerned. Not quirky-locking-up-all-the-time, but quirky-the-fan-never-goes-off-during-Tax. I've always hated the cooling system on this thing, since the normal fan is quite loud and the Superfan (when it goes on, you better believe she's getting hot) draws glances from those within earshot. This time, the Superfan (as I used to know it) never came on, but the fan stayed on at a low level the entire time and occasionally revved up to what I may have to label Jet-Engine Fan.   In the end, who cares - it's just a laptop. But I hate thinking I'm bothering people, and boy was this thing annoying in Tax. Let's hope it was just a phase, or something. Other than that, everything seems to be in order.   These "what am I doing today" posts are getting tedious so tomorrow I promise to try and crank out an old school rant or story of some kind. Unless I  urlLink win $1000 , in which case I'm buying stuff and ignoring you people.

      Despite all the aforementioned trouble with shipping, my laptop was returned today and seems to be in tip-top shape. Final score, for those keeping: Sam and Gateway 1 Airborne Express/DHL 0  Now I can again sequester myself in the library like a proper law student, and still check email, update the blog, and otherwise cause havok on the Internet while I pretend to work.   It all starts tomorrow, which is normally my day off but, in a feat of truly oddball scheduling, is a "Monday" as far as classes are concerned. This is officially to make up for the Easter Holiday, but unofficially I think it's to confuse the hell out of faculty and students alike. Either way, I've got a full day ahead of me, starting bright and early with Tax at 9 a.m.  Mad props to Jason for the excellent advice he gave yesterday. It's not every day that somebody comes up with a good idea that I truly hadn't thought of, so he gets loads of credit for that. I guess I'll go to his little "wedding" after all.  End communication!

      I just picked up my mail, and to my curiosity there was an envelope from AT&T that contained a check. I could tell because they cleverly positioned it so that "Pay to the Order of" was visible above my name through the envelope window (envelindow? envewindow? someone let me know...).  So I open the envelope (Hurdle 1 - Get Them to Open It - goes to AT&T) and pull out the junk. It's a $30 check made out to me. Now, I've received money from American Telephone & Telegraph before, after they overcharged me for long distance last year, and this is the same type of check. In bold but small lettering near the top, however, it says:    Signing and cashing of this check and independent verifier confirmation will switch your long distance, local toll, and local services to AT&T.   Now, I'm not on the board of the Better Business Bureau, but it seems to me that sending people checks and then switching ALL their phone services to AT&T when those checks are cashed is beyond the pale of shady business practices. Would my DSL line cut out? What does SBC think about this? Is there a check from them in my mail tomorrow?  AT&T, you're on The List. Right under DHL, which as of 4:10 has not yet found the time to swing by and GIVE ME MY F!@%ING COMPUTER BACK. On the plus side, I'm well into the second half of my Legislation paper and I think it might not suck. And by not suck, I mean it's "acceptable".

      Here's the thing about having packages delivered: they don't do enough to meet the needs of the non-office-based public.   My computer has been floating around DHL's San Diego warehouse for 3 days now, but they refuse to deliver it at a time when I'm home. Yesterday (Attempt One) I was out all day, and don't blame them for that. But today, I was out for  one goddamn hour  and they choose to "attempt" delivery then. Not only that, but even though I called to request a re-attempt at 10 a.m. (giving them  7 hours  in the business day to try again) I was told that it was "unlikely they'd be able to stop by again today." They only have SEVEN HOURS to try.   What does this mean? Either I sign for it and my laptop sits outside my damn apartment all day tomorrow, or they send it back to Gateway. Seems to me that either way I have a good chance of never seeing it again. My only hope is that the delivery guy "feels like" stopping by again today while I sit at home, unable to go out for even a moment. God damn them.

      1. My Law Review Comment was deemed "acceptable" by the Board. The Board on which I now sit (except I don't read Comments). That could have been embarassing. Acceptable simply means I don't suck bad enough to do it again - it has nothing to do with publishability. That's okay, since it's not really for publication anyhow.  2. Gateway has already shipped my computer back. Unfortunately Airborne Express has some silly ideas about "leaving" computers that are worth "lots of money" in front of my door all day, so I didn't actually get it back. Tomorrow I will be home all day working on (finishing! really!) my Legislation paper which is 25% complete as of now. Frame of Reference: what I currently have took about 2 hours, and that included start-up time. Ain't no thang!  Heat: It's mighty hot here today. I've been praying for the heat to return, as I am fully ready and accepting of summertime, but it has been chintzy with the warmth this month. Today: 85 degrees, which in San Diego is thermometer-busting.   I know, you all waited breathlessly since Saturday for  this ? But alas, there's not much more to divulge at this juncture. 'Tis the last week of class, my Five Final Freakshow starts next week, and things are otherwise quiet. A little TOO quiet... I will promise big things to come in the next few weeks however. Stuff that's been cooking is finally done and perhaps ready to be released upon the world. Not until I'm/it's ready, though.

      It's not often that I get to point to a winning Detroit sports team (Redwings aside), so I'd just like to take this opportunity to do a quick round-up for you all.  The Redwings are 1-1 in the semifinals. They  urlLink beat the Flames  today to tie the series. There's no reason they shouldn't win this series handily.  The Pistons are still going strong and  urlLink today beat Milwaukee  to take the lead in their series, 2-1. I know little about basketball, but it warms the heart to see them win.   And of course, the Tigers are still shocking the hell out of everyone by remaining well above .500 with an 11-7 record. Today, they pulled out a 9th-inning  urlLink win against Cleveland.  Yesterday, they smacked the Indians around like little girls, beating them  urlLink 17-3 .  The Lions are doing the other, above-average Detroit teams a favor by not playing any football games right now. They did draft a fairly competent wide-receiver this morning, and Kevin Jones (a Virginia Tech running back), but I hold out no hope until I see them play.  There you have it! For all your Detroit sports news, it's KBILLY, home of rock.

      Background: In ConLaw today, we learned that most of the strength behind the separation of church and state comes from  Everson v. Board of Education , which in turn bases modern religion/government interaction on a series of events that occurred in Virginia 200 years ago. In short, Virginia was a trailblazer at the time, being the first state to erect a real, meaningful wall between church and state operations. Although I felt a momentary bit of pride -- it's not every day that my home state is brought up in a California law school class -- I also realized it was probably the most progressive thing Virginia ever did. And it was centuries ago.  Today, Virginia is like a host of other states that have unique geographic divisions that are reflected onto the psyche of the populous. California has its North vs. South debate (which is really San Francisco vs. Los Angeles), and it also seems to have a Coast vs. Inland thing. I haven't been here long enough to figure out that second one. New York has its NYC vs. Everywhere Else, even Michigan has a Upper vs. Lower Peninsula thing. Not to be left out, Virginia has Northern Virginia vs. The Rest of the State.  Virginia, when you mention to people who aren't from the east coast, is often imagined much like Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina. This may be because of Virginia's rich history as the preeminent southern state -- after all, it was the seat of the Confederacy. But nobody from the D.C. area looks at Virginia this way, because the D.C. area is metropolitan.   I went to school in southwest Virginia, however, and I can tell you that the rest of Virginia harbors a deep resentment towards NoVA. Justified to some degree because NoVA receives the bulk of any funding (though they also pay most of the taxes, but hey), the resentment is mutual because of the aforementioned "image problem" that Virginia has. In the end, the northerners hate the southerners because they make the country think we're bumpkins. The southerners hate the northerners because most Virginians ARE hicks, and their tax money usually goes to NoVA.   Personally, I like both sides. I like the low bar that people set when they hear that I was born in Virginia, because it gives me a chance to detect any perceived stereotypes in those that I meet. But I also like being from a metropolis that rivals the greatest cities in the world. Perhaps that makes me less apologetic about my status as a Virginian, but my lack of embarrassment may also stem from the fact that I don't assign much weight to a person's state of origin.   But that's a post for another day.

      I'm a pretty cynical guy, in some ways. Also have a strong pessimistic streak and am quite self-deprecating, but lets just stick with the cynicism for now.   The stuff that I hate is, for the most part, lame stuff. I know that's subjective, but even the most ardent TV watchers will probably grudgingly agree that "The Swan" is just wretched television. But for just a moment, I'd like to decynicize (not a word!) and mention some things.  Everybody hates bad drivers. Bad drivers are everywhere, they have their heads in their asses and resoundly suck. But you know what? When YOU'RE on the phone, or jabbering away with a friend, and driving - you're the bad driver. You make the mistake of being in the wrong lane to turn, or not going the speed limit. So lighten up a little, okay? The world is not going to hell just because somebody cut you off.   Some TV shows are enjoyed by many and rejected by a few. American Idol, for instance, is a Bad Show because it's pointless and has so little to do with actual music that it makes me weep. That doesn't mean it should be banned from air, though, because plenty of people like it. I enjoy the show Friends on ocassion, and actually think some of the episodes are laugh-out-loud funny. You can decry the popularity of Friends as the downfall of society, but I know funny and sometimes that show is damn funny.   I could go on, but my point is (sort of) made. Everybody should give everybody a break. I see alot of venom being spewed on blogs, especially (not any specific blogs, just the general blogging public), so perhaps it's just a way to vent. Lord knows I vent all the time - but I don't hold those who enjoy the lamer things in life in any less esteem. Everyone has their guilty pleasures, and accepting that doesn't mean you can't criticize and feel differently.   Except for anybody who likes Insane Clown Posse. You people DO suck.

      I have a warning to issue for the Internet community: if you have a computer, and you want it to keep work, please do not come near me. The computers are revolting against me, one by one.  First, my laptop died. As was documented last week in this blog. I've grudgingly accepted my fate as a pen-and-paper guy for the next few weeks while my laptop is in Irving, TX being poked with bamboo by semi-intelligent rabbits. I mean, I assume.   But last night, poor Hilary's computer crapped out too. I headed over at about 6:30 and, well, I got home at 11:30. It was a bad scene (not being at Hilary's - that's always fun - but rather the computer). First a driver had crashed, because of a memory leak. But in conjunction with that, or perhaps even as a secondary effect (the jury's still out) her entire hard drive got fuxored beyond belief. In fixing (or attempting to fix) the computer, I learned how to use the vaunted "Recovery Console" in Windows XP, which is a last-resort, if-you're-here-you-better-start-praying way to fix things.  Hilary's computer, unfortunately, was so far gone that  even the Recovery Console  was messed up. For those of you unfamiliar with computers in general or the RC specifically, this is like going to the auto mechanic and watching all his tools disintegrate when he tries to use them on your car.  In the end, nothing short of a complete reinstall  with a format  would suffice to bring it back into useable condition. This was considered by the team (Hilary and I) to be a Necessary Evil that, in the end, would be okay because she had just backed up all her notes and papers and stuff. So we formatted.   It was only after complete reinstallation of WinXP that we popped in her backup cd and found out that of all the absolute pisser luck, her notes were corrupted on the disc and inaccessible. Gone!   In the end, it will be okay (which I tried to convey to Hil) because the rest of us have notes she can borrow, and she has notes from before her last backup (Jan-Feb). But I can't help but feel bad, even though by most accounts this was really the perfect storm of computer failures. Not one (a simple driver problem) or two (and a harddrive failure) but THREE (why not corrupt a CD-RW?) things, all in one day.  I'm going to become a Luddite. A member of the Resistance, fighting against the machines. As soon as I finish posting on this blog, checking my email, and playing a bit of SuperCollapse.  --- ps. In redesign news, I've altered the width so that you goobers with 800x600 should see the whole page, among other things. Holla back if it didn't work or you have some other lame-o problem.

      Hey, new format. Found it on a cool  urlLink blog skin website . Blogger has been pretty skimpy in what they offer, and J's recent layout changes inspired me to go looking for a new theme.  Since it's not Blogger-based, it has taken a wee bit more tinkering to work correctly, so I'd like some comments if you see something weird/bad/incorrect. I know the ad at the top is partially covered, but beyond that goofiness, what else is weird/no good?  I like trees!

      Well it's registration time again. For school. Always entertaining to try and figure out what classes to take - but this time I've got oodles of freedom. Why, you ask? (You did! You asked!) Because summer school frees me up to take almost anything!  Since I will most likely be taking Criminal Procedure and Professional Responsibility (haha!) this summer, I can go part-time during my 3rd year and thus save a boatload on tuition. Well, "boatload" is only about $9500, and by going to summer school I'm taking out almost as much in loans, but hey! It will make my 3rd year a little easier, which is good considering that I'll be trying to find a job and be a competent Executive Editor for Law Review. Special note to any concerned parents: going "part time" is not like going part-time as an undergrad. It's purely a financial move made possibly by taking extra classes during summer. I'm not being lazy. I mean, no more than usual.  Meanwhile, this year is winding down quickly. Two weeks of classes left (including this one) and then my monstrously horrible Finals schedule begins. I'm feeling good though - there's no reason I shouldn't do just fine with my many, many tests. And summer is looking to be both productive and a lot of fun.   So there's hope that someday, I might actually have something interesting to write about!

      Ain't nothin finer on a Sunday afternoon than a little Swayze/Elliott fisticuff action.  urlLink Road House  - quite possibly a modern-day masterpiece of cliched storytelling - never fails to delight as a source of completely unintentional humor. The movie features Patrick Swayze in his prime as a bouncer (I'm sorry, a "cooler") with a heart of gold and a penchant for reading philosophy. The entire script is peppered with amazing nuggets of wisdom, including the three tenets of proper bouncing: "One, never underestimate your opponent. Expect the unexpected. Two, take it outside. Never start anything inside the bar unless it's absolutely necessary. And three, be nice." (Wait isn't that five things?)  Also Swayze's ass makes quite a few appearances, for you ladies (or gay men) - at least if you catch the movie on cable. Fortunately I'm lucky to be watching it on TNT, which removes such truly objectionable elements lest they batter and wound my delicate sensibilities. It does still feature: - the anti-Swayze character (complete with dark hair and excessive man jewelry) - the line "Nobody wins a fight," spoken by  a bouncer.  - the secretly hot female doctor who just can't resist a philosophy major who beats the daylights out of people - Sam Elliott, who is pretty much the coolest guy ever. - a bad guy with two first names (Brad Wesley) - a truly bizarre last line: "Polar bear fell on me."  I think I've mentioned movies on an above-average basis lately, so this will be the last time I opine on the subject for awhile. Unless I see  urlLink Kill Bill, Vol. 2 , in which case I reserve the right to trash/praise it as warranted.

      1. Go out the night before and sleep poorly at a friend's place.  2. Wake up extra early because her living room gets as bright as a solar flare in the morning.  3. Decide to try and watch " urlLink Solaris " on cable - possibly one of the most tedious movies ever crafted.  4. Attempt to watch above movie from bed, while it's dark and rainy outside.  ...et voila, you have complete unconsciousness! For added effect, put on sweatpants and take your contacts out - I guarantee a 3-hour nap, minimum. I was so deeply asleep that people called and left messages on my machine and I didn't even BEGIN to wake up. And my phone is  right there.   Now the question becomes: can I get enough energy up to actual to something productive tonight? It's already 7pm, but something tells me I'll have plenty of energy. Perhaps the absence of 4 beers and 3 jello shooters will keep me lucid as well. That's about all I'm saying about last night - well except for mad props to  urlLink Marek , who came BACK to the bar after I got there, even though he was practically dead on his feet, because he's just that cool a guy.

      I find  urlLink this story  a little bit alarming. Actually, I find it more exciting than alarming, but that's because I've never been in an earthquake before, and the odds are that my little 2-story apartment building would be okay.  Perhaps I should buy Quake Insurance. Then if I get fragged by someone with an RL, I'll just get the quad and grenade their ass to kingdom come. If you know what I mean.

      Well this page has been loaded and reloaded 10,000 times now, and although I count unique views with more value (currently 6,620 and climbing) I figured it was worth pointing out.  Unfortunately for you, dear readers, that's about all I've got to report today. My laptop is on its way back to Gateway for retrofitting - I'm hoping for a slick racing stripe and the ability to travel through time, but if they make it work I'll be satisfied. Hopefully I'll even get it back, in top shape, before finals start up. In the meantime I'm building my writing muscles up again by taking actual  hand-written notes  in class.  I'll be going now. Fun episodes of Buffy are on the telly.

      Part of the problem with a broken computer (yes, it's officially broken and will be sent to Gateway for repairs) is that I can't really blog during the day. I'm on campus from 9-5 most days, and I'm not about to sit in the computer lab and blog. Most of the time I can't think of anything to write anyhow, and there's no way it'd flow while surrounded by neurotic law students.  So instead, you all get nighttime updates which will cleverly masquerade as "new" (since nobody reads this thing after about 7 or 8 p.m).  Today's Topic:  Things I Will Do Again Someday  (when Law School is over)  1. Play the piano, and play it well. This may require taking actual lessons, which I'm prepared to do.  2. Row, in an actual boat. The  urlLink ERG  doesn't really capture the experience of being on the water.  3. Sail. This is similar to #2, and although someday I'd like my own boat, for now I'd just settle for sailing, period.  4. Go on a proper  urlLink vacation , one that lasts longer than 2 days and is to a place other than my parents' houses. Not that their houses aren't nice, but I mean a  real  vacation.  5. Live in a place where I can wash my clothes without going outside first.  6. Start learning to play guitar again. Actually this may drop off, if #1 has its way. Which it might.  7. Stop making stupid lists that merely reflect a failure to properly budget my time.

      Lat night I had what was probably the most intense dream I've had in years. It was, unfortunately, a bad dream about bad things (or "nightmare" as I like to call it) that I won't go into because it's unimportant and, well, still sort of painful to think about. Seriously, it was  that  powerful. Instead of feeling detached and noncorporeal, I was very much involved and walking around in the dream world. It was like a lucid dream, except without the ability to control what happens. Which mean that it was like life, except with really bad shit happening.  When I burst awake, sweating and possibly more awake than I've been in weeks, it was only 3:30 in the morning. Since I couldn't call the people involved in the dream (they were asleep like most of the free world) I basically tossed and turned and got about 17 minutes of sleep over the next four hours.   There's really no point to this post except to share how horrifying that dream was. Just imagine the worst dream you can remember - the one that woke you up in a cold sweat, or that woke you up crying, and that's what it was. Let's not have THAT again, okay?

      Yesterday my laptop blue-screened in a very alarming way, but after rebooting herself under her own recognizance, she worked fine in the library for 3 or 4 hours. When I got home, I backed up everything important onto CD, and as soon as I was done the damn thing started freezing. During startup, 2 minutes after startup, 30 seconds after startup - she just wouldn't work.   Now, I'm fairly proficient when it comes to solving most of your everyday computer malfunctions. Laptops are more difficult because you can't crack 'em open as easily. Laptops that simply freeze up - those are my white whale. Because what can you diagnose? "Uh. It just stops." She's not crashing or blue screening (anymore - and that first one was a very scary relative of the less-scary Blue Screen Of Death that most Windows users have experienced) it just freezes completely.   Today, of course, it hasn't frozen at all. Perhaps this is because she knows I emailed Gateway and am about 24 hours from sending her back to get a completely new something-or-other. But this is absolutely the wrong time for such malfunctions, since I have FIVE finals to take and would really like to use my laptop. What's more, I really need a functioning laptop because if the damn thing crashes during a final, it's like the apocalypse.   Marek had this problem and it meant his harddrive was failing. I would rather that wasn't the case. But repair is difficult to consider, now that I'm in that gray area of time before finals. It's like when you're just far enough away from a light turning yellow and you hesitate for a few seconds too long, and you end up having to speed up or slam on the brakes. I'll either have to rush job fix this, or not use it at all during finals.   Because I needed more on my mind right now. Stupid technology.

      Easter Break is winding down (Day 5 of 5!) and from this point out it's all about studying for finals. And doing law review crap, of course. That never ends.   The weekend was uneventful for the most part. Tried to get some work done, but failed for the most part. Had Easter dinner/lunch with Hilary's professor-friend, thus making it a tradition to go there on major holidays (Thanksgiving was the first time 'round). He and his wife are very nice folk, so it was quite enjoyable. And now I've had artichoke, which is something new. Can't say I'll be actively seeking it out in the future, but it was an interesting experience.  Finally jump-started my Netflix account again (I'd had the same damn movies for ages) but " urlLink Reign of Fire " was not terribly good. Better than complete crap, sure, but otherwise unremarkable. It will be interesting to see Christian Bale as Batman in the next movie; boy's got some acting chops.   And now I'm in the library, about to attempt some cite-checking. Crazy days, my friends. Crazy days.

      Between watching episodes of " urlLink I Want a Famous Face " on MTV and " urlLink The Swan " on FOX, I'm fairly certain I've lost all my respect for humanity.   The first show's premise is "Hey look at these complete numbnut kids we've found, let's document their horrific journey to make themselves look like a celebrity!" If that goal were accomplished through mere warddrobe and make-up alterations (wasn't there a similarly-premised show on MTV a while back?) it would just be fluff TV. Instead, these vacuum-brained people actually go through thousands of dollars of cosmetic surgery, getting implants and suctions and various other procedures. In the end, they look  nothing like the celebrity  they idolize. If I were famous, I would pay these people NOT to look like me.  The Swan's premise, from what I've seen, is that ugly people suck and are often so ugly that not even copious amounts of training and surgery can change that. Two women enter at the beginning of each episode, and at the end they basically tell one of them "Guess what? You're  still  too ugly to be on this show. Via con dios!" If that isn't a depressingly accurate depiction of our society, I'll move to Canada.   The impetus behind this post was, of course, watching some complete nimrod get huge breasts so that she could pose for Playboy and look more like Pamela Anderson. Nevermind that she was perfectly attractive already. The best part was when Playboy said they weren't really looking for the big-boob thing anymore, but thanks!   Cosmetic surgery is stupid. Unless it's to correct a major physical defect (in which case it's more accurately termed reconstructive surgery, I think) you need to stay the hell away from it. Getting a mole removed or something "lifted" isn't the worst thing in the world, but getting ANYTHING implanted is just plain nuts. Just Say No, kids.

      The Friday Five is lame this week (sad, considering the 2-week hiatus it was just on) so instead, you get my thoughts on dating.  Everyone talks about what they want in a mate. "She has to be as smart as me" or "He has to be confident" et cetera. While it's good to know what you want out of a relationship, the real key (at least in my opinion) is knowing when to drop someone who is NOT living up to your expectations. If you're going to make lists about the perfect mate, especially  urlLink lists that are perfectly reasonable  - shouldn't you actually DEMAND those things when you actually meet a real person? (Editor's Note: the link goes to an example, not a target of this post)  Unfortunately, I think women are the ones who fail to follow through on this claim. Men, for all their many failings, rarely put up with women who don't meet whatever level of performance they've imposed. Women, on the other hand, often mistakenly believe that they can change a person. Putting aside the fact that the only real change in a person must come from within (a blog post for another day), this leaves many women in relationships with guys who don't meet even HALF the "requirements" they would list if asked.  Perhaps it's a self-esteem thing. The "he might be the only one who will put up with me" syndrome that many women (and some men) are afflicted with. And yes, there's also love, which I don't discount. But  true  love will not be found with someone who is sub-par. You may be infatuated with, or simply attracted to someone who is no good, but don't use love as an excuse for staying in a relationship with a complete loser.   The only way men will ever step up and become better men is if they realize that they can no longer behave like bumps on a log and still hang on to their women. When women demand better, men will start getting better, and we'll all win. But if women keep putting up with the shit men give them, men will never change. And men will always have more power in that situation, so it'd also be better for feminism and society if that changed, as well.  Recognize when you're in a bad thing. Recognize it objectively, and get out. Listen to friends and family that you trust to give you an honest opinion. Don't balance unfairly -- "Sure he never takes me out or remembers my birthday, but he bought me flowers once for no reason!" is a good example of poor justification. And don't reward bad behavior by accepting it.

      I forgot to note two things, which I must note because I usually have zero things and would be shirking my blog duties otherwise.  1. I had my first cite-checking dream ever last night. It was brief, but to sum, I thought I was done with a load of cite-checking when in fact it turned out I'd only copied about 1/5 what I had to copy. I was horrified. Also on the menu last night in the land of Nod: a young Carmela Soprano in the shower. That's all I'm saying about that.   2. The Tigers are one of two teams (the other being Anaheim) that are still unbeaten this Spring. At 3-0, that's not saying much, but it's worth noting because a) they'll lose soon and b) my jinx works in reverse, so maybe they won't. Currently they're tied 4-4 at home in Detroit against the Twins. Go  urlLink here  to see the current score and how it ends.

      Technically, our first day off is tomorrow, but savvy readers will note that I don't have Thursday classes and thus, my mini-break began yesterday at 3:45 when Legislation ended.  I'm finding myself tapped for suitable blog entries these days, but I'm not sure why. Yesterday's money discussion wasn't that interesting, nor have any posts that I've written lately. Too distracted by Real Life, perhaps? If that's the case, it's a distraction that isn't even interesting enough to blog about. Writer's Block, thy name is April. Hmm, that's actually a pretty name.  In an ironic (or maybe just sarcastic) smack to the face, yesterday after I got home, and after writing about how money and I have such an easygoing relationship, I got my 2004-2005 loan offer. Normally cause for celebration, as it means I will in fact be allowed to finish Law School, it's also the last major loan I'll have to take out, which means the final damage total is in. It's quite high. And by quite high, I mean I could buy a house in one of the flyover states with the money I've borrowed for "education." I could also buy a really nice boat,  three  really nice cars,  fifteen  moderately priced used cars, or  150  plasma-screen televisions.  Instead, I have a "head full of legal knowledge" which may or may not be leaking (I can't for the life of me remember most of what I learned in Property when asked), a crappy apartment, and some nice experiences which should have been documented by camera more often. And it's not over yet!

      For an as-yet undiscovered reason, I am in a fairly solid financial situation this semester. I haven't really determined why, because even accounting for parental generosity, I'd still be in okay shape.    Note : Okay shape, for those of you who have jobs, means I can pay rent - nothing more. I'm not buying yachts or TVs (or even movies), I'm just not going to have to ask for much, if any, help from the parents this summer.  But the lack of financial stress--other than that looming $140,000 debt I have attached to my person as of next May--has given me a moment to consider my overall views on money. My complete disclosure before saying anything, of course, is that I've never been destitute and my family is comfortably upper-middle-class, at least nowadays.   When I have money, I spend it. I save it when something tells me I should (i.e. to afford vacations, or presumably when children are born to save for college) but otherwise, I have no attachment whatsoever to seeing lots of cash in my bank account. People don't often ask me for money, especially now that I'm living fat off the government, but when they do I've almost always given them whatever I could. I don't give out loans, though; approximately 90% of any financial assistance I've ever given has been given without a plea for repayment.  Along those lines, aside from large rent-paying checks or outright "gifts" because of dire straits, most of what I do is pay for stuff. I don't mind picking up a check, if I can, especially when it's dinner for two or a movie or just... whatever. I wouldn't call it chivalry, because although it occurs with my female friends more often, that's simply because I have more female friends. In truth, I'm not sure why I operate that way, because at this point it's second nature. I certainly don't keep track of what I pay for (I mean, other than for my own bookkeeping purposes) so it's not about reciprocity either.  I guess in the end my point is this: save when necessary, but otherwise, don't be such a cheap bastard. Really, this applies to things beyond money (love, friendship, volunteering) but people seem to get super worked up about cash most of all. It's only temporary, and as long as you remain smart--no giving away your kid's orthodonture fund--it's a much less anxious way to live.  Oh, and stop asking for repayments of loans. If you give someone money, and you don't specifically sign a document detailing repayment, then when they don't repay you, just remember that for next time and call it a day. If it the money was that important to you, you should have been more careful to detail the terms of the transaction--but since you didn't, let it go.

      I dislike Tuesdays, if for no other reason than because I feel isolated. I have only one class, at 9 a.m., and then I'm on my own for the rest of the day.  Most days, that means library for a little while, then home and/or gym. Today, I have a meeting with my Public Interest professor, who will tell me that I write in passive voice and perhaps should consider not doing that anymore.   It's a short week, though - I only have 3 classes left, and they're all tomorrow. That makes for a long tomorrow, but a nice 5-day weekend (Easter break - we get Friday and Monday off) which will be spent starting non-Law Review activities (such as "studying") that have been sorely neglected this semester.  I have this recurring (3 or 4 times now) dream that I'm playing a giant game of musical chairs, except instead of chairs there are people, and when the music stops everyone pairs up. The music seems to be winding down, and I suddenly find that I am the only one without someone, and it stops and everyone asks me to leave. I don't think you have to be Freud to figure this one out, but it's a pretty weird dream nonetheless.

      I find it curious that a number of people see reading a person's blog as a small invasion of privacy. Even curiouser, I get almost angry when I hear other bloggers complain about people reading/commenting on their blogs. I've even seen posts like "...and whoever it is that visits my blog from Alabama, get out! If you're not my friend you shouldn't be here!"  People, people. It's the Internet - you can't pick and choose your visitors if you don't put up some kind of password. If you want a private, intimate website that only a select few can find and read, then creating a blog is that absolute wrong way to go about it. Not only is it asinine, it goes against the entire point of having weblogs. Whether you comment on the news like some, or on your personal life, or you just write for writing's sake - the point isn't to keep it to yourself.  But on the other side of the blogging coin, I find it silly when people (even friends!) stumble over my blog and then actually  feel bad  about reading it. Granted, such people aren't very accustomed to the idea of blogs (living under a rock, eh?) but I would give no apologies if I found someone's blog and read it. None. Even if they claimed it was private (see above). Because if you're going to put something out there, you have a responsibility to not get yer undies in a twist when "the wrong people" find it, read it, and react to it.  That's why I write in general terms, with first names only, and don't talk about too many person-specific feelings. It's not because I don't have 'em, it's because This Blog is supposed to be egalitarian in function. My parents and sisters read it, as do a couple ex-girlfriends, as do a couple never-were-girlfriends, as do friends. If something I write offends one of those groups, then I take full responsibility (well, for offending, not for whether they SHOULD have been offended). I would never tell someone to stop reading it, as that would be the height of hypocrisy.   Welcome, one and all!

      The good news is, my editorial position on law review is, in my opinion, one of the better positions to hold. It's a hefty amount of work, but not as much as the Lead Editors (and certainly not as much as the Editor in Chief or the Senior Exec. Editor), and it has a significant level of autonomy to it (i.e. you work on your own schedule, to a degree).   Also I found out I get $500/issue, so that's nice. And I get to call myself an Executive Editor, which is doubly cool because we're pretty high on the masthead.  Today I'm tracking down a Kinko's to make the necessary 13 copies of my Comment, which is finally good-and-due tomorrow. Other than those quaint little stories, nothing very interesting to go on about. Y'all come back now, ya here?

      Well we were sort of at a loss at what to see tonight, and trapped rather perilously in that dreaded 8-9pm timeslot (where, between the two major theaters, ONE movie was playing at that time). So instead of seeing  urlLink Ladykillers  (which I've heard is only so-so), or that Angelina Jolie movie (not playing till 10) we snagged  urlLink Hellboy .  Hellboy was... uneven. Fun, quite fun in parts, but it lacked a strong narrative. A bunch of stuff just seemed to "happen". In the pantheon of comic book movies, I'd put it at about Daredevil level, but below X-Men (both of 'em) and well above Batman Forever. Perhaps if I were more of a "Hellboy" comic book fan? Who knows!  Anyways, 2.5 stars out of 4. Worth seeing if you like fun action movies, or if you're a fan of the original work. Otherwise, grab it on DVD like I did with Daredevil.

      Mock Trial went well. All the actual participants did great, especially Cindy and Dana. I did only okay - I didn't forget anything important about my character, but I also failed to ad lib effectively when given the opportunity. Mostly that was because I was unsure how much artistic license to take, but I had a couple moments where I could have given C and D a boost but failed to properly do so.   Live and learn! If I'm ever a witness again, I'll be on the lookout for mistakes by the other side. Bam!

      Awake at 8 a.m. on a Thursday? Say it isn't so! No day off for me today (as if it's ever really "off") because a make-up ConLaw class takes place this morning. I'm not exactly sure where - I've narrowed it down to "one of the law school buildings" but that's as far as my sleep-deprived brain will allow me to go.  Woke up no fewer than 5 times during the night. Reasons were as follows: dreamt I was crashing my car into a bus, dreamt a friend was in the hospital, dreamt a parent had a "brain infarction" (which I'm not even sure is a thing you can have) and was dying, got a call from someone at 6 a.m. ("This is Bob, somebody paged me."), and was very very thirsty.   This afternoon I have to go be a witness in Cindy and Dana's mock trial thing. I play a college-age bagpipe player who saw a funeral mishap. In that my character's ancestry is Scottish, it has been (jokingly, I hope) suggested that I use a Scottish accent. While I am no slouch when it comes to accents, actually using one in a non-joking way ("Aye, I saw the casket fall open.") is not my forte. Besides, my Scottish accent is usually just Mike Myers as His Own Father in "So I Married an Axe Murderer", which means I can only really talk about the pentaverate and children with large craniums.  Alternatively, I can do a pretty good Sean Connery, but again it's only good when it's actual Connery lines. So unless I'm asked what losers whine about (their best) or how to get Capone (he pulls a knife, you pull a gun, and so forth) - both topics I'm certain are not relevant to the fake trial - I won't be whipping that out either.  There's also Groundskeeper Willie ("If it were up to me, I'd let ya go. But the lads have a temper - and they've been drinkin' all day!"), but I won't even go IN to the likeliness of anything he's ever said being relevant.   I'm off to find a Con Law class.

      "Memorialization" is probably more accurate, but that seemed a little showy.   Quick recap time:  Hiked up the mountain on Saturday and got sunburned, but not in a good overall way. Hello farmer's tan!  Finally watched Chicago (via Netflix) which was entertaining but not as catchy as I expected. I'm no expert when it comes to musicals (my favorites are still West Side Story and that episode of Buffy) but I found most of the songs a bit... boring. Finished the fifth Harry Potter book, which I've been borrowing from Jaime since  last June . No, I haven't been reading it since then, I just always had other books prioritized above it. I thought it was quite a bit darker than the previous books, and Potter was starting to annoy me with his constant bitching. But hey, it's fun to read and it only took me 3 days. Went to Jaime's friend's engagement party. We didn't stay long (I knew almost nobody, and Jaime only knew them as acquaintances) but it was weird to see so many people my age who are married. Outside of the Big Wedding (which isn't for another month) I've only known ONE other couple that got married.   That last event made me think that maybe I exude some sort of anti-marriage pheromone. I know some law school folks that are married, but they've been that way since I met them. Everybody else? Unmarried and uninterested in the institution. Of course, the effects of my presence on the east coast may have finally worn off, as a few more people seem to be slowly lurching in that direction.  If it IS some sort of telepathic power or naturally-occurring influence, I'll make sure I shut it off before I even get close to Washington, DC, and the Big Day.

      My mom surprised me this week by sending me not one, not two, but THREE seasons of Buffy on DVD. First of all, that's not cheap at all. But it's a pretty amazing gift, so a big thank-you is in order.  I now have Seasons 1-6 on DVD, which is awesome because that's pretty much the cream of the Buffy crop. Tonight I watched a couple episodes I only saw once, and the  amazing  episode "The Body" (from Season 4. If you're not familiar with Buffy, it's the episode where her mom dies, not from supernatural means (as is how most people on Buffy meet their untimely demise) but rather from an aneurysm. I won't go into specifics, but it's quite possibly the most moving, realistic, and well-shot hour of television that I've ever seen. There's no background music and each segment is made up of very long one-shots.  I'm lucky enough to have never lost a parent (knock on wood), but even without that experience to draw from, "The Body" is the saddest and most emotionally draining TV I've ever watched. And man, I watch a LOT of TV. Makes me sad that Buffy, and Angel (which never quite hit that high note), are gone.

      I couldn't think of a better title, besides "Movies I Just Saw and a Book I Just Read," and where's the poetry in that?    urlLink The Quiet American   - I remember hearing how good this was back in 2002 when it first came out, and lo and behold I did not hear wrong. In a way, this movie does for Vietname what Lost in Translation did for Japan. But only if you ignore the war. Michael Caine is quite impressive, and Brendan Fraser, though doughy-looking, holds his own.    urlLink Shrek 2   - Saw this last night with Marek & Co. before he leaves town for Mother Russia. It was, well, the same as the first, which is to say if you liked Shrek you'll like Shrek 2. It seemed to have more little in-jokes than the first, but sacrificed some of the truly clever aspects of its predecessor to squeeze 'em in.     urlLink Kill Bill, Vol. 2   - I'm on my way to see this in 20 minutes. I'll annotate this post later.    urlLink Jitterbug Perfume  , by Tom Robbins - Finished this one last night. I'm fairly new to Robbins' work but it was pretty quirky and entertaining. Definitely on a different wavelength from most fiction, but interesting nonetheless. It's about immortality and, well, beets. If you like Douglas Adams' books, but are looking for non-science-fiction, it might be for you.

      When I said that "this will be a summer to remember," I didn't mean because  urlLink terrorists would be blowing up  a small chunk of real estate somewhere. Consider this your warning terrorists: mess with MY summer plans and you'll be more than in trouble, you'll be in "Man on Fire" Denzel-goes-nuts trouble.   I'm still really digging my new "clean" apartment. It's cleaner than it has ever been, and that includes right after I first moved in. It's like living in a hotel, ever morning I when I get out of bed I marvel at the fact that I don't have to watch where I step to avoid the possibly important papers that were scattered about.   Speaking of getting up, my insomnia seems to be returning, after a brief respite last week. I was up until almost 3 a.m. yesterday,  urlLink reading  and thinking and then  urlLink reading again .

      Awhile ago (seems like an eternity now) I wrote about the fact that, for the first time in my life,  urlLink I had "options"  when it came to dating. It was a fine day for everybody.   But, like some physics theories postulate, analyzing something will automatically change its properties. In other words, as soon as I mention it out loud, the gradual decaying process begins. Here we are, 3 months later, and my options have dwindled to... zero. (EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm still sure that something like this exists in physics, but it's also called the Hawthorne Effect in sociology, wherein "individual behaviors may be altered because they know they are being studied.")  This is not a "poor me" story; quite the opposite, in fact. As has also been mentioned previously, I  urlLink undertook some changes  to "jettison" certain parts of my life that seemed overly complex or unhealthy. Though it has been a two-steps-forward, one-step-back sort of process, I think I finally got there.   But it's hard to be by yourself, sometimes. I love my friends dearly, but with a third of them gone for the summer, and another third always gone because they live far away, I find myself operating in solo mode more often than I'm used to. The problem with that is, I don't  need  any more time for quiet self-realization. I do plenty of introspection during even my busiest times, and if there's one thing I don't need more of, it's time to think.   In the end, I will (in my third internal reference, yikes) try to  urlLink recapture some  of my hobbies and interests, such as piano, crossword puzzles, and the destabilization of post-industrialization South American economies.  It'll be a summer to remember, I guarantee. Also, you'll like the way you look, I guarantee it.

      On any given Monday, I'm usually in 2 or 3 classes and am so exhausted from them, and the impending week ahead, that my non-law productivity is nil. No bills are paid, no outside activities partaken, zilch.   But without classes in my way, I'm (in comparison) a productivity dynamo! Today I:  - hung stuff on my walls that have needed hangin for ages - vacuumed thoroughly - worked on law review editing for 2 or 3 hours - bought a  urlLink coffee table  - went to the store and got more cleaning supplies - updated this blog  And now you're up to speed. Tonight may be a little less active since I plan to assemble the above-mentioned table and possibly hit the gym. To those who are at the gym, I say watch out! The productive dynamo is coming! I will make your 30 reps look like 3, compared to me!  Oh yeah, while cleaning I found a letter from USD Parking Services. An old letter from, um, last November. But the good news was, the  urlLink parking violation I appealed  was in fact dismissed! I'm counting this as my first legal victory. Mark the date! Well, mark November 13, 2003 I guess.

      I'm trapped here in the library holding "office hours" for the Law Review kids, and the place is so quiet it's almost eerie. If it weren't, you know, scaldingly sunny outside.   Last night, during game night at Jaime's, I somehow managed to remember the name of the guy who invented the Segway and the meaning of the word "glasnost". I am unable to determine how either of those nuggets of useless information first set up shop in my overcrowded brain, but there they are. What I didn't remember, however, was which Simpsons is not named after a member of Matt Groening's family, and let me tell you, I could not feel lamer. Any question that starts "On  The Simpsons , which..." should be a  total  lock. I mean, why am I even carrying around such a complete compendium of Simpsons information in my stupid head if I can't use it on something as, ahem,  trivial  as Trivial Pursuit?   I also pronounced  Cristal  like "crystal" and though I tried to pretend that I was doing it on purpose to throw Jaime off, I actually am not nearly cultured enough (or rich enough) to recognize Cristal when I read it.  More later, I'm sure. This is going to be a long 3 hours (1/6 over!).

      Re:  urlLink http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/   Did  urlLink you  think I hadn't heard about this already? I'm so up on this thing I practically work for Rockstar.   More later after I beat Jaime at Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture Edition.  UPDATE: I lied. I'm tired and I have to go to school tomorrow (afternoon, but still) so I'm hittin the hay. Jaime and I tied in wins, I rocked TPPCE and Scene It! but lost to her in Encore and Trivial Pursuit 4th Edition. That last one was by a hair.

      Read  urlLink this article  on Slate, by the smartest legal analyst writing today.    The real problem is that there are really only three arguments against gay marriage: One is rooted in entirely God's preferenceswhich have little bearing on Equal Protection or Due Process doctrine, as far as I can tell. The second cites inconclusive research on its negative effects on children. The backup is the slippery slope jeremiad, which seems to pass for a legal argument, at least on cable TV. But fear of the slippery slope alone is not a sufficient justification for doing the wrong thing in any individual case.   Damn skippy it's not. I've never found the "slippery slope" argument to be a very valid concern in ANY area of law, and it's cited in many, many areas of law. It was argued during desegregation and the civil rights movement, and clearly THAT was a valid concern (note sarcasm denoted by all-caps writing). The article notes that there are some valid, notable concerns with a "slippery slope" metaphor, but also correctly labels it as just that - a metaphor, not a sound legal principle.  I'm off to turn in my papers, and to grant sweet release to this semester in full.

      Ahem. An explanation as to the frequency of my blog posting for the next few days:  " Adopt 1358.1, Title 16   Proposed regulation would specify all the criteria for an ethics course run by the MBC. The criteria would include duration, faculty, objectives, method of instructions, content, class size, evaluation, records, program completion, change in course content or instructor. Adoption of this regulation was halted on December 5, 2003, pursuant to Executive Order S-02-03.  Regulation 1379.23, Title 16   At the August 2003 DOL meeting, discussion of the proposed midwifery regulations was postponed until a later meeting so that Dr. Karlan could participate. In November, the Board reopened hearings on 1379.23 and received input from a variety of citizens on the proposed changes. The disputed portion of the controlling law, SB 1950, was the area that mandated physician supervision of midwives. Midwives claim that no physicians will supervise them, and physicians claim that malpractice insurance claims would be too expensive to do so. SB 1950 requires the Board to adopt regulations defining the appropriate standard of care and level of supervision required for the practice of midwifery."  Wow! That's some pretty weird, wild stuff, no? If anyone is interested in more, send me an email and I'll have someone come by and knock some damn sense into you.

      ...between working hard during Finals and working hard  after  Finals is that I am master of my own destiny. King of my castle, emperor of the throne of poorly stapled papers and plastic tabs that I've built in my apartment.  I don't mind being massively stressed out after Finals, because there's a flair of independence to the situation. Sure, I've got two papers due on Thursday, either one of which could easily fill all the time between now and then. And sure, I've got to catch up on Law Review editing I neglected during Finals, including finding missing sources and battling through the undergrads who have taken over the library during their own finals. Notice the lack of a capitalization on that word; just a snide editorial remark on how much weight I give the undergrads, who are usually too busy baring midriffs and vacationing at Lake Tahoe to bother with tests.   It's something to do, anyhow, while everyone is out of town. Keeps me from going stir crazy.

      Yesterday, we taught the first round of new Law Review members how to cite-check so that they can get started on it this summer. The new folk are all 1L's who placed in the top 5% of the class after fall semester was over, so clearly they're pretty good at schoolwork.  What they're also good at, however, is being stressed-out piles of neuroses. Because they're all top of the class, a large number of them are also super-involved in everything and quite busy. Summer jobs, clerkships, research assistants, etc. While most of them rightfully embrace being on Law Review, some are so... "harried" at this point that they actually consider declining it.  Declining Law Review membership is like being an independent filmmaker who spends a year making a really good movie, and then declines an Oscar nomination because they're "too busy to handle it." And no, I don't mean the Sean Penn-types who avoid it for moral or political reasons. It's a lot of work, everybody knows that. But you can't get a higher honor in law school, other than whatever cum laude crap they may hand out at graduation. I'm lucky as hell that I managed to write on, so perhaps I'm biased--I actually had to actively try to get on Law Review, whereas the others are simply awarded membership based on grades.  Some of the Board mentioned yesterday that some schools have write-on only law reviews, and I'm not quite sure whether that's a good idea or not. On the one hand, law review is heavily writing-oriented, so it makes sense. But to grade on, you have to have some writing competence so it's not like that unrelated. It also provides a mix of personality types when you have both write-ons and grade-ons. I'm not even in the top 50% of my class (last time I checked, it was close, but not quite) so I'm sure I bring a different point of view to the proceedings.   Anyway, if you're on Law Review, don't be a wuss and quit. Even if you don't care about the "honor", realize that any employer who sees you're high ranking in the class will question why you declined to join, and the "it was a lot of work" answer--no matter how legitimate it was at the time--is going to make you sound really lame.

      Time to vent. I saw Troy this afternoon, and it was entertaining although not "good" in the classic sense of the word. Too many liberties taken with the Iliad for my tastes, even if it's understandable given that the filmmakers wanted to remove the gods from the story.  What also irked me, though, were the gratuitous shots of a half-naked Brad Pitt. I'm all for nudity if it fits the story, and hey sometimes even when it doesn't. But the movies that use it excessively are bad, almost across the board. A good movie with nakedness doesn't overuse it, it just uses it as necessary - see  urlLink American Beauty  for an example, in my opinion.  What really annoys me, however, is not gratuitous skin (after all, there is far more female skin in the movies), but it's the fact that for some reason, women feel obliged or even liberated in ogling Brad Pitt-type actors, but when men do the same--often much more subtly--we're branded as pigs.  This is unfair, and it pisses me off. Not because I'm clamoring to vocally express my appreciation for the female form, but because even if I wanted to I'd catch a load of crap for it. Maybe for good reason - women have lots of body image issues, and perhaps seeing guys slobbering over rail-thin actresses doesn't help. But isn't it hypocritical to demand guys behave one way, and then turn around and act just as bad (worse, I would say)? Granted, men may not have as many body image issues, but is that really the point? If women want to be taken seriously, and if you believe that an impediment to that is that our culture unfairly emphasizes looks over substance, shouldn't  both  sexes strive to look beyond that?  I know, movies are just movies. But swooning over Brad Pitt is just one example, women swoon over real life guys all the time. I just think that those who do so should relinquish the right to even mutter under their breath when guys do the same.  It occurs to me that I'm in a pretty hefty bad mood, and have been for a couple days, so maybe this is all just me be angry at something else. Take it with a grain of salt, then.

      Finals are over for this strikingly care-free chap. Constitutional Law put on the gloves and got into the ring, but at the end of the 3rd round it was clear only one of would be leaving. Since I am here to tell the tale, I'll let you figure out who that one was (hint: care-free).   I've still got Law Review editing breathing down my neck (due Monday!) and those damn Public Interest papers (due Thursday!) but when compared to the blistering hell that is finals, getting those done will be like being nuzzled by kittens. Kittens, I tell you!  No more for now, my morning was long and I slept quite poorly, so I believe that a bit o' naptime is in order. The sweet embrace of my bed awaits...

      This country, and perhaps the world, needs a new period of enlightenment. A new renaissance period, where ideas are praised and ignorance is no longer something to be proud of.   The first step would be to hold those who are intelligent and creative in high regard. This is a problem not only in politics (I wouldn't be the first, second, or even 1 millionth person to note that our President is a detached and disinterested dullard) but also in celebrity. Hollywood has a knack for pandering to the lowest common denominator, but when was the last time that you heard of someone simply because they were brilliant in their field?  The last "literary star" to really sweep the nation was J.K. Rowling. I have nothing against Ms. Rowling, and I think the Harry Potter books are quite entertaining, but they're not masterpieces. Still, they're the closest thing we've got to a step in the right direction, for the singular reason that they've encouraged a generation of kids to read.  We need another "Quiz Show" phenomenon. Not with the scandal part, of course, but rather the part that made America tune in to see people who weren't pretending to be less intelligent than they are. We need an "American Idol" for physics or art, not music. We're pretty well covered in the bad pop-music department, so I'm not sure why discovering more bad pop talent should be a priority.   None of this will happen until Americans start believing they should, and can, be better. Not this "fat dumb and happy" mentality that currently occupies the minds of a majority of Americans. And lest you think otherwise, this isn't an attack against only the traditionally ignorant - conservatives. Liberals who refuse to see other points of view and constantly rail against issues that they don't fully understand (I'm looking at you, WTO protestors) are just as bad.   I can't think of an eloquent way to end this post, so I'll just stop typing. I should be studying, anyhow.

      In a fit of post-final jubilatory fury, I've decided why not change the template. This one has plantlife too, in a close-up, unfocused sort of way. Out go the trees, in come the leaves.   Besides, I kinda like all the new options Blogger created. Built-in comments, better archiving. It must be a response to the modblog/typepad folks, who have offered such things for awhile now.   I got my official invitation to the Wedding of the Century today. Very nice invitations, quite hip. I've already become confused about whether "with ____ number of persons" means I should put 0, or 1, or +1, but maybe that's because I'm a moron and I've never responded to a wedding invitation before. Excellent inclusion of stamped reply envelopes though, I'm always a fan of saving 37 cents. Or however much they cost now.

      It would figure that as soon as I go through the trouble of tracking down a new template for this blog, Blogger would issue a crapload of easy-to-apply templates (along with their new redesign, which is... interesting). Even though a couple of them look pretty good, I'm keeping with the trees for a little while, just out of spite. Plus I still like it. And it took me ages to tweak all the appropriate links and various bits.  Tomorrow's Public Interest Final is worth about 20% of my grade, is closed-book, and only 2 hours. It's practically not even worth my  time , man. But Thursday will find me deep in Constitutional Law, so I'm going to focus on that final for now. Except for tomorrow morning when I'll lazily leaf through my PILP notes and pretend to memorize them.   I've really only got another 5 or 6 hours of studying left in me at this point, but that should be sufficient to successfully attack ConLaw.   Pizza time!

      Yesterday was my duly-designated "intermission" day for finals. With three down and two to go, it was time for a break, and a break was indeed had. Let's start with   Tax . Final number 3 and a big blight on the universe, Tax was unlike other finals in that it wasn't essay-driven. All fact-patterns, all the time. I have renewed respect for CPA's and other various tax-related professions. I think I did okay, though. Or at least that I passed. That was at 9 a.m.   PB . Post-final, some relaxin' was in order and by sheer coincidence, Pacific Beach was having a block party. I headed over to Hilary's, but just as I was  turning onto her street , a motorcycle cop saw me "roll through" the stop sign and pulled my ass over. Well, he pointed because he wasn't even on his bike at the time. I got a ticket. I have no idea how much it is, I have to wait to get something in the mail and then fight it, go to traffic school, or pay the fine and get points. We'll see what I'm in the mood for. The block party itself was entertaining. There was funnelcake. Lots of ill-fitting bikini tops and tattoos. Such is Pacific Beach. But alas, my ticketing for the day had not ended! After temporarily maxing out on the block party, we headed back to Hilary's to move my car so her roommate could park when she got back. I moved it to a "less allowed" area of the alley and, of course, was immediately ticketed. This is even funnier because I was only in the house for 10 minutes. Frankly, I'm allowed to park there for loading purposes for 20 minutes, and I have half a mind to protest the ticket under S.D.M.C. 86.06, but we'll see. It's only $47.   Having now paid a significant amount of money to eat funnelcake and get sunburn, we decided to catch a movie instead of continuing the fun that is PB. Enter  Van Helsing , which was... cheesey. Fun, but cheesey. It also rips off (at our count) at least 8 dozen other, better movies in various ways. And I don't mean movies like Dracula, which it obviously must pay homage to, but also Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Matrix, Star Wars, every James Bond ever made, and Fried Green Tomatoes. Entertaining enough for a matinee, avoid the $9.50 ticket or you're paying $4 too much. The screening we caught was also digital projection, which was very cool at first, but then faded from importance in light of the lameness of most of the actual plot.   Then we got  Ice Cream  at Corvette Cafe in Hillcrest. That was actually the least eventful portion of the day, but capped it off nicely. Total cost of Finals Intermission: probably in the neighborhood of $300 (combined among all involved individuals). Fun had: Lots. Ready for Final Four and Final Five: Nope, but I will be.

      I stumbled across  urlLink The Spark  (Remember that? From a few years ago? Yeah you do.) and in a fit of nostalgia, I took some  urlLink cupid/love test  thing. There was a period of time when Spark's tests were all the rage, though now it's not so hot. I think the point is to get you signed up with their online dating, which I'm not going to do, but it did give me this interesting analysis:  "Here today, gone today. You are The Vapor Trail. Are you in a relationship now? What about now? Vapor Trails can be highly charismatic people--unpredictable, confident, and magnetic. You're experienced. You know how to handle yourself in a relationship, and many people appreciate that. Many people, all in a row. You've had your share of blissful beginnings, to be sure. But things almost never turn out how you'd like, do they? The problem is you're never happy with someone for an extended period of time.  Vapor Trails especially need a girl who will laugh at their jokes. They're also the most likely male type to be haunted by serious regret. FACT: A few of your exes, the ones you were best to, will always love you. Nice going. "  So basically, The Spark thinks I'm fairly evil and a bit of a player. While some of those opinions definitely ring true (especially the laughing part), I'm fairly certain it's not the best analysis ever. Funny, though.

      As some of my fellow Bloggers  urlLink have noted , Google is offering its  urlLink new email service  to those who have blogspot-brand blogs. I quickly signed up.  At first it was difficult to determine how useful the features would be, but I started forwarding my major USD account to Google and am now very much enjoying some of Google's capabilites. "Labels" instead of folders, the ability to search mail, and when the " urlLink scary evil ads " to make an appearance, they're very unobtrusive.  In closing, if you haven't yet signed up, I highly recommend Gmail. It's far, far better than both Hotmail and Yahoo, in my opinion. If you don't have a blog, tough luck until it goes public.

      1 Down, 4 To Go. Hopefully I'll do better on the rest.  I'm in the bit of a blogging slump these days. I don't want this thing to turn into a simple account of school or finals, but school and finals occupy 98% of my time these days. So my apologies for skipping days, or completely bland and boring posts. I hope the boringness will be over in a week (when finals end), but I also have papers to write and editing to do so no  strict  promises.   Finale of Friends tonight, eh? Haven't really been watching this season (or last) so I'm not sure what's up, but I guess it's nice that they're going out while the show still retains some semblance of humor. While I never liked Friends as much as say, Seinfeld or even Scrubs, there have been plenty of moments that were laugh-out-loud funny. Good for them! While on the topic of television, last night's Angel was excellent as always. Only two episodes left, now. I hate the WB.   I've got three weeks between the end of finals and the beginning of summer school, but probably not nearly enough actual work to fill all that time.  They're saying that May Gray will have set in by then, so beach-going may not be at the top of my list, but perhaps some hiking is in order. I'm going to try and avoid staying inside playing computer games the entire time. Fortunately, I've heard a rumor that reading books can be done  outside , so maybe that'll be my plan of action.  Well the excitement is just dripping off this post, so I'm gonna go find a sponge to clean it up.

      Final numero uno is tomorrow, so it occurs to me that perhaps I should start studying for it. Haha! Seriously. The temperature has apparently retreated from its Mercurial highs, so avoiding the nerve-wracking library is again a possibility.   A bit of explanation... the library is my prefered location for studying because--outside of finals--it is a quiet, not-to-stressful place to be. But when finals come, boy you better watch out. The library turns into a churning cauldron of frantic outlining, hair-pulling, and general fretting about everything related to law school. Yesterday was even better, because the geniuses that run our school's IT systems had the entire network down ALL DAY. Not that people need email or an outside connection to the Internet when trapped in the library for hours. Nah.   So I, in my infinite wisdom, hang out here in the Sauna and tab my notes and book up real nice. And watch bits and pieces of daytime TV. And play the ocassional bit of TextTwist.  Oh, and find  urlLink funny articles for my blogging public to check out . I've mentioned AdCritic on  urlLink Slate  before, but usually it's at its funniest when Stevenson writes.

      If you're not watching "The Sopranos" you're missing out on some pretty entertaining television. Meadow was finally on in a more-than-3-lines role, and I've missed her.  It's not even noon yet and the temperature is already 87 degrees in here. This bodes poorly for studying Tax at home - I'm off to the library.  "Extreme Dating" isn't very good. But it's the only thing on besides a really old West Wing and a bad comedian on Comedy Central.  I just found out a bunch of my professors have a  urlLink right-wing blog . Although I generally disagree with most of the political opinion, it's an interesting read nonetheless.   My new online nickname (for games like UT2004 and Wolfenstein) is "Johnny Wishbone" and I say "I am a psychic from the isle of St. Croix!" after every frag.  Read  urlLink this article in the New Yorker  to learn why the Army is a FUBAR when it comes to the Iraqi prisoner situation.  This new hotness is off to the gym.

      Ask and ye shall receive: the weather has finally gone over the curve beyond being spectacular to simply being hot as hell. Currently, the temperature in my apartment is (I kid you not) 91 degrees.   Fortunately, this isn't standard. It's a hot streak which should start dying down on Monday night. The sad part is, I have so much studying to do for Finals (starting Wednesday!) that I can't even make time to hit the beach on a day like today. Can't work on outlines in the sand, after all.   Instead I'm inside, two fans positioned to blow directly on me, working on Legislation and watching "Spartacus" on USA. Dr. Kovac is whupping some Roman ass.  Fact of the Day: The term "loose cannon" comes from early naval warfare. The cannons in a ship were strapped down tightly, because a heavy cannon, if it came loose from its position, could do substantial damage to a ship sailing in rough waters.

      Attention dastardly fellows:  I know you're not very smart. If you were, you probably wouldn't be a criminal. The sad truth of the Real World (actual, not MTV-version) is that crimes are very hard to pull off successfully, and the penalty for failing is often far more severe than the benefits you might reap. Armed robbery for $150 in cash? How about 20 years in prison instead!  That being said, my Criminal Procedure class has armed with me with a few very simple, fairly obvious (to some, at least) rules that the criminal element should live by.  1. Do not consent to anything. The police will ask if they can--don't let them. Don't let them search your car, house, purse, body cavities, or anything else you might have. Refusal to consent is not a crime, and if the police have the power to search without your approval, they will. It cannot hurt unless you're innocent and you have somewhere to be. But if you're a pothead and you can't remember if you left drugs in the trunk,  do not say "sure" when the cops ask to look . The temptation to seem easy-going and like you have nothing to hide should be fought, unless you really do have nothing to hide.   2. Do not run. Running, when combined with other factors, can make your actions rise to the level of reasonable suspicion. Other factors can include "being in a high crime area" so those of you in such places should stick to indoor gyms when you jog. Running is viewed suspiciously; always walk when you're trying to get away. That is unless the cops already have enough to arrest you; in that case you should run your ass off.   3. Do not give access to evidence of your misdeeds to third parties. If you robbed a bank, don't give your disguise to your mom for the laundry. If you sell heroin out of your backpack, don't ask your friend to hold it while you go out to get a hamburger.  They will give your stuff to the police if asked . Same goes for roommates, officemates, wives, husbands, kids above a certain age and possibly even the mailman.*   *kids below about 10 aren't usually able to consent to access because they're too young. Also, I was kidding about the mailman, unless you gave him a key to the house.  Now, let's go out there and make Cops more entertaining for everyone who watches.

      Saw an interesting (albeit oddly written) article on the Post website today about  urlLink a bunch of "players"  at Yorktown High School. Worth the read, if you've got nothing better to do. It fails to shed any new sociological light on the whole "bad boy" phenomenon (at least none that I haven't heard before) but there was one interesting tidbit:   "He continues: 'When women are looking to settle down, they want someone who will be good to them and give them a long-term investment.'" - social psychologist at the University of Michigan    Granted, that's not interesting at first glance, but I found it interesting because the first thing I thought was "how boring is that?" Why should "nice guys" have to settle for a woman who loves them only because they're a good "long-term investment"? I may lose women to the bad boys, but I sure don't want one that sees me as an investment opportunity. The article implies that non-players must sit by the sidelines and wait until the women in their lives have grown up enough to "realize" that the nice guys are better for them. I say the hell with that, if you don't want me now then good riddance to you. I'm no player but I certainly have more self-esteem than THAT.  I was going to say that it was a sad statement that so many girls fall for the whole "player" style, but then I realized the article is based mostly on high school, and everybody in high school is an idiot anyhow. If you're over 21 and you still haven't figured it out, however, you're setting feminism and equality back decades.   NOTE: I think my blog is broken. If you can read this, you're either a) in my head in a Malkovitchian way or b) it started working again. Let's hope for (b), my head's crowded enough as it is.

      The first time I got into a fight (other than little wrestling scraps as a boy) was in the 8th grade. Roberto Sanchez was the villain's name, and he tormented me the entire year. He was the typical bully--not very smart, big for his age, and more than a little cruel.  After picking on me mercilessly for 2 semesters of junior high, I snapped. Waiting behind the backstop during a mandatory softball game in gym, I of course found myself on the same team as Roberto. He grew bored with making fun of the batters (who were, of course, on his team; another sign of his poor socialization skills) and decided to put me in a headlock. The impromptu rules of the headlock were that I had to say I was a "faggot" to (in theory) secure my release. This was a common sport, often alternating "say you like boys" or "cry like a girl" as the secret phrase, probably depending on what Roberto had for breakfast that morning.  But by the end of junior high, I had had enough. I usually resisted until he let go (I didn't want to say I cried like a girl if I wasn't even going to cry), but this time I hit him in the head so that he'd let go. I wasn't very big at the time but he let go and as I tried to punch him, he sort of laughed at me.  But then, I got in a good shot to his face. He stopped laughing and decided to beat me into oblivion. Fortunately for my physical health, our gym teacher had started running to break up the fight as soon as it started, and at that moment arrived and literally checked Robert with one arm, knocking him down.  I've wondered since then if that wasn't excessive force, when you consider that Mr. Frasier was a 6 foot 200 lb. 29-year-old gym teacher and Roberto, though terrifying to other 13-year-olds, was still just a kid. But it became the stuff of legend ("Did you hear how Frasier totally kicked Roberto's ass?") as did the copious swearing that issued forth as I hammered Roberto with my ineffective fists of fury. Apparently, I can cuss a blue streak. I don't remember because I was in such a rage, so most of the specifics escape me (parts of this story are compiled from eyewitness accounts).  I've been fortunate to avoid most (but not all) fights as I got older, usually by avoiding people who try and fight with me. But that first one stays with you.  I'm  way  bigger than Roberto now. And my rap sheet is probably shorter. Criminal bastard.

      Sometimes when God closes a door, he forgets to set the alarm. Then, when he's not looking, you can sneak out the window and borrow his car.  Some people view the glass as half empty, but I tend to view it as full of something I probably don't want, because somebody else was drinking it.  ...  Consider this busy week at an end. I've finished the last of my law review articles for the issues (although I may have to do some last minute editing on one particularly unfortunate article) and I'm all caught up on my reading. Let the weekend commence!   Except for I don't have much to do. Drat. Still, it's nice to be able to avoid the library for a couple days. Next week I've got more to do, as both my summer classes have decided to give us midterms, and I have to get my shit together for next week when I'm out of town for the Wedding of the Millennium. This weekend is just the calm before the small, mild storm.

      I know that radio is Technically Evil. But it's right there, and sometimes I get tired of whatever CDs I have stashed in my car, so I end up listening.  Then, something happens that makes me remember why radio is so bad in the first place. Some idiotic "morning zoo"-type show was editorializing yesterday about  urlLink AFI's 100 Years 100 Songs  show (I think it was on Tuesday night). They were mocking the list and it's inclusion of "old" (translation: fairly well-known and truly classic) songs and the exclusion of pop songs.    But they couldn't even name what songs they were referring to.   Let me reiterate that these are in fact DJs (at least four of them!), who work  in radio  for a living. And yet, I hear: "What about that one from The Breakfast Club? You know, it's like "don't forget me..." "Yeah that was cool. Who did that? Does anybody know? You know what else was good was that song from Say Anything. 'Your Eyes' or something."   I'm not as big a music, ahem, "afficionado" as perhaps  urlLink some   urlLink people . But who the hell works for a radio station and doesn't know Peter Gabriel (especially that song)? Or Simple Minds?   The sad part was, they did all remember that it was Peter Cetera that did that song from Karate Kid II ("Glory of Love"). They played it and it was stuck in my head all day.

      Sometimes things don't work. Things that really, by all accounts and by most acceptable math, should totally work out.  It's funny how two people can match up in 9 out of 10 areas, but when it comes to certain kinds of relationships (the kind that involve making out, for instance), that 10th thing is more necessary than almost all of the other 9.   Yes, I'm being purposely shady and not giving details. No, I won't tell you more, even if you ask. But I feel I should at least partially hint at why my blog is likely to take a decidedly melancholy flavor over the next few weeks. My cynicism levels are bound to shoot through the roof, at least temporarily. You've all been warned.  I'm totally skipping Professional Responsibility right now. This is okay because a) it's completely useless to attend class and b) I'd just be playing Spider Solitaire anyhow. This way I can at least do some law review work. If I can ignore the weirdos running around the LRC on some sort of researching scavenger hunt.  Oh and props to  urlLink this kid , who seems to be the first real superhero born out of genetic mutation I've ever heard of. He can join the X-Men!

      I'm a liberal. It would not be terribly far off the mark to call me a bleeding-heart, tree-hugging pinko, except that I don't hug trees with any sort of regularity. I don't believe in capital punishment, draconian drug sentencing, restrictions on abortion or gay rights, and a litany of other conservative ideals that will no doubt keep my soul from entering the kingdom of heaven when I pass beyond this mortal coil.  But Michael Moore is starting to irritate the bejesus out of me. I'm so anti-Bush I can't see straight, but Moore is getting to be so full of himself that he bugs even me. Case in point: his repeated threats to sue anybody who trashes Fahrenheit 9/11, using defamation or slander laws.   First of all, if people say the movie sucks you can't do a damn thing. That's not what libel law is meant to restrict. Only people who make outright false claims (like "Moore is a pedophilic Satan-worshipper") can even  begin  to be prosecuted, and even then if it's said in any sort of op/ed format (I'm looking at you, Wall Street Journal) it's simply opinion. So why is Moore saying all this?  Because he's annoying. Because he's pompous and although we probably agree on 95% of the issues, he refuses to let another viewpoint into the room, and that I cannot abide. I will go toe-to-toe with any conservative on any issue, but that's what makes free speech great--the ability to argue. Moore cries like a baby whenever anybody says anything against him, and what's more, that makes him a hypocrite of the highest caliber. He wants to shine the light of truth on public and corporate officials? Great! But if somebody shines a light on you, you'd better be able to at least stand up to them without running off to your lawyers.  Note: I just noticed  urlLink Slate  has a  urlLink couple   urlLink articles  about this very thing. Go Slate! Also let me state for the record that people consistently bash Moore (I won't link to their websites) are just as stupid as Moore sometimes allows himself to be. Moore would do the world a favor if he could rise above their criticism, but alas, that does not seem to be the trend. I really liked  urlLink "Roger and Me" , why can't we return to those days?

      I went and downloading  urlLink iTunes  finally, since I've heard good things about the organizational properties and general usefulness of the program. I don't have an iPod or anything, which may be why I'm coming late to the game, but it really is pretty handy.   Thanks to iTunes, I've found out that I have over 900 (918 to be exact) songs on my hard drive, totaling over 2 days of music. This includes only 2 or 3 CD's that I've ripped (sorry, RIAA) but goes back, historically, to when I first started downloading MP3s, which was in 1997. SEVEN years ago, man. I had my collections at the time burned onto CD (once in 1997 and once in 1999, I think) to preserve them for all time, but have since reloaded them onto my too-big-for-words 80 gig drive. It's not like I'm using the space for anything else.  The post has no real point, except to be amazed at how much crappy music I've piled up. The thing about MP3s is, I download songs that I'd never buy, because they, um... suck. Example: any pop song that I find catchy enough to overcome my general revulsion towards most radio crap. Easy listening stuff from the 80's and 90's. Songs that I hear from friends or other obscure sources that are easier to find online than at a record store. And so forth. Added to the fact that I don't delete ANY songs, even if I get tired of them, and you've got a mess.  Really, I'm just trying to explain why "She's Like the Wind" and every song from "Mega Man 2" can be found in my possession. And having said that, I realize there is no rational explanation.

      And of course I don't mean the local base-ball team.   Some of the earliest memories I have of my dad are outdoor memories. Every time it would rain (in Virginia, it happens frequently) he would march us outside to "follow the water" as it rushed down the street towards the creeks and/or storm drains. Dad tried to pass this off as one of the many quirky habits of a civil engineer, but I think it had more to do with just being a kid again. Playing in a summer rain, when it's far too warm to catch your death, and after the most serious lightning had passed on (but not completely, because the occasional crack of thunder livened up any outing) will stick in my head for the rest of my life.  It's a good memory, one I hope to repeat with my own kids if I haven't gone all cat's cradle and missed their formative years due to a hour-intensive attorney job. Something about my generally lazy nature tells me that the job won't be much of an obstacle. More likely it will be finding a will pair of ovaries to help with the procreation. Single guys who play too many computer games are rarely offered the adoptive opportunities given to "normal" couples. And by normal I mean "responsible and not impoverished."

      Last night I went to the Comedy Store in La Jolla and saw like, 15 comics do their thing. It was highly entertaining, if not always the funniest thing I've ever heard. Lots of jokes about the same old thing (girlfriends/boyfriends, sex, etc.) but some had definite potential. They just needed polishing, I think. One of the funnier guys was funny because he had the cadence and wording of all his bits down pat, so that it flowed better than most.   I think some comedians might not realize that a good joke can be ruined (or at least rendered largely unfunny) by a mediocre delivery. Of course, I'm no professional comic but I know what's funny, what's edgy and what will work. I think someone needed to tell the crazy white guy who told ethnic jokes that the crowd wasn't quite southern or drunk enough, yet. And one guy just said "Think about it!" over and over again after every joke. I thought about it: he sucks.  That's my review of the revue. It was a good deal overall (5 bucks for admission and about $30 for 6 drinks, including tip) and it was amusing to see guys who were checking IDs and taking covers performing on stage 20 minutes later. Godspeed, moderately funny fellows!

      It's just crappy out here, with a capital C. So, um, Crappy. The weather has gone beyond "AM Clouds/PM Sun" to simply "AM Clouds/PM Stop Asking Me". The sun  barely  breaks through, and when it does it's brief and usually at around 5 or 6 p.m. That's just unacceptable weather, man.   It gives everything a melancholy pall, and puts everybody in a subconsciously bad mood. By that I mean if you asked, people would say they were fine and mean it, but that it takes very little to just submarine the entire day. Just the fact that my stupid apartment building's washer and dryer are broken, thus forcing me to find a damn laundromat, is enough to make me annoyed at the world. I think I'll just pay less rent this month...  I think I'd just like June to be over. I'd be halfway done with summer school, close to going home and seeing people, and the weather might (knock on wood) be better (there's no "July Gloom" -- for one thing, it doesn't almost rhyme). So lets just all agree that tomorrow is July 1. If we get everyone on board, it won't matter what the "calendar" or the "orbit of the planet around the sun" say.  Oh and  urlLink read this series  on  urlLink Slate  about a guy my age going to the Prom. It's funny and a little bit frightening. Kids today are messed up, man. I blame the Internet.

      Isn't it weird that the words "opened" and "closed" can both be used to mean a state of being (i.e. that package is "opened" or "closed") but "open" and "close" cannot? You can still say "that package is open" but you can't say "that package is close" unless you're using "close" to mean nearby. But I'm not, I mean it as in the condition of a sealed container. Why do we spell those two words the same way, anyhow? "Close" (your books, class) and "close" (to someone you love) aren't remotely related, and it must seem awfully confusing to those who are learning English as a second language.  Now that I've written the word "close" like eight times, it's starting to look surreal and not at all correct. Like when I write "tear" and mean something that falls from your eye instead of something you do to paper--that doesn't seem right at ALL.  Stop the madness!

      Actually, as I've now discovered, and earthquake is pretty darn quiet. No loud rumbling at all, just a weird, eerie shaking that is unlike anything I've ever experienced.  Yep, we had a minor earthquake out here. The epicenter was actually like 90 miles away or something, but it was a 5.2 so everyone in San Diego felt it. You think you know what an earthquake is like, but subconsciously I was likening it to how the house shakes in windy storm, or perhaps like the shaking you feel on a rickety bridge. But actually, it's like the  whole damn world  has been turned to jello. And that, my friends, is unsettling.  Not as unsettlingly funny as Chappelle's Show, though. Hi-larious, man. Hi. Larious.  p.s. PISTONS ROCK! ROCK!!! EAT IT YOU LAKER BASTARDS! Thank you.

      Warning: God-related entry not for the faint of faith.  I believe in God, I really do. At least, I think I do. I believe in  something  out there that is more powerful than we insignificant humans, and if it turns out to be God then I will jump onboard his bandwagon.  It seems like there are two components to organized religion, faith and worship. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum, as I see it, because faith is impossible to fake, while worship ridiculously easy to fake. You can't pretend, at least internally, to believe something that you don't. Sure you can say you believe to others, but ultimately faith is an internally set mechanism. Worship, on the other hand, is all outward. We go to church, we praise the Lord our God and his son Jesus or Buddha or possibly that Six-Armed Fellow (Vishnu?) but since faith is in our hearts, what does worship matter?  I think it matter not at all. Consider this: God, if It exists (and we'll assume It does for purposes of this blog entry), created everything, including mankind. Why did he do this? The only thing man can give to God is praise, but why would God need praise? For that matter, since the only thing we can offer is worship, that would mean that God (being all-knowing) created mankind for the sole purpose of having worshippers. This creates (in my mind) a problem; why should we, as free-willed individuals, worship something that created us only so that we would worship It? What kind of all-powerful being made of love and happiness requires devotion? Creating an entire universe so that somebody will pay attention to you seems to be the height of narcissism, or egocentricity.  Since the idea of an egotistical God is rather absurd, I think it must mean that worship in almost all of its forms--church building, hymn singing, any sort of sacramental endeavor--is rather pointless unless it is done solely to affirm your faith. Some (many, perhaps) would argue that of course that's the whole reason we have institutional religion: to help people get in touch with their faith. To those people I say maybe once that was true, but today private worship is discouraged, and that makes no sense. If your heart is full of faith in God, why must you prove your love to Him/Her by sitting in uncomfortable pews and singing mostly tuneless hymns? Why must you attend church at all, unless you find it entertaining?  Maybe I'm off base. Maybe faith and worship are more intertwined than I believe. A further exploration of the meaning of faith is probably in order, but I've work to do so that will have to wait until another day when I'm feeling particularly theological. Or maybe I should say "blasphemous and pretentious."

      That was the weekend?   Nothing else? Just those two days?   Thank God I don't have but one class tomorrow, and none on Tuesday. Because I'm not quite ready for full-on classwork just yet.  I don't think I've mentioned it yet, but my grades last semester were... mediocre. Not bad, considering what I could've gotten, but noticeably lower than Fall 2003 (wherein I got all B's). This is not a Bad Thing, because it hardly changes my GPA, but it  is  frustrating. It's driven me to really concentrate on doing well this summer, as I think I grew complacent after my relatively strong Fall semester and then allowed my study habits to falter. I will do well in PR and Crim Pro, though. I declare it to be so.  I'd forgotten how funny " urlLink Wet Hot American Summer " is, even butchered for Comedy Central. But the big question is, why didn't they release a soundtrack? I'd buy it!  9pm Update: The Pistons are simply better than the Lakers. If not for one lucky shot by Kobe, this series would have been over in 4. As it is, the Lakers will be extremely lucky to even get the series BACK to Los Angeles. Detroit Rock City!

      Classes started and my professors are quirky but entertaining enough to bear. Law review is a constant pain but nothing that I can't handle. Hilary got locked out of her apartment on Monday but that was resolved without having to break in her two-story window. Wednesday and Thursday have proven to be heavy loads, but then the Pistons won so it defused the stress a little bit. Thursday night was an unmentionably difficult evening for other reasons, and Friday was exhausting as it was done on 3 hours of sleep. Today I send some mail and maybe hit the gym.

Awesome.   - And am I ahead of the whining curve, or what? Check out CNN  urlLink playing catch up  to my  urlLink Internet Dating rant !  That's all I've got for now.

      Can't think of anything remotely interesting to write about today. Perhaps this is what happens when school, even of the summer flavor, starts back up.   I may have more interesting stories after my first CrimPro class tomorrow, but that may be promising a bit much considering it's a law school class and I am, of course, a boring law student. Maybe the teacher will execute a student or something, I dunno.  I will say that I'm getting tired of wall-to-wall Reagan coverage. He's dead! Gonna be that way for awhile! He was very, very old and very, very ready for his train ride to slab city. You think you're tired of it on the east coast? Try living in the state he was governor. We have coverage on LOCAL news, too. Sigh.

      As usual, the Sopranos season finale leaves us with many questions to ponder in the 20 or 30 years that will elapse before the next season. They include:  - will the Soprano crime family get over their anger with Tony for protecting his cousin? - will... um... hmmm.  There are no other cliffhangers! None! Tony and Carmela are fine. The kids are fine, probably. It's hard to say because Meadow is NEVER on the show anymore (except for the one episode). Christopher lost Ade but seems to be moving on. The looming mob war has been completely defused by the surprisingly competent FBI, leaving the Sopranos unharmed. Everybody's pretty much snug as a bug in a rug.  I was disappointed. Especially after the previous, very exciting and shocking episode. A tepid ending to a wildly up-and-down season, says me.  In other news, my Professional Responsibility professor is Mel Brooks, or at least his very close relative. Strange.

      I've decided I'm done with Internet-arranged dating. Match.com, Spring Street Networks, Yahoo Personals, eHarmony (I only used two, but I know people who've used all these) -- they're all well and good, but they're not going to give me what I'm looking for.  What I've realized is that the criteria used by these websites to match you with other people, or even to just display in a profile, is largely irrelevant to a meaningful relationship. Favorite book? Sure, that's interesting, but how many people have fallen in love because they share a passion for Ayn Rand? The questions are designed to find people with similar interests, but if you're  really  looking for someone, it doesn't matter what those interests are. I've never dated ANYONE who had even half the same interests as me. We've differed on books, music, television, movies, politics, art, the existences of a higher being, whether fried chicken is good... but what mattered was that intangible quality that you cannot find listed in an online profile.  This doesn't mean online dating is useless, though. If you just want to "get out there" and go on some dates, then it's definitely a good tool. Or, if it's your bag, I would imagine it's an easy way to find casual sex that's a few steps up from drunkenly picking up/getting picked up at a club. But if you're looking for something that goes deeper (and it seems that at some point, most people are), you've just got to live your life, and take your opportunities where they appear.

      So I saw "The Day After Tomorrow" last night, and I have two general observations.  1. Seeing a movie where most of the United States population is forced to flee to Mexico in what is possibly the closest movie theater to the US/Mexico border (at least in California) is  hilarious . People were cheering, laughing, and truly enjoying themselves as the Americans were turned away at the border crossing. And when the President is forced to make deals with the Mexicans to gain access, it resulted in a  standing ovation  from our heavily Chicano crowd.  2. International hilarity aside, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen since I saw "Volcano" in the theater with only 2 other people. I highly recommend catching a matinee with a friend who doesn't mind snarky whispers and decent climatological special effects. It's worth the price of a ticket just to see the completely insipid dialogue and plot devices.  I've also realized, from this movie and pretty much every movie in the disaster genre, that if something bad goes down, and you're in NYC,  go to the Statue of Liberty . It always survives! Every movie has some foreboding shot of the New York City skyline on fire, buried, underwater, or otherwise cataclysmically affected, but the head and torch of Liberty ALWAYS survives. If only so that later on, time travelers can find it and realize that they've been on Earth the whole time.

You can't beat the rent, especially since I don't have to live in the sketchy areas of North Park or University Heights to get it. Why is it, anyway, that anytime a place has the name "Heights" it turns out to be a scary bars-on-the-window sort of neighborhood? Remember that TV show "The Heights"?  Anywho, I'm staying on good ol' Reynard for now, paying good ol' sub-$700 rent and putting up with my good OLD neighbors. The median age among my building's 7 apartments was 53 before I moved in.  Summer classes start on Monday, and I'm mildly nervous/excited. It's like the normal nervous/excited status, only cut by summer's lazy attitude. I'll end up waking god-awful early 3 days a week, I get one day off (Tuesday, randomly) and I'm never in class past 12:30. Should be a good summer!  Right now I'm in the computer lab (waiting for Hilary and, with her, lunch) and they've gone and purchased all new, flatscreen monitors for every (also new) computer. I'm at once both impressed and annoyed; perhaps the money would be better spent on new copiers that don't break every 2 hours, or more copies of books that are always missing/checked out. Then again, maybe it was a specific grant for "technology infrastructure improvement" or some other stupid thing. All I'm saying is, I hate those copiers, man.

      Today's Goal: postpone my imminent jury duty until August, when summer classes have ended. Status: ignored until finishing  urlLink True Crime: Streets of LA  in entirety, but then called and successfully achieved postponement.  As an extra bonus, I also started on my next Law Review article (editing, people, just editing--me no rite so gud no more) and... hmm actually those are the only two things I've managed to accomplish today. A banner day indeed! I'm waiting for  someone  to loan me  urlLink The DaVinci Code , since I am quite possibly the only mammalian creature on earth who has not read it. I have other books queued as well, but they're long and I wanted to try and get TDC read so that I can participate in conversation.  Still to do (for those keeping track, which is basically just me): - figure out the optimal method of resolving my moving violation ticket - determine into which dark chasm the Financial Aid Office has misplaced my summer money - go to the optometrist and get a new prescription for me peepers - play some GTA:Vice City  Which do you think I'll do now?

      When faced with contradicting sentiment from someone, how do you know what's real - their actions, or their words? Someone can say lovely things but fail to act in a similar manner, whereas someone else can say nothing but find a way to always show up when you need them. Is one more indicative of actual feeling than the other?  In one man's opinion (mine), yes. Absolutely yes. This goes for all kinds of relationships, too - familial, friendships, etc. The thing about words is that they're easy to say. Some people are quite gifted in spinning a tale of epic love, and at the time they may actually mean what they say. But there's a reason they say that "talk is cheap," and that's because actions aren't. Actions require forethought; you've got to think about the person when they're not around, because action (usually) requires planning. Talking requires no planning, however, so those who are even marginally skilled at stringing together sentences can come up with the right words to defuse a situation on the fly.   That's why actions mean more than words. Obviously, some people can mean what they say and say what they mean. But if they don't act to back those words up, then what they say is hollow and shouldn't be given any credit for simple platitudes.   This may seem obvious to many people, but when you're actually in a situation, whether it's with a best friend, girlfriend, or parent, it can be difficult to see. But we all know, instinctively, when someone isn't living up to their stated intentions. What makes it hard to fix is the fact that, when it is pointed out that Person A isn't acting how Person B thinks they should, they have to  talk  about the situation. And Person A can easily talk their way out of the problem, yet remain unchanged when it comes to acting differently.  When it all comes together, he or she will act and speak off the same page, and that's when you can take the words to heart.

      What? I'm still here, and I've got 18 minutes before I hit 2 days with no post, so here we go!  Last Thursday I went to "Screen on the Green" (San Diego version) which I must say isn't quite as fulfilling as the Washington, DC version. Primarily because the "screen" is much smaller, so when you're way in the back it's almost impossible to see. We saw "The Music Man" and it reminded me why I dislike musicals. However, the atmosphere makes it well worth going, and after about 15 minutes of attempting to watch the movie we dissolved into mocking it and using a nearby light to make shadow puppets on the vast grassy expanse that lay peppered with actual film watchers.   Yesterday, I had the pleasure of going to see "Twelfth Night" by a very impressive  urlLink acting troupe  that performs using only modern clothes and sparse, sparse sets. The show thus rests upon the performances of the actors and this group was entirely up to the task. Not only did they make "Twelfth Night" understandable, but it was even  entertaining . If you've read and/or seen the play, you know what I mean when I say that's high praise.  Which brings you pretty much up-to-date! More later when I, you know, live more.

      The Cable News Network seems very proud of the fact that they're "the first and only network" to anchor from the floor of the convention. I'm very happy that they're so enamored with their coup, but somebody should probably mention that it makes it really hard to watch when you have 500 people wandering around behind the anchors.  And sometimes, as it was during the 5 minutes of Crossfire I watched yesterday, the convention hall is so loud that understanding the guests/interviewees is nearly impossible.   So they get points for trying, I guess, but lose points for actual execution. Still better than FOX News, but then CNN could run a test pattern and it would be more informative. I get all my convention news from the Daily Show, anyhow. It rules more than you.    UPDATE : Blogger says this was my 666th post. More proof that CNN is the antichrist! Or maybe it's all cable news. Or maybe television in general. Or maybe  I'm  the antichrist! But then again I think I'd know if I was. I'd have much sweeter threads.

      And one to go. The Crim Pro final was hard, given that it was multiple choice and only 40 questions. But we're talking about  tough-ass  multiple choice, people, not that namby-pamby "one obvious right answer" crap that you undergrads are used to.   Right. So, short update today as I indeed have some Professional Responsibility to learn (emphasis on learn--class attendance has been useless as far as discerning actual knowledge is concerned) and some video games to play. I mean, I have to decompress a  little bit  before my next test, right?

      Memory! You don't know how important it is to a computer until you triple how much you have. And then, wow!  Actually, it's not so much "wow!" as it is "huh." Memory is sort of the quiet, uncomplaining hardworker of a computer, rarely causing problems but integral to most functions. I tossed in another 512 megs today and lo and behold, everything runs the same at first. But I fired up some previously choppy games (Battlefield: Vietnam, for instance) and boy does that extra bit help. Load times are faster, busy maps run without a hitch, and in general the computer runs smoother overall.  I had another, longer post about the psychological ramifications of sex after the demise of a relationship, but we'll just save that for another day, because it's too sunny out to pontificate about such things.

      Well I  almost  went to the Comic-Con yesterday, until I turned on the news. People had been lined up since dawn to get in, and the average wait was something like 2 hours. Once inside, it might have been cool (though expensive--$30 I literally don't have) so next year I will plan ahead, buy cheaper passes online before the event, and hope that I'm still in San Diego in late July.  Where am I now, you ask? Okay, well let's assume you asked. Fine, be that way, but I'm going to tell you anyhow: the library! Yes it's a return to Sunday in the library for Sam, because in 2 days I have 2 finals back-to-back and must prepare. That's why I'm... writing a blog entry.  It's too bad because it's a really nice day out, and I could be hanging out with people I don't see often enough. Instead I frittered too much of my Saturday away on Professional Responsibility and now must devote copious amounts of Sunday brain time (usually reserved for the Sunday crossword and whatever "100 Best" list is running on VH1 that day) to Criminal Procedure.  I did see Spidey 2 again, and it rocked my ass just as much as the first time, if not more. But I was again cursed with a fussy baby and parents who refuse to leave the theater (or--and this may sound out of left field--choose not to attend a movie with their 7-month-old). Fortunately the baby was less fussy and not seated directly in front of me, so it didn't hamper the experience as much as the first show.   And now: the 4th Amendment, the 6th Amendment, and the gradual transformation of my cognitive brain function to jelly.

      You can read the account  urlLink here , if you haven't already. I refuse to link to the original article because it makes me so goddamn annoyed.  In a nutshell, a woman flew from Detroit to L.A. on a plane with 14 Syrian musicians, and got so upset over what she thought was a terrorist hijacking in the making that she nearly fainted. The musicians were, in fact, musicians, on zero terrorist watch lists and in no way dangerous. They were Syrian, they used the bathroom, and they knew each other.   I can understand being nervous on the plane. That's just ignorance combined with the general fear induced by air travel. But the part that makes me  furious  is that she wrote a whole article about it and, despite the involvement in the FBI and other law enforcement agencies (who have all said the men are completely innocent) she still insists that they were doing some sort of "dry run".  Let me say it as loudly as the Internet allows:  THEY WERE MUSICIANS YOU STUPID BITCH . In their oddly shaped cases? Musical instruments. They congregated in the aisles? They knew each other--any 14 people traveling together would act the same EXACT way, and in fact these men were quiet and disturbed nobody with their actions, only with their race. They went to the bathroom? So did most of the passengers on the 4 hour flight, but because they weren't Syrian this stupid whore didn't notice.  I just saw her on CNN saying "I know they were 'just musicians' but apparently all terrorists have to do is learn to play instruments. I'm sure it was a dry run." Based on what? What? NOTHING. Law enforcement investigated the hell out of all 14 men, confirmed their booking at a casino out here in SoCal, and ran their names through every single known list of terrorists in existence. She refuses to admit she's a racist moron, even in the light of completely uncontroverted evidence proving that she is. It wasn't a dry run, they played their gigs and they went home. It was only a dry run if you think every vaguely-Arabic airline passenger is planning on hijacking the plane. If that were the case, every flight from the mideast would be hijacked because (shocker) they're positively full of Arabs!  Just had to add my two cents to an already crowded forum. You can read more about this hysterical broad at  urlLink Salon.com  as well.

       urlLink This damn thing  is responsible for directing at least a dozen people to my blog in the past couple days. I'm not sure why but apparently if you  urlLink Google Image Search  for "turkey" my blog is home to the 4th entry. This is odd because I'm not actually hosting that image, of course, I simply linked to it one Thanksgiving (months and months ago).   All of sudden Google thinks I'm top dog (well, 4th dog) for such images. Welcome all you crazy turkey image hunters! I bid you go in peace and good luck finding tryptophanic fowl you so desperately seem to seek.

      This weekend is the annual  urlLink San Diego Comic Convention  (BiMonSciFiCon!), which is probably the biggest comic book convention in the United States. Don't quote me on that or anything, though. When I was in my comic-collecting heyday, the SDCC was like mecca to my dorky self, but eternally out of reach. Now, I still enjoy the odd comic book or two, but despite being  in the same city  as the Comic Con, I have yet to go. Deep inside me, my 13-year-old self is enraged.  But depending on how my outlining goes tomorrow, I may actually try and stop by on Friday or Saturday. Just to see what's the hubbub, bub. I lack in a like-minded companion for such an adventure, but if memory serves, quiet single guys are plentiful at comic book conventions.  This one is pretty huge though--Sarah Michelle Gellar will be there, as will Eliza Dushku, Jude Law, and a crapload of other fairly famous people. So don't cry for me, Argentina. I may recapture (more of) my inner dork after all!

      PTSD, that's what I got from watching  urlLink "Six Feet Under"  last night on HBO. It started out in the usual way, with multiple scenes briefly discussing each story arc. And then WHAP, one quick punch to David's nose and we're on our way towards a truly disturbing half-hour of television.  Why oh why didn't David just beat the snot out of that little shit? Yeah, he had a gun, but he  clearly  had two or three perfectly good moments with which to escape and/or deliver a whuppin'.  Am I just armchair quarterbacking his reactions? Would I be any less sniveling in the face of such a situation? I'd like to think so, but then I've never been held hostage by a crack-using bisexual sociopath. Not this week, anyway.

      Things are in a lull right now. There's no real explanation beyond the obvious--I don't have much to do--but in times of low stress, I find myself stressing over the much bigger picture.   The end of law school is in sight, now. One year left, then the bar exam (but in which state, I'm not sure), then... what? I've been far too lax in seriously considering my employment options, but then again I've got an entire year in which I'll only be taking 18 total credits and have plenty of time to job hunt. I hope having "Law Review" on my resume is as helpful as people say it is.  Then there's the rest of my life, which at times seems full and at other times as empty as can be. It's as if I've finally figured out what I want from friends and out of more serious relationships, but cannot find anybody to fulfill those roles correctly. This is not a dig on any of my current friends, just commentary on my friend-seeking ability since moving to San Diego. School is usually busy enough that I have neither the time nor the inclination to ponder such trivialities. But school is wrapping up, and it has become glaringly obvious that I've nothing to fill the space with.  Enough griping. There's nothing You, My Blogging Public, are required to do except sit back and watch my gradual descent into madness. Haha! Just kidding. And this is not a request for suggestions, so please refrain. It's not that I don't have ideas of what to do, it's that I'm slow to implement them.   But no worries, venting it on the ol' blog has helped, and now it's time to attend Professional Responsibility (aka "the class that seems 17 hours long but, according to my watch and outside observers, is only 2").  Oh, and  urlLink Spider-Man 2 ?  Rocked my world , man.

      After a long (well, 4 weeks) absence, I finally returned to the gym yesterday and am definitely feeling achy today. I really wish it were closer, though, because I think part of my problem is that in peak traffic hours, it can take 20 minutes to get there. 20 minutes!  Anyway, summer is almost over so it's appropriate that I would choose  now  to go back. But hey, I pay $25/month, I should be going at least once per $25, right? I also ran for the first time in ages, instead of using the bike or the erg. Running is sometimes more relaxing, and is a nice median between the ease of the bike and the difficulty of the erg.   Weird new interface in blogger, though I like the ability to Ctrl-key for bold and italics. Easier than that whole HTML interface, but sad to see yet another skill of mine pass into complete uselessness.   Only one week of classes left for summer! Let us celebrate with the eating of ice-cream and the watching of a movie.   UPDATE: I don't like the new interface. It crashed my browser twice and put all kinds of weird linebreaks in my post. Down with features!

      The 4th amendment prohibits search and seizure without a warrant. It is a basic tenet of the Constitution and a staple of criminal procedure that the government has no right to rifle through your things or put you in custody without probable cause. There are many exceptions or qualifications to the 4th Amendment (like exigent circumstances), but one of the most interesting related issues is the exclusion of evidence obtained in a search that violates the 4th.   It may seem obvious to most people that if finding the evidence violated the Constitution, using the evidence in court to prosecute is also prohibited. But in fact, Congress and the Courts have come dangerously close to removing that exclusionary rule from use and replacing it with a monetary award. That is, if your house is searched without a warrant or probable cause, and they find 50 lbs. of cocaine, they can use it against you in a criminal trial but would be liable to you in civil court for something like $10,000.   Fortunately, that is not the current lawprosecutors simply cannot use evidence obtained illegally. Many people object to this because it applies only to criminals (it wouldn't be evidence against you if you committed no crime) and hampers effective prosecution. Thats why in 1995, Congress tried to pass a law removing the rule and inserting monetary damages. The thought was that it would create the same, and perhaps a greater, deterrent effect and police still wouldn't search and seize without warrants because theyd have to pay.  Which rather long-windedly brings me to my point. If such a law were passed, I dont think it would have nearly as much of a deterrent effect as Congress might suppose. Police would use covert surveillance anytime and anywhere they wished, without need for any suspicion or warrant, and would only move to obtain evidence when the crime it indicated was severe enough to warrant paying for the illegal search. But if you dont have evidence of a crime in your house, and the police are bugging you, when will you initiate a civil suit? When would you even know youd been searched? Technology would allow widespread abuse of police power and most people would never even know they were being watched. Youd only find out when the police came to arrest you and confiscate the evidence, and then a $10,000 award seems awfully insignificant when compared to the prison sentence you may be receiving.

      According to Blogger's statistics,  urlLink this right here  is my 400th outgoing link.  There are so many people I need to thank, I really don't know where to begin. All those folks on the navigation bar at the right, they've all been great. MSNBC and the Washington Post (23 links) for great stories about whatever is amusing me/pissing me off that day. Slate.com for very informative columns, especially the Jurisprudence stuff (16 links). And finally God (63 mentions), without whom none of this would be possible. Or so I've been told.  In honor of the many links I've created, the above multi-cited paragraph will be completely linkless. Also because I'm lazy. Since I'm messing around, I'll also note that I use the F-word only 4 times in this blog, though the S-word pops up 14 times. I've said "damn" more times than I have the energy to count. Lazy, remember?

      As sort-of promised,  urlLink here are the pictures  I took at the wedding. I reiterate that I am in no way "skilled" at composition or lighting and remind everyone (sisters of mine, mostly) that there were two professional photographers as well as a free FunSaver at every table.   So check out the only picture I took of the  urlLink Happy Couple . Or other pictures of  urlLink two   urlLink people , only 3/4 of whom are  urlLink couples . There's also one that better reflects the very cool  urlLink lighting scheme  they had going, courtesy of my moody camera that uses a flash only when it feels like it. It was my first time meeting Adam's girlfriend Jill, who is very cool and is made cooler by the fact that almost every picture has her looking  urlLink baffled by his existence . Of course there are  urlLink "good" ones  as well.  Also, there are a few pictures of the  urlLink bachelor party , as well. Nothing salacious, just us  urlLink playing pool . There's even  urlLink one of me , albeit from the back. I have a  urlLink blue shirt !  I once again tip my hat to Jason and Dawn, the wedding was really flawless and what minor (and I mean minor) crises popped up were easily dealt with and all but forgotten by the end of the evening. I was amazed and impressed by how good the Torpedo Factory can look with the right colors and lights (see above for a slight example), and of course by how good I look in a tux. I really need more excuses to wear one. Maybe I'll be a maitre'd, the hell with this law stuff.  Aside from the wedding, it was really good seeing everybody and catching up. Or, as was more often the case, reminiscing about the old days. Catching up only takes so long, after all.  Tomorrow, I may blog about  urlLink Anchorman  (the first half is the funniest) and what happens when you leave the parking brake off (brief answer: your car rolls into a wall and the mall security guards laugh at you).

      Twas a lovely affair.   But I'm exhausted, as that bastard of a time difference allowed me no more than 4 or 5 hours of sleep every day since Wednesday. Also, if you weren't already aware, the Best Man has lots and lots of stuff to do. I was more than happy to be a part of the Big Show, but today I find myself in desperate need of decompression.   So no more details for now. I may share a few pictures Monday, but don't expect much because I failed to get any good ones of what I'm told are "key elements" (i.e. the bride, groom, ceremony). I figured they had a perfectly good photographer, so I just took pictures of friends and whatnot.   Carry on!

      I'm back in Virginia for a few days for  urlLink Jason  and  urlLink Dawn's  big day. That means posting will be sporadic, as I have only my family's decrepit home computer on which to compose my love messages to the Internet.   I'm also  this  close to telling you about a funny and weird dream I had last night. But close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.   Tonight: bachelor party. It will probably end with my Pacific Standard Time ass outlasting everyone. That time change is a kick in the nuts, I was up until almost 4 a.m. last night.

      I can see the allure of an anonymous blog sometimes, I really can. It's an interesting phenomenon that the best blogs are often "outed" by their own outstandingness.  urlLink Fish , for example, is grappling with the problem of being anonymous-no-more, and what that means for her blog.  The anonymous blog gives you greater freedom to speak your mind--whether by giving salacious and licentious details about dating, or by lambasting friends and relatives for idiotic behavior. But as with any good story, the devil is in the details, and an anonymous blog can only give so many.  For instance, for anything I say to be relevant, you'd have to know I was in San Diego and at law school. That immediately limits me to one of about 1000 people, give or take. If I were to rant about undergrads or heavy tuition, you'd know I was at USD, and simple arithmetic would probable tell you I'm going into my third year of school here. My point is, even had I attempted to stay anonymous, it wouldn't be hard to get a fairly good idea of who I am. And if a friend stumbled upon the page, well they'd probably know me in an instant. The only way to prevent being discovered would be to keep readership very low and very non-local, and that's just plain difficult (and counterintuitive--don't we bloggers WANT readers?)  The alternative, which I readily embrace, is to give up the urge to disclose the most titillating details of my life, and in return I get to tell my friends and family about the blog. It's a trade-off I sometimes regret, but at the end of the day I find it more worthwhile. And hey, if I ever do have the need to tell some other stories, I can always start a new blog. Not that I would tell YOU people.

      That's like a recap, except of a fictional set of occurrences that happened only in my head and will be either boring or irrelevent to 99.9% of the universe.  Dream 1: Most of the plot points are largely irrelevent (an unknown house, lots of random family, an ex-girlfriend, a friend from school, etc...) but at one point I reached in my mouth and pulled out two teeth. From what I understand, this is not unusual in dreams, as it signifies fear of losing control, or something. But this time, it was so real that I  actually said  (in my dream) "This is only supposed to happen in dreams!" The irony of my complete obtuseness is not lost on me--unfortunately I've never been very aware of when I'm dreaming, and thus cannot control/effect what goes on (beyond whatever I can control as the character I'm inhabiting). Still--some freaky shit, man. Losing teeth just isn't right.  Dream 2: Notable only because of the  completely random  appearance of a friend from highschool (Duncan!), and the location (in a gym). What actually happened is boring, but I remember walking all over the gym and most of the people were using the equipment in ways that I would never have imagined. Example: I had to time my passage through one area to avoid legs that were swinging up and blocking the way. It was like something out of Super Mario Bros., and I think it relates to my fear that at any moment, somebody at the gym will walk up and tell me I'm totally doing it wrong.  I shall not trouble you with my dreams again for awhile. But these were particularly jarring, and I lack other suitable topics for discussion today.

      The Terminal: cheesey but ultimately not that bad, especially if you like the surprise ending where the airport is burned down by Tom Hanks' estranged, zombie father. Just kidding.  Professional Responsibility Midterm: odd but ultimately pointless, since it only counts if it's a higher grade than my final.   Last Minute Not-My-Fault Law Review Work: 4 hours in length but ultimately gratifying to help out and go beyond the usual call of duty.  Other Aspects of Life: looking up, ultimately.

      The first time I remember noticing girls--and by noticing, I mean beyond the fact that they were similar to me except most had longer hair and played with lamer toys--was sometime in grade school. A bunch of the girls had formed a club wherein they pretended they were unicorns and chased the boys they liked or, failing the appearance of one of those, any boy who would run. As boys, we just wanted to play tag and be left to our own dirt-throwing devices, but the girls routinely ended every game of tag early by swooping in and chasing one or more of the players away.  To this day, I'm not really sure why unicorns would chase 9-year-olds, but at the time it made sense (to the girls). But regardless as to the logic behind their actions, it became my first experience with the confusing emotions that appear whenever a member of the opposite sex is present. I  wanted  to be left alone, to play tag or to throw rocks at the wall or to do whatever it is that 9-year-old boys do at recess. But at the same time, I noticed my first real feelings of jealousy when the other boys were picked and chased and I was left unharassed. Sure I didn't  want  to be chased, except that maybe I sort of did. Finally, one day, they descended on me and I cursed them and ran (like we all did) both annoyed and exhilirated at the same time. Little did I know that, with regards to women, this would be only the first of many times that I would experience both feelings simultaneously.  In 3rd or 4th or 5th grade, one of the girls at my school actually started liking me. She sent me notes and love letters that said things like "I caught myself staring at you during the movie about Noah's Ark" (Catholic school) and "If you want to be boyfriend/girlfriend, just say 'green' and if not say 'red'." She was one of the quiet, dorky girls that I would eventually come to appreciate but, at the time, did not. I was already a magnet for teasing (unruly hair and hideous glasses will do that to a lad) and being seen with her would only escalate my daily torture. I turned her down ("Red. I'm sorry.") and went to play with my Transformers in the another room.  Sadly, while I have come to appreciate the brainy, interesting type, that type has stopped appreciating me. I'm not sure where I lost my credibility as the brooding, quiet guy, but now that the tables have turned, I find myself unable to meet the right kind of person. I'm too sociable for the angst-ridden girls, and too angst-ridden for the sociable girls.   It was all alot easier when you could tell a girl liked you by how loudly she screamed as she chased you through the yard at recess.

      We have this one article for the next issue that I affectionately think of as the Article from Hell. Or Dis, or Hades, or whatever suits your fancy. It came into the editing process with  zero  footnotes (as if the author had never heard of a law review article before) and has ever since been a headache and a half.  As I've attempted to boringly explain before, law review articles are known for two things: content and corroboration. You can't just claim things left and right without backing your stuff up--I mean, this isn't journalism or public relations. That's why articles have footnotes. A standard, long law review article will have between 150 and 200 of them, all of which must be verified for correctness (at least in theory) before we will publish the article.  So an article without footnotes is either really, really short (and completely opinion, which is extremely rare) or really, really badly put together. The content may be sterling, but without proper citing even the best ideas in the world are worthless. You've got to show your work, people!  Anyway, this article has been a headache. It's also tough because it concerns foreign law and thus references numerous books that are in another language. This, of course, makes cite-checking impossible to hicks like me that can only (barely) speak English. Well, and a little French. And I can count to ten in Spanish. And I can say "No" in like 5 languages (hint: it's usually something starting with "N").  This is what I've been up to, and why my blog is boring. My actual  life  is boring too. Today is slightly different, as I am off to help Hilary move, again. She has managed to pick what the weather guy is calling "the height of our heat wave" so that should be loads of fun. Luckily she is also poor and owns very little actual stuff.

      It turns out you have your own  urlLink self-appointed protector , standing vigilant against the obvious danger inherent in having any Muslim person within a 500-mile radius.  He doesn't even try to hide his complete disdain for the entire religion. As one entry notes, Internet terrorists may not have stolen GWU's server space, but rather since "10% of the student population... is Muslim. I wouldn't be surprised if the videos were posted using IDs and passwords issued by GWU."  While I wouldn't be surprised if one or two students were involved (because who knows) implying that the entire Muslim student body at GW is part of a terrorist plot is going more than too far. He also says that because the security company hired by Dulles employs many Muslims, they weren't as "on guard" as they should have been on 9/11. I'm sorry, could that link be any MORE attenuated? Taken to its logical end, that means only white Republicans should be hired for any security job, because the mere presence of "dangerous minorities" would dull the super-keen senses of those on guard.  It's easy to start blaming an entire group of people for the actions of one particular subgroup, and the reason it's easy is because doing so requires little adherence to common sense or reality. Muslims are, like every religion, a diverse group. There are nuts--just like in Christianity and Judaism--and there are normal folk. Instead of focusing our security on a hugely impractical swath of people, let's look for those who are  actually terrorists . Then, we avoid violating rights and defaming the innocent, yet we still get to save lives!  I am by no means a terrorist sympathizer. But I think we should find, arrest, or kill only the people responsible for terrorist actions, not their friends, families, acquaintances, mail carriers, or block captains. Yeah, it's tougher to cast a smaller net, but it's no use casting a large one. There's far too much unhelpful junk to sift through.

      The title sums it up. I've got bloggers-block, and can't come up with anything terribly interesting to talk about. Politics aren't terribly engaging right now;  urlLink Rick James died  but what more can be said about that without referencing Dave Chappelle; and my own life is quiet.   Today I hiked up Mt. Cowles again, 'twas fun and I got a bit of a burn on my shoulders so that's progress towards a less pale existence. Amy came and is now in that elite group of people who can say they were the highest point in San Diego for a brief time. I'm thinking of having t-shirts made up.  Of course now I'm pretty tired from the 3 mile trek (1,500 feet vertical) so the rest of Friday will be spent being the absolute definition of lazy. I may also call the bank to bitch about my lost money, and I'm still toying with the idea of a haircut but, let's face it, if I'm not resolved to do something it ain't gettin' done.   Oh, and I made a fruit salad. Just for fun. I had papaya, mango, blueberries and bananas and thought "why not just combine these into one big taste sensation?" And lo, I did and it was good. It's the first thing I've "made" in nearly a month, if you don't count salads out of the bag, hotdogs, eggos, or sandwiches.   Go forth and be fruitful!

      See, I could be a movie cricket. Just got back from   urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  , and I enjoyed it just as much as the original. That is to say, a whole lot.   It's really a return to the high caliber action movie that used to dominate but no longer does. For my money, both Bourne movies are as good as the first two Die Hards, the first two Terminators (though that's more sci-fi), and the the first two or three Lethal Weapons.   Hopefully, the Bourne people will be smarter than those three series and not continue when they should have stopped. Of course, whether that's 2 or 3 movies depends on the quality of the third, so maybe it's an impossible request. In hindsight, however, Terminator 3, Die Hard 3, and  especially  Lethal Weapon 4 should have stayed tucked safely away in some screenwriter's head. I don't want a bad Bourne to ruin the series, though I admit the name is ripe for further exploration ("The Bourne Inadequacy"? Or how about "The Bourne Elasticity"?).  If you liked  Identity , go see the sequel. You'll pay for the whole seat but you'll only need the edge! Unless you've got back problems, in which case you should probably sit back and relax, buddy.

      But then I forgot what it was. Instead, you get this:  I'm bored. Bored like a blind man in a porno store. I've a few things to do (more than a few, really) but none of them are fun or urgent (they include the optometrist, the smog-check place for my car, Jiffylube, and a wide variety of other things so mundane that to list them would be to induce unconsciousness across the Internet). I'm actually glad that my next set of law review articles has finally come through, as it gives structure to the day. Ironic that I actually look forward to going to the library, if only to escape the tedium that has manifested in my apartment.   It occurs to me that this is probably the nadir of the last year--the quietest point in life. You can't have a nadir without an apex, though (look at all the SAT words!) and hopefully another one will come along shortly. Last September/October was a definite high point, so perhaps this year the pattern will be repeated. At least I will have started with my final year of law school. I remember thinking that I'd be an old bastard of 27 by the time I graduated, and now that 27 is a mere 5 months away, it doesn't seem so old.   urlLink Doom 3  came out today, and all the game-playing world is in a tizzy. It will have to wait, though, as I am not quite done with  urlLink Far Cry  yet. Great game, but the lack of a quicksave/quickload option bugs the crap out of me sometimes.

      I saw the new M. Night Shyamalamadon movie on Friday, and I must say I was unimpressed. As unimpressed as I have been by a movie lately. That's not to say I thought it was bad--not exactly. But because I hold him to a higher standard, unfairly or not, I expect better. I expect  urlLink The Sixth Sense  everytime I go to one of his movies.   urlLink Unbreakable  was only interesting to me because of the comic book aspect.  urlLink Signs  was downright silly, although legitimately creepy. The aliens, lamely defeated or not, were at least scary. But  urlLink The Village ... well without spoiling too much, let's just say that while it is at times creepy, the "twist(s)" at the end leave you wanting a hell of a lot more.  Even aside from the lame plot twists, the movie didn't even make sense. I don't mean "that could never happen" type problems, but rather errors of logic and plain ol' bad storytelling. Unresolved issues that, since they were left so unresolved, piss you off because they were scary at the time and now are revealed to be in the movie for that single purpose: to creep you out. If I want weird or spooky scenes with no real adherence to plot, I can watch any lame slasher flic. I expected better. Don't go see it if you do too. There are better, scarier movies to be seen.   Also the Bourne Supremacy, which sounds cool. All sequels have been pretty smashing this summer, actually. Go figure.
