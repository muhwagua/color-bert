      At work today, today is my work at home day (I work at home on Tuesdays and Thursdays) but my boss threw a fit and here i am,   at work!!  !   It could be worse I guess, I could be out of work.    I had a lousy night last night.  I had to write the worlds longest email to someone and it was one of those painful emails to write.  "dear john" letters are easier than that was.  That has left me in a pretty glum and grim mood-  great way to start Halloween      I plan on doing the 100days 100 blogs thingy, where you list 100 things about yourself.  I was thinking of 100 things last night in bed, it put me right to sleep, better than counting sheep.  My quandry is, does that mean I am boring?

      2nd post of the day, during my smoke break at work. (don't actually smoke but since everyone else does I use the break {If I take one} to surf the net or whatever).  My boss has left for the AM to go watch the CEO of the business speak about the business (i.e. to get face time with someone who won't remember his name 10 minutes from now) so that leaves me blissfully unobserved and able to accomplish my job without interruptions.  For thsoe who don't know, I have the joy of sitting outside my boss' door, always fun fun happy time for good ole mary.  This weekend is shaping up to be mighty busy...Friday nite is MechWarrior down at Napoleons-I'm bringing my camera this week, hope to get a few neat pictures: I'm sure we will all head out and grab a burger or pizza after the event.    For those friends NOT in the know, MechWarrior is basically a bunch of little robots and infantrymen and tanks and stuff on a 36 x 36 board running around shooting at each other (as you can imagine I am the only girl who plays-although there is another wife who played last week at a different event) and trying to win prizes (other robots and tanks or whatever).  Dale is pretty good (he is ranked in the world-checkout www.wizkidsgames.com and search for Dalemite!) and I am less than that, but it beats sitting around at home on Friday nite-plus its nice to hang with Muench, Jeff, Mikey and co...  Anywho..Its getting close to my vacation time from work (as in 21 days and counting!) and I am off to San Antonio, TX to visit Dylan & Dan Peden   WHOOO HOO!!!   I have been told by numerous people I need to check out the Riverwalk when I am down there.  Dylan tells me I need to pee on the Alamo (didnt Ozzy do that?) which I feel might be a wee bit impossible.  I'm not planning on renting a car (although I might do that for 1 or 2 days just to tool around) so I am at the mercy of the boys.  I think that they have a pool so I expect to be sitting in front of it reading in the sun as much as I can, I think I might need an extra suitcase just for books.  If anyone has any other ideas for stuff I need to visit while in San Antonio email me at home zazi@charter.net.  The break is almost over, I'm debating on if I want to pay 15.00$ a year to be able to post pictures here (I guess the answer would be yes, but I would have to make sure people actually visited the page before I spend $ to post a bunch of snaps!  See everyone later!  -**mary

      Morning world, first post, at work before I actually start, eating oatmeal and listening to the stereophonics cover sinead o'conner covering prince doing "nothing compares 2 u."  Its been a busy week at work (and its only wed)...I've been trying to recover from last weeks trip to NYC (as soon as I figure out how to add pictures Ill post a few from my two and 1/2 day adventure to the East Coast).  Its time to finish with the food and shuffle off to the workfarse. -**mary

       HAPPY THANKSGIVING!     Last day in Texas. Got up, watched football, went to Joanne's house for Thanksgiving.  They have a great tradition of signing the tablecloth at dinners and then Joanne embroiders the signatures! So cool.  Flying tomorrow, I am so excited to be going home even though I have had a wonderful time!

      Day Before Thanksgiving:   Today Dan and I kept it on the DL.  Dan worked this AM, Dylan and I played computer games and chilled.  Dan, Lizzie and I went to "Quicksands" for lunch (different),went to  urlLink Berings  for coffee and hammers, then the three of us went to the Spurs vs. Nuggets (a slaughter).  Visted Dylan at Stonewerks (packed with a good rock-a-billy band) and went home for more AOE 2.  Off to bed and to read my new Enders Game Book (thanks Dan!).   Finished  American Psyco  last night. That is one twisted ass book~

      Today Dylan and I went to Austin, TX to walk around 6th street.  We went and saw an installation at an Art Museum, saw the capital building (taller than DC by 1 foot) and ate buffalo wings at BW3 (thirty cent tues...).  It was fucking rainy and cold 45 degrees so we stayed in, ate pizza from Romes and are wating the Spurs/Nuggets game.  Dylan is playing GTA-Vice City and Alice.  We also played Chez Geek.  Tomorrow more Spurs vs Nuggets at the SBC center.

      Today we chilled out at home.  I woke up at 10am after sleeping 12 hours.  Dylan and I went and ate mexican for breakfast at 1:30pm and then we played Space Munchkin and read books.  Went out and bought a new video and playstation game for Dylan and have been chilling at home ever since.    Tonight we go out to dinner with everyone (either Sushi or Italian) for my birthday and tomorrow Dylan and I drive to Austin to see the clocktower and the campus.    I am pretty much ready to go home, I miss my cat.

      Day 4 or 5 in Texas.  Today I woke up around 10:30am.  Dylan worked till like 3:30 last night and he woke up shortly after that.  Dan brought home breakfast tacos (a purely southwest-y thing) and I had a sausage one.   A breakfast taco (for those not in the know) is basically a gordita bread thing with eggs and meat and I think maybe some onion? All wrapped up and eaten with hot sauce.  It was tasty.     Dylan and I then decided to go to Sea World as Fiesta Texas (which is Great America only in Texas) was closed for the season. (even though it was 75 degrees today?!)  The 410 highway was moving as fast as the cars in the REM  “Everybody Hurts”  video (which is to say not at all) so it took us like 600 hours to get there.     We saw three shows, a Dolphin/Manatee/Diving Humans show (rad), a Sea Lion/Walrus/Otter show (very rad), and (of course) the Shamu The Killer Whale (read: Asshole of the Ocean) show.   Dylan was picked beforehand to be the volunteer in the show and he actually got this || close to the whale (I have this on video) and he got SOAKED!!  It was very cool.  We also went on the 2 roller coasters there, very cool.   Then we went home, had dinner (which Dylan made-yum) and then decided to go out for Saturday night.    We first went to Broadway Bar (nice, had a bunch of leather chairs and a big screen) played darts with Jason and Lesley (Dylans coworkers), got some free Schmirnoff Swag and then decided to hit the Riverwalk and go to Howl at the Moon which is a rowdy Piano Bar  urlLink  Howl at the Moon     This place was nuts, NVTS Nuts.  Dylan and co. closed the place and we went home.  Dylan and I stayed up till like 4:30am talking about um, stuff.  It was also my birthday at midnight so Dylan bought me a shot.     Today I had brunch with Art, Paula and three actor friends of theirs.  I am going to a play with Art and Paula that the actors are in this afternoon.  Happy Birthday to me, more later.

      day 4 in texas? I am losing track.  Today was a wierd day.  I slept till 11 am because I didnt go to sleep till 4am, too many cups of joe and pepsis at the bar and too much munchkin.  Today Dan and Dylan and I went to pick up Dan's check from Burlington (which look like 30 min, what the fuck?) then went to the bank then went to IHOP (whoo hoo) for breakfast )(ate some odd mexican egg and steak thing, which sucked..but we had a hot waitress named Joi...) then we went to Burlington (just Dan and I) so I could buy clothes with his 20% off discount...Got some nice shite..   We then went to some gaming store so dan could buy Space Munchkin  urlLink Check out Steve Jackson Games and some other game....Went back to Casa de Peden to play it, cool as hell. We then went with Paula to the new SBC center in San Antonio  urlLink SPURS to watch the Spurs beat the Grizzlies.  Had super great seats (Thanks to Univision 41 and Paula!)    After the game Dan and I went to see Dylan where he works  Stonewerks caffe and Bar  ate some Nachos and Mozz sticks, drank a nice Gray Goose and it was all compped (thanks Dylan and his boss!) went home and here I am.     Dylan gets off at 3am, we might go to either Austin or Fiesta Texas tomorrow.  No idea which.  I am off to bed, Love you dale.

      Today is technically day three in texas as it is 3:14am.  Dylan and Dan and I are playing "Munchkin" endless games of that...   I woke up at 10 am today and had salad for breakfast and talked with Art about The Alamo and his play and their cool house.  Dylan did not come home last night as his girlfriend shipped (flew?) out for some place in Europe today (err yesterday)  Today Dan and I went out to lunch with his mom Paula and dad, Art.  We went to Metropolitan (psudo french) outside in a shopping area in what used to be a Quary.  I had Pumpkin soup (laura would have loved it! and this samich thingy which I picked at.  We also saw the San Antonio Univision station where Paula works.  We drove in an area of the city with these HUGE old houses (very New Orleans feel, one had a TOWER dale!) and then we went shopping in a artist area next to the Alamo. I bought a picture and talked with a potter about her craft.  Saw the business cat, it looked like Zazi.  Then we went to the Alamo.  The Alamo is one big room, you cant take pictures inside, you cant wear your hat, you cant touch the walls.  There is no basement of the Alamo.     Then we walked along the Riverwalk and into a Mall.  It was a mall and it was loud.   That brings us up to 4 pm when my feet hurt and I got crabby and we walked back to the car.  Went home-rested-played AOE 2. Met Tim, Tim is cool.  Ate pizza, pizza is good.   Tonight went to a bar in a mall (much like La Tigre) listened to a bunch of people play Irish music, then Dan's friend Vanessa (her dad is the Mexican Consulate to the USA and she is from Equidor (she has Diplomatic plates which allow her to run over old ladies with impunity) and her friends Josh and someone else showed up. I ripped on them all night and they didnt get it, very sad.   Came back here at like i dunno, midnight and played endless games of Munchkin which I must buy.  It is now like 3:30am and so I should sleep.  No plans as yet for tomorrow.

      Day two in Texas!  yesterday I flew in and was late coming out of Atlanta (no big suprise) and Dylan picked me up.  Dylan DROVE me back to his house but first we visited Dan at work and I bough shoes on his discount (cool sketchers only 12 bucks!)  They have a beautiful house with a pool (which is normal cause everyone here has a pool!) We went to dinner theatre last night and saw Arts play, "Twigs" where he played an abusive ex-Army husband.  It was very well done!  Then Dylan, his date Amy, Dan and I went out to a bar called "swig" on the riverwalk had a glass of port (fontanseca bin no 27 no less!) then we walked past the Alamo at night (we  couldnt get near it, guarded and all)  I slept until 10am today and it doesnt appear Dylan came home last night!  Dan is at class.  As soon as I get on cable modem will upload pictures from last night!

      I am sitting in my hotel room in Pontiac, MI drinking tea and listening to Norah Jones.  The detroit airport is fucking huge, they have trains in the airport zipping around over your head (will try to get a picture of that when I leave tomorrow)  I had dinner (steak-mmm beef) in the hotel restaurant (impressive wine list, had to restrain myself from ordering a $165.00 bottle of Stags Leap {If Craig was here we would have had that bottle I tell you}) and went back to the room to find that Buffy had been preempted by fucking Redwings Hockey (fucking Michigan), I went up to the Concierge Floor (swanky) gazed at the "Honor Bar" which has more alcohol than is right, grabbed some free tea and cheeze and this little finger cookie thingy with raspberry Jelly in it....  I watched some of "The Professional" on the plane ride here.  That is one of Dale's Holy Trinity of movies.  Good plane fare.  Only 8 days till TEXAS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!, so excited I could freak!  Here I come Dylan and Dan!    Court hearing tomorrow early, then another car ride back to the airport, hop the plane, get into Milw before rush hour and go home.  OH! The OT that i will clock this week!!

      Morning, happy Friday!   I'm planning on having some "me" time this Friday night.  Dale is going down to play Robots at Napoleon's and Mary plans on doing the following: 1.Returning overdue movies to blockbuster (paying fine)  2. Going to see   Sweet Home Alabama    3. Going to Target to buy a Christmas Tree (or if all else fails going to Walmart to buy said tree)  4. Putting up said tree  5. Keeping cat away from the aforementioned tree   6. Finishing Robin's Xmas Present   7. Cleaning stuff (like kitchen and toilets and floors and dusting)    My one best buddy is away from work today which will make the day LONGGGG and painful.  Fridays at work are always LONGGG and painful since no one else in the business world seems to want to do anything either.     More Later   -**mary

      Just back from having a nice lunch with my dad at Applebeas (which I hate but he loves their oriental chicken salad).  He picked me up in his vette which just got waxed.  They plan on waxing it again this weekend.  My dad is a nut.  Its freezing outside so I came in from the cold to go back to work and listen to Norah Jones on my laptop.  This is an excellent CD.  Seriously. If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up.

      Back at work, mailbox not as full as I would have thought for being out for a whole day.  Eating my bagel and waiting to start work.  Have lunch with my dad today, which is like the 500th free lunch of the year (if you count work and work and lunches with dad and work) which means I am sick of eating out.  How I long for Chef Boy R Dee out of the can, a nice homemade Peanut Butter and Jelly, with possibly crackers on the side, or mmmm leftover and reheated whatever I had for dinner last night.   These endless lunches out are killing me, food is no longer tasty and delish when I go out, its simply a chore. And that is sad.   on the good side I get to see my dad for the first time in like 3 weeks, thats always a bonus mouse.   Back to the grind!

      Happy Weekend everybody!  This has been a busy one for the Baumer Family.  We had dinner out on Friday Night with Mark @ Oakland Tratoria (very yummy bread) after MechWarrior (Dale took 3rd, Mark took 1st), had dinner out last night (and lunch too! WTF?) with Mark S and Mikey at "The Pub" in Oconomowoc (very tasty steak) and today we are heading over to Jeff and Kristy's house to RP and eat pizza (maybe)?    I am trying to get over this cold I seemed to have picked up (again) and also working on making a Rooster in Cross Stitch for *someone* for christmas...   Yesterday Dale and I did some clothes shopping for Dale.  He got a bunch of new sweaters and pants and shirts and underwears.  I also got new underwears.  I would have gotten new pants but the line at Lane Bryant was fucking stupid.  I stood in it for 25 min, 7 people in front of me and 10 behind and it didnt move once.  I didnt need those pants that bad.  -**mary

      Morning Morning time, its time to rise and shine so get your sleepy head out of your dirty bed.   Today will suck at work.  Today is report day.  I hate report day. Report day always provides me with at least one headache and 4-5 papercuts.  last night dale and I went out to dinner with my in-laws to the Water Street Brewery in Delefield, WI  urlLink Waterstreetbrewery   Usually I enjoy eating there (they have fab homemade rootbeer) last night my meal was just, blah.  It was a blackened chicken taco salad and for some reason, it just wasnt appitizing.  I'm glad we ordered the 'bloomin' onion as an appitizer.    I think I am not enjoying the eating out thing because I eat out so much that all the menu items just kind of look the same and seem to blend into one another....   Today is "treat day" at work and the treats arent here yet..Hunger calls I need to go scrounge up breakfast.  -**mary

Thanks to Robin for the Starbucks thermos (which keeps coffee flaming hot for over 10 hours, NUTS!) and the new Trival Pursuit game.  Sunday we gamed at Jeffs-made dinner, yum.  Thank goodness for the pampered chef cookbook, that Pecan carmel ring is YUM!.  I think I lost at Fantasy Football to Mark (stupid Drew Bledsoe!).

Today I am going to see LOTR: The Two Towers with everyone.  Matt said Rockwell bought 100 tickets so I guess most of Rockwell will be there as well!  I am leaving work at 3pm, heading to Oscars for a "early" dinner (or 2nd breakfast) and then to West Towne Ultrascreen to sit in line.  I have a book, a crossword, and my cross sitch, also brought jeans and a sweater to change into so I am set.  From what I have seen this movie is super cool.    Pretty rainy and yucky today.  They better not have people waiting outside for the movie, there will be riots!!

      No posts this weekend, it was a long and busy one.  Friday night I went to my parents house, had a snack, helped make x-mas cookies, came home and was surprized to find my husband!  He begged off Napoleons and stayed home.  We ended up watching Band of Brothers on DVD and playing Warcraft 3.  Saturday we went to Madison to visit Robin!  Ate lunch at Pedros (pedros pedros making Mex-ee-can!), went shopping for used books at  urlLink The Frugal Muse  bought the xmas gift for my in-laws, went home.....Mark and Muench came over and we had dinner (thanks to Harry and Davids for the ham) and played Munchkin  urlLink Munchkin  till the wee hours.   Gaming at Jeffs sunday and I lost in the playoffs to LeMarbre.      Happy Monday

      WHAT A SWELL DAY!!!  Today I got a gift basket from  urlLink Harry and Davids   from my friends at Pitney.  It has a freakin' turkey in it plus a very cool Jazz Classics CD which I am listening to as we speak.  It has coffee, chocolates, yummy fruit (and if you have never had a Harry and David pear you havent lived!) and god knows what else.  It is now sitting in my truck being cold.   The disease is not getting better for either Baumer.  Dale was dizzy and sick in the shower this morning, Mary is coughing and sneezing up a lung over here! I am really tired although I got alot of sleep last night...maybe sleeping with my cat is making me sleepier.  She certainly seems to love to sleep with us!  I'm going to take my lunch break....Have a nice day everybody!

      Had a fun time over at the Reynolds'-Kristy isnt feeling well and its possible she may go back into the hospital until the baby is born :( Im dropping off a big pillow for her afterwork.  I seemed to have developed a yucky rash on my right arm that can not be explained, it must want to match the one on my chest and the reddish burning dry skin thing on my face, all in all I must be a medical marvel.

      Long weekend....Thursday, Robots, went out for a drink.  Friday Robots, went out for a drink at TGI FRidays at County Stadium, worst service ever.   Saturday, house inspection.  Everything is A-OK and a go.  We found a problem with the fuse box and reduced our price to $182k, we will see if they accept today....I must call our realtor!  Saturday night we did something....oh yeah, we went and saw Marquette beat the snot out of Southern Florida state.  A boring game till the last 16 min of Q2 when almost the whole team either fouled out or was injured. Funny.  Then we went home to bed.   Sunday over to J&K's where we played board games and ate chineese.  Went home with a migraine.   today got to work and had no desk.  Waited around an hour for a desk and now have moved into my new office...which doesnt suck too much.   tomorrow, flying to Florida for 4 days for work (oh how HARD that will be to go there when its 11 degrees here)

      went to doctor yesterday, heard the babys heartbeat for the 1st time, 160 beats per minute, i am giving birth to a rabbit or a bumble bee, as dale said "the smaller the animal the faster the heartbeat." and i think the animal in my belly is about the size of a very small mouse.  i guess i am healthyer than normal, which is good, i have this huge iron count so that means i dont have to chow down on these icky prenatal vitimins as much (yeah!) i got some antibiotics for this awful cough which makes me puke more than i should. yuck. lets see, oh, im losing weight (wierd?!) yet my pants dont fit which i guess is also good. so thats all the news thats fit to print about the babykid.   tonight dale and i will be grocery shopping or cleaning or buying paint, fun

      today is the second doctors appointment....i think today they check the heartbeat and stuff and weigh you in and tell you to eat more veggies and fruit etc....i am wondering when they do an ultrasound?  I guess there are no units in the office so you have to make an appt downstairs in the hospital...and according to jeff who knows all things baby (and even things you dont want to know about babies) dale should be there for the 1st U/S, ill try to email the pictures around if we get some....   check out my new favorite website,  urlLink THE DAILY WAV.COM  I hope laura is having a blast in San Diego!

      Doctors appointment went well in Thursday.  I guess I have a large womb.  I am not sure if that was bad news or not because the OB is a very wierd lady. Have an ultrasound next week Friday.  I dont know if thats when we can find out if its a boy or not...whatever....   Puked this morning right out of the shower, very pleasant. Treat day at work, made cookies and taco pie and brought in candy and chips...all seemed to go over well. Alan brought in bagels. No plans as such for this weekend, maybe doing the D&D thing on Sunday...my guess is mr. dont call dont write wont show up, which isnt a big loss really, mikey may be paintballing so he may be out as well and I think muench is visiting Vic in Indiana this weekend....more later.

Yum, then plan on coming home and going to sleep...no plans for tomorrow night, maybe get a pizza and rent a dvd or watch one of my own, maybe simpsons season 2?  who knows....saturday we have mechwarrior in the am, nothing at nite...sunday gaming over here?  with Jeff and co....hopefully dale comes home by then...

      happy memorial day.  today we plan on hitting the gym (pool), heading down to mikeys pond for the annual dan and mike happy birthday/memorial day BBQ (looking forward to my cheddar brats), vanessa is coming over with josh around 2:30 (i think) to drop off my candles, see the cat, see the house...then dale wants to mow the lawn before he leaves for his trip to PA.     yesterday we did yard work.  i edged the new flower beds, dale trimmed all the bushes (we now have a pile of branches all over the place.), and we decided to grill out BBQ chicken on our new miniweber grill (yummy and BBQ-y). repainted one of the new dressers and attached knobs, planning on painting the 2nd one today. watched the mavs lose to the spurs (which should make the pedens happy), went to bed.  back hurts a lot and dale says i am walking like a pregnant lady, which i think means i waddle.   we have girls names picked out, which is cool...i am almost done making the baby blanket, next thing to work on, bibs.

      Yet another lazy work filled day at home.  Its now the end of the day so its very sunny in the kids room (where I work) so the cat is doped out on the floor in the sun and I'm pretty doped out here.  Have spent most of the day working or resting, the kids are moving alot and I get tired easily....Dale coming home early this week due to July 4th so we may get to eat dinner early and hit the gym...!

      hello...today and last nite were busy nites...went to Johnson Creek with jeff and dale to play mechwarrior (dale won) which was good since he lost today at Hobbytown (woo hoo muench!) and was cheated at AGP tonite.  I guess Eric decided to play a bigger army than allowed and Tim, Andy, and Dale were screwed.  personally I wouldnt play with him anymore if I were them... I would just boycott him as a player.  Now dale is at Steves on Bluemound with everyone drinking and (I assume) bitching.    News for everyone.  Our Babyshower with all our friends is on July 12th, 2003, our place, I think 3pm, check with robin for details...if you didnt get an invite or an email invite, come anyways...bring lawn chairs, bring lawn games, bring sunscreen.  We are registered at  urlLink Target  &  urlLink Babies R Us  hoorah.   tomorrow is visiting the kitty at the baumers, going to my aunts for the family baby shower and coming home with 100000 baby thingys which need to be put away.  According to Jeff we will get more blankets than we know what to do with.     Tonight I was locked out of the house so I spent a few hours at Jeff and Kristys eating dinner, playing with Kieran etc...Went to the family house and lay down and finally dale picked me up to come home where I have been watching "seven" on tv.  That was pretty stupid because now I am wired and cant sleep.  ergo, I am blogging at 12:24am.  I also found a new sign of the end of the world, I guess Dennis Miller is now in Bush's corner for reelection,  urlLink Click Here  what has the world come to?

      Hello! You can now leave comments for me on the webpage...Click on the comment link to leave a comment etc...Its been pretty crazy around our house the past few weeks.  I'm pretty much on house arrest, working from home, trying not to walk around too much, laying down all the time...Its getting harder to get up off of things when im sitting or lying down....Ive been missing phone calls because I cant get to the phone in time (you would think i would just keep the phone with me...that would be too simple.)    Cleaning has become really hard too. I tried to clean the bathtub last nite (well I did clean it) it just was impossible to bend the right way to get it done quickly...I think thats the last time I clean the tub for awhile.    Ive set up shop in the babies room for my home office for the time being.  Im on the big green comfy chair and the printer is next to the changing thingy and I have shit all over the crib and floors, its pretty humerous.  The cat seems pretty pissed off that I'm in here since she has decided to claim this room as her own.  Speaking of cats, dales parents have a new kitten who is named squeeks. We are going over to see him on Sunday. Sunday is also the day of the 1st babyshower (relatives only)...Which means loading up the car with stuff.  Robin is throwing us a babyshower/BBQ at our place on  JULY 12TH 2003! Come one come all, bring your lawnchairs, grab something off the babies gift list from target or babies r us and come eat brats and burgers and whatnot....We hope to play croquet or bocci in the backyard (hopefully mike can come and can bring his set), hang out, eat food, drink beer (for those of us who can drink) and generally be lazy with our friends!   Big good bye to Derek who is leaving for Japan in a month!

      dale still dizzy and sick in bed today. meds make him super drowsy so he spent all weekend sleeping, fun. its hard to take care of someone else who is sick when you can barely take care of yourself. The kids spent most of the weekend kicking the hell out of me.  The cat is now sleeping behind me keeping my neck warm.  Dale is sleeping keeping the bed warm and I'm working.  everyone else in this house has it really really easy.

      spent like 4 hours at the Er last night as dale has some inner ear vertigo thingy which makes him really really dizzy and stuff.  remind me that when you are 8 months pregnant, 4 hours in the er on a stool in a hot room really sucks....no, really it does, since dale is sick we have done nothing this weekend, i went to the market and got food, went to the pool and floated the kids and spent the rest of the day getting my stomach kicked from here to kentucky by these kick boxing maniacs.

      Busy weekend.  Dale and I had a date nite and went to  urlLink Sticks & Stones  in Brookfield on Friday night.  It was very very tasty-very.  Then we went to look at cars.  We are going to test drive a  urlLink Subaru Legacy Wagon  at the Acura dealership Tonight.  It's pretty sweet, and darker blue, and stick (thank god)!   Saturday spent time with Dan who is here from Texas, was at Jeffs then went to the Pond to cook out and swim and play a crazy game of bocci (which turned into Sand Bocci and toss the ball 7000 feet bocci thanks to Muench).   Sunday we gamed here at our place and ate Yummy food from the deli (thanks mikey).  Now this week I (Thankfully) have very little to do, no doctors appointments, no baseball games, and all I need to do is head into the office on Friday to go to a 1 hour meeting (and lets hope I feel shitty enough to just call in for it!)   Sprechen of that, I actually feel pretty crappy.  Have a cold (gotta be from the pond), Im achy pretty much everywhere from the waste down (except my back doesnt hurt, go figure?)  My boss is gone all week in CT so I'm not sure how much real work (new) I will get this week, looks like another week of updating the manual for training, yippie skippy!

      bah, what a bust yesterday.  We didnt get to get the 4d ultrasound, just a normal 3d ultrasound (albet with the new logiq 9's). We have a Cd rom of pictures, (if you want to see a few, email me and I will send you some) but they arent as cool as the 4d would have been.) Plus my nerve was acting up during the scan so I was in alot of pain on my back :(  We saw the girls fighting however.  Apparantly my kid (baby "b") was kicking dales kid "baby a" in the crotch.  Now this isnt really what was happening as they have a pretty thick membrane between them, but on the scan it looks like shes pushing the membranes and her foot was in the other girls crotch.  and baby a had her hands up by her face, which was funny...i think we have it on the vcr tape of the scan.   the plummer is here now fixing our sink (we have a new one and a new faucet) and the cat is freaked.

      busy weekend this weekend!  Saturday went to the dump, the dentist, the kmart for a cooler, the grocery store (2x), and the booze store (the looks that I got being pregnant and carrying booze out were funny), and my parents house (2x) to pick up a grill and a cooler.   we got pulled over 2 seconds outside of my parents house for not having a front plate on my truck (i havent had a front plate since I bought it 2 years ago) and were let off with a "warning" to "fix" that.   we then had everyone over for the worlds largest BBQ/babyshower.  Had many sausages this weekend, also some yummy spinich dip (thanks robin) and brownies (thanks robin and carol!).  Played a rousing game of bocci in the backyard (the anti-reynolds beat the reynolds 12-10 thanks to my stunning 2 point last round)....then Muench, Mike, Dale, Jeff and I stayed at our place LATE to play munchkin and illuminati. Jeff brought over Papa Murphys-yum.   sunday mikey got a free 1/2 barrel (about 1/2 of it was left) from his bosses boss who had party on saturday and no one drank.  sooo, dan, julie, mike, muench, jeff, jim, crystal, jake, nikki, me and dale went down to the pond to eat the leftover food from saturday and help finish the keg (except for me, I didnt help down warm MGD). I left around 4pmish and came back at around 7:30ish to find dale very very drunk in the pond with jake and mikey.  went back home, got my suit and drove in to swim me and the girls out to the far raft to watch over said drunk hubbie.     around 8:30ish took my drunk hubbie home and make him mac and cheeze since he hadnt eaten anything but chips all afternoon.     2:am drunk hubbie proceeded to wake all of us up by throwing up in the bathroom.  On a good note he did toss out the garbage can he puked in before coming back to bed.   3am drunk hubbie finally took some asprin like I told him too 4 hours before.   and now its 8am and I am working today.   plan on hitting the BB game to watch bucko coach in a few hours.

      So next week I am getting a GE 3d ultrasound  urlLink Click here to see what they look like  The cool thing is they can video tape the ultrasound and also put pictures on a blank CD-R for you.  So next week I can email everyone pictures of the kids.  The ultrasound is so detailed that you can see their faces, fingers, eyelashes etc..   Some of the people at work who were pregnant did'nt want to get the scan because they thought it would be too creepy to see what their kids looked like before they were born, which may or may not bother me, I don't know...   I know my mother in law is excited about seeing them, Dale's cousin had a 4d scan done with her first baby (and maybe the 2nd one, Im not sure....) and it is really amazing.  So if you would like to purchase a lovely Voluson 730/Logiq 7 or Logiq 9 let me know, I can hook you up with a nice sales rep!

      still pregnant, babies now spend most of their time kicking me in the ribs, colon, gut, ribs, stomach, and pretty much everywhere else.  they also do not like hearing the word "out" as in "when do you want to come out?" as that provokes much rib kicking.  they also seem to get a kick out of having the hicupps at the same time.     Happy Birthdays this week to matt and breezy, Happy anniversary to my in-laws, happy late birthday to my mom and robin and happy early birthday on the 2nd to Alan.  Only 4 more days of Jim being employed at GE, i could plotz.

      ok lets see what ive done thisweekend....my mom is 75% done with the painting and the wood stripping upstairs, it looks nice.  it was 93 or so yesterday so I didnt venture out much.  we did go out to dinner at PF Changs with Robin Mum and fred and Jason...Robin and Jason are moving in together (4 cats!)....went out for Mack's custard (yum) and watched the football game on TV.  Today is gym and gaming (here) plus dale is mowing the lawn, its already 80 out and its only 10am....   cool news is laura is coming from texas for a visit in October, she was emailing my old address and thought i was ignoring her! We got that all worked out...Ill have to try to get everyone together from the wedding to say hello, i believe shes here the 5th and 6th which is neat. i should stil be on leave...!

      well after todays dr appt i learned that i am 1 cm dialated and the dr can poke my babies in their heads.  when she does that they do what is called "floating up" which means they dont like being poked in the head and move up out of my pelvis.  the good news is theres no bleeding or anything which means im not going into labor. which is nice.   TODAY IS ROBINS BIRTHDAY  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROBIN!   Saturday we are going out to eat at PF Changs for her birthday.  i have never eaten there but it is supposedly very tasty or something.   also major superbestest goodest news today, the lame ass boss at work, Jim, resigned as of Sept 1 to pursue opportunities elsewhere (vp at an associated bank branch) i will now be taking my money out of that bank and placing it elsewhere, the man could fuck up anything, he reminds me of all those saturday nite live skits where they play jeopardy, if you asked him to name a letter he would prob. tell you "f".  the company only spent prob. 800-900k on this loser and its amazing he didnt get fired months ago.  as i said to alan "krusty has come to save us and we are going to tiajunana" (had to be there), its quite possibly the best news I have had in months.  now what am i going to bitch about?

      Today is dr's appt 987 for the week, or something.  Im losing track.  Im also increasingly unpleasant at the hospital.  I can't tell you how annoying it is to answer the following questions 7000 times a day: 1. How are you?  "Im fine." 2. Is the daddy to be excited about the babies?  "yes, hes thrilled" 3. And are we having any problems? "no more problems than the ones i had two days ago?" 4. And do we know the sex of the babies? "yes girls" 5. And what names do you have picked out? "i cant tell you?" 6. Why? "because we arent telling anyone" 7. Does this hurt?  "no it feels FANTASTIC" 8. Aren't you happy to be doing this test? "no, i hate having to come up here every other day and sit to get monitored when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the kids, plus it hurts to walk and I have to trudge halfway through the hospital to get here to be tested when there is nothing wrong." 9. But dont you just LOVE being reassured about their wellbeing? "i love being able to sit at home and relax and sleep vs getting all 3 of us stressed out by walking in here." 10. And do you know which way the babies are facing? "yes head down. theyve always been head down" 11. Are you doing to deliver vaginally "no, i plan on pushing them out through my ears."   Honestly to you it may seem silly that all that pisses me off, but imagine that everytime you go somewhere you have to answer the same 15 questions to a new person and then repeat the process with coworkers, the checkout girl at the sentry store, that guy over there.  Its enough to make me plotz.  The only one that doesnt bother me with questions is my cat, all she does is sleep all day. Lucky cat.

      YEA! The a/c is fixed at a low low cost of $200.00 for a part that costs $45.00. a/c repairmen are bitches.  Spent today trying to clean the a/c filter outside, replaced a/c filter inside with a hepa filter (was the old one grrrrrross!) and vacuumed the air ducts (fun and messy).  Had hamburgers at Murffs with the parents, had pasta at Pepinos with the inlaws, finished my baby blanket cross stitch (only took like 6 months) and worked on a bib.  I also had an ebay buyer call me an evil seller because i sent them a great item quickly?  ok...? dale is now #1 in the state again in Mechwarrior, i guess he has 13 straight wins...

      i am now officially tired of being pregnant.  Our air conditioner has a part broken so we cant use it (because it gets so hot that the grill on the unit melted, i kid you not) so i sit in the house and am hot and unhappy, at least our basement type area is cooler than upstairs at at least it looks like rain today.  I now have to go to the hospital 3x a week, once for a dr's appt and 2x for Non Stress tests which means i sit for 30 min with monitors on the kids measureing contractions and heartbeats. fantastic, so now i can barely walk without pain, but i have to walk to the drs office 3 times a week, in pain-lovely.  the good news is I should deliver in august vs sept so count down the days folks!

      Hung out with Caitlin and Breezy last nite to show them the house and catch up on whats been up.  I guess Doc and Nancy have redone the whole house (B said you wouldnt even recognize it!) and backyard!  Breezy said Nancy thinks we need to come over and visit, I agree-can't remember the last time I was over there!  I think Ill wait till the kiddies born and bring them over to say hello.  Dale thinks we need to make sure when we do that we dress the girls alike, I betcha Nancy will get a kick out of that, and we may wind up not being able to take them home (Nancy lovvvvves babies).   Dale said his bosses boss Dirk (from Germany) has OK'd him getting set up to work from home if he needs to when the kids are born or if his Vertigo comes back.  I think thats cool.   Had last (I hope) U/S yesterday.  babies weigh 3 lbs 13oz each and are fine.  We have a neat U/S picture of Baby #2's face, shes sucking her fingers/thumb..say it with me, awwww.

      dale was out of work all week (ex for wed which was a mistake) and i got up early this am to drive him to work, i guess driving for him is like driving drunk, but he can sit up and work.  we are having fun watching him take 80.00 worth of pills that may or may not clear up the vertigo (yech)   My children spend most of their time kicking me, the doctor estimates that they are between 4-5 lbs each, plus placentas and fluid which would account for most of the 42.5lbs I have gained.  I'm spending most of my time damning my skin to hell as (some of my female breeder friends will find out) strech marks when they keep streching because you dont have any more skin left to stretch feel like sunburned scabbs that are being streched and pulled.  it is the most painfully uncomfortable thing ever, and there is nothing i can do about it.  Ill take morning sickness over this crap.   no big plans for this weekend, dale wants to play at lost worlds of wonders on saturday afternoon, my mom is coming over to paint, i will most likely sleep as thats all i do lately, or play diablo 2 with the 1.10 beta test patch.  urlLink check it out here!  and gaming on sunday of course, we now argue over 3.5....

      got a double stroller yesterday, took the kids for a walk around the block, which they slept through....they also seemed to sleep through the night (meaning they slept for 3 hours at a crack and didnt scream).   Today we have no plans, since its like 50 degrees i dont think dale will be mowing the lawn, tonight we will most likely watch the friday night crap-a-rama on TV.    Tomorrow we are going to toni and freds for dinner and to see the great grandmas (and the new kitty)

Will be working with my mom this week to turn our hall closet into the kitchen pantry, turn the space under the stairs into something actually organized, and I also hope to get all the ucky wallpaper steamed off in the bathroom.  Dale goes back to work sept 28th :(

      visited my grandma in the hospital this am.  She has cancer in her bowel, but they are doing surgery on monday to remove the cells that are "bad."  She is also malnurished because she was refusing to eat for a few weeks there.  She also refused treatment since April, but finally my dad carried her (really) into the hospital. She weighs like 75 lbs and is extremely sick, we are hoping she can get better soon and go back home with her boyfriend....:)

      well its pretty likely ill be back in the hospital tomorrow. i was puking rainbows today and have a fever.  I am going to the doctor tomorrow and may be admitted. Is'nt that super??  Ihave had more problems after being pregnant than i did during!!  Kristy must have jinxed me!! (haha)   Dale has been super wonderful taking care of the poopers, plus our parents have been working the night shift.  Fred and Toni are here right now.  Its been great that everyone is helping since I can barely function myself.  its totally miserable since i dont have any meds to remove the kidney stone, i just sit (lay) here and wait.  totally bunk.   here are some more pictures of the kids, hopefully you like, we think they are cute.  urlLink babies    in other news our neighbors stopped by with cinnamon bread which dale assured me was tasty. i wish i could eat it.  i guess the plus of not eating is I am losing weight like crazy, the downside is my milk will be effected if i dont eat.

      hello all!  We had the babies Sunday August 31, 2003.  Malinda Elise was born at 9:23am and is 5 lbs 5/8 oz and 18 1/2 inches long.  Her sister, Mya Elizabeth was born 7 minutes later at 9:30am and weighed 4 lbs 14.2 oz and was 18 inches long.  Malinda is doing well and is in the room with us most of the day, Mya is in the NICU because she came out too quick!  She has a bruise on her nose (thanks mom) and some fluid in her lungs (because she didnt get pushed for like 30 min like her sister to clear it out) and she is getting antibiotics for something, I just dont remember what!  I just finished holding her and she is getting a lovely suntan from the lamp in the NICU, she can come home with us on Thursday. I am now going back to the suite to feed Malinda (again) provided she can figure the whole sucking thing out!  Other than the extreme pain and the 18 and 1/2 hours of labor, Mom and Dad are doing swell!

      I am going to rename this page "crabby for life." My new boss hs denied me working from home because he "can not accomodate a flexwork plan in the forseeable future, make alternate childcare arrangements."  Putting my kids in daycare will cost me more than I make per month, that is just swell.  I cant afford to work and I cant afford to quit.  Lovely

Did the MW thing tonight, dale won the fellowship and got a toy, hooray for him hey? Today girls went to walmart to get photos done, the plus is we get a ton of pics for $3.88 each, the downside is its walmart so that means cheezy backgrounds etc... Going to the dr on thursday, I have a thyroid condition(?) gotta get that checked out, more doctors, more pills. This weekend, no plans since jeff cancled sundays game-a-thon, note to self, ask jeff if we should create a blog for the D&D game....

      Interesting day today for me.  My motherinlaw and I took the kids to the mall, did some shopping, ate lunch, and then went to Mommy and Me Cinema at West Point Cinemas, watched "Intolerable Cruelty," which was very good.  Next week we plan on seeing "Runaway Jury."  Mommy and Me Cinema is where you can bring your kids (babies) to the movies.  Everyone is crying, fussing, etc so no one minds.  There were about 50 people there, pretty good turnout.   Then Dale ditched me tonight  to play MW so me and the crabby girls stayed home.  Mya pooped herself all over so we had a bath and a change.  Watched ER, read my US Weekly, comforted kids (endless comforting required), and took a break (now) once dale got home.   Now I have to give Malinda a bath, whoo hoo.

      helpful tip of the day: if you are using a mousetrap to catch mice in your garage, when you catch a mouse you should dispose of it right away, if you let it sit for an unknown period of time, the mouse will be filled with maggots and they will drip all over your garage and make your husband puke.   Laura will be here on sunday, all are welcome to come over monday and watch Monday nite football, and play the new munchkin set, clerial errors!

      spent the night at the er with malinda.  they think she may have to be admitted to childrens hospital for a upper gi scan/consult.  I guess she may have acid reflux which is why she is so crying all the time.  so i have had no sleep.

      Busy week.  Its not hard being back at work, its just hard getting organized everymorning.  Packing the bottles, clothes, lunch, cooler for milk, pump for milk, bag for me, two car seats, gym bag.  My trunk is full every AM.  Plus I feel constantly in motion, get up at 5am, feed, pump, load car, drop off at day care, drive to work, pump work, pump, lunch, leave to visit girls at lunch, come back, work, pump, work, drive home to do housework for 30 min, drive to daycare to pick up kids, come home, unload car, drop off or switch babies with someone and it goes on and on.  Last night I fell asleep and missed the last 15 min of Angel (grr, arg)   Tonight is our 1st kid free night.  Both girls sleeping at grandmas.

      Coming down off a pretty busy Monday.  The sad aftermath is I have a boring rest of the week at work to look forward to, unless something interesting comes up...Seriously concidering taking that other job that should be offered within the month, we will have to see how the $ situation shapes up next year with the review.   Apparantly on the other side of the job front Dale got his review and his raise which was excellent but the company doesnt believe in giving huge % raises.  I think the whole company will quit and form their own consulting firm, then they can do the same work but get paid the "consultant" rate.    Have you made your nationstate yet?

While in Philly I ate at  urlLink Morimoto's restaurant   and had some excellent seafood (better than Nobu) and some Wasabi that could kick your ass.  Ate dinner the next night at a place called the Capital Grill (right across from the hotel on Broad street in PA) they had a nice delmonico steak, verrry tasty.   waiting on the offer letter for the new job at work with my old boss.

      Had a fun night last night, girls at grandmas-went to the store, dale mowed our crazy overgrown lawn.  Did all our laundry (ugh!) and organized my closet and our linen closet.  I have been going crazy trying to clean out junk from my house (so I can get the junk from the basement of my parents house (double ugh).  New hair cut got many complements!  urlLink Mail me!

      The thing I have to get used to at my new company is that being called into the boss/owners office for a quick minute is not a bad thing.  From working at a big company I have learned that when you are called in your bosses office it means you will get yelled at.  Here, I got called in this AM for my boss (aka the president/owner of the company) to sit down with me for a sec to tell me how glad he is that they hired me and found me and how great its been to have me here etc...    Shit like that is nice.  I'm so used to being beaten down and yelled at at the big company that I'm always nervous when someone calls me into their office.  So its nice to have not to be freaked when your boss wants to chat with you for a quick second.  :)   and then I got hollared at yesterday for leaving at 3:30 to get a haircut...so I guess it all evens out!  urlLink Mail me!

      Spent a weekend in Door County, WI (sans kiddies) with my company.  Dale and I drove to washington island (took a 30 min ferry ride) and drove around for a while (nothing was open yet!) We went a climbed a huge lookout tower and then took the ferry back.    We had a great dinner at C&C Supper Club with my boss Kristin, her husband Ken, and my future boss (as he will take over the company from his dad) Mike and his wife Kiera-it was fun!  On Saturday night after dinner we went swimming in the 24 hour indoor pool!  Sunday we had brunch with Mike and Kiera and Larry and Gail (larry currently owns the company!  We drove back home, stopped at the outlet mall in Oshkosh (bought some summer outfits for the girls) and picked the kids up....Spent yesterday watching "Master and Commander, far side of the world"  *(my rating-ih, just OK) and turned in early (after pounding out 2 loads of laundry and an hour or so of FF X2.)   This week I am getting a foot and a half of my hair cut off, colored etc....plus we have MW tomorrow night.  see ya!  urlLink Mail me!

      Odd Neighborhood Fact:  Dateline Waukesha:    Our neighbors across the street have moved out and abandoned their house at 2700 Algoma Terrace.  They have knee high grass/weeds, an uncovered full swimming pool (read breeding ground for disease ridden mosquitoes), and a dog shit covered backyard (they had a huge golden lab).  I guess the house has been empty for months (?).  My mom said "you can call the city and they will at least cut the grass and charge the owners on their p-tax bill."  OK.  So I call the city Building Deparment this AM and give them an address, 2702 Algoma Terr.  The lady says "do you mean 2700?"  I said, "sure, well why not, the house next to it is 2704.."  She says "well we know that house, we have had numerous complaints and we are "working on the problem."     Well what the fuck does that mean???  How many people have to complain in my nice-reasonably upper middle class neighborhood?   This house is so bad that at the reunion this weekend, this guy Dale hadn't seen in 10 years knew exactly where we lived because he said "oh you live across the street from the dogshitgrass house."  Thats fucking weak man.  urlLink Mail me!

      well according to Mikey, Dylan got his return ticket comped back home from the airline (thats good!) which I'm sure Dan didnt know when he called me on Sunday-at least I feel better about that....I called Dylan and left him a message so hopefully his job situation is A-OK. This is like the best job he's ever had that I can remember and I dont want him to f it up. So thanks for the update mike-yer off my shit list.  urlLink Mail me!

      LONG WEEKEND.  I forgot how tiring it is to keep up with Dylan.  He stayed at our house but didnt sleep there.  The reunion was fun until the end when Dylan got his drink on, had an argument with dale and we left the bar (nice place actually) around 2:30....I got a call from Mikey around god knows when saying they would stop by to pick up his stuff, so I stayed up even later waiting for people to show up that never did- I guess Dylan showed up around 6:45am or something (thanks to Matt and Mark for dropping him off)...he was of course still drunk and seemed to think it was 4:30 am...he packed up his stuff and proceeded to lay down to sleep.  I hauled his ass out of bed and into the car as we had to go to the airport.    Got him there in time and dropped his way way drunk arse off at the terminal.     Went home, canceled gaming as Dale had a migraine and I had 2 hours of sleep.  Around 2 o clock the phone calls started from texas as it appears Dylan was so drunk that he passed out in a chair at the terminal and missed his flight.  Dan called me at 3:30 saying that Dylan had just woken up from being passed out and called home.    It cost 600.00 to buy a new one way ticket home, and most likely Dylan will lose the job over this as he had to work at like 2pm.   So props to everyone who did'nt help Dale and I in getting Dylan to leave the bar at the end of the night when he should have left; and tahnks for taking him to whereever he was after the bar to drink some more, you know that fucking helped alot.   Thanks for making me look like an ass when I promised the Pedens I would make sure he came home on time.    This is my big rant.  Im crabby, I'm suffering from lack of sleep and illness-The kids are sick and I'm pissed off at everybody.. Once I say my big, Fuck you very much I should feel better.  There I feel better.   And I will be calling the Dylan and giving him hell too.... The party for my dad on Sunday night was very nice.  It was a nice turnout.  Took a sick day yesterday as I felt like hell.  urlLink Mail me!

      Picked up Dylan last night, his flight was an hour late so we had to fight traffic pretty hard core coming in from the airport.  Got some sausages and soda and grilled outside.  Chatted with Jeff, Dale, Dylan, Tommy S and his wife Lia.  Later on Mikey, Julie, and Dan showed up (Muench was driving back from Wausau) and took Dylan out, I assume to meet Matt and his wife.    Dylan never came home last night so I assume he's at Dan and Mike's now.  Dr's appointment for the kids later this afternoon.  Tonight I just want to sit at home and not move, I'm so tired!    The SBC workers are striking around the corner from where I work.  Good Luck in those contract negotiations guys!  urlLink Mail me!

      It is a rainy crappy day.  I learned today that because of all the rain we have had this month the city of Milwaukee has dumped  1.5 BILLION   gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan.  Remind me that I do not want to go swimming in the lake like, ever......ewww   Mya woke up at 2:30 am so I'm once again suffering from lack of sleep   Also learned today that Dale's Grandma on his dad's side has breast cancer and will need a breast removed. :(  His Grandma is 83 but other than this she's pretty healthy.  She won't need chemo or anything-  Get Well Soon Grandma!   I have a facial appointment at lunch so I am looking forward to a 45 min catnap at Rouge!

      Holy heck was it a busy-arse weekend.  Lets see, The band concert was really nice on Thursday-The piece that Rick wrote for my grandpa was very nice....The bands did a great job playing!  The girls behaved well too!   Friday the girls spent with grandma-Friday night I had my Twins Group Meeting-I am in charge of fundraising for next year!  I now have to scrounge some GOOD fundraisers and organize a Brewers Trip!  Malinda stayed home with dad and had a crying/screaming fit (more on that later) and Mya went out for a fish fry with my parents.   Saturday morning Malinda woke up with red spots in her eyes and her face was all blotchy-went to the Dr.  It appears her crying/screaming fit broke blood vessels in her eyes and face.  Silly girly!  She got a strep test (negative) and bloodwork (normal) so thats all good. Saturday afternoon we went to Grandmas and Grandma and Grandpa watched the girls overnight.  Mom and Dad had a nice night to themselves. We also got to go to the store late late that night.    Sunday Dale mowed the lawn in the Am while I went to pick them up from the inlaws-we then went swimming later in the afternoon at Westwood with Grandma while Dale finished the lawn, and did some edging and cleaned the grill.   We stopped up at West to see the MB practice.  Then we grilled out sausages and ate outside while the girls played on the grass.     Last night no one wanted to sleep (especially MYA!) because MYA is cutting tooth #2!!!!!!   This AM they decided to wake up at 4:30 am so I'm surviving only on like 5 hours sleep and a large Breakfast Blend from Stone Creek Coffee.     MW on Tuesday night, nothing for the rest of the week until Saturday which is Dale's reunion down here in Milwaukee.  I'm sure that will be-interesting.

      Yea fixed code, look at me I'm a freaking Haxor.  Bah.     Spent last night at Hobbytown with Dale, Scott and Malinda.....Took off early as the baby was tired....went  home earlier than usual, got Malinda to sleep (perhaps the newness of sleeping in Mya's crib vs her own) and managed to catch the last 45 in of my TV show while I went through a weeks worth of daycare forms etc....and managed to get them in some sort of order (ie not in a nuclear pile on the floor/table/counter/shelf).   Dale and I then went nuts washing the bottles/dishes/stove and filling up tomorrows (today) bottles for daycare....  Managed to also get a book read (One for the Money by Janet Evanovich) and try to crack out a few chapters of Al Frankin (while I cracked up)   Tonight Dale is getting his hair cut by Jen (and maybe colored...who knows?!) while Mya and I have some Mommy and Me time...if its nice, I think a walk to the park for some swingtime is in order.    we have no less than 5 retirement parties to attend in the next 3 weeks. arg!  urlLink Mail me!

      hola mis chickas and chickos...googled for the hell of it tonight and low and behold i popped into a webblog of an old pal....check out  urlLink   which is run by an old old pal, Damon Payne...We can safely say that without the existence of one Damon Payne we would have checked into the "throwing a major temper tantrum" bin sometime in 1994-1995.    It appears that he is the proud parent of one small and walking, Brooke.  Why does everyone I know give birth to girlchildren?  Who the hell is going to marry my daughters?    Anywho it appears several old faces also post on there every now and again... which is like old home week or something....so hey damon if he pops by.   Watched another Netflix Hugh Grant movie tonight, Love Actually-It was brittish and thats all.  We have Wallace and Grommit and "Dickie Roberts" coming next week.  Mona lisa Smile sucks more as it sinks in...off to read a book....   Oh for those that asked I have read in the last week:   The Smiths and beyond, 2 Mysteries by Joanne Pence, Both books by Anne Brasheries "The Summer of the Traveling Pants" and Second Summer of the Sisterhood". starting on a Rita Mae Brown mystery and at the same time Ed Sikons seminal work "on sunset blvd" which is the bio of Billy Wilder, the director.

I'm gearing up to have lunch there when it opens but im 100% sure the food will not be as good as : A: Nobu, B: Morimoto's or C: and sushi you could get over there in Japan.... and Im also reasonably sure there will be no uni on the menu...  urlLink Mail me!

      Ok...1st things 1st....This is from Derek in Japan...apparantly this picture doesnt do the size of this fucker justice....     Back to my Ohio adventure....I enjoyed the con....had fun running MW....the Nationals were pretty good...its amazing how many people will cheat just to win a tiny plastic toy.  Big fucking losers those guys....Mostly the players were good guys (I can say that since the only girl in the tourney dropped out) who were generally happy to play....a majority of the final 8 were kind of jags....please also dont get me started on the guy who won the whole thing....Not enough words in english to describe this donkey!   I did enjoy hanging with the envoys who ran the event with me, Josh, Matt, Joe, Joel, and Nick (also Rain and Matt (who reminds me of Finco in a good way...)   On Sunday I took it easy (I forgot how much your feet hurt when you walk on then 8+ hours a day) and ran some Mechhunter events, its a quick play of mechwarrior using a heroclix map and a booster..,its a very sneeky way to get people to buy boosters and keep on buying....Both Dale and Nick got some nice figures from playing this....  I also can't say enough how nice the Enjoy swag was....I have way too many figures now to know what to do with them!!!     On another note, baby #3 (and we are mostly sure its only one this time...getting an U/s soon) is due on January 13, 2005.....Lucky me.  urlLink Mail me!

      Hazah! I am back home from Ohio!  The lawn across the damn street was bulldozed-yippie!  We had an excellent time at Nationals.  On Thurs we walked around, saw the con-stood in line at the WK booth to get our stuff-I went to the envoy rewards dinner (yum) and signed up to work nationals.  That was a very good idea, I had fun with the Approved Play Lead, Matt and the Rules Arb for MW, Rain...Dale went 6-4 and Nick went 8-2 (was #10 in the nation, good job Nick) beating last years National Champion.    I also got a level 2 battlemaster bump which was very nice.  I have to do some cleaning around the house, so I'll post more later (incl. pictures) plus I feel yucky from driving, lack of sleep, etc.... urlLink Mail me!

       Those Crazy People in Japan     Girl shoves little boy off building to hide video arcade visits    A 13-year-old girl who pushed a 5-year-old off the edge of a Tokyo building because she didn't want him to tell her mother she had been to a video arcade has been taken into custody, police said. Mainichi Shimbun  The 5-year-old was pushed from this apartment block in Tokyo's Shinjuku-ku.  Miraculously, the 5-year-old survived the 11-meter fall with only light injuries after the branches of a tree cushioned his fall and he landed on shrubbery beneath the building, located in the Takadanobaba district of Tokyo's Shinjuku-ku  The 13-year-old said she regretted what she had done.  "I didn't want him to tell my mother that I was going to the video arcade. I had him sit on the railing of the stair landing and pushed him off. I feel bad about what I did," police quoted the 13-year-old as saying.  Because of her age, the girl cannot be prosecuted. She has been referred to a Tokyo child consultation center.   Investigators said the girl led the boy, Sun Jizu, who is of Chinese nationality, to a spot between the fourth and fifth floors of an apartment block at about 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday, and pushed him off.  The boy fell onto shrubbery below. As he was falling the branches of a camphor tree appeared to have cushioned his fall, police said. He reportedly suffered scratches as he fell.  Police said Jizu's 33-year-old mother had taken him to a pachinko parlor at about noon on Tuesday, and he had been playing by himself at a video arcade next to the pachinko parlor.  At about 3 p.m. the girl came to play at the arcade and said to the boy, "What are you doing at the arcade?"  Jizu reportedly replied, saying, "You always come here too. I'm going to tell your mom."  Because the girl had been told not to come to the arcade, she reportedly decided to push the boy off the edge of the apartment block to "shut him up."  The girl had reportedly met Jizu several times before at the arcade, and they knew each other well.  At about 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the girl led Jizu by the hand to an apartment block about 1 kilometer from the arcade, and they climbed the stairs on the outside of the building together, police said.  When they reached the space between the fourth and fifth floors, the girl said to him, "Why don't you climb up onto the fence?" After making him sit on the fence, she reportedly pushed him off.  Soon after the incident, the girl approached the head of a dry-cleaning store nearby and said, "A boy about 5 years old has fallen from the fifth floor," before going home.  Police said the girl told them she had lent Jizu money in the past but he had not returned it. "I had lent him money but he didn't give it back. From a while back I had thought he was cheeky," she was quoted as saying.  Speaking at a news conference on Friday, an official from the child consultation center that received the girl said the center had received a report about the girl in the past from her school. The school reportedly told the center that the girl found it hard to form relationships with those around her and that she occasionally caused trouble.

      Milwaukee's "Rhythm Chicken" hops around the world By Molly Snyder Edler   Long before "flash mobs" made it fashionable to create public diversions, a Milwaukee man -- who goes by the name "Rhythm Chicken" -- started spontaneously playing the drums on street corners, wearing a ridiculously large bunny head.  "There's something totally absurd about a street musician hauling a drum set around," he says.   But even more absurd is a man masquerading as a bunny who calls himself a chicken. Or is it?  Rhythm Chicken has performed all over Milwaukee - from East Side street corners to festivals to outside rock show venues - as well as in Door County, Green Bay, Indiana, Chicago, the Twin Cities, Kansas City, California and once at a "men's drinking day" in Germany.  "I prefer to perform in places where it's the least expected. Sometimes I just drive around until I see two people sitting and I'll set up (my drum kit) right in front of them, just because it's so out of the ordinary," he says.  Rhythm Chicken's favorite public event is the South Shore Frolics, where every year he rides in the parade on the Rush-Mor Records float.   "To Rhythm Chicken, South Shore Frolics is better than Christmas," he says.  Four years ago, someone who worked for the Brewers spotted Rhythm Chicken in the parade, and later hired him to perform at a home game. Footage of the Rhythm Chicken also regularly appeared on the scoreboard, but the organization changed his name to "Rally Rabbit."  "They said the fans wouldn't understand why I was called 'Rhythm Chicken' and wearing a bunny head," he says. "I later went to Poland for a year, and when I returned, they had gotten a Disney-fied version of Rhythm Chicken, named him 'Rally Rabbit' and I have not heard anything from them since."  Rhythm Chicken's usual routine is to stake out a spot, set up his drums and play for five or 10 minutes before anyone gets angry or annoyed. Sometimes, tension is unavoidable, like the time he started drumming in front of a Minneapolis apartment and a tenant was trying to sleep.   "He threatened to dump water on my head if I didn't stop. He was even holding a bucket of water out the window," he says.  The police have given Rhythm Chicken many warnings but never a ticket. "The police don't know what to do. They usually just tell me to stop or to move along," he says.  Coincidentally, Rhythm Chicken's existence began with a crime. Rhythm Chicken stole the bunny head from work, and even though most of the employees knew who did it and thought it was funny, one co-worker took offense. To avoid conflict, Rhythm Chicken bought the co-worker a new bunny head for $80.  "I gave them the brand new one and I got to keep the really stupid-looking one," he says.  Rhythm Chicken started his gig in 1999 when his punk rock band broke up after many years together. "The best part of being a one-man band is it never has to break up," he says.  But there's another reason why he continues his white meat music-making.   "I just want to make people smile. Some people are way too into the daily drudgery of their job," he says.  Although he calls Milwaukee his home, Rhythm Chicken often flies the coop. He spends summers working in Door County and recently went to Poland for a yearlong vacation.   "A lot of people thought Rhythm Chicken was dead," he says.  But Rhythm Chicken has no intention of permanently moving from Milwaukee or ending his public performance career, at least for now. "Someday I might burn the head in a ritualistic ceremony," he says.   urlLink Mail me!

      My neighbors and their shitty weeds:  The city said they have the order to cut the lawn with the maintenance department.  It's all been signed.  Just need the weather to clear and they will cut the lawn.  They probably will only be able to cut it when the weeds grow big again - will see when they get to it.  At least the paperwork is in order....   urlLink Mail me!

      It was a long and sleepy weekend.  Friday we did something.....my dad cut on the trees in the yard and I think we watched Secondhand Lions (which was really good).  Saturday we had a LONG day.  We staretd out by going to Mickey's Dairy Bar in Madison to get scramblers and meet Breezy to say Hi!    We then went to the farmers market (pictures coming asap) and walked around with Robin and Jason...listened to 10,000 political/jesus will save your soul from the damnation of hell speeches as we walked around.  Bought organic green beans, strawberries (extra good), some breads (pumpkin and banana) and cheese curds (extra squeeky).  The girls got to pet cows (it was dairy day) and eat hot cheese bread that Auntie Robin bought.     The drive home sucked as Mya had a hissy fit and we had to pull over in dodgeville for cuddle/bottle time.  Then we watched two movies Sat, Holes (which was great!) and Freddy vs. Jason which was horrible!  My parents came over as well to say Hi and drop off their lawnmower as our $20.00 wondermower finally crapped out on us.    Sunday we mowed the lawn and took the girls swimming at Westwood.  They had fun in the big pool and the small pool.  Malinda is very possessive off her rubber bouncy balls-FYI.  We then went over to my parents house for fathers day, watched Golf and A Knights Tale, ate Beef Stew outside.  Went home late and I watched a double feature (IE me flipping back and forth) between Inside the Actors Studio 10 year special and Zoolander....3 days till Ohio!  urlLink Mail me!

      My neighborhood saga goes on...update on the crazy grass house, the city didnt want (and still hasnt) to mow the lawn because they didnt want to get sued for tresspassing! (even though the house has been vacant for months!), two days ago at dinnertime there were no less than 2 cop cars, 2 fire trucks and an ambulance next door at my neighbors house (they are quite elderly, I think either katie or Ray got taken to the hospital?), then this morning across the street at the Reed's (the family that has 2 sets of twins plus a singleton) there were two cop cars with lights on (I have NO idea why-but no one came out in handcuffs!)

      Watched a pretty OK movie last night, "Win a date with Tad Hamilton."  It didnt suck and was pretty funny, it also helped that Topher Grace was the star and I really like him!   Girls decided this AM that they no longer want to eat a bottle before daycare, they want to try and bite everyone.     It rained this AM which sucked since the whole office had to dress nice for tonights board meeting, which entails Larry giving a speech and us getting a cookie at the WAC, or something.    Im sneeking a cup of Oolong Tea (naughty) but I have fallen asleep 2x at my desk and that isnt really ok.   Off to the farmers market in Madison on saturday with Robin, Breezy and the family, we also get to watch "Holes" and "Secondhand Lion's" tonight  urlLink Mail me!

One guy was so loud Mya couldnt sleep (usually the girls can sleep through a war) so she was up till 9pm....and crabby.  One guy was too busy 1: asking silly rules questions that even I know the answer to and 2: bitching about how "stupid" the rules are and how he quit playing for this reason etc....    I seriously hope these guys never show up again....our core group are nice and most importantly quiet people.  These guys were incredible fuck ups.  They showed up late, took like eons to build an army and bitched that I didnt give them extra time....arg.

      Had every intention of going to the gym last night after work.  I felt like doo-doo afterwork and went home and had a much needed 40 min rest before picking up the girls at daycare.  Apparantly, Mya attempted t o crawl into Morgan's (who is about 4 mo old?) carseat on top of her to try and go home with Morgan and her dad.  Nice, my kid is already trying to escape me!    The grandparents came over and played with the kids for 45 min or so and then we put them to bed with no crying or waking up-yippie!   Dale actually got to play his PS2 game (something about a robot freedom fighter?) and I fell asleep reading my biography of Billy Wilder-so I got more sleep than I usually do.

      This is what we did this weekend:   On Friday I had my Twins Club meeting, afterwards, Gretchen, Barb, Terri, Erin, and this other lady who used to be in the club but isnt now and I forget her name, went to Gretchen's Uncle's coffee shop (downtown Milwaukee, next to Hannon's) to chat.  Remind me never to bring up religion in mixed company that I don't know well.    The lady whos name i dont know (here after referred as "lady") has 5 kids (in 5 years) and her husband was going to be ordained but wasnt and so is now just a deacon or whatever at the lutheran church they go to.  We got around to discussing baptism and how we just got our kids done to please our parents etc... The lady apparantly is very devout about her faith and went into this whole "why did you baptise your kids if you dont believe etc.." riff.  I also got the "well do you believe in god" riff.    I didnt bring it up because I could tell she was getting really pissed but my main problem with organized religion is that YOU (meaning the not me) have to be "right" about your (insert religion name here) faith.  YOU then need to browbeat, argue, pamphlet ME showing me how right YOU are.    Arg.   I got home around 11 and crashed.     Saturday we took the girls to the zoo for a twins outting and didnt run into anyone but it was fun for 2 hours or so, the girls liked the monkeys as they came right up to the window to watch the girls.   Sunday my parents took the girls all afternoon to graduation parties.  We went to the Home Depot for supplies and managed to sand and paint the new wall, take the stickers off the new door, scrape more wallpaper off the bathroom, go to the store and get home to kids who hadnt eaten since 11am (it was now like 4:30) except for fruit at the parties..we gave the girls a bath (Malinda has a bad diaper rash) and they were out for the night by 6pmish.   Mya kept waking up and wanting to be cuddled, get a bottle etc...Malinda slept straight through till her new wake up time (thanks kid) 4:15am.  I am a zombie today.  urlLink Mail me!

      THE GREATEST GIFT EVER...(HINT HINT)   By Glenn Abel   LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - All 45 episodes of the kids-and-critics fave "Pee-wee's Playhouse," including six "lost" installments making their home video debut, are headed for DVD this fall.   	   The shows will be packaged in two box sets, with a separate release for "Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas Special." A collector's set is due next year, which includes commentary and bonus materials from Paul Reubens (news), star and creator of the series.    "I am extremely pleased that 'Pee-wee's Playhouse' will be available on DVD," Reubens said, "The digital medium affords the shows a look that was not possible when they were originally broadcast or made available on VHS in the 1980s and '90s."    The show ran on CBS from 1986 to 1991, the year that Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure at a Florida porn theater, and picked up 22 Emmys. Electronic rock pioneer Todd Rundgren (news) did the theme song and music for many of the episodes.    Reuters/Hollywood Reporter   urlLink Mail me!

      It was not a long enough weekend.  It rained too damn much (although congrats to the Mierzwa's who had nice weather for their wedding-i'll try to post a link to a picture here in a few days), I was very tired all weekend and sick most of the time.    Friday we stayed in with the kids-Saturday we went to Sam's club and the mall (note to self, do not go to Sams Club on a saturday when its raining no matter how many tasty free samples are offered.)-Sunday went to my aunts house for my cousin Matt/Pauls graduation (college and HS), Monday we were going to go to Mike's annual BBQ, but it was raining and cold and I didnt want to drive to tosa to hang at mikes house with the girls-so we spent a fun afternoon @ the Reynolds playing with Kieran who is a walkin' machine!   Today I have some calls to make and I will have some interesting news for everyone next week....  urlLink Mail me!

      Took the girls to the car dealership this Am to get our cars oil changes etc...Then we went swimming in the backyard-malinda kept trying to drink the pool-My parents came over and they had fun watching the girls swim.  We had a way long nap this afternoon and then took the girls to Riverfest for a few hours.  Saw my parents (volunteering for the band selling soda) had a snow cone and mom and dad ate corn on the cob and cheeseburgers.  Took a walk around and enjoyed the nice weather.  Sent the girls to bed around 7pm and spent the night cleaning up the computer room, logging books, getting rummage sale stuff together.  Sunday Dustin is coming over!  urlLink Mail me!

      ALTOIDS MAKES LIQUORICE FLAVORED ALTOIDS-WHEEEEE!  I ran into a guy I went to Middle School with at the gas station this morning.  I havent seen him in like 12 years, that was very odd.  It was even odder that he recognized me....Watched disc 2 of Freaks and Geeks last night, played Sequence with Dale and we both spent 30 min scrapping wallpaper in the bathroom.  I fucking hate the wallpaper.    We may hang out with Damon and family this weekend, I'm not quite sure...We may also take the girls to riverfest, of that I am also not quite sure.  urlLink Mail me!

      Watched Disc 1 of "FREAKS AND GEEKS" last night.  Why the hell didnt i watch it when it was on TV? What a totally excellent show! (made even better by the yummy Linda Cardellini and James Franco)  Took girls up to West for dinner with my parents and the marching band-they ate oranges and baked potatoes.    May get together with Damon and his Jen and his daughter Brooke at some point in the next month-that should be cool.  This weekend we have oil changes on Saturday morning and Im pretty sure thats it...  urlLink Mail me!

      I had a long weekend filled with not a whole lot.  On friday we took the girls swimming in the backyard and it was way cold....The girls are teething in a mean way so we had Mya having this screaming pain filled fit which neither Tylenol or Tooth gunk could fix.  Saturday more of the same, painfilled kids.  Sunday went to the Waukesha County Fair for a Fraternal Twins contest (they lost) and we looked at the animals, Mya got to pet a bunny which she liked.  There was much screaming yesterday as their teeth suck.  We went to Toys R Us (which was a hit) and bought some teethy things and some letters (you'd have to see it to get it).  Mya spent a good hour screaming in Dale's arms before she gave up.    Good news is we rented "chris rock bring the pain" damn funny, watched Miracle (pretty good, but I dont like hockey) and Oceans 11 (which we own on DVD and gets better every time).  All the women in the house have these horrible cold/coughs and we are all snoring and keeping daddy up at night. bah!  Happy Monday  urlLink Mail me!

It was seriously fucked up.    Tonight we are watching Miracle and visiting my brother who had Knee surgery yesterday (torn mininskus or whatever you spell it).

      I GOT MY EARLY AMERICAN CHRONONAUTS LAST NIGHT, YIPPIE!   Also ran a junkyard battle for Mechwarrior, was fun-the baby threw up all over the MW mat, that was lovely.     Spent last night after MW rereading a Laurell K Hamilton book (book 6 of 13...) Im rereading the whole set this week, I should be done by Sunday, Im cracking through a book a day.....We are moving a VCR stand and a couch tonight so my house is starting to look like less of a disaster zone.   I'm hoping we can take the girls for a swim in the new pool we got this weekend....i dont want to dump them in hose water and see how that works....  urlLink Mail me!

      Thanks to crimsonrage for this lovely poem about the worst director (and ex husband of geena davis) ever:   Renny Harlin Oh my gawd Oh my darlin' What a clod! His awful turds Will get a reaction What Hussein did to Kurds He does to action His apparent stupidity It has no equal He stripped the validity Of the first Die Hard sequel Instead of action scenes That were tough and had a brain We get fakey blue screens Of John flying out of a plane It's all so frickin lame Our hopes Harlin shatters The cast looks so ashamed Even Carl from Family Matters But lo! That wasn't it We weren't left alone For Harlin made more sh!t This time with Sly Stallone. The movie's called Cliffhanger It co-starred Michael Rooker It's like a herpes-laden wanger After screwing a she-male hooker The many special effects Are supposed to be a WOW! But you'll only reflect About the chin on John Lithgow Next came Cutthroat Island A movie I did not see For I'd rather go to Thailand And have a guy chop off my wee. It was a huge bomb The public got it right But when you thought he was gone Came The Long Kiss Goodnight. Does anyone else here think That it was a monumental crime That despite its awful stink This was the best selling script of all time? What did Shane Black write That made people so giddy "She's says a joke and they fight Man I'm so damn witty!" And if you thought "Hark! Renny couldn't be more gay!" See his film with the shark That starred LL COOl J. It's like a turd-topped waffle With a side of toilet scum The shark effects were awful Worse than that ad for Trident gum Harlin is the pits He'll never be forgiven For turning out more sh!t This time called Driven He's made so much dung He's such a f-cking dope That he should be hung From his long hair, instead of rope.   urlLink Mail me!

      So anyways, last two nights my mom has come over to take the girls to the park to play after dinner.  This has been nice because 1: I get a break and 2: They get super tired and sleep as soon as we put them down.  They came over last night to help me get rid of one of my futons (kick ass) so I can put a crib or something in the new babies room....Have I ever mentioned that ever since I left college I really hate the idea of the metal black futon.  I have one more in the basement and I can not WAIT to get rid of it.  My parents are giving us their old (read pretty much brand new) furnature.  Which is great.  I am giving Robin back her big overstuffed chair and I gave her the matching couch (so now she has the full set) which was originally her mom and dads old furnature.  In fact, everything in my house is someones old furnature, what the hell? (except my bed, which sucks and dale bought and is not king sized and should be and i should stop bitching)    We watched "50 First dates" last night.  It was cute, but since when did Adam Sandler turn into this sappy romantic comedy guy?  As always the (as dale calls them) "3 guys" who are in all his movies were beyond funny as was Rob Schneider.  Ive also watched two movies lately...The Deerhunter and October Sky which have led me to this conclusion, living in Pennsylvania really sucks, its dirty and everyone either mines or works with steel and is poor and mean....   We have Starsky and Hutch and Bubba Ho Tep coming today from Netflix, of course since tonight is Mechwarrior Night we wont get to watch till tomorrow.    I get my early american chrononauts today....hey MD i got a 2001 promo card from Loony labs...do you have that one?  Its The Jade Statue of tirade.....  anyways....keeping busy around the house, we have about 10, 000 weeds to pull, plus a deck to clean off (which I plan on hosing off tonight) so the girls can use their new swimmy pool....Oh yes the a/c had  abroken wire or some shit in the walls and they fixed that, now my allergies are somewhat back to normal.    I suck becase I still haven't seen Spiderman 2.  urlLink Mail me!

      So I have discovered that working in a small office really highlights the office cliques more so than in big business...heres what I'v e found so far you have your....:  LIFERS.  The lifer is what it sounds, they are gonna work for this company till they die and have worked here for like 10 years.  The lifers may be managers, or not; either way they all hang out together, go to lunches together to talk about all the newbies and smokers (see below), go to each others weddings, kids birthday parties, and 4th of July BBQ's.  Its impossible to be in their little club unless you too work for the company for a billion years.  Get on their bad side and work and you are fucked.  NEWBIES.  People who just got hired.  They are totally lost and alone since they don't know anyone enough to break into a new clique.  They eat lunch by themselves and try pretty hard to fit in with some group or another....they spend their time waiting to stop being "the new guy."    SMOKERS.  Just what it sounds like.  The bastards in the office who smoke and get to take extra breaks (which the non smokies dont get) to stand outside and chat....  ill break it down more when i have more time-work calls.  urlLink Mail me!

We had one at my old house when I was a kid.....I saw it running around in the (creepy forclosed) neighbors yard on the way to daycare-neat.    The fucking A/C guy came last night, told me it was "just a tripped breaker" in the basement and left....guess what assmonkey, it wasnt a tripped breaker, the fucking A/C still doesnt work.  I am not enjoying sleeping with all the windows open with 50 fans running.

      Last night we made a trip to target.  We have to somehow get 3 car seats in our car so we bought a very thin carseat last night to see if that plus baby carrier will work in the car.  I do not want to buy a new car.    Also bought some bathtub stuff (slip free mat, pads for mom and dads knees and arms, funny toys) and two hats for the girls.  Gave kids a bath, ate Subway for dinner and went to bed (hard to sleep without A/c and my allergies from having the house open are insane).    Watched Spy Kids 2 on DVD (yes, I like those movies, robert rodrigues is amazing) and expect to watch Spy Kids 3 and Boiler Room tonight (if netflix shows up).

      My Million Dollar Idea:   What the world needs on the www is a page dedicated to NFL criminals.   What it would be is links to all current NFL teams and their rosters, then you would click on a name (lets say we click on Steve McNair) and you would be able to see his roster picture (you know him all smiley and whatnot) and his Mug shot.  Jeff Garcia, DWI, Michael Irvin crack whores and drugs, an incredibly bad wardrobe   Then a list of his criminal offences, DWI, status of his case, date he was entered into the NFL Hall of Fame etc...   Then you have a "REWARDED WITH" tab, such as Ray Lewis, crime: got away with killing people, rewarded with: super bowl win and super bowl MVP   Then you could just go back through the years, FORMER NFL criminals (how many jags are in the hall of fame etc...   Then you could have that guy from the packers, the closet pooper, crime, shat in some girls closet in college, rewarded with lucrative contract for the Green Bay Packers.   I think it would be a brilliant webpage.  urlLink Mail me!

      Yea for Mya she has a new tooth in the front!  She pushed through her top left tooth yesterday and it appears that another one is on its way (you can kinda see this "hole" thingy where the tooth should be.)   Yesterday was my 1st day taking the girls to daycare when they had their big girl seats.  This was almost impossible to manage for me.  Dale and I are working out a system where he can take the girls and pick them up and I can not have to get stressed out doing that....  There is a new candy from Nestle called dark chocolate mint (one of the mini's) MAN do they kick ass!   Ordered a new board game off ebay called Sequence....Robin and Jason showed it to us over the last weekend, pretty fun...I also bought the 2001 promo pack from  urlLink  Loony Labs  with my Rabbit Points (long story)....PM to Matt Dull if he checks in, you should go check that out...a new artifact and 2 new (well ok old) mission cards.....  Today at lunch I am going to visit Lynne (my eyebrow lady) to get my brows done.  She is by far the BEST brow lady I've ever been to.  I also need to call Jen (our hairstylist) and book an appt for dale and I....  Tonight is MW a head to head thing, which means very low maintenance for me....I'm hoping my Early American Chrononauts will be in (I special ordered it last week!)...all is good on the baby front for those who are wondering!   urlLink Mail me!

      Ok I think I last posted on Wed? so alot seemed to have happened since then.  I'll break it down for you:  If you dont want to read the medical stuff skip to item #2   #1 I'm having some complications with the pregnancy (some bleeding/some bloody discharge).  I had an ultrasound last week Thursday, the baby was (then) 15 weeks 2 days old (they measure bones etc...to date it) and my new due date is December 28, 2004.  Lucky kid born around X-Mas.....The baby appeared to be fine, doing alot of moving (I cant feel that yet) and was sucking its thumb (very cute). I will try to take a picture of my u/s picture and post here so you can see the little bugger.    I then ran into the obgyn cause, you arent supposed to fucking bleed while you are pregant...The dr checked my plumbing out and said everything looked fine...If I keep bleeding I will have to go on bedrest at 16 weeks.  This will be a disaster, seriously a disaster.  I had to rest all weekend and I only seem to have this bleedy problem in the AM and PM.   #2. I had my meeting on Thursday.  It was an incredible waste of time.  I did find out some things during it  and we caught the other party in 2 outright lies (which they later admitted were lies or "forgot")  There was a lot of things said that were stupid and the end of the day the mediator said "they have a lot of problems and a lot to think about."  So I am feeling good about it I guess.....sad that we couldnt have done this before the fact....whatever fuck them eh?   #3.  Went to door county for the weekend (baumer family reunion) with the kids.  They now have their BIG GIRL car seats and are facing forward which they (and we) like.  Malinda likes to stare out the car window and fall asleep.  We had hours and hours of fun listening to Sesame Street on CD with the kids.  We stayed at the Landmark, they gave us cribs and highchairs (nice) to use.  We went out for food and spent time with Robin and Jason.  On Sat. Dale's cousins husbands family has a house on lake MI (Jonesport) and we spent time at a cookout.  We played many card games after the kids went to sleep.    Sunday we drove home and my mom took Malinda out for the day.  I watched the end (disc 2) of Pearl Harbor (didnt suck as much as I thought) and took a nap.   And thats the weekend.  urlLink Mail me!

      I had no time to post over the weekend.  On friday we grilled out Italians and ate outside while my parents played with the girls.  My Raspberry bushes have gone insane and are threatening to take over the yard.  We also need a new lawnmower as the $25.00 wondermower has died.  I'm putting 'er out on the curb this Friday for the trashman.   Saturday crap what did we do? Oh yeah, we took the kids to their 1st July 4th parade in Waukesha.  This is, of course, the lamest parade for anyone over the age of 5.  The 4th parade is the "kids" parade, the highlight of which is about 500 kids who decorated their bikes (read red white blue streamers) get to ride and wave.  My dad also marches with the Park Band.  The only reason he marches is because everyone who marches in the parade gets free ice cream bars at the end.     We also got free bars since we were sitting with the Fleishmans (they bought our old house and always help hand out the ice cream so we always get ice cream.)  The girls enjoyed listening to grandpa's band play (they did not enjoy the 45 year old guys on a float playing Matchbox 20 cover songs-neither did mommy).  Mya was being held by Scott Fleishman (hes about oh I dunno 300+ lbs of Marine) and decided she liked him enough to fall asleep on.    We went to Mack's for 2-4-1 Cheezeburgers with my parents and then went home.  I also think we hit Sams Club Sat Night.... All I know is for the past 3 days, Malinda doesnt want to sleep.  She wakes up about an hour after we put her down and cries.  She has been up till like 11 for the past 3 nights.  She wakes up with these terrified screams.    Of course, last night (you know the night we can't sleep in the next AM) she slept like a baby (haha).    Sunday (Happy 4th) I felt like shit so I attempted to not move all day.  I watched the Nathan's Hot Dog Contest on TV and puked watching that Japaneese guy eat 53 1/2 hot dogs in 12 min.    Monday we took the kids to Denny's for breakfast and had Goldfish Crackers and Mashed Potatoes off the kids menu-whoo hoo.   Dale and I also played innumerable games of  urlLink Chrononauts  and  urlLink  Pirates of the Spanish main  over the weekend.  (Thanks to Mall Dull for the 411 on Chrononauts, way way fun game).  This week I have an Ultrasound for the baby on Thurs, Blood tests, mediation on Thursday afternoon and a meeting with my atty on Wed night.  Fun and Joy.  urlLink Mail me!

Today has been a brilliant morning for morning sickness, remind me NOT to walk through that alley to work anymore.

      Today I am tired.  I didnt sleep very well last night, my back hurts.  I spent latter part of last night organizing the mech room and now it is clean(ish).  Tonight I am going to try and get Dale to fix the clogged bathroom sink.  Malinda bit Mya at daycare yesterday and I had to sign this incident report because my kid is a biter.  Their teacher said "well we thought it was so cute that Malinda was trying to kiss Mya until Mya started screaming."  I should have told them Minda does not kiss, she bites.  (her dad was a biter too).   Dale's grandma Sally isnt doing very good.  She just had a breast removed due to cancer and went back in to start chemo and her PET scan found 4 or 5 other cancer "hot spots."  So Dales uncle Bob (hes a dr) is going to tt her doctor and find out what the deal is....good luck grandma!  urlLink Mail me!

Did a lot of ebay shipping last night and then read a book.    Tonight is faction wars at hobbytown and I have pitched in a Vincent DeLeon for a prize, yippie!   Today I went to TJ MAXX for lunch and bought a laundry hamper, some kids books, a kids ring toy thing and 3 outfits for the girls.  I hate TJ Maxx, too much stuff and too shitty service.  According to Dale malinda is in the 10% percentile for weight and Mya is the 3%, we have to feed these girls more I guess (even though they eat all the time now!)  urlLink Mail me!

      Having lunch at John Hawks Pub with Damon today-Yum fish fry.  Last night scrubbed kitchen floor and now it is super clean-yeah! Tonight is Mechwarrior and I think its just a H2H...not sure...either way I may have to turn it over to another BM as the baby may need to go home and sleep.  I then will try to organize the upstairs as it is a mess bah!  urlLink Mail me!
