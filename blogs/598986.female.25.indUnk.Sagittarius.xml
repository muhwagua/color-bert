      eh. im so out of it today. i also feel like shit. why must these pple at work treat me with such disregard? is it an age factor or something? because it seems like everyone in the world is treating me this way today. i feel so alone. hold me. :(  my friend, feels a little sad himself. although i can relate, i can not really understand his pain. his woman treats him like a piece of trash, when hes like the KEWLEST person on earth!

      I think I just  MAY  have to move to NJ. See, i dont mind, I think it will be just as good as if i were to stay in CA but i would miss my family a whole LOT! ...not to mention my new found friends over the years, which are hard to find in the city of Los Angeles.   We are planning to see when we should leave. I guess its safer to say that we are going to NJ. We arent leaving until AFTER cochella thats for sure! :D

      so ive had this lingering thought in my head ... I may have to move to NJ with jay. Well, i dont HAVE to but i feel i NEED to - for my sanity's sake. i still need some time to dwelve in this thought.. hrmm.. *insert thinking here*  on a FANTASTIC note: I - am - going - to ----  urlLink COCHELLA ! whooOoohOOOoO! Saturday April 27th. Picture this - HEADLINER = BJORK, Chemical Brothers, Sasha & Digweed, Groove Armada, Cake, Jack Johnson, BETA BAND.. and MUCH, MUCH mooooore! weeeeeeee! Im going to have so much fun. I just bought tickets this past saturday. Jay and I are going definitely but I dont know if my female-tortured guy friend is going.. probably not - hes too keen on being, tortured. :p  thank gawd! for blog! sometimes i just need to talk.. about nothing, occasionally something. ;)

       WEEKEND UPDATE   Saturday, we went to see  urlLink Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones . I really enjoyed G. Lucas' movies in the past, "Return of the Jedi" being my favorite of them all. Although, to say the least, i thought Clones sucked mucho big time. I left the theater not only with a kinked neck (due to being 5 rows back and a "large n charge" guy sitting in front of me), but I was also $10 buks lighter. :P  Sunday, Jay and i went to Paradise Cove up by Malibu.. mMMmm.. They have a bunch of tide pools up there, where you can see hermit crabs, mussels and the like. i love it there.. very very lovely. I really do   im thinking.. a cute little snowglobe would be awesome to go next to my powerpuff girls collection. im undecisive at this point, if only someone would pick me out a kew one.

      mMmMm.. i wish i had some MORE weekend.   Saturday: we (Jay, Friend & I) went to see Scorpion King. One word - lame. sooo very incredibly lame. i was also slowly passing out but the kid that was sitting behind me insisted kicking my seat. his father followed soon after in kicking seats. ah yes, this man was a grown-up! i suppose you just run into rude people in the city.   Sunday: jay and i went over to my moms and had a HUGE ass bbq complete with heines. they ALWAYS have bbq. yum! i got a little buzzed, had fun and ate like a pig. i had sent my mom flowers a day b4 Mothers Day and this time they came out okay. see, i had given her flowers for her b-day just a week or so ago from the same place and they were all wilted. wtf!? so to make a short story shorter.. i bitched and got new ones!  its great to hang with the family and chill, mingle and the like. Not to mention eating HUGE quantities of delicious food. mMmMMmm.  Which reminds me, i have to go to the gym today to work off this weekends festivities and to level my chi.  i miss the beach, luckily ill be seeing it next weekend when Grandpa takes the family to Paradise Cove! its right by Malibu Beach, I think we are going to celebrate Rauls b-day, or just because! he turned 22 on the 9th! i remember turning 22 which wasnt TOO long ago, its very .. so um.. just another number.

      Untitled ====== Baby, you're going to leave me someday You're going to walk out right through that door and never say goodbye  I'm a relentless soul, Full of pride and pity. And I've always wondered how you ever stayed around this long.  You're a lovely soul, to heavy to break down. Oh, of all the pain and suffering you have endured Which, at most times, are unrewarded I gaze in awe in your vigor and brilliant patience And I can not even begin to fathom anything as close to what you carry.  Written:     02-05-01  Just a little something I came up with. A lot of things are on my mind and Im feeling a bit melancoly but free at the same time. I suppose in LOVE & RELATIONSHIP's can tone how a person feels a lot of the time. But, its your OWN endeavors that count the most in the end. I sometimes get lost when I lose my own.

      blech. so i feel sad today.. and ive been feeling depressed lately.. it happens every several months, its odd. theres nothing really to be so SAD about. its just the feeling of utter aloneness! waaaah. i feel very unexpressive and bored perhaps thats whats leading to the depression. that and its been awhile since.. you know ;)    work is same as always. how predictable. blech to that. hey, it pays the bills at least until i make up my mind to move with Jay to NJ. Im sure i will b/c i cant stand to be away from him.

      W-O-W. its been 10 days since my last entry. what the HELL have *I* been doing lately? well for starters, not a whole lot. Although i am still preparing for the move and all. I will for sure miss all the people i did meet especially my really close friend. He was one of the reasons why I was trying so hard to stay here.   This city just makes me want to move to the east coast more and more. It's filled with a bunch of no-it-alls & greedy illegal people. Im sure there are more crappy people inbetween but whos counting?!

      bloggety doo.. bloggety blaaah. i havent been in a blogging sort of mood. i wonder why? i feel like posting something now, so i will. :)  this weekend or last thursday, the 4th of July, i went up north to see my family and see FIREWORKS! mMMm i love fireworks. i love fire. tee hee! im a pyro at heart what can i say? Every year they are getting truly creative in the fireworks they display. Its the choreography of the fireworks and the fireworks themselves. This year, they made them turn into brillant colors and made crazy patterns across the sky. They look so damn cool! weeeeee  the rest of this weekend i was in cat mode. Weeell, besides the 2 hours i stepped out of my apartment to see "  urlLink POWERPUFF GIRLS  " - the movie! i felt like a kid again when i watched this. ive been watching them for awhile and anticipated this movie for a loooooong time. my fave still is bubbles. yummy goodness. :d  hrmm, sometimes i feel that im REALLY not going to move, like its just a dream. It just seems that when im moving ive just begun to meet so many awesome people. Although, there is only  one  person i would like to UNMEET! She's evaaal (with an accent). wehehehe   Lately, ive seen this livejournal thangy going on .. some of my friends have mentioned it, but i like to stick to the basics and not really complicate shat. so blog, here i stay.

      i think ive burned out on this diary thang. hence me not writing in it much. there is much on the mind and no time to do it. blech.  im for sure moving out of this state, soon in fact, really soon. maybe the end of this month or the end of nov. it all depends on if i can get someone to cover the lease.. OR i can just break it.. but it would be good to get that deposit back on the apartment. cha ching!    hrmm.. i wonder how im going to break it to my BUM ASS roommate. i suggested writing a letter to her but jay said NO, of course. i suppose in her face will do. i just dont want to due to all my pent up frustration with her. i just dont like stirring up shit when you live like 10 feet from someone. and i just dont feel like wasting energy on talking to her. shes fucked up waaaay too many times. (she missed rent 2x & utilities 2x & shes filthy & shes just nasty) BUT really, let me tell you how i   really   feel.   lets regress..  this weekend, was a hooot. it must of been something in the air or mebbe it was just hanging out with jay. i can say for a fact relationships have its ups and downs.. it was in a down for awhile but its back up again. i do love jay so very much. so much in fact im moving for the smelly o fart.   well anyhow, the weekend, yah thats where i was. weekend. i saw "Lilo & Stitch"  - a Disney flick. It was cute. nothing too fantastic. just a cute movie.  theeen there was "Momento" - hella fantasmic movie! this blew my hair back! i havent watched something resembling an acid trip since "Being John Malcovich"! wow. go get it now. I just cant believe i waited this long to see it. Just so much to do, and so very little time to do it in.

       what a long, wild trip its been!   I had soo much fun in Vegas. I LOVE that city!! I swear i walked for miles and miles in that city and went through just about every casino on the strip. Won some money, spent some money, won some, lost it again. Jay & I stayed in the Marriott, which turned out to be nicer than we thought. It was a nice ass suite. :D    Note to the wise, the Bellagio food isnt all that hot. ive tasted better food at "Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles" in CA.    It would of been nice to meet up with some of the other people that I heard were going but it was a no-go. :*(   Although I did meet up with a BL ive been wanting to meet FOREVER!!! :D   so i was stoked all in all.  vegas  = weeeeeeee!!

      okay so i been neglecting my blog. so what.  soooooo saturday i went to an acupunturist. omg its like an orgasm all over ur body. its the greatest feeling. its unlike any drug you could take. acuputure, dates back b4 western medicine - of course. chinese (eastern medicine) believe that you should take care of your body from the inside out.  it feels good to take care of the mind, body and soul. this indeedy cures all three.   ive been trying to lose this last weight i have i think i have like 10lbs left and down to like a size 8 or 9. whoooT! whos the sexay bitch?!? its fairly easy to lose the weight, its the SUGAR i craave. gaaaah! note to the wise: it IS good to eat 5 or 6 meals a day on the count that it isnt 5-course meals each time.  not to mention drinking gallons of water. wheew, im running to the bathroom like every 30 min!  OH! another thing.. jay is moving out in about 2 weeks. i sure am gonna miss him. its time that i have some quality time to myself but then i dont know how i will react when hes gone.

I went up to San Jose - the South Bay area, to all of you that havent the slightest, i didnt have the slightest until i was up there. ANYHOO, i meet up with some lovely peoples that live up there. I had a blast to say the least. Just a great mesh of people and a beautiful backdrop of landscape to match.  I feel in love all over again with cali and other things to say the least. it made me feel  alive  again..

        cuz you're we're all spies.. yeah    I'll let you guess where thats from. ;)  its funny as time goes on, things or events remind you that you are not all that invinsible, that you can take things for granted. take people for granted. and then i think of jay, i miss him so much, i dont even think he realizes. i miss him so much.  cant think straight oh is this fate..? i know what to do but my options of which were many, are few  its all in my head all the things ive ever said i dont know why i feel so defeated.. .. its me, with my thoughts alone, i guess.

        ~god speed~    To all those people that like to assume that i am moving out of LA b/c things or people. you thought wrong. its all on my own free will. you or they, had no part in my decision or ever on anything, for that matter. sometimes you just have to  deal  with things. this is my deal. :)  hopefully in the time im gone i can finish up my B.A. It will be fun in Philadelphia, it will be. with my sweetie on my side. MMmmMm.. im just dreaming now. yum. ;)  oh and with this, i will be back - oh i WILL be back in this city again. back before you can believe.

      Despite my crappy mood im in right now. I have the weekend to feel good about. Jay and I went to Carpenteria, one of our "usual" spot on the beach. we had a nice romantic picnic with some wine to top it off. mMmm.. i about ate jay up after that! it was so much fun.   We also got out of the house of LOVE to catch a flick we've been dying to see. "Signs" was a disappointment to our dismay. Sometimes lighting doesnt strike twice.

       Is it me.. or does EVERYONE have a blog now??    Even everyone and their mom on Bluelight has a damn blog.. c'est la vie.  So I digress, to yesterday after work because nothing interesting happens at work, other than the impersonal banter of co-workers and their boring lives. lol Reminds me of an  urlLink onion  article I read awhile back. It mentioned how "Larry" wouldnt tell his co-workers, which were slaves to their jobs, when he came back to work on Monday that he had a fantastic, partying like its 1999 weekend. ha! figures, be a slave to the money, it controls you in the end. Oh, where was I? Oh yes, my day after work.  So the Account Representative from  urlLink CCA  calls me after I get home from work at about 6pm. We talk about details of the school Im going to next year. I thought I would be enrolled for Jan/Feb. sessions, turns out there is a waiting list until April/May sessions. Oh well, cant hurt to wait a few more months. In the meantime, Im moving out of this apartment by the end of this week. Staying with my folks for 2 weeks, then moving to Chris' casa in San Jose.   Chris is a sweet guy, he really is. I finally have someone that is really special to my heart, its been awhile since I felt this way.. 6-8 months at least. I just love the way we talk, the way we hang out.. he's an awesome guy. I won't be able to see him for at least 3 weeks, unless he gets a schedule change or something, but I doubt that. So, it will be more like 3 weeks away from my sweetness. :/

      Last nite was one of my most INTERESTING nights. I ended up totally sloshed out of my mind, I even forgot what happened part of the night. I had a few drinks to start the night off.. 3 to be exact, I only remember drinking 2. lol I saw Deep Dish. They were off the HOOK! I was dancing my ass off until I could just not MOVE any more. On my way out of the club, I ended up making out with some random HOT chick. NO apparent reason, just cuz she was simply HOT. Damn, I'm a fool, I didnt even get her name or number for that matter. ha! All in all, a very kick ass nite.  mMMm.. indeedy.

      I feel a lot better today, thanks to a talk with Chris & an email from Jay. Thanks you guys! You are the bestest!  Today, my heart misses Jay, but my heart aches for Chris. I dont know if Jay will ever know that it was between  us  why we didnt work out, not because of someone else. c'est la vie.  I even doubt as to whether or not I post this. If I do, I obviously dont doubt it. This just needs to be OUT there.

      La te de dah dah. Just feeling a little depressed today, for no apparent reason. Must be the weather, or maybe its just me. Things on my mind -- I'm worrying about the future, which should be something I put in the back of my mind. Just a little voice in the back of my mind questions my actions to whether or not this is the "right" thing to do.    My inner monologue:  Is it? Is it what I want?  It is what I want to do, its my life's career of what I always wanted to do.  Why am I so afraid?  Well, for one, its completely on my own.  But I've always been on my own, self-sufficient and independent. Just a new place that gives me the jibblies. It will be fun and exciting, something new -- a challenge!  Just sometimes it saddens me to think that I will always be there for someone else in their time of need but there will never be someone in mine. Sad really. I'm being selfish, I know.

      weeeeeell.. its a change of plans everybody. turns out im NOT moving to the east coast. im staying right HERE in cali.. but a slight change.. im moving to norcal -- San Francisco to be exact. I will be going to one of the TOP 2 culinary schools in the country..  MMMmmmMMm.. indeedy! :D plus ill be living in San Jose or San Fran. Most likely, San Francisco b/c it would be more economical to not drive back and forth from San Jose. Plus the school also offers dorms for the students, but ironically it doesnt come with a kitchen! *gasp* So ill probably looking into the housing dept. there. For the time being, it is up in the air. i start NEXT spring.. and im just getting everything situated right now. weeeeeeeeeee! i cant wait! i didnt really want to move back east its too cold and far from my 1st love, California. Ill miss certain people but its not like im THAT far. Plus, ill get to be by mah schweeeetie. :*

      I feel simply awful today. My stomach is in knots and I slept horribly last nite. I really do miss Chris, I just hope he believes that. I don't know why I screw up, I really don't. I wish I was "Ms. Perfect" or something to the like, because what I'm doing isn't working.. obviously. *le sigh*

       mMmm.. I feel the PLUR x's infinity!!!   Seriously people, if I get anymore PLUR.. ill just have to open up a store and .. well, sell it. No, but really.. I LOVE it! muah! everybodeeeeee!   Okay, so I have an appointment with the sezzay acupunturist today. OMG.. she is the best thing that has happened to me. If it wasn't for her, I do not know WHAT I would do. I will miss her when I move. She has brought nothing but creamy goodness into my PLURY little heart. I suppose I will have to find another L.Ac. in San Jose/San Francisco. I think she will be one of 3 things I'll miss from LA. C'est la vie.  Hopefully sometime this week I will get my car, not to mention my life for that matter, back! My car is getting fixed by my dad. He's fixing the transmission and putting in the new snazzy top I bought on ebay last month for only  $300  -- it's a STEAL if you ask me. At the current moment, I am at the mercy of my parents (and friends) picking me up and taking me places. Which is something all so new and frustrating to me. I just cant wait until I get my car back and things can feel like they are moving.

        Ain't no valley low enough, Ain't no river wide enough, to keep me from gettin' to you babe    So today the company, well SMM(we all go by 3-letter initials here -- I thought it was quite weird at first, but then the weirdness fades away.. into.. where was I, oh yah), notifies me today that we are going out to lunch on Friday to send me off. That's nice of them, isn't it? I thought so. weeee! I told Carlos aka geek computer guy that comes in on Thursdays, that next week is my last week in the office. He tells me that he should(should? damnit he better damn well do it.. ha!) take me to lunch. I said, "Sure, but I'm going on Friday. So any other day is superb to moi`". So I guess we have a tenantive lunch "meeting" on Thursday next week or sometime that week. Funny he mentioned that his good friend is a chef and he's a sushi chef in one of the Hollywood & Highland restaurants. mMmm.. sushi. If you ONLY knew my love & lust for sushi that I crave daily, nightly. mMmm.. did I tangent? *looks at what she wrote* Apparently I did, as always. I've got to focus my wandering mind.   So anyhow, I can not WAIT until I am off this shift, 5pm to be exact. whooT! Then its off to the bus stop.. I go? Yes, I do ride the bus, at least for the time being. Its a bitch driving on the 405 in rush hour traffic IN Los Angeles. Luckily for the ride home, I have my handy-dandy book to keep me company. I'm reading  "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". It's got me glued so far.   It looks like the job search is going well. I've gotten a few calls and interviews and I'm not even in San Jose yet! Totally kew. I'm also looking at jobs in San Francisco (they tend to pay more over there). So save a little cash, put a lot towards school. I'm totally set.  I just sometimes sit back and think, "wow, I am actually doing what I have been wanting do to for the majority of my life. I just had to decide." I indeedy have a problem with deciding at times, but when I have my mind made up.. I see no bounds high enough.

       THIS JUST IN!! (do ta dah do dooo - musak playing in the background)   Sooo.. most likely I will be getting my deposit from my EX roommate by Wednesday, Nov. 13th.. whoOT. Which would be nice b/c then I could pay back Jay for all the repairs to "lil red" and for the UHaul to tote my crap to San Jose. weeeeeee.. it would be MOST excellante`!  Now this move, as it get closer and closer to the date (Nov. 17th), it scares the crap outta me. I think I need a "it will be alright" talk over and over. Only if my mind didnt wander and drive me in circles. GRRR! It will be an adventure, and fun one at that. Yes, it will. It will it will it WILL! :D  Work is slow, as usual. It scares me to think that it is THIS slow everywhere in America. You would think that Los Angeles is a big market, businesses should be busy. Stocks are the only thing moving. I think I will get more 411 into that. I have daytraded before but its been ages since I actually stared at Reuters and guessed where the next position was going to be at.   Furiously digs for notes.

       BEST SONG EVAAR@!@!!!!!!   Artist: royksopp  Song: remind me  Album: melody a.m.   (chorus)  Will remind, will remind, will remind me,  Will remind, will remind, will remind me,  Will remind, will remind, will remind me,  Will remind, will remind, will remind me.   It's only been a week,  The rush of being home in rapid fading.  Prevailing to recall  What I was missing, all that time in England   Has sent me aimlessly,  On foot or by the help of transportation,  To knock on windows where  A friend no longer live, I had forgotten.   (chorus)   And everywhere I go,  There's always something to remind me  Of another place and time  Where love that travelled far had found me.   We stayed outside til two,  Waiting for the light to come back,  But hid in talk I knew,  Until you asked what I was thinking.   (chorus)   Brave men tell the truth,  A wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles,  A woman holds her tongue,  Knowing silence will speak for her.   So now I'll never know,  As you will only sleep beside me,  And everywhere I go...   (chorus)  (repeat)   It's only been a week,  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  The rush of being home in rapid fading.  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  Prevailing to recall  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  What I was missing all that time in England  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me.)   Has sent me aimlessly  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  On foot or by the help of transportation,  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  To knock on windows where  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me,)  A friend no longer live, I had forgotten.  (Will remind, will remind, will remind me.)   (chorus)

      Seems to me that there is so many people depressed lately, more than usual.. it must be the holidays.  I dunno I always associated holidays with family fun and togetherness. Nothing like hanging out with some 2nd cousins I havent seen in awhile, and trying to remember those 3rd or even distant cousins/aunt/uncles! I have a HUGE distant family on my mom's side, but then we ARE hispanic  -- notorious for having a big family.   So where was I? Ah yah, so everyone seems to get depressed.. WHYTF for? Seriously, everything is great. You have the Christmas tree you get to decorate, the house in decorations. FOOD.. ah the food you make around the holidays. Just when you think you cant take all the holiday grub, its over. And it comes around next year to remind you that yes, it is good. Life IS good. I suppose most people just smell commericalism in the air and turn off to the warm glow I feel during the holidays.   My birthday is coming up in the middle of December. *groan* Yes, another one. I'll be 24 this year. jeez, last time I looked 24 was OLD!!! Although, I love how I am growing up, finding my way. I just wish I could help others discover this within themselves. I like to show a little light into their souls. Things look great in the horizon.   OH! Chris has a b-day soon too.. a day b4 mine(Dec. 15th), that's crazy if you ask me. I never knew someone that had a birthday close to mine -- it was non-existant! Speaking of him too, I love him so much. I'm glad I moved up here for him, everything just fits so right. I didn't really even feel nervous about moving, well maybe a little -- its natural. It's great how somethings turn out.  He is definately someone to know/cherish/love life-long.

      Oh, it's been ages since I've touched this blog. 3 months, and even before that there wasn't much I talked about. Distanced perhaps? or just blazed out of my mind and fucked up priorities -- maybe. Call it a little of both. It's time to prioritize, buckel down and make things happen.  carpe diem !  While trying to make things a little pretty around the house, I decided to 'clean up' virtually. I was on this 'webmaster' site looking for updates, new things and the like. I found this site, urlLink Sitepal , kind of trippy really.  You pretty much just type in what you want this computerized cartoony looking face to say and it says it. You can pay a hefty price for an annual license or just have it on a monthly basis. Your pick really. I think that a free trial to test it out on websites would be chill.  c'est la vie   ***********BALEEEETTTEEED******************** ****************SECTION*******************  So now, I'm debating whether or not to go to the gym. On one hand, I dont really want to go anywhere but then on the other hand I will feel great and energized.   I think i'll opt to feel great.    ciao`

      This is a piece that I stumbled across today. It shows a date of April 30th of last year but for some reason I think its from this year. Its something Im feeling today.. thought it was appropriate.  Baby, you're going to leave me someday You're going to walk out right through that door and never say goodbye  I’m a relentless soul, Full of pride and pity. I wonder how you ever stayed around this long.  You're a lovely soul, too heavy to break down. Oh, of all the pain and suffering you have endured  And which at times are unrewarded  I gaze in awe in your vigor and patience  For I can not even fathom something as close to what you carry upon your shoulders.

      So again I was in a lull with this journal-entry-thing-a-mah-bobber. I love to write although I havent written much in the past 6 months. Lack of inspiration? tired? busy? perhaps, all of the above.   Much has happened.. so where do I begin? I was living in the Downtown area, not too shabby of a town -- just not TOO much going on, I prefer the city mostly.  I moved again, still in the vicinity of San Jose however.. just in a more suburban area. It is pretty nice actually, over by Valley Fair(mostly likely where I will be divulging all of my shopping needs, resulting in an even more empty pocketbook -- as IF I COULD BE ANY BROKER).    Been working out.. down to a size 6, weight is down.. self esteem is up!.. I just need to invent a method that reduces my height.. and it would be all good.. tall is out and short is IN! And sianara to those stilleto heels that kill the calfs of women everywhere! MUNITY I SAY! !! Whoo, that was a tagent if I ever see'd one..  Going back to school! Which I did this past summer.. still continuin' mah edumacation.. so that the companies can hire lil ol me.   Trying to stay on the creative edge... speak my mind and live for today.. its been a rough year, and I am not going to let it get the best of me..  carpe diem

        whew!     Is to say the least of my last episode.. with the flavah of the week.. and I mean that in the most sarcastic way.. fo serious. I continue to baffle myself as to WHY I am still hanging out with "flavah".. he says one thing.. and then another happens.. its all just miscommunication or he's lying.. or he's lying to his friends to be coo and all that shit. Whatever it is.. games are so beneath me..  I tend to ask myself... WHERE do I find these people? lol

       I've had that writing itch lately..  (something from a few weeks ago)   Maybe this time isn't to be The dreamer born to late for fall's spring Enchanted by earth's beauty and the simple way she moves It is no wonder this devine creature does not fit in with today's society To love something completely is untrue and unrealistic to the pane view  Lost in the devices of this machine that conquer day and nite It can consume in one fatal bite, leaving without sight Can you feel the relentless journey.. waking up every sunrise, breathing in and out To find no prize..  Bouts of revelation keep the spirits up of the dreamer Too short is this life to keep grudges Embrace  love life

      sometimes it doesnt make sense.. only worlds colliding, crashing into new universises'.. you were only bored .. you needed to seek some shelter.. i was deemed the best cover at the moment.. did you ever consider that i am a power house of emotion.. that every move your body makes, i notice.. did you ever consider that every thought process you made.. i went at the same pace.. did you ever consider me to lose face.. didnt you ever consider.. at all?  did you ever consider.. i was falling head over heals.. OR did you scheme the entire time.. im lost in the madness of it all.. however, i will come to grips of it all.. and figure if you wanted to have a glimpse of ohme`(a complete circle and balance).. you'd come back to me

      How can a  familiar feeling  come back almost 3 years to the date I first felt it.. ? a revelation of thought.. of passion, an explosion of devout love. .. only to be cast aside like a commoner and only treated as just fuckin emotions and not considered that an entire person was loved/lusted. These waters run deep.. as maybe perhaps thought before none surfaced nor expressed. I love truely and deeply.. and unlike any other.. I am a great being. It's a test like any other..

         Wondering            If it is too soon to move on.. I feel that it is time to move on in my mind, although, in my heart it feels like it was just yesterday Joe left me. There is no real reason to stay in a state of wonder and hope that we will be back together because, we never will. I know this.. I feel it in my bones. It's just the thought of how an end could come to all of this.. cold turkey.         Moving on..         I did however, meet a reeeally great sweet, geniune guy. (Not to mention he's super cute) But I want to give this guy the benefit of the doubt.. so I am taking it slow. I found out that he's an IT Support guy and is a drummer by night. May I say.. he has intelligence, uber cuteness  and  great sense of humour. He makes me laugh all the time! Thats to be said for something..        Getting Fit            Trying to do this but it's seriously HARD due to my love of food. Dammit.. it will be the END of me! So I have been weening myself off of fried foods.. beef and steered more towards more real foods, like vegetables, fruits and nuts.. blah blah. More water = more trips to the little girls room.. well at least I am learning to be more self discipled. Got to focus!        School             Is being more strenous than usual.. I was told by my counselour that I can not drop one course due to me having to take an extra elective.. and I could just re-take the class later on.. BUT that means I would have to pay an extra frekkin' $2K -- "I told her no flippin' way!".. so needless to say.. I have to KEEP the Finance class and I am behind 3 Units.. which reminds me .. WHY am I revising my blog, when I SHOULD be doing my homework? Curious minds want to know...

         Remembering you the way I'd like to..       Even   though this fascade may show that I am over you.. I just may never be, over you. I still think about you every day and every night I lay my head down to sleep. I miss your touch and your smell. It's as if I wait... for you to call or show up at my doorstep declaring your love and how stupid you were to leave me the way you did.. but I know you never will. So why do I hang on?     &nbsp;  All I have are, our memories. How I wish those times would be here again. I remember that awesome day in Big Sur where we went on the beach where no footsteps wandered before and those times at Twin Peaks, where I thought I could just be in your arms forever.     &nbsp;  Left with these memories, I am forever grateful they are in my mind. Forever grateful that I could feel such depth and feel the thril of being alive and in love.     &nbsp;  I am proud to say that I am better now. After you left me.. this has made me a stronger person, stronger than I have ever imagined. I almost wish you could see me now, and how I have change for the better.. but you can't .. and you never will.

         Craigslist!           &nbsp;   I think I am going to drop off the message board.. its driving me completely insane. Mainly due to the fact that many other people are going through the same life complications I am going through. There is complete anonymity that I don't know if it is really the person I think it is but then I think.. it sounds so   I  still miss him. I wish I didn't. Things would seem "brighter" if I didn't miss him.   c'est la vie...

         MC, Oh where, Oh where are you!!??       Days are getting better and better,  Now that I know that you aren’t in my life.  I guess I was just driving myself insane due to the mere possibility of us being together, forever.  Now, I know it was a lie, a sham and that you truly did not love me at all.    &nbsp;  I had thought that you were my reason to go on in this shabby existence of life.  I found my reason, to go on, to believe in living my life to the fullest.  It was you, were you too blind to see?   I know that you will never read this,    Or condemn yourself for ever doing this to my heart.  You are just cold-hearted, I suppose.     All accusations and never really knowing.   So go on live your dream of being wealthy;  You may be wealthy in riches but you are by no means rich in life.   I believe that you will wonder what you did with this love of your life....    And think.. you wish you had it back.

         Maybe I am stoopid          &nbsp;  Well today I attempted to get a hold of "whats his face", again no avail and probably no response -- per usual. I just can not grasp how this love could reach such density and just be cut loose with nothing to show for it. I felt as though I had been kicked aside so that he could pursue other interests. .. which is in fact, IS&nbsp;the truth. However, he did it in such a cold fashion. Bastard son, he is.   I think I am over the hurt part.. now, its just replaced with resentment towards him.     &nbsp;  In short, I just want my shit back. And he could have all of his back for that matter. ;)     &nbsp;  Going through my things at work.. I forgot that I had brought one of his poems he wrote for me... it was written back in May. It's about how ALL OF HIM loves ALL OF ME. But in hindsight, that was all just a bunch of crapola.

         I went up to the hill..           &nbsp;   where he last took me. It was a sunny, hot and windy day. It was a thinking spot.. somewhere I could feel I could connect and yet disconnect at the same time. There's not a day that goes by that I do not think of him.. and the longer the time.. the more I begin to actually believe there is no hope of him ever confessing his love for me.     &nbsp;   I wonder though, if he ever does have a passing thought about me. Perhaps. I will never really know. I just need to get over it.. I feel as though I have gone through the entire rollercoaster of emotions over the past 3 weeks. Badgering myself, badgering him.. badgering life. .. It is no ones fault, really.     &nbsp;   How bittersweet life is.. to be so delicious and exhilarating and then to be so hurtful and empty. However the pendulum swings, I know I will be happy&nbsp;and I will love again. que sara sara...

         Something I concocted.. in a drunken stupor       &nbsp;   J,  &nbsp;  What is “meant to be”? Only a device of 3 simple mangled words.   &nbsp;  I know you love me &amp; that I love you. And that is all that matters b/c even though I can not be a part of your world now, you were then and that has made all the difference.  &nbsp;  AND even though many positive things may have come of our union – we will never see, obviously – but at least for a moment of life we were both truly inspired.  &nbsp;  “Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working”, is how the saying goes.  &nbsp;  And even though you may delete this encounter from your mind; I know that someday you will read this and remember the best time of our lives.  &nbsp;  I loved you and perhaps always,  R   &nbsp;

         Today&nbsp;aka an Ode to you           &nbsp;   Today is better than my yesterday.. and that makes me feel better. Better, that I am loved. Thanks god for my friends.. where would I be without you?     &nbsp;   Today is the day I am giving up on men...    &nbsp;   Today I will not be a slave to my emotions.     &nbsp;   Today I will not give into the complexity of WHY you left me.     &nbsp;   Today is the day that I will not let you control me, even after you are said and gone.     &nbsp;   Today is the day that I will succeed in my baby steps to success. Yes, I will get there and not carried by&nbsp;anyone but only with my own&nbsp;strength and will.     &nbsp;   Today is the day that I will not forget who is my true friend and fo.     &nbsp;   Today is the day that I will get absolutely sloshed that I do not remember what tomorrow's damage. (However, I will remember the hangover -- oh yes.)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

        Fingers   &nbsp;  Its as if my life's blood has been sucked straight from my marrow. Yes. I am being somewhat of a pissy baby but seriously, when you love someone that you completely lose yourself in.. it is all a lie, what do you do?  &nbsp;  I wish I knew what to do with myself. I honestly have no time to do anything other than keep busy with work, school and keeping myself to a fat-minimum. However, I find myself just staring into space thinking about him.. wondering if he is ever hoping that he will see me again. That I would trade everything to be with him.  &nbsp;  I sound like a babbling baby waiting for my mothers teet.. damn I hate being whiny. I detest those bitches.  &nbsp;  But how is it I feel so numb that I detach from everything that ever made me happy. I dont even want to go out, dance, socialize.. and drink? wtf? THATS my american pastime.

        Empty    How can I feel just so absolutely empty that I want to just end it all? Tell me something.. whats the use of living if it seems as though there is nothing to live FOR. I need my love life. I need the love of my life back.

        Patience & Balance     I suppose in some strange way I am patiently waiting to get that phone call or email, however, the reality of it all is.. that I never will.   Mulling over relationship problems with my friends, it seems to be a theme going on here, I discover that everyone has their own issues and its up to us whether or not we want to deal with it or them.   Yes, I have been wronged. Although, I have loved.. truly, deeply or so I thought. Maybe what they say is true, its better to have loved, then never to have loved at all.   I just need some sort of clarity in the madness of it all. Always a sleuth in the discovery of knowledge, I can not rest until I know the real reason. I believe that it is safe to say that he found a new love but how can that be, when I know he still loves me. Although, how can someone love if they treated someone so disrespectful? Such a YIN & YANG life is.   Such a tatered heart for this sensitive soul.

        Shabam!     Mood Song: "Love Song" remade by 311    Does my mood song say more than I already expressed? I'm a mess and it shows. Why am I letting myself fall apart over some ingrate that did not even want to grace my presence with a proper "I'm dropping you like a sack of potatoes" or a "Fcuk you berry much, NEXT!!"?   So strange.. but so have corelations earlier, maybe its me. Although, every encounter before this one, I have been at an arms length. Never knowing and never truly feeling. Recluse and repressed as it seems, it was better than a broken heart. Love has never been easy, at least for this girl. Damn. I think a shot of tequila should suffice.. or maybe that new AWOL vaporizer, which gets you drunk at a faster rate and all you have to do is inhale. HA! Should only it be that easy.

        Last episode:    So for the past few months I have been dating what I thought was the love of my life. Low and behold, he drops me out of thin air like an anorexic on cake. No explaination why or whom, just dropped. I was a mess the first few days but I began to pick myself up again, I can't let my school or work disintegrate simply because of my horrible disposition. My life depends on it.   Well the week progresses and then another, I have a drink and its like I am back to square one again. I can't stop crying and I begin to ask, "Was I not good enough?", "Why doesn't he love me?", "Is it someone else, who the fuck is it?". But then I come to the conclusion, well maybe it wasn't meant to be, besides, why would I want to be with someone that can be as cold hearted as him?   But I love him, I'd move mountains for him.   But, I can't tell him that, why? It would be giving in. Giving in to the madness of it all. I am becoming insane.   It's such a production everyday at work, with friends and family, to put on a front; but the truth of the matter is, I would have given anything to be with this man, everything and forever.   How could someone bear their entire soul and pledge it for life to you and then just snatch it from under you? Melodramatic, I am, yes. But answers, I need to know. Again, no why or whom? Just good bye. Trying to make sense of it all..and my tears can not stop falling.   ===============  A poem:   Solace    Lying awake at 3:20am Contemplating whether or not to drive Pondering, this relationship, thinking, should I strive? Affirmations that I am  Finally, I drive with unexpectations Going against all sanctions In front of your house, I am breathless Nothing to say, only thoughts of love and longing  I left a note on your car, Telling you how I truly feel Explaining I stress every meal Conveying, loving you so strongly from afar.  Disbelief with the restrain of longing I am lacking the strength of belonging Mulling over, actions of purpose The thought of giving up, giving into the insanity beneath the surface.  Sulking to the point of withering away to disillusion Enchantment of wanderlust coming to a close Just searching for a suppose Counterpart of a fusion.  -- 07/01/04 RAE

         I am feeling nostalgic..        And when I do that.. its seems to bring nothing more than pain and longing for the past. Longing is such an evil thing.. because you want what you can not have. I can not have what I want. Although, when I have what I want.. it is not quite up to par. Why can't I just be happy? Why can't things be the way they used to be? Why do I fall into this constant cycle? Is it chemically induced? Why am I always asking questions!??!      AAAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!       Frustrated with the madness of it all.. But why should I be? I have love in my heart and in life.. so why should I be down?       I need to forget.. forget. I thought I was forgetting but I was just lying to myself.. I think maybe it will take longer than I thought to get over this hurt that has happened. I can however distract myself, although, I feel bad for not giving my entire 100%. It is not that I do not want to.. its that I simply can not bounce back so quickly. I suppose this is to be said for SOMETHING.. I love deeply and it is not something to be dealt with lightly.        Feel it..         Its the wave of melodic wave coursing through my body.. influencing my way of motion. I feel it.. lifting me up. Higher.. higher... feel .. heal.   mMmm it's Paul van Dyk I speak of. Can you hear?

         I feel again..            It's funny how things can just come around and you feel fresh and new again. This seems to happen when I meet someone new and not just anyone new, a special someone. I really like this guy that I am talking to.. I must talk to him every moment that I have.. and I feel okay with it.

         Soo...            What to do? What to do... ? I swear that relationships are so complicated sometimes, I just want to BE. Just be.. fall into a person.. we become one. Romantic? or Dillusional? I'd have MORE please..      But seriously, I notice when I find a flaw in someone, I just back away and look else where. Am I building walls or just noticing the cracks right away? I dunno.. maybe I just need to cool it with new boi.. good thing he is 657 miles away, enough space for my comfort and enough for it to grow into something potential.       I suppose a tramatic ending to my previous relationship is still somewhat fresh in my mind. But I can not just cave in into the mess that it is.. its not my style. I need to feel free. To be. To live. To breathe in and feel alive.. the thrill.

         Feeling strangely fine..            Do my words just fit exactly how I feel right now.. in transit. .. motion. Moving, moving further away from the very thing that killed me almost a month ago.       And moving towards something that fits oddly more than the one before. I speak in vague tongue because I do not know what this is.. to tell you the truth. Have you ever gone somewhere and it strangely feels like home to you. Just the sound of someones voice level you?       Ever... just feel like its a rush again.. to be so free, entralled .. mMmmMM

         Check me out...       I said, CHECK me out!                   you are deeppink  #FF1493         Your dominant hues are red and magenta. You love doing your own thing and going on your own adventures, but there are close friends you know you just can't leave behind. You can influence others on days when you're patient, but most times you just want to go out, have fun, and do your own thing.  Your saturation level is high - you get into life and have a strong personality. Everyone you meet will either love you or hate you - either way, your goal is to get them to change the world with you. You are very hard working and don't have much patience for people without your initiative.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz
