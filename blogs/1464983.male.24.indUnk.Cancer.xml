						   Its always suprising to hear something you've written on the guitar played by someone else.. Better yet its even more amazing to play along with someone else. I have a new friend, who is a coworker from my office who plays guitar. Suprisingly she plays in the same style I do, We've hung out and played a couple nights and what a difference it makes! We hope to have our first little song recorded soon which has been titled by Alicia "Waiting for Katie".  I just need to come up with a decient solo ;)  Work goes on and on this week, same old  nothing.. Boring as hell.. Bleh..  Oh and Bonnie sucks :D

						   Working in Foresthill sucks, I always forget to post to this thing. My neck has been stiff all week and I feel like I am going to wake up paralyzed one of these days. I could be so lucky. :P  I love it when your subconcious plays tricks on you in your sleep so you have BIZZARE dreams. I had a VERY strange one last night involving Katie, that made me wake up quickly. Stupid subconcious. Stupid..  Speaking of Katie, I am in the process of writing her a letter. I found a pretty little flower that I am going to put in the letter, it should put a little smile on her face. Although knowing my luck she'll be allergic to it. :D I need to call her mom in the morning and find out how my mermaid is doing. I really hope with all my heart that she is a little less depressed. My poor angel. :(  I have been talking to a new friend this week, its a friend of Keven's friends. Another teenage angst type of person. Except there is one difference, she seems to like to try and seem like the smartest person in the world. I got quite pissed off the other day when she started talking down to me about some completely stupid thing. Where in the hell does Keven find these people? Good lord!  I realised the other day that my birthday is in a month. Oh goodie. I bet no one remembers like usual. Sort of like last year. ;) Atleast I will be down in LA this year, maybe  Missy or Danny Boy will remember.

						   Well after nearly a week I am back to posting here again. Finally :)  Friday I recieved word from Katie's mom that Katie was home. She was in a car accident in AZ, and had just gotten home the day before. I was terrified of how bad Katie was hurt, and from what I have heard and seen of Katie's truck she got banged up pretty good. Right now she has a broken collar bone, is bruised up everywhere and lost the nerves in her foot. I was already planning to head down to LA over the weekend so I worked to fit in a side trip to hopefully see Katie. However Katie isn't letting anyone see her so I didn't get the chance. :( I did however get to see her mom and dropped off some things for Katie, including my favorite lamp that I hoped would put a smile on her face.  From what I hear it did, which made me happy. But the important thing is that I was there, I might not have gotten to see her, but I was there for her. I sat at the cliffs for a while and did some thinking. For the first time ever, I didn't feel out of place there. I wasn't nervous or scared. I was there, it felt natural to me, like I have been there everyday of the past 2 years.  Late Sunday night I made the long trek home, I didn't get back until 9am. I managed to sleep and get a whole 2 hours of work in. WOO HOO! This week starts the week that I work in Foresthill again, I don't know how long I am going to be here, but I really am already starting to hate it all over again. Oh well you can't win them all ;)  Tonight as I sleep I will watch over Katie, I only hope she gets rest tonight. She's had a rough past 2 weeks.

						   Is it Thursday already? Good lord.  Keven ditched me to go to Tracy and visit his friends down there. I guess things just got too boring for him around here, that bastard! I guess I know where I rate ;) I noticed fark.com's new personal ads seem to have some VERY strange looking people on them. Not that they are unattractive or anything, just their pictures seem odd. The fellow on there earlier today sort of looked like a neanderthal ;) Now the current girl on there looks like she needs to wear less makeup and not be stoned. Who am I to judge anyway? I look 40 most of the time.  I upset my friend Hilary today. I was talking to her about how Keven feels and that he isn't sure what to do. Somehow we wound up talking about her visit down with Katie (Not that Katie) to watch a movie. I made a mention that because she was semi cuddled up to Keven that left me and Katie sort of sitting there and I knew Katie wanted someone to cuddle up to. Well I wasn't going to cuddle up to anyone, and once they put on that chick flick I made the effort to leave (without telling anyone) because I felt like a piece of meat. Hilary apologised and said that wasn't the intention and such. I believe her wholly but I still felt the way I did, its not her or Katie's fault but I couldn't help the way I felt. Since then Hilary hasn't talked to me. :(  Work, work, work, today! I have been trying to get an online shopping cart done for a customer. I made some major progress today and hope to have it finished tomorrow. Of course that all depends on if they want any changes done to it afterwards. Starting next week I have to go to work in Foresthill again for a while, which means I will now go from no money, to well negative money. It will be interesting to see how I am going to have to balance money to actually GET to work.  I don't know how I am going to eat.   I found out Yesterday that it was the last day of classes at UofA. I assume now that Katie will be home earlier than I expected. I am excited to know that I will get to talk to her again soon. However at the same time I am also scared. I don't really feel like I know what is going on between her and I at the moment. Are we still together? Are we not? Will she have found someone else? Questions... I do know one thing is for sure. It has been 4 months that she has been gone, I have missed her everyday I didn't talk to her with all of my soul. I hold on to my heart and to my feelings, I keep my head up and I walk forward hoping for the best. I know that my love hasn't faded, that I still love her as much as I always have. I hold on to that love because its part of who I am, and because I learned long ago to fight for what I believe in. Out of all things in this world I believe in her and I, and deep down somewhere I know she does too.

						   I overslept today. Of course the traffic on 49 was awful. And they decided to work on one of the bridges by the time I got to it. So I had to make a detour and go back to the freeway and drive to Colfax and cut over 174. Whoopie!  Things at the museum are going well, I noticed today that the gift shop is coming together. Not only that our locomotive is coming along nicely, the air brake plumbing was finished today and it was quite impressive to see the needle on the pressure gauge rise as we charged the system. Not only that it was more impressive to HEAR the sound of a functioning system. :) I finished getting the hardware on the fireman's door done today. We atleast have one complete door now. ;) The big move from the shop to the museum building is Saturday, hopefully we will have the final touches done in time. I lost track of time and wound up being late for work, coupled with the fact I had to take the detour I was an hour and a half late. :/ Of course when I got here the boss asked what happened to a project he gave me yesterday. A project I finished and told my supervisor that was done. Turns out someone had went in and changed the template on me AFTER I made the change to one that didn't have this special link. So I had to go and set the stupid thing up again.  I read an email from Katie today, an old one from a year ago after we had fought through some tough times. I read the words she wrote, and just thought in my head about how she is still after 2 years every bit the same woman I am in love with. I miss her terribly but I know she is with me everyday. I should hear from her in 2 weeks so I am excited. I hope to get her package mailed out at the end of this week, but it depends on if I can get a picture I want to send her or not. Otherwise I might just drop the whole thing off by her house when I go down to LA later this month. Either way I know she will love what I am sending her.  Speaking of people I care about, why is it that I can't find a single person to go on a late night drive with me? Everyone can't be a bunch of wussies can they?  Oh well, tomorrow is another day, and another couple dollars.

						   Ahh yes another Monday. I have decided to keep this log to write down my thoughts I might have during the day or basicly how I am feeling. Today started out like every other day: Get up, late for work, get to work, get hungry, starve, lunch time. I did manage to get help from Keven to clean out and wash my car. Now my car is white again :) One the work front today I managed to get a few little things done which will make the boss happy I suppose. Tonight looks like gaming night over at Keven's he's been wanting me to play computer games with him the past few days now, I guess I shall humor him. ;)  One good thing has come out of today atleast, the fact that I get to work at the museum tomorrow. YAY!

						   Sometimes when you least expect it life throws you that curveball. Other times you get the pitch you expect.  Today Katie and I decided to be friends. We are going to always be close, and I'll be damned if I wont be the best friend that I can be. I can't say that I am not sad, or my heart isn't broken. I am. But at the same time, I am glad that she will still be in my life. I had always feared that if she left, she would go for good leaving me with a hole that would never be filled. There are times when no matter how much you love someone, you have to let them grow and you have to let them experience the world for themselves. It is time for my Katie to spread her wings, and fly. Time for her to start on her life.. Time for her to be ready to great things.  I know that I will always be part of her life, that I will never fade away or be forgotten. I will always be here for her. I will love and carry her with me, part of my life forever. The future is not written, and no one can say what will happen a few years from now. I need to be a friend, a best friend, to be supportive and listen, to love unconditionally.  So today my life has changed.. But then again.. Everyday things change, basicly they stay the same. In one way or another.

						   I hate drama, I really do! Things have been hell lately, and worst of all I was trying hard to stay out of it.. Yes I did a few things that  I shouldn't have but nothing as bad as I am getting hell for.. I went overboard Sunday and told someone off and I really shouldn't have. Worst of all my Katie has stopped talking to me, and I did nothing to cause that. Its sad and hurts quite a bit. I am not sure if I will ever talk to her again and that wasn't my fault.. I just want to cry now..  The only good news in the past week is that I might be getting a new job that is closer to home and pays more.. We'll see how that goes. But if this past week is a vision of things to come then I am screwed..  C'est La Vie

						    The End Of An Era   Tonight I get the lovely task of cleaning up my desk here at the Auburn office. Because of money issues we are being moved to a smaller area in the back of the building and sadly there wont be room for my computer there. Its sad to know that I am "leaving" this place, so many things happened the nights I sat here. Most were good, but there were some bad ones. My life changed here at this desk in many ways, for the past 6 months I've been here everyday. I will always remember the days here, smiling at my picture of Katie on my desk, the days I laughed, cried or was angry. Now that I am in Foresthill again things aren't the same, it doesn't feel like my office. I don't even really feel like I am at work up there.  It is strange to feel like a place, even one that you didn't like much was such a special place. I guess I only realise it now when I am leaving.  In the end its just another day of life and the end of an era so to speak.

						   I can't believe its been so long since I updated this. Things have been nearly a sort of hell the past few weeks.. It seems like when I have a good day, I can expect the next one to be bad. There are days when I am so tired, I just don't want to wake up. This last sunday has to have been one of the worst days I've had in a long time. I dropped and broke what little mayo I had left. I got a flat tire.. I had to get a ride to the office only to be abandoned there and had to walk 10 miles to get home. Monday I was sore as hell, I had to do the "70 year old shuffle" all day long.  I am in the process of changing my life for the better. I need to firmly plant my roots in the earth. This week I am going to be in search of a new job where I will be paid better and one that I will enjoy so I can not have to be broke all the time. Among other things I am going to try and start taking more time for myself. I've noticed in the past few months I have spent most of my days "for others" and not enough for me.  Katie has decided to move up here and come to UC Davis and it will be nice to have her around. There are a lot of things that her and I can still do and many things that she will enjoy as much as I will.  Just the other day a friend of 9 years told me that there was something wrong with me.. He said that I don't seem the same, that there seems to be something missing. In many ways he is right, since I broke up with Katie I haven't been feeling right, like something is missing. I am doing everything I can to be a friend and a damn good one at that. But there are times where I feel like I am annoying her, and there are other times when she isn't telling me things because she doesn't want me to get upset. The sad part is that they aren't things I would get upset over.. They are little things I wouldn't think twice about but it hurts when she wont even mention them to me. That and that alone hurts..  Somedays it seems like she's forgotten who I am. Then again maybe she wants to forget..

						   Its been a long time since I wrote in here. The past 2 days have been days of hell.  Katie is upset with me because there have been some things said by other parties to her which I "apparently" said. But I know I did not say them. I've been trying to cope with the feeling of being almost hunted. I don't know where these things came from that were said, but I know I never said them, they aren't things I would say. I have a bad feeling that some sort of nasty telephone game is going on. Whats worse is that she is starting to not believe me and it hurts me deep down inside. In the entire nearly 3 years that I've known Katie I have done nothing but be openly honest and truthful to her. I have and will always be that way to her because I know she does the same to me. Not only that but I find it hard to lie at all, even about little things. I seem to tell the truth more than I probably should at times.   I've had to kick Rob out last week. He had been bad mouthing me to my family. There were problems with bills and problems with personalities. Rob is a damn good friend and I really care about him but after a year its hard to be a roomate with him. I felt so bad when I had to tell him, I didn't know what to say and I went through hell that day. I felt worse because I couldn't tell him in person but over the phone. So now Rob is quite upset with me, he apparently never wants to talk to me again and in a way that breaks my heart. Rob has been my friend for a long time and I hope honestly that him and I can work things out and be friends again one day soon.  I've talked to Keven in the past month and I tried to settle things with him. There were a lot of things that were said and done back during the drama that was hurtful. Some things he said to me I will take a long time being able to forgive him for. But I've tried, I extended the olive branch. I feel like Keven doesn't understand why I have been upset with him, at the same time I feel like he absolutly hates me. All in all it bugs me. I feel like I am still blamed for a lot of the drama that happened even though I stayed out of it. Katie has said that she doesn't blame me and such but I still feel that in some way Keven does have some sort of animosity to me towards what happened.  So today was the day of hell, a flash point of stress. Today I tried to talk to Katie and I tried hard to tell my side. I poured my heart and soul into it because I would never say anything bad about her. But at the same time Rob and Keven made a trip over to finish moving stuff out of the apartment. Daniel told me the whole time what was going on and there were some things said. Some things bad about me, and even some nasty things said to him.  So here I am, at work, trying to reason with Katie and to try and work things out. Daniel is telling me what was going on at the apartment at the same time. My stress level hit the roof and I broke down.. For the first time in a long I felt like the world was coming apart at the seams. My bestfriend and someone that I care deeply about was doubting my intentions and feelings to her and two people that really don't like me were tearing the apartment apart. By the end of it all, I was and have been scared. It seems like the world has turned against me and I fear waking up in the morning, I fear what will happen next. One can only cry so long...

						   Wow, someone loves me.. For the past few days I have noticed that someone keeps logging in as me on icq. I had to change my password today because whoever it is logged in atleast 5 times while I was working lastnight and twice this morning. I hate people sometimes.  On a lighter note I spent the weekend up in Oregon on the Sumpter Valley Railway. It was nice to finally go up and meet everyone that I've exchanged emails with. I even got to ride behind the first doubleheader since 1996. I also learned something interesting from the trip, Highway 395 is pretty much the same from Reno to Alturas as it is through the Owens Valley, one big desolate pile of dirt. It was a nice trip though and hopefully I will have some pictures developed soon to put in the photo gallery which is sorely out of date.  I spent all my time last night at home working on bills and figuring out the split costs between my roomates and I. This week I am going to focus on getting a lot of things squared away and settled. Hopefully I will get to sit down and have some long talks with a few of the people that are upset with me. I am tired of feeling hated and I miss a lot of them. In the past few weeks I've gotten a little overly upset at some of them when I shouldn't have, in the end it made me bitter towards them which is something that shouldn't have happened.  The past few months I know I have upset some people, and hurt a few people. I realised last night what I have been doing wrong, and I foolishly hurt someone I never intended to. Instead of listening to my heart and what I've been told directly, I went by an assumption I fabricated in my head because I was sad, jealous and in many ways just scared. My heart cannot convey how truely sorry I am for what I did, I should have known better, and for one brief moment, I didn't. If you are reading this journal (you know who you are),  I am truely sorry, what I did was stupid and its what I get for not listening to you, for not just talking to you and asking you.  The past few months have been a sort of mess, and I've shut out a lot of people in my life, people that I never should have.  I miss Rob and I miss Keven, they were always good friends, and yes we had disagreements and got upset with each other. But things have gone on too long, it sometimes takes time to sort things out but they are my friends and they always will be. I can't hate them, I never have, and I never will.

						   Hell week continues..  There is a battle raging on in my heart. The past few days has really been hell. It seems that everyone around me is having a terrible time in their lives. I have been trying to help them out, and keep them with their heads above the water. Yet at the same time I can't do that for myself. I've heard in the past few days that I am a terrible friend, and at this point I wonder why anyone would say that about me? Better yet, what did I do? I seem to have done nothing but mope around all day. I feel numb and I am confused.   Maybe I really am a terrible friend and I just don't realise it? I kicked Rob out of the apartment.. I kept away from Keven because he told me that I didn't matter to him.. I kept away from others because I didn't want their drama in my life..  Yet for some reason because of these things, I've become a terrible friend. What is worse is the one person I want to talk to, isn't talking to me. Right now I don't know what to do, my bestfriend and someone I care about doesn't want to talk to me. No one else wants to talk to me or see me except some coworkers, Daniel and Biff. I need my Katie right now. I know that she doesn't believe me or trust me right now and that breaks my heart. All I have ever done is love Katie and treat her the same way I would want to be treated in return. I've told the truth on all things good and bad. And now after 3 years I feel like she doesn't care, that she's forgotten about me and how I feel. I know how I feel.. I know I hate the drama.. I know that I care about her more than anything in the world. She's my bestfriend... She's my heart and soul...  Why am I the only one that truely knows this?  All I want to do right now is cry... Which I guess in this case is the best thing.

She's such a sweetheart :)  Daniel, Marcus and Alicia are all MIA this week, yay a boring apartment to myself.. Blargg... Atleast I get to see Celeste Thursday, its been a while since I saw her, it will be good to see her and the family. Not to mention I have a lot of people to call and wish a Merry Christmas. Heck I even get to see all my family this week. Shocking huh?  However on the "bad" side, my car is REALLY starting to crap out. I need that tune up bad. BAD BAD BAD! Thankfully I get paid this week. So far the week has been boring, work, and work oh yeah and more work. Anyway, time to get back to work.  heh  oh and here is the Fark quote of the day:  Posted By: Hep_Cat_Swing   "WTF.....a tribute to CREED?!!!

						   Well Ebay goodies are arriving in droves. I can't believe I won as much stuff as I did. My collection of old railroad stuff is growing. Maybe one day it will all be worth something. ;)  I have been having strange dreams lately... Dreams of being fired, people I haven't seen in a long time, Katie... It seems everything is fair game in my dreams.. Whats weird is that its always something familiar in an unfamiliar place. Anyone know what that means?  Other than strange dreams things are normal. I am glad its Friday, I need a well deserved rest this weekend. Oh and Return of the King rocked!!!  Enough for now.

Other than that I have been spending a lot of time with the people closest to me around here. Jeni, Daniel, Marcus and Alicia. I have also realised that I am an Ebay Addict.. not that its a bad thing..  wait... uhh.. anyway :) I must cut this short for now. Here is a little bonus the Fark Quote of the day!

						   Its January 14th.. Which means tomorrow is Katie's birthday!   HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!!!!!!   In the past year I've watched you grow so much. It  has been a hard year for you I know, but on this special day I want you to know that I am proud of you. I always will be. Be at peace on your birthday, and know that you are in my heart.  The journey of a thousand miles begins with but a single step.  :)

						   I noticed and had it confirmed that the very front part of my hair is in fact turning grey! I even have a perfectly white hair in my goatee. I am such an old man ;)  Next week is Katie's birthday and being a good friend I got her a gift.  We all know that I am such a sucker when it comes to getting gifts if I can afford it. Usually I have to make presents for people and there is nothing wrong with that. Sometimes I can splurge and get people something neat. Of course I always safe those gifts for birthdays. :D Anyway, most likely Katie will kick my ass for what I got her, but its simple and thoughtful.  I am feeling better than I did a few days ago. My morale seems to have improved, and I am not feeling so low anymore. I am still very tired however, thats pretty normal though. I even applied for a new job yesterday with Union Pacific. Thats right, I vowed to do something I'd never do and try to get a railroad job. However I would be doing fueling/sanding of locomotives if I got it, so its not as bad as say an engineer or conductor job.

						   Well its a new year. Oddly it doesn't feel like a new one. It feels like last year just started all over again. I started the year off with a bang. People mad at me, the never ending exhaustion WOOO! This is all starting to get old. Everyday I wake up, is just another day I lose more of my soul. I no longer feel like wanting to do anything, all I feel is that I don't want to be here. I don't want to feel like I do. I am so tired lately, I have no energy to go out anymore. No will to do anything, as if my life lacks motivation. I feel like I've hit a wall.  Sometimes I feel like the sole purpose I am still around is to save others. But if thats true, then who saves me? Why is it in helping others, being there for them that only then do I feel better?  Why does part of me want to run and never come back? Why does part of me know that I am needed here?  There are so many things I miss these days. Places, People, Experiences.. All I feel is that most of them will never come around again.  I guess I just feel like the world has passed me by, like all I can do is stand and wave. I wonder if those who have left me will ever remember me, or if they'll think of me.     Remember we used to dance..  and everyone wanted to be..  you and me..  I want to be to..     What day is this..  Besides the day you left me..  What day is this...  Besides the day you went...

I am making progress on the current TrainSim models hopefully I will get one done this weekend, the Sumpter Valley Coach is the first project.  Lately I've been talking to my friend Nicole who is off exploring Australia and New Zealand. Apparently she's met quite a hot chick in New Zealand that she's gaga over. Congrats to her. ;)  Daniel got his new toy today. A 1:20.3 model of Eureka and Palisade #4 the  Eureka . We are going to do some hacking on it to make a model of North Pacific Coast #7 the  Tamalpais . Ok I am sure I didn't spell that last name right, so deal!.  Katie has made it back home alright thankfully, I have been worried about her. She seems to be in a lot better mood than before she left. I knew getting away for a while would do her some good.   Venéa, Le meluvan úne ar alye lúmessen tenna nurucilie.  ;)  Work is going good and the car is holding out I am pleased to report. The next thing I need to fix is the brakes which are getting bad. Next paycheck! (I say that every paycheck).  Thats it for now...

						   Good news gang! Got the car tuned up over the weekend. Only cost $200! *gag* We destroyed one of the spark plug wires on accident so they had to be replaced. Problem is they cost $100 for the set! and I had to wait a day for them to get here. What a pain in my ass! However now that the car is back in good running order, I should save money on gas costs driving to work. Which in turn, helps me eat and stay alive. All of this of course means one project down and several more to finish. This week I still need to:   Finish work for the website www.houdini.com. Send out a Valentines Day card to someone special. Get my car registered. Give the car a good cleaning inside and out.  Oh and I might as well organize my desk too if I have nothing else to do. WHAT AN EXCITING LIFE I LEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Actually I have been trying to find something to do on Valentines Day.  Sadly, no luck there, I'm not cool enough I guess :P I guess me and my best friend Mr. Wild Turkey will stay home that night ;)  Oh well can't win them all Or can I?  Oh.. Here is a funny message exchange from today:  Marcus: hey brain dead, is it alright if I play unreal tournament on your computer Marcus: and eat cheese at the same time Me: you want to eat unreal cheese and play tournament on daniel's face? what?  Ok not that funny.. Feh..

						   Today I did something shocking  SHOCKING!!!!!  ok maybe not that shocking.  I started working on my Nevada County Narrow Gauge pictorial book I've been planning to write. Yes thats right, I am writing a book. I started basic layout of the cover today and one of these weekends I will start gathering up photos from the museum at first. I still have a number of places to use as sources. But hopefully in time I will get more of it done, I have the basic layout and idea of the structure done I just need to get to work.  I am glad its Friday, this week has seemed to go by beyond slow... Now this weekend its tune-up time for the car, and maybe I will get to hang out with my friend Cindy, I haven't seen her in a long time. I miss her bunches, just as I miss all my old friends.  Tonight Daniel and I are heading down to a model ra ilroad club in Sac, it should be interesting. I have to bring something along to run apparently. If I had something to run things would be ok ;) however since my change of Era I don't have much of anything to show anymore. I guess I could take the V&T Mckeen, but its extra cheesy to bring just some stock brass model if you ask me lol. Oh well eh?  Well, I don't have much else to add tonight, other than todays fark quote of the day. Ok so I stole this yesterday from a thread about the President threatening an amendment banning gay marriages. The poster of this message about made me shoot coffee out of my nose.  Posted by: chaosdeathgerbil      I, for one, am not gay.... But i would much rather take it in the ass than be some closed minded, inbred, budwiser chugging, bible thumping, sister humping redneck sheeple.

						   I must say that the past few weeks have been some of the most productive weeks I've had in quite a while. Atleast in the world of model building. ;) So far I've finished about 8 models for Daniel and to sell on ebay. TrainSim models have been lacking but I have been doing a little work on them here and there.  Other than the above mentioned "fun" the world has been kind. Work is going good and I am finding everyday to be short "busy" days.  My car is in dire need of a tuneup, something I hope to fix this weekend. I have a number of things to check and go over on it which should get it back into tip top shape. :D Here is the shocker of all shockers! I am actually getting all of my debts repaid! albeit slowly at the moment, payments are caught up once again and I will start to have extra money to pay off people I owe: my dad, Marcus, Keven's Brother and Nicolle.  The search for a new job continues.. I haven't heard anything from UP yet but I am keeping my eyes open,  even if I have to pick up something on the weekends for a while that will work.  Katie is still off on her Adventure, I haven't heard from her but I assume she's ok. Maybe she'll send me a letter, Who knows... Either way I miss her.  Over the past 2 weeks I've been fed up with spam. I took it upon myself to fight spam in everyway I could. After checking out the message source of nearly 100 spam messages I figured out some "keywords" most people wouldn't figure out. Basically I found odd key coding that comes from 2 things..  1. The programs the spammers use. 2. links the spammers use directly.  There appears to be a "glitch" or intentional code in some spammer programs where after every = sign in an HTML email it adds '3D' and example would be: align=3D"center" so by blocking messages containing "align=3D" that knocked out a number of spams. The next part is the links, well rather than simply block the address of the link, I took it a step further and blocked the variables the spammers try to pass in the links. The variables would be the bits that say ?hpsales= in the link address. "?hpsales" in checking out these tags I found these variable names appear to be unique to specific spammers or "companies". Based on the junk I was getting the 3 most common were: ?hpsales, ?nights and ?AFF_ID. This combined with my ISPs spam filtering has knocked my incoming spam level from 500-600 messages a day to around 140 messages. I still haven't beat all of the spam but I knocked it down to a managable level. My spam filters are picking up ~400 messages a day now which means less time I have to delete crap! :D  I am toooooo proud of myself! Enough for now.

						   Well its been one hell of a week. I ran out of money and was waiting for a check from some side work I did. I didnt get it until yesterday of course :D Now I owe Daniel much bux for keeping me alive.  In the meantime I've been planning the big trips this year Westside Reunion April 15th Help my mom move May 1-5 Sumpter Valley Labor Day Weekend (possibly) or Around my Birthday, not sure yet. That depends on a few things and who is going *ahem* yes you know I'm talking to you :P Laws trip one of these days Narrow Gauge National Convention in Sept Possibly Colorado in October for fall colors?  Could I possibly have more trips to make this year? POSSIBLY!!!! :D  In other news, I got a letter from the DMV letting me know how much money I owe them. Only $165 so thats not too bad. On top of this, I'll have BOTH my target and my credit card paid off by the end of this month. Not to mention have insurance and a registered car. Once all of this is caught up, I'll be one step closer to being completely caught up. Then I just need to pay off the money I owe to people around here.  I haven't worked on models much this week, mostly because I ran out of supplies to do anything. Time for a trip to the hobby shop to stock up.  I installed a new chatroom over at fradsplace.com its got a small following now of people who love it. Of course there are also 2 people that have technical issues with it, isn't that always the case.  Oh it looks like tomorrow is April 1st. I can expect all sorts of wonderous happenings tomorrow. Weird emails? Fake News Stories? Worse yet.. will someone try to pull one over on me?  The answer this and other questions will be answered in 24 hours.

						   I'll be the first to admit it, at the risk of being called a "nerd".  I have always been a fan of Star Trek, however like all things I take it in moderation. I keep up on the latest news, and I keep up with the current series "Enterprise". Sadly "Enterprise" has suffered from its share of issues and has slowly been losing a viewing audience. This season has turned things around story wise and brought the show up to par, but the damage is done.  Star Trek is dying..  As sad as it sounds, and as much as I hate to say it, I think its time Trek took a break once Enterprise is over. It seems to me that the people in charge have no idea to write good tv and at worst they don't even know how to please fans. This downward trend started with Voyager and continues to this day. Don't get me wrong, I still watch, and Enterprise has been 1000x times better this season than any of the previous and dare I say it, MOST of Voyager.  However one thing I've noticed in the past few months is the large compliment of fanboys who:  A. Are mad that Capt. Kirk died. B. Want to see him come back via movie or other media. C. Think bringing back Kirk will "save" the franchise.  Sure sure Kirk is a hero, he's part of our culture now, etc.. But these fans fail to realise something. With the poor shape Trek is in now, bringing back Kirk will do one thing: turn the average American against Trek. There is a strong fan base for Star Trek and there will probably always be one. However what keeps shows on the air and sells movie tickets are stories and characters the average American can understand without having to see 10 movies and countless hours of TV. It is because of this reason, that we need to let Kirk rest in peace.  I present to you my evidence WHY he should remain dead.  urlLink www.bringbackkirk.com  I happened to watch their new "Trailer II" tonight, and frankly I am disturbed. This 9 minutes of spliced together soundbytes, CGI models and recycled movie/tv clips stands out in my mind as one thing: The biggest steaming pile of fan boy masturbation EVER! I hate to speak down to people who spent their time doing this. However even being a moderate fan I can pick apart 50 good flaws in what is being passed off as a story (more like a 100 page story with only pages 1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90 and 100). This is the sort of thing that would kill Star Trek for good.  Its time the Trekkers out there realize the facts before hand. What makes you happy and what you want to see, is not going to help the franchise. Sure keep continuity there, keep nods to other shows, bring in a guest character or two from time to time. Please, Please, Please don't beat a dead horse anymore. Kirk died, he even died the way he knew he would. Making a movie where every Star Trek cast and ship is jammed into one movie would have the same negative reaction as Greedo shooting first. Whoops wrong Sci-Fi there, but you get the point.  Star Trek needs to get back to the core of what the show means, exploring humanity through a set of metaphorical eyes. We don't need old characters, explosions, and fan boy circle jerks to accomplish that.  You want to save Star Trek? Write Paramount, demand Berman's head on a plate and save the show by bringing in new blood, not only in the production/writing department, but by appealing to the rest of the viewing public out there.   I am stepping off my soap box now. - Self Admitted Closet Star Trek Fan Since 1994 -

						   A few days ago I recieved an email from Jim Wilke. For those of you who don't know, Jim Wilke is responsible for the correct paint now on the replica steam locomotives at the Golden Spike National Monument. Jim had found his way to my TrainSim modelling page and was impressed by the work the group and I do. He made a request, and an interesting one at that. The recient DSP&P Tiffany Reefer model I finished is done up in the "accepted" paint scheme the cars had. However Jim has found a paint sample from the 1890s of a standard gauge Tiffany reefer in the "official" Mint Green color. So his request was for me to paint the DSP&P Tiffany to Mint as an experiment. After guessing and guessing for a while I found a color he said was "very close" and I plan to release this car as a seperate download in a few days.  Well now, why am I not showing a picture of it here? Simple answer, its a suprise! That and its not quite finished yet. I actually am starting to like the mint color and its very unique from what most people expect to see on a freight car of that period. When I get the color and new numbering finished I'll post a shot, until then, you'll just have to wait.  In other news: Today was payday and for once I have some extra money!!!!  So I bought some lottery tickets ($8 worth) and managed to win $6 back. Not bad I suppose.  I think I will treat myself to a good dinner tonight, then a shower and then relax.. Its been a friggin long week so far.

						   Some of you that know me, know that I always have very strange dreams. The past couple months alone have been no exception. I decided I'd describe the most common reoccuring dreams, as well as one completely weird one that left me with a WTF in the morning.   Dream 1 The Weird:   In this first dream, for some reason my mom moved to Alaska, and my family and I went up to visit her.. But the part of Alaska she lived was like a jungle almost (you could see glaciers in the distance in the mountains).  At one point I was walking across a bridge and happened to meet up with a swimmer who bet me that they could swim across the river faster than I could run across the bridge. I won the race but her and I became friends throughout the dream.  Then whenever my family and I would do anything up there we had to walk because there were no cars or streetsand the place was littered with rocks and machinery ruins.  For some reason though there was also a strange little narrow gauge railroad that still ran up there which I saw pass by once in the dream (and quite fast too). There was this one section where we had to walk through this little creek that was under the forest canopy (the train tracks went though this creek too). I always noticed these cool colorful plants in the water as did my family and wondered what they were. Finally I wound up climbing up one of the trees and happened to look at my family standing in the creek. At this point I noticed those plants were actually HUGE centipedes like HUGE HUGE... Like 40 feet long and 6 inches in diameter  those cool plants were their legs. It was frightening in the dream and then I woke up wondering WTF.  If someone can figure what that dream means I'd love to hear it ;)   Dream 2 The bad:   In the first reoccuring dream I always see myself die in my dream... Its like watching a movie really, not seeing it all happen from my own eyes, but seeing this happen to myself as a 3rd party. It is always for some medical reason that never gets explained. In the dream Marcus and Daniel try to wake me up in the morning because I've overslept, it takes them a while before they realise what has happened. The dream always shows someone having to tell everyone what has happened which is always a head breaking moment or them. Some people do not take it well, and Katie always freaks out because of my death because she "wasn't there to save me". In the end I see my funeral and some beautiful words are said by some people there, sadly I never remember the words they say because I always wake up shortly after they are done.   Dream 3 MORE Bad:   This dream has be slightly more disturbing than others. It starts like this, my friend Nicole is over with her friend Sarah, her myself, Sarah, Marcus and Daniel are all hanging out in the living room goofing off. At one point I provoke Nicole and she lunges at me, knocking me over from the chair I am sitting on. But because of the way she hits me, she winds up breaking my neck on accident. I wind up being paralyzed from the neck down, In the dream this terrifies Nicole and she sort of "vanishes" after that point. What makes the dream horrible is the fact that I am left without the ability to do anything all of the things I loved to do I can't do anymore. Even the people I care about begin to vanish from my life one by one. In the dream I seem to suffer along for a while until I can't take it anymore and wish to die. However no one will kill me even though I wish to. In the dream I am left to hate my life as long as my natural life span. In the dream I never do die, I left tortured this way.   Dream 4 My subconscious:   In this dream, I am married to Katie, its some point in the future as we are quite a bit older than now. But the dream features not only Katie and I, but our daughter (who has no name that is mentioned). In the dream the three of us are walking along the cliffs in San Diego and for some reason Katie and our daughter slip off the edge of the cliff but are still holding my hand (our daughter is holding Katie's hand). I hold on the best I can, but the top of the cliff is sandy and I am slowly being pulled over the side too. Despite all of our screams for help, most people seem to ignore us. Finally a single person comes over and helps get us all back to safety, I never actually see this person in the dream to put a face or name to them, its just some unknown person. Safe in the dream I hold the two of them tight to me, crying. This is when I wake up, this dream is usually very traumatic and causes me to not be able to fall asleep again.  Now some of you that talk to me regularly have noticed I seem to be erratic, very moody and can sometimes seem "lost". This is the reason, the past month I haven't slept well and I am plagued by dreams, worst of all I am remembering them which is something I rarely do. I only wish I could tell what dreams meant, if there is anyone out there that can decipher these for me, let me know. I would be very interested to find out the meaning.

						   I am slowly growing to hate people everyday. Here is my ever growing list of people I hate:  Soccer Moms. Always hated ya, no change there.  The stupid kit that always looks at me weird if I am outside and he's walking by. Sometimes I just want to punch that little bastard in the face.  Alicia's ex/non-ex boyfriend. He to needs to be punched in the face.  Atkin's Diet people. Eating meat constantly is NOT HEALTHY FOR YOU! You want to lose weight? Peel your gargantuan ass cheeks off the couch and do exercise. Run fatty run! (that wasn't nice I know :P)  People who think they need to lose weight when they really don't. Guess what, you aren't fat, get over it. We all accept and like you for who you are and if you gained weight we'd STILL accept you. If you don't think you are attractive the way you are now, you will never be attractive.  People who drive Hummers or Luxury SUVs. So big, so macho... wait no you're not. Take that overpriced steaming pile of crap off road and see what happens, I DARE YOU.  The lady who tried to purchase $1,600 worth of stuff from Wal-Mart with a MILLION dollar bill. At first I thought she was just a stupid criminal, but the fact that she actually believed it was a legit bill leaves me speechless. MILLION DOLLAR BILL??!?!? Why on EARTH would you even shop at Wal-Mart if you had a million dollars in the first place?  Those stupid Quizno's commercial animal things. Ok you were cool when you were a flash animation for like 2 seconds. Now you're like nails on the chalk board. If there is proof that "Anti-Intelligence" exists in this world, its those damn animal things, and the lady from above.  All in all this sums up the list and is not in any logical order based on level of hate. Note that if you're my friend and you fall under one of these categories, its not directed at you, its everyone else that I hate.  I really just need to get away from here.  Andrew needs a vacation ;)

						   The string of insanity continues......  I found out I have to stay in the apartment another month, so Daniel, Marus and I are all stuck there until June 1st. When I got to work today I had a check engine light on, so I take a peek to see whats wrong under the hood if its something easy. Turns out a vacuum hose had been resting on the belt and got a nice size hole worn through it. Sadly this hose seems to be a mile long and I cant quite get to one end which means I probably have to take the air box out or get under the car to fix it. YAY ME Daniel went to San Francisco so I guess I have the place to myself tonight, I'll probably watch a movie and relax.  Still nothing from Katie, I guess she rode off into the Sunset or something.. In fact, I haven't really heard from ANYONE.. No Jeni, Mik, Warren, Jessica, Taylor or anyone else for that matter.. Maybe I'm dead or asleep.. That could be interesting..  I talk to like 4 people everyday: Keven, Katie (other one),  Sarah and Nicole Everyone else.. nada..  Go figure eh?

						   Its been a busy past few days.  Daniel and Marcus are moving out at the end of the month which means I have to as well.. Somehow I need to get out of the lease before then, and I havent been able to get a hold of our landlord yet. In the meantime I need to get things packed and moved within the next 4 days somehow. I am sad to be leaving the apartment, its been my home for nearly 2 years and I had a lot of good times there, a lot of memories or that place will linger in my heart and mind for years to come. For now I am going to be moving into my friend Corey's which is a more LAN party like environment which is fine with me, atleast I wont ever be bored. ;)  I leave for Washington to help my mom move on Saturday so this week is going to be a busy busy week.  I've decided that I am going to save up my money, and hit the road for a month, just take a road trip and see the countryside. Once I get moved I am going to start saving for this goal.  In addition, and in order to complete this goal, I have to quit smoking. I've been wasting too much damn money on cigarettes and for a year now I've suffered being poor because of it. Starting this week, no more!  As the road trip plan gets fleshed out, and as I progress on my quitting I will keep them noted in here.  Also in the past week, the  "Marin"  has been progressing and hopefully should be done soon. I got a nice compliment from a fellow model railroader calling my weathering jobs beautiful which was a nice compliment.  Otherwise its been a pretty boring past week, but this week should be entertaining to say the least.

						   Its been a week Its been one hell of a week  I spent most of the weekend poor and bored which was my fault, I didn't manage that last check very good. Daniel and Marcus have decided to move out "soon", which means I have to find a new place to live. Right now, I am very close to just getting my debt paid up and then hitting the road, taking the great American adventure for a few months and seeing the country. Then again I might move, it is about time I left the humble burg of Auburn and I have choices open to me. I could always move to Oregon and be close to the Sumpter Valley, or move to Portland with Bonnie and her Roomate. I could move to Colorado, I have a job offer over there that sounds REALLY good right now. Hell I could move to Chama, NM and run Jaybawb out of town ;)  The question is where am I going to go? what am I going to do? where am I supposed to go at this point in time? Could this be a sign for which way my life will go? Or am I just insane..  I've realised that I really dont have many friends in Auburn anymore, sure I see Sarah and Nicole, even Keven and Jeremy from time to time, thats about it beyond Johnny. Even at that, Keven has seemed to ignore me all day which is strange..  I STILL haven't heard from Katie, not sure whats going on there.  All I know is part of me wants to leave here, and never come back.. Part of me wants to leave everyone behind and find a new life.. I want to run.. So no one finds me..

						   Apparently sleep is one thing I just can't get no matter how hard I try. Sure I was up until 4 or 5 or I don't know when... But I was watching Schindler's List... Either way I've been tired all day, I think I fell asleep for a while because I dont remember much of today. I think I'll head to bed early tonight.  I spent a little time working out the new page design for my site. Now the front page has the new little opening image I made. Very old time :) In addition I am going to be getting rid of the black background and moving to more easily read colors, this should help those of you with bad eyes/monitors to read whatever is readable on my site.  In the meantime, things will be buggy while I am working on this mess. There might also be some "ghosts" around that show up.   Other than the things listed above, It has been a slow day at work today. My big pink candle and I have just been sitting here melting away. For fun I photoshopped Sarah which was mildly amusing.. I created a header for Mikky's webpage which replaces what he's got there now. I am not sure if he is going to use it or not, but I like it.  An update from yesterday: Keven's network problem was solved by getting a new cable. Another update: Still nothing from Katie, but I think I have an idea whats going on there. Yet another update: Marcus sucks...  Thats enough for today.. Sleep tonight? maybe? hopefully? Who knows.. Lets hope though.

						   Its Wednesday.. Wow has it been a boring week this far. I finished up the brochure I was working on at work, its off at the printers so hopefully I'll see a copy of it in a day or two. My massive amount of lead weights showed up Monday, so I've been working on models trying to get them done.  So far I finished one car which Johnny loved.  I went over to help Keven with some network issues he is having, I fixed a couple things but not all of them. It seems they need to replace a network cable which potentially must have gone bad.  Lately there hasn't been much going on, to be honest its been quite boring around here. Over the weekend I made a trip to Nevada which was nice to get away for a day.  Sunday I went down to CSRM to take some measurements for the miller buffer I have to build for Daniel's model of the Marin. Once the coupler pocket comes in I will start building the buffer, it should be fun.  For some reason I am still very tired when I wake up, things have been this way for the past few weeks. No matter how much I sleep it doesn't seem to be doing anything. I hate when this happens. It can't be stress because I am not stressed, it could be worries? Who knows.. Hopefully I will feel better soon.  On that note, Katie seems to have vanished. Its been a week since I've heard from her and she just sort of vanished when she went to restart her computer. Lately she'd been having trouble in the computer department. Its possible her computer just blew up. So I am putting out an official APB to find out where she is.. Where are you Katie?

						   The lamp is burning low upon my tabletop, the snow is softly falling. The air is still within the silence of my room, I hear your voice softly calling. If I could only have you near to breathe a sigh or two, I would be happy just to hold the hands I love upon this winter night with you.   The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead, my glass is almost empty. I read again between the lines upon the page, the words of love you sent me.  If I could know within my heart that you were lonely too, I would be happy just to hold the hands I love upon this winter night with you.   The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim, the shades of night are lifting. The morning light steals across my windowpane where webs of snow are drifting. If I could only have you near to breathe a sigh or two, I would be happy just to hold the hands I love and to be once again with you, to be once again with you.   Tye-méla Vénea

						   Ahh yes yes its April Fools Day.  Quite a bit of creativity this year I've gathered from around the net. Here is the list of things I saw today:  The Sun had an interesting article on England's Traffic Cops training hawks with video cameras mounted on them to watch traffic from the air.  Google was looking to hire employees to work their new server farm, on the moon (codenamed GCHEESE). Also Google apparently is starting up their own online email service called GMAIL, although they claim this is in fact legit. We shall see tomorrow wont we?  Homestarrunner.com "apparently" had their domain taken over. The resulting cartoon from that was quite funny.  Startrek.com had whole plethora of jokes including "Trekland" a revue of the album "Let It Be.. Naked Now" featuring select Next Generation actors on the cover. In addition there was a preview for the upcoming "Klingon Eye For The Human Guy" and an announcement for the upcoming Enterprise episode "She" which apparently will introduce the ultimate Xindi weapon; Cindy Brady.  On the railroad front, CTC Board posted a picture of Union Pacific's latest efforts to hold on to trademarks, a Dash 9 painted into the Western Pacific F unit paint from the 70s. I also found reference to the "Atlantic Tunnel Project" on another site which outlines the efforts to build a tunnel under the Atlantic ocean to connect North America to England via railroad. Suprisingly the site is VERY well put together leaving one to wonder if its truely a joke or not.  And Finally Fark.com, never to be out done went full force into the holiday spirit employing different random  "pages" to replace their main page. These ranged from the site being hacked by Guinea Pigs (an old classic) to this gem right here:  urlLink Click To View In New Window . The fun didn't stop there! Comments posted in the feedback sections were subject to the addition of random Homestar Runner quotes as well as language translation.  Those are all the sites I could think of off the top of my head, I am sure there are plenty more I missed.

						   I am up wayyyy too late..  I have been packing and getting ready for the move. I've got 3 days (including today) to get things packed moved and everything taken care of. The sad part is that I am not 100% sure where I am going. I need to get a hold of Corey and get that squared away. Otherwise I will have to relent and go to my sisters or my moms. In either of the latter Daniel is going to be out of luck when it comes to a place to stay. Hopefully however things will be alright and he wont be without a place to stay.  I have set the date for my journey to Denver for June 14th. I MAY have two job interviews if the thing with Caboose Hobbies works out. Cross your fingers! :)  Most likely if I do get the job in Denver, I will move in about a month or so. I will leave most of my things here that aren't essential here for the time being and then get them at a later date.  It looks like this next month is going to be busy and hectic.  On a lighter note, I have had too much to drink. WOOO!  There is only one thing wrong at the moment..  You know what I am talking about (yes you) I know you feel bad for not being able to repay me, but now is your chance. I need your help.

						   Another Payday.. Money thats spent before I even got it. YAY.  I had to wake up at 9:30 to pick Daniel up from the Bus Station, I am really freaking tired today. But I'll live.  On A lighter note, I saw lastnights Enterprise (Season Finale). All I have to say is WOW! I dare someone who wouldn't be interested in the show to watch the reshowing Saturday and NOT want to see what happens at the start of the new season. Thats all I am saying.. I never expected what happens, not in a million years.  In other news I am getting too good at singing Beach Boys songs.. Its hard, but I can pull them off. I need some more practice of course but its good vocal exercise if you sing the harmonies. Out of all the things I do, I think that driving and just seeing the sites is what I like to do most of all. I love to travel, every hour on the road is an adventure! Maybe I should do it more often.

						   I need to get out of here..  I've been in a bad mood all day mostly because of the stupid Foresthill Community Television site. I was sent a "logo" that they wanted to use on the site that looked pretty amaturish, however this logo was too compressed so I requested a less compressed one to make something out of. Rather than get the same one back, I was sent a new improved version of the logo that looks like a child drew it in MS Paint. I was so disgusted that I redrew the original crude image over from scratch as a vector drawing and then used that to create a header image. The result: Something that looked decient.  On top of this I've been posting on a message board where I made the mistake of opening my mouth about something I probably shouldn't have. The result was being "poked" fun at over things that I really didn't care about. I lost it and posted a very rude message because I didnt want to deal with it anymore.  However this isn't the root of my problem. The root of the problem is my inability to deal with life anymore. Everyday is the same damn thing, over and over.. I work at a job I grow to dispise more and more each passing day. I get more and more tired and I am losing the want to get up in the morning at all. The sadest part is that I've been hiding it from everyone for months now. I've continually tried my best to get along like nothing was wrong, when in fact I've wanted to explode. Everyday I go home, and I just want to go to sleep and hope I wake up in a better mood in the morning. Somedays I can't tell the difference between things I've imagined or reality.. Often I'll think people are upset with me or don't want to talk to me when they really aren't.  Where does all of this stem from? I've been stressed over having to move and not knowing where I want to go. I'm barely making enough money to get by each month and everyday I go to work feels like a day wasted. I was "pushed" to work on models constantly for months, something that  drove me crazy until I finally started being unhelpful as much as possible. I've been relied on too much without getting anything in return. Sometimes I've done things and not gotten the credit for my work, rather the person would claim they did it all themselves. Its all too much, I need to get away for a while, I need to save myself before I completely lose it. This is the reason why I've wanted to move.. I can't keep going each day feeling like a time bomb, getting mad over things I shouldn't and being a prisoner in my own mind. I need to get out of here.. I need to go soon...

						   Somehow I managed to stretch this last weekend as long as it would stretch. A couple visits to Matt, hung around the apartment most of the day Saturday.  Sunday I was supposed to go driving around with Biff, but I was too lazy to actually get up at 8am to meet him. Lastnight Keven brought his computer over for a while and we played some games. I got Jeremy hooked on Enterprise by showing him the last few episodes. Apparently its all he talked about on the way home. ;)  Everyone around here seems to be doing well. Sarah is going out with Robbie, (Kristal's ex bf) which is good. Robbie will treat her right unlike the morons she seemed to go out with in the past. So I fully approve. :) Matt is still Matt, I got to see Anna for the first time in months, she was pleased to see me and tipped me off to another job. In Costa Rica! Apparently some guy she is in contact with is looking for a Cold Fusion guy, I am not sure about moving there unless it pays REALLY well. However he may want some contracting work done which would be a good source of side income. I saw Jay last week, he's doing well, working full time and seems to be more laid back that he used to be. He recorded a video of Myself, Daniel and our favorite waitress Christina down at Dennys with his digital camera. I'll get that video from him and post it here, its not very funny I don't I think. We were just talking about something, I can't remember what, but I am sure the wit and wisdom conveyed would interest someone. Bonnie is getting closer to moving to Portland, I wish her the best of luck there I think she'll love it there. On that note, yes Bonnie is moving to Portland and the interesting part is that in the 3 years I've known Bonnie, her and I have never met in person even though she only lives in Grass Valley. I find it funny that the one person I always talk to when I am at work, I've never met, and will probably never meet. Funny how things turn out huh?  This is my last week in my apartment. I have been working on getting more things packed and ready to move. I hope to start moving things either tonight or tomorrow night, It should only (in theory) take a couple hours to move since I don't own much. It looks like I am going for the job interview in Denver next month for sure. Hopefully around the 10th is what I am shooting for.  Work so far this week is going uneventful, I've been working on the webpage for the Foresthill Community Television station. I wish I had full artistic control for the page so I could make it "kick ass" sadly the only thing they have me doing is the basic page layout and putting in a few scrolling news bars and a flash animation. I was told not to spend too much time on the look and feel because its going to get changed anyway. Oh well I can't help that I suppose. :P

						   Its time to continue my previous "essay". So I present to you,  Rules Part 2 :  Addendum to Part 1.  Grrl can also infer that the person chatting is a Lesbian. This was reported to me by Missy as its "fairly common".  13. Names consisting of a band name and another noun or adjective. These sorts are typically your crazy fan type of person. Commonly they will defend their favorite band to the death, sometimes going so far as to make statements that make no sense (I.E. 'Metallica is the greatest country band ever!'). However in addition to being a crazyed fan, they may also be an anti-fan. Typically anti-fans have "hate" or "die" somewhere in there with the band name. These sorts are the exact opposite of the crazed fan, lashing out insults about this band they hate and unchanging in their opinion. You will also hear outlandish statements from these types, though not often. Typically their arguement is "They Suck" or "They're Over-Rated". If you don't like to debate music, stay away from these folk.  14. Names consisting of Random Adjective + Random Noun or Random Adjective + Random Adjective. This is a broad classification, since typically you'll encounter a number of people with names like this. They can be anything from depressed to an EMO kid. Be leery of people with these names whining too much. Keep in mind these people might be nerdy as well, especially if their name is "Nerdular Nerdence".  15. Names using "Pixie", "Punk", or "Rock". Lets face it, no true punk calls themselves punk outwardly. Thats just silly. If you have the need to call yourself a punk and show it off to the rest of the world, chances are you're really an EMO kid who likes to think they are punk by listening to the bubblegum punk thats passed off as true punk these days. The same goes for Pixie and Rock, yes we know you like indie bands and yes we are sure you think you're better than the rest of us. But the fact of the matter is, your crappy EMO bands and small time elitist indie bands are usually typically lousy and reaffirm the fact that you have no decient musical taste. That being said, not ALL Indie bands are bad and not all EMO kids are bad, just some of them.  16. If the name contains "Thug", "Gangsta" or "Bitches". If someone is using this in their name, expect them to be a wannabe gangsta or typically a suburban white boy who thinks he's "the shit" because he has a pimped out Honda, a stereo system that makes up for his lack of penis and "rolls" to the current gansta trends. They are not thugs, pimps, gangstas, or playas. They are sad little boys who try to act tough because they don't know how to exist in the REAL WORLD. Remember no matter how much they claim to be from the street, they aren't.  17. If the name has "Wiccan", "Witch", "Sorceress", "Sorcerer" or any other form of witchcraft related wording of their nickname. Typically this is in fact a Wiccan or someone atleast interested in that religion. However, watch out for names like "Wiccan_Gurl" or "Wiccan_Hottie". This combination of names from part one generally means the Wiccan part is simply for attention and they carry the same characteristics of the second part of the name. See Gurl and Hottie sections. In some cases the combination of words can give interesting results. Expect someone named "Wiccan_Grrl" to be a complete poser princess type who thinks they are a lesbian (Lesbian for attention).  18. Names including "Doll". A person using this in their nickname is generally a very "Cutsy" type person who likes to think they are sweet and the "boys" should be honored to have them. In some cases this is true, in some its a lie. If cutesy people make you gag, you'd be well advised to stay away from the Doll types.  19. Names involving colorful language or racial statements. Lets face it, the Internet is not safe from idiots. There are certainly a fair share of ignorant racists out there, combine that with a veil of anoninimity you have one nasty combination. Often times these people will start ranting and upset someone, when said upset person tells the "racist" to shut up, the racist will tell them "Its a free country" (often forgetting at times, that websites are private property unless specifically noted as public). If the offended makes a valid arguement to the racist about why they are wrong, the normal response will involve "Liberal", "True Americans", "God" and or "Leave America". If you value your own sanity, try to avoid arguing with these people.   20. If the name includes "Nascar", "Hunting" or Anything Dale Earnhart related. Sometimes this person will be a type 19 in disguise. If this isn't the case, remember, their name potentially has "Nascar" in it. Enough said. Unless you like Nascar.. In That case have fun.. But don't talk to me.. Enough Said..  21. Name looks foreign. Chances are, you're going to run into a foreigner online. If you don't then you must not go online much. For the Ladies, expect the guy to be typically horny or fall in love with you in 5 minutes (with out even talking to you or seeing what you look like). For guys, usually it will be some young girl who will want to talk to you constantly and never make any sense or understand what you're saying. In some rare cases this girl MIGHT tell you she loves you. While this might be any guys wet dream, think about it, how safe would it be to fly to Iran to meet some 15 year old girl? If you plan on living you'd be smart not to go. In either case, these people will not shut up EVER, and they will keep making nickname after nickname to annoy you for a while. Just keep your banning finger warmed up and you'll be fine.  22. The most important of all rules. Everyone you talk to on the Internet, excepting bots, is a real person. Some of the examples I've given here may not be correct for every possible instance, if you feel brave try talking to someone despite what their nickname might mean. You could be suprised. Most of all, try to be polite if someone isn't cute enough or they offend you accidentally. Remember there are millions of people online, and they can't read your mind. Be polite and just tell them you need to go if you decide not talk to them anymore. DON'T send them nasty messages like "FUCK OFF!" or "YOU'RE FUCKING UGLY" or things along those lines. They aren't polite and despite how full of yourself you might be, you're not the hottest thing on the block to everyone in the world. Be a decient human being and you might be suprised that you are treated the same in return.  In addition, keep this in mind when looking at a nickname. If the name contains two words from different types I've mentioned above expect that  person to carry both the traits or potentially just one. Its a mix and match game at that point.  Just as everyone is diverse, so are nicknames.

						   A day once dawned, and it was beautiful. A day once dawned from the ground. Then the night she fell and the air was beautiful. The night she fell all around.

						   Its no secret that I am a nerd to the extreme.. I deal with it, and so should you! j/k  However, seeing as I've been chatting since 1996 I've determined a set of rules for determining what sort of folk you are dealing with BEFORE you talk to them. Follow these guidelines next time you talk to someone new and tell me how close I am. ;)  A lot could be said from a persons nickname, some people are blatantly obvious about their character in them, some ironically describe the person without them realising it. Lets take a look at names shall we...  1 .If the potential chattee has a name that contains "hottie" chances are they are one of two things.  a. Vain and Full of themselves, they will most likely not talk to you unless you, yourself are in fact "hot" by MTV/TV/Magazine Definition. These are typically the sort of people who think of beauty as a status symbol and therefore you have to make them more popular. Personality of these people generally borders on Shallow/Stupid. If you have any intelligence, avoid this sort of person.  b. This person may not actually be hot in any way, in fact they may be the exact opposite. However because they have been deluded by thier "ultra-hot" friends into believing they to are in fact hot (I.E. because of status) they will want the same thing example A will want. Oddly enough, the demand for the "hotties" by the "un-hotties" typically is one most people avoid. Keep in mind, these "un-hotties" will in fact insult you just as bad as type A even though you you're self would get a higher score in a beauty contest than they would.  Moving on.. 2. If the persons name is something along the lines of "IM2HOTT4U06". this personal is typically between the ages of 12-14. These people (usually always girls) think they know more about the world than anyone else and are exceptionally boy crazy. Typically these girls have the same desires as #1s but only apply their rules to the cute 16 year old hotties online. If you are older than 18 and one of these girls starts talking to you, be leery. Potentially the only people like this that talk to the over 18 crowd are the young white trash skanks who will most likely have 4 kids by the time they are 20 and live in a trailer park. Nothing good comes from talking to these type of girls ever, remember as you get older and the age difference gets bigger they are up to something if they are flirting with you.  3. Persons name looks like this "Sarah_Cam_xowyawjw". This person is some sort of porn bot.. Don't be fooled! If this person talks to you and "seems" real, test the AI. Ask them a question that would require a thoughtful answer, if the response reads like: "Oh I don't know...lets talk about sex instead" RUN AWAY! BLOCK THIS PERSON!  4. If the persons name contains BBW. By now, you should know that BBW stands for Big Beautiful Woman. However, this is often abused, typically BIG and WOMAN is right but the Beautiful got lost in translation. If you like bigger gals, more power to you. If you're a human stick and value you're bones, ignore this person.  5. If their name contains "Cutie" and "Pics". This might be a porn bot, but most likely is just an advertising nickname for some sort of porn site or cam girl. Avoid these.  6. If the persons name contains: "Gurl", "Grrl" or "Cute Boi". These must be broken down seperately, but they are very similar in definition. A. Gurl: This person comes from the Princess school of thinking, ideally they grow up believing they are the most important person on the planet and if you don't submit to them, you're not worth the time. Typically these people are between 12-16. B. Grrl: This is the 17-21 year old version of type A. They eventually move from princess mode into Avril Lavigne mode and like to believe they are tough and don't take anything from anyone. These sort of people will claim that something in their life is horrible and they're mad at the world because of it (I.E. Drama). C. Cute Boi: When the "Grrl" type grows up (22-?) they become a combination Princess/Avril Lavigne girl. Typically they are tough, in your face but want a sweet boi to submit to them. Hence, coming full circle from where they started. At this point they have become so disillusioned with drama that at any sign of a problem, they'll just tell someone to fuck off or hate them for a while.  Sadly I am not sure what happens after this point. There has to be a 4th step, I just haven't seen it yet. In dealing with these types, be warned that if you don't submit, you're going to be blown off. At later stages you'll just be called an asshole.  7. If the nickname contains: "horny", "penis", "tits", "2night" or "lover". This is a person after one thing, sex and only sex. Typically these would be the playa guys and slut chicks. However you will also encounter the Cheating Boyfriend/Girlfriend or Derived Wife/Husband. If you're looking for a one night stand, these are the people you talk to. However, around these people don't let on that you might be attractive, OR single. You WILL get hit with a million messages from dirty old men/women or horny 16 year old boys. If one of them wants to talk to you, just ignore them, unless of course thats what you're looking for.  8. If their name contains "Cowgirl" or "Cowboy". By default cowboys on the internet are right up there with people from group 8. Typically they just want something to rope and wrangle.. in bed. Better yet, no matter how sweet a cowboy sounds, he's got a 75% chance of being a total redneck and or bigot. If you yourself are a redneck/bigot, this is the type of guy you are looking for. If not watch out. Occasionally a cowboy will message a non-cowgirl with tales of wild nights in bed (out on the range?) and gloat that they have a big penis. However, keep in mind these guys drive BIG TRUCKS and we all know what that means don't we? ;) A "Cowgirl" is going to want one thing, a cowboy. They don't care about anyone else unless you have a tight fitting pair of wranglers on to show off your supposedly "nice" ass. Why does a cowboys ass look nice? Because the Wranglers form the lifeless blob of an ass into looking decient. Any person that truely rides a horse has a flat ass, why? becuase the constant motion of your ass beating on a saddle beats it flat.  9. People with "Darkess", "Vampire" or "Mistress" in their name. This area is sketchy but typically most people who put "Darkess" in their name preceeded by an adjective are young girls or gay guys that like to think they are Goth when in fact, usually its not. Remember if they are 13 and claim to be Goth, they in fact are posers. No one is goth at 13. Don't argue, its true. If the name contains all three of the above listed words, they most likely have some Role Play scenarios they'd like to work out with you. Chances are they are probably a large person OR have been with so many people that they are looking for a new frontier in sex. On the same token, some of these people are honest genuine people and you may or may not share the same interests you do. Chances are if you like Vampires, their name has vampires in it and they aren't 13 you'll get along.  10. A quicky. If the name has "69" in it but nothing sexually related in the name, its a safe bet they in fact do not want to see your penis. Sorry.  11. Name looks like this ~*$@R@h*~ or has any sort of replacement of normal letters with special characters. Based on the area you are chatting this will either be a script kiddie OR some sort of person who thinks they are computer savvy because they found character map and spiced up their boring name "Sarah" to read ~*$@R@H*~. If its a script kiddie (they'll talk in "leet" speak about their exploits, how much the xbox sux and PS2 Ownz joo, etc) try not to piss them off, they'll try to "hack" you and usually fail unsucessfully unless you are a retard yourself. If the hacking fails, they will most likely try and post your email address on some spammer forum. If they aren't a script kiddie most like they will talk like this oMg LoLOlOLOl U R FunNi! Im All Dat and Hott N I HAtE U Bcuz Yur UgLy. These people in fact need to be slapped. There is nothing more to say about this other than they will try to talk to you and their chatting style is annoying beyond belief. Some of them are so terminal you'll have no idea what they are saying because they use so many letters and numbers in place of ACTUAL WORDS you'd think they were playing Bingo or something.  12. Name is like "Justins Girl" or "Sarahs Boy" or "I love Tim!". These  people will drone on and on about their significant other or their crush at the moment. Unless you're a chatty girl who is going to tout your crush back, stay clear of these people.  With that I am going to stop here for the day. I think I set a record for length of journal entry today. I will return tomorrow with a contiunation of rules and finish up the list.

						   Saturday was the 1 year anniversary of the NCNG museum in Nevada City. We had a big gathering up there and it was quite an event. We had old cars on display and our diesel switcher as well as the little Porter steam engine were running. Shuffling cars around the yard. The F&CC boxcar which I've put a lot of work in made its first public appearance, its truely the most beautiful piece we have.  Saturday was also my Mom's birthday so after the museum I went down and spent some time with her and her crazy dog. My mom found my long lost letter opener that I've been trying to track down for years, Its good to have it back :) Then I met up with Sarah and Katie and went to Dennys for some food, after that we went down to Matts and met up with the gang and hung out. I accidentally elbowed Sarah in the nose and felt like crap the rest of the night. Late at night Daniel and I decided to hit a local bar. However the bartender aka little hitler kicked us out because he didn't "recognize" Daniel's military ID. Daniel was upset and said some choice words at which point the guy grabbed a wooden chair and threatened to throw it at Daniel as well as kick his ass. Needless to say we were distraught by the events so we went home and drank. I did talk to some cops over at 7-11 about what happened and they told me that they have a lot of trouble with that guy and that when his boss gets back he's going to get fired.   Sunday nothing really happened, I sat at home, went to the movies with Sarah and Katie but forgot to eat before hand so I was miserable. I got food afterward and brought something for Daniel. The rest of the night I sat at home.  Someone was talking to me today about nicknames for some reason, and I figured up a list of the nicknames I call people and they call me. Some of them I don't say around the person, I just use it when referring to them with my friends.  Names I Call People: Keven - Chuckles or Kevvie Bonnie - Bonnilicious Katie (Foresthill) - Spicy Asian My Katie - Dr. Katie or Shady Jeni - Jenijeni Johnny - Grandpa Herman - Herman-man Jonathan Lewis - The Kid Allen - Mik Sarah - Aranel Iris - Model Chick Matt - Matticus Craig - Craigy Nicole - Ambrose Brian - Deetchler  Names People Call Me: Hoss - Allen Honky or Honks - Keven Old Man - My Katie Lazy Ass - Biff Long Bug or Bug - Sarah and Nicole Nerd or TrainGeek - Bonnie Biscuits or Son - Johnny  I am sure I missed a few but those are the ones I could think of off the top of my head.

						   I've been asked why I feel its time to leave here for a while. The reasons are complicated, some are not ones most people would expect.  I've lived in Auburn for as long as I can remember and I've made many life long friends here. But Auburn isn't the same as it once was, I remember an Auburn with open space, friendly people and genuinely a wonderful place to live. As much as I love it here, everything is changing.  I remember just 4 years ago being able to drive from Lincoln to Roseville and the landscape being beautiful open countryside. Something you are hard pressed to find out there now. I remember the roads leading from Auburn all went into the unknown for a kid. The world seemed huge in these eyes. The only thing you could see were the beautiful golden rolling hills, and air as clean as could be. If gold was still to be found in the foothills, this was it.  I've watched for years as the beauty of the world around me has been stripped, paved and turned into mini-malls, subdivisions and churches. The best example of this is the drive south from Lincoln. Turn onto Industrial Blvd and drive what was once the old "highway" to Roseville. Right before you hit the road to the Casino, notice the landscape around you, grasses, creeks and a place full of life. Look further out and see the new housing developments, the Casino, the industries and take another look at the area directly around you. At one point, this is all there was, the beauty of the California hills, and valleys at your fingertips, a site now soon to vanish into the sea of pavement.  To me, the nature of the west is my spirit, every passing month the dark ocean swallows the natural beauty here and my soul. One day what beauty is left will simply be another suburb of Sacramento, a soulless wasteland where beauty once reigned. My soul longs again for the beauty of nature, the freedom to stand on a hill at dusk and know that for miles around you are away from it all. It is for this reason that I am at home in the mountains, in the plains or standing next to the ocean.  My heart, my soul and my clarity in life has always been the open space. With out that space, I lose who I am, and all I will be.  So the title of this entry, "The Last Resort" is a title of an Eagles song, one approprate to how I feel. Download it for yourself and listen to the message.

						   People piss me off sometimes.. I woke up this morning with a message from my friend Jesse stating that if I see any Muslims today that I should yell at them to "Get the fuck out of our country". When I wake up the morning I am not usually in a good mood so I responded with a simple "Sometimes I wish you'd just die".

The fact of the                                   matter is you've ALWAYS been that way and                                   thats why no one liked you around.. You are a                                   complete and total dick, and now becuase there                                   is a war on you think that justifies the right                                   to villify ALL Muslims becuase a handful of                                   idiots are causing problems?

Even by the most conservative of folk in the                                   country  Songbird   5/12/200 8:00 PM  I've tried for years now to be understanding                                   of the bile that comes from your mouth and                                   your mind. But fact of the matter is you'd be                                   better off living down south with the rest of                                   the good old boys complaining about the damn                                   Muslims, Wetbacks, Niggers and Jews  "runnin                                   this great country into the ground".  Songbird   5/12/200 8:03 PM  and for the recond I do not approve of any of                                   the shit thats happened to our troops in Iraq,                                   its disgusting, pure evil and vile..                                     Songbird   5/12/200 8:03 PM  But the fact of the matter is not everyone is                                   like that and if you claim to be intelligent                                   at ALL you'd know that.. Its safe to say we                                   both agree that shit is horrible, but I am not                                   going to blame everyone for it.. Otherwise I'd                                   say crime is all the fault of black people,                                   mexicans are sneaky, and jews are greedy and                                   all white people are rednecks.. It just doesnt                                   work that way to broadly spew things at the                                   world    After this point I assume he put me on ignore with his oh so witty calling me Un-American. I also neglected to mention the Crusades at all in the list of terrible acts by Christians. It would have been more appropriate than the example I gave. Oh well :P

						   I made the trip to Washington and back in once piece. It was a long journey, and I kept a journal of those days on the road. I will type this journal up and post it on here shortly. So I wont talk about the trip this post.  Meanwhile back at home things are going alright. I have gotten my credit card paid off, even finished a few models on the side. I started redesigning my website as some of you can tell, in the end it should look much like this page does now. Note, you should now have the option to leave comments to each of my posts, assuming this whole thing works. If not, oh well. :P  I am getting ready to move and thinking about doors that have opened to me in the past month. I now have 3 options where to live when I move, I haven't decided on one yet though. You might ask, why am I being lazy about it? Why haven't I decided yet? Well there is a 4th option, one which I haven't mentioned to many people. I have been offered a job in Denver, doing webpage design for a professional company out there. In fact its a far better paying job than what I have here (about 40k a year), I would have to interview for it, and certainly there is no 100% guarantee that I will get the job. If I did, it would be an opportunity to get out of the state for a while and make a decient living. The problem however is if I am sure I want to leave or not, fear on my part. I know Katie lives in Denver and she is not the reason I would move, this is just an oddly timed coincidence. However I can't claim that I don't think about living closer to her like this, because it crosses my mind constantly. Mostly, I wonder what would happen if I lived that close, not to me, but to her. I think my fears stem from the possibility of upsetting her by moving there potentially or possibly in someway making things difficult for her by me being nearby. Most of you know I worry about things to much, and I am nutorious for overthinking things in life around me. For all intents and purposes things very well may just be fine and I might get to see her from time to time.  But then, there is the second problem.. What happens to everyone here that I'd leave behind? Would everyone be alright? How would Sarah, Jeni, Keven, Johnny and others react to my leave? Part of me knows deep down inside that I need to leave for a while, to see the world, new people and places. I've lived here so long its engrained in my heart, all of the things here, things I wish I could take with me. Ultimatly it comes down to what is going to be best for me, and right now I can't decide, I am close to leaning either way.  So I am asking those of you who read this, what should I do? Assuming the comments bit works, leave me a comment and give me your advice.

						   This is a public service announcement:  I love it when I get calls to the office. But the person calling doesn't leave a number for me to call back OR even a message for that matter. So far this week I've recieved calls from: "Hope" and "Nika"  Now.. Hope would be interesting, could it be my long lost friend Hope?? She has my cell # though...  and who is "Nika"? In both cases these people said they wo uld call back, guess what! THEY NEVER DID!!!  ARGH!!!!!!!  /end public service announcement  In other news, I have been dreaming again. Yes dreams as strange as always.. Nothing describes the feeling of dreaming about someone that you haven't talked to in a while. Are they ok? Am I ok? Have I lost my marbles? Is it my sub-concious? Or is my empathy trying to tell me something? Normally a dream or two isn't important.. But I am talking about sheer volume here.. I normally don't remember dreams, but I've woken up remembering them for 3 weeks now. They are all "related" in some way, and none of them make any logical sense, like the pieces of 4 similar puzzles mixed into the same box.   There's a train down at the station, it's come to carry my bones away.  Two engines on, twenty-one coaches long, end to end, twenty-one coaches bend.  The watchman's out kicking the bums about.

						   As a testiment to the quality work I bumble through everyday. We had a customer concerned about a ticket order he had placed. As it turns out his order said he was going to get charged something like 25,023,324.00  I took the time to investigate how on earth this happened. Everything in the database looked fine, one ticket at $190. Nothing major there. The email it sent me read fine, so I wondered how only he would get a message saying that? On a whim I did some digging and noticed something strange in the code. What happened was my changing the form each event so I dont have to re-write the whole thing. Well last event they had me add this field for a second special pre-event. This time I needed to add a field for "Registering Mentor", so I reused the old pre-event field in the database and form keeping the same input name used previously. Well I had forgotten that the pre-event ticket price was hardcoded into the order page. In addition a persons "Registering Mentor" is an IBO number, usually around 7 digits long. So when the form was submitted, some wild math took over.  Something like this: Total = (Ticket Price * Number Of Tickets) + (Registering Mentor * 39.00) See what happens when I rush to do code when I am half asleep? Thankfully however, no one was harmed or over charged. The system still does credit card payment the old fashioned way.  Enough of my programming foibles. Over the weekend I got to play City of Heroes, which I must say is a pretty entertaining game. Corey and Lori got their own copies and  when they are at work they are going to let me play on Corey's account until I get my own copy.  Daniel has been busy getting ready to move. Most of his stuff is packed and ready to go.  Most of the weekend was slow, Corey and I went nuts driving around Sac on Friday night. Saturday I pretty much sat at the computer staring off into space until I re-installed windows. Sunday I played Battlefield 1942 for about 5 hours straight, managed to get something to eat and then spaced out staring at the wall for about 3 hours.  Eventually Kassandra (Lori's bestfriend and an old High School friend of mine) stopped by while doing her paper route and I snapped out of it. We started talking about music, and she asked me if I had some songs, which of course I did, because frankly I have everything. One of which I thought was interesting, the song "God Only Knows" by the Beach Boys (on of my favorite songs). So I played it for her, and told her about how I can sing it, so before she left I sang two songs for her "Surfer Girl" and "God Only Knows". Normally I don't sing for people, I know of about 4 people that have heard me sing. Kassandra told me that I have a beautiful voice and that I made her cry, quite flattering. :) That made my night, I never thought I could make anyone cry from my singing. Maybe I need to sing for people more often.

						   Well the good news is.. apparently the Police are leaving me alone now. Thank god! I wasn't sure I could live with that stress anymore, it was driving me nuts.  I have also managed to borrow enough money to get my car payments caught up. So I will atleast still have my car. :) I even managed to figure out what was wrong with my computer at home. It was down most of the night lastnight but when I get home I should get it fixed back up.  I devoted a good portion of my day yesterday to working on my website. It is starting to look more appealing, even though half of the links don't work. I decided to stick with the sort of Victorian Era book appearance, I think its a nice change from the black, white and purple I was using before. Why oh Why I used those nasty colors I will never know..  Tonight, the "gang" and I are having a Farscape marathon, WOO HOO! Actually I don't know how it will go, I never watched much Farscape.  As for everything else, I am SO upset at two people that will go unnamed (they know who they are). At this point I hope I never talk to them again, what they have done is uncalled for and downright rude. I honestly could careless anymore. And no, one of these people isn't Katie.

						   This is my 60th post to my journal.. Doesn't seem like a lot but when I started this I was a year younger and the world was different.  In some ways things are the same, in others they have changed dramaticly. But today is my birthday and I am now a whopping 24!  What did today hold for me? Well Jessica told me never to contact her again and as far as she is concered I never existed. All because she took offense to my journal post about nicknames.  Jeni wrote me a birthday email to tell me that I am a horrible friend and that I apparently don't care about anyone other than myself when they are in need. In the end giving me a nice "Happy Birthday" ending the email.  Katie has forgotten about my birthday for the first time ever, though I can't blame her, she's pretty busy the best I can figure.  The police think I am a criminal and there is no way that I can see to prove my innocence.. For some reason APD works on the guilty until proven innocent system until they determine otherwise.  So as I sat this evening looking at the evening sun setting, I watched the swirled sherbert sky and clouds and thought. This could very well be the worst birthday I've ever had, and that is saying a lot. I've wanted to do nothing but sit at home all day, cry and be alone.  Tonight I burn a candle to a year gone by, and I look back at everything leading to this day. The light that glows reminds me that no one has forgotten me this day, that I am in the hearts of many and I mean the world to them even though they can't tell me themselves.  I remind myself, that I am loved. Because of this, I remember who I am and where I am going.  Though you aren't here this day. I feel you in my heart. The love you give. I cherish my life. To love and be loved. A gift that can't be taken away. Dream of me this night. As I will dream of you.

						   About two months ago, someone stole a laptop from a person that shares space in my Auburn office. As it turns out it was my friend Mary Helen at Parallax whom it was stolen from. Immediatly there after I recieved a call from the police since I had gone to the office that night to drop something off and check on my servers. More on this in a bit  This isn't the first time I've had dealings with the police. Last year around October or so I was called by the Sheriff reguarding a coworker who had left her new husband and was out running around with some guy. The Sheriff explained that she came home and told her husband that she had been raped. He took her to the police station where she confessed that she wasn't really raped but had cheated on her husband, it was a mistake and she didn't want him to find out. The police filed a report anyway and asked her who she had slept with "just in case". Among those people she named me off. So the officer was calling to confirm this with me, after the inital shock of the words "sheriff's office, rape and questions" I was sort of freaked. However I never had any sort of relationship with this person in that manner. From time to time she would come visit me at the appt and vent about her husband who she felt treated her bad. I explained this to the deputy and everything got squared away. Needless to say, calls from the police scare me.  Back to the matter at hand. After the theft of the laptop I got a call from APD to ask some questions about if I had seen anyone since I was the last one out of the building. I did my best to describe what I remembered and explained why I was there. I also explained why I had turned the alarm off and a minute later turned it back on. The reason? Because there was another guy working when I came in, when he left he didn't realise I was there and turned the alarm on while I was in the building. In order to leave I had to turn the alarm off and then back on again. The officer understood and that was the last I heard of it.  Fast forward to today. I had recieved a call from a different officer yesterday asking if I could come in for some questions. I said sure since I wanted to see the thief caught as much as they did. Mary Helen lost a lot of work that was on her laptop and I felt bad for her. I show up around 11am this morning to answer questions and I am lead to an interogation room and the questioning begins. However, this isn't the same type of questioning as before. 2 months ago I wasn't a suspect and Mary Helen vouched for me to the officers before that she knows me and knows I didn't take it since I do work for her from time to time and such.  Today however, I was the prime suspect. The questioning wasn't so much questioning as it was trying to get me to confess. They threw all sorts of things at me, like supposedly having me on tape in the act to talking to my coworkers who had said when I am around things tend to "vanish". I explained my side and told them everything I knew, everything I saw and tried to prove that it couldn't have been me. In fact I mentioned that I had been chatting to people online from my office when I was there so I had a record of what I was doing the whole time I was there (about an hour). The first officer stepped out for a bit and sent in officer #2, a much hardened and too the point guy. He explained that they just wanted the laptop back and asked if I knew what the punishment was for this sort of thing. I said I wasn't sure and he sort of was agast at that, but what the hell would I know? I'm not a criminal.. Again he brought up the tape, and how could it not be me if said tape shows me in the act, etc.. I got upset at this point and told them that their tape was wrong and it must have been someone that looked like me, but it SURE AS HELL was NOT ME. I remember everything I did that night and  I didn't even go near that part of the building. I did what I had to do and left. Finally I was given the option to take a lie detector test and of course I said yes. The officer asked me what I thought the test would prove and I said that I didn't do it. So they tried to get the guy they needed to do it but he wont be available until tomorrow, so they let me leave and to come back tomorrow (I had the option the whole time to leave whenever I liked but I felt it would look bad if I didn't answer things to the best of my ability).  So all day today I've been very upset, I went and spoke to Mary Helen and she pointed out that whomever took the laptop didn't bother to take the cords effectively making it useless without a way to charge the battery and that if someone tech savy like myself would have taken it, I would have taken the cords. I then talked to my bosses and told them whats going on and if they had some "miracle" evidence somehow that I might not be to work for a while. They made a mention that they don't know what coworkers they talked to but it wasn't anyone that they know of in Foresthill. Which is about 99% of the employees. They also said not to worry they don't have any evidence and there are no cameras, my boss of all people would know this since we have thousands of dollars of equipment there. But my question is why? What sort of questioning was that.. there was no questions just "we know what happened and we know it was you" when in fact it wasn't. It seemed they wanted BADLY for me to confess to the crime going far enough to tell me that they could get a warrant for my arrest TODAY if they wanted to. They seemed to be focusing on me and the other guy that was there who was unlikely to steal anything since he never leaves his office, I don't even know his name. Despite the fact that Mary Helen is near a door which most of the day is unlocked and doesn't close properly, and that she left at 6pm when people come and go from 6pm to 10pm as they please. It could have been ANYONE that just walked into the open door grabbed it and ran off. Instead, they are trying to make it some sort of "inside job" with me as the prime suspect apparently.  I knew APD sucked ass, but this is just plain stupid! Everyone knows it wasn't me except the people investigating the damn thing. They must have run out of ideas and thats why its taken them 2 months to decide I did it. Its bullshit and I am mad as hell. So tomorrow I go in for my "test" and if somehow I fail the damn thing I am getting a public defender and I am going to not only prove I am innocent but sue the bastards for this harassment.  This is fucked up!

						   Its funny the people you meet on the bus.. I've heard horror stories, well we've all heard horror stories to be honest. Thankfully on my journey, I was spared the insane or the weirdos. I met some interesting people thats for sure, but no one I would classify as terrible.  First up: Texas Guy. The first person I had the pleasure of sitting next to was this quite outspoken man from Texas. But rather than being annoying in a stereotypical Texan fashion he was actually quite an interesting guy. It turns out he hates Texas and is moving to Oregon, so he spent some time bagging on Texas and enjoying the scenery. I was going with him as far as LA so in LA I showed him the Hollywood sign and other sights as we drove past them. All in all he was a pretty cool guy.  Also on the trip there was a cool guy going back to Ohio. He was a nice guy and was actually on the trip with me all the way to Denver when he continued and I got off the bus. The funny part is that for the most part he looked like a Neandertal. If you saw this guy on the street you'd expect him to grunt and beat his chest. He was nearly completely covered in hair and even had the facial features, it was odd to say the least. However he was a really cool guy and it turns out he was going home to Ohio to see his family and such.  Depite these two cool folk, there was one VERY strange guy that got on the bus in Stockton..  He apparently was from San Diego and decided to just get on the bus and go one day in some sort of "find myself" mission. The problem? It seemed he had been on the bus too long, and went off a couple times with these deep thoughtful hippie like ramblings.. in response to a question.. He would just start to ramble and it made no sense delivering such classy lines as "You've given me what only a woman can give!" in response to someone giving him a cigarette. Oddly enough, with a shortage of seats on the bus he gave up his seat to someone and walked off the bus. We assumed he'd be back on since there were a few seats left. Apparently not.. the bus left without him, thankfully.  Also on the bus I met 2 guys from Weimar who were headed to San Diego, they seemed pretty cool but I didnt talk to them much.  From LA to Denver there werent many new people. I encountered a couple foreign girls in LA who were waiting for a bus, I over heard them talking. More on these girls later. We did pick up two girls going back to Vegas, one had her little daughter with her that was 9 weeks old. It turns out neither knew the other was from Vegas and wound up sitting next to each other and hit it off. They were right behind me so I could hear everything they said. The "mom" had left her boyfriend and was staying with family in LA, she began to his the boyfriend a lot and was going home. The other girl got in some sort of fight and was kicked out of her grandpa's where she was staying so she was going home. The problem? Well these two girls were about as "ghettofied" as you can get, and proceeded to talk about their thug boyfriends and what gangs they rolled with, etc... As creepy as that was they were quite nice and the "mom" spied me sketching the mountains and I talked to them both a little.  When we reached Vegas about half the bus got off and while I was standing around, I encountered the Foreign girls again who had taken the later bus. This time there were 6 of them. I happened to wind up talking to them and learned they were from Poland. They had never met each other before and were sort of on a "mission". Which to me seemed very sketchy. This mission was for the 6 of them to move to Vegas, find jobs and stay for 3 months, then return. I didn't know what to think, I could see possibly doing something like that for school or what not, but anywhere but Vegas. I felt sorry for the girls who were just the sweetest people I met the whole trip and I wished I could have stayed longer. There were plenty of seedy characters out on the street that were eyeing them like wolves after a calf.  We didn't pick up any from Vegas until about Grand Junction. There we picked up a mom and son, the son was about 12 years old. One of the skinniest kids I've ever seen (YES SKINNIER THAN ME!). He and his mom lived in Denver and he was pointing things out to me on the trip. He was a nice kid and I watched him play gameboy a lot.  In Denver I didn't really meet anyone because I didn't have time to socialize.  On the return trip I only met two people. One was a guy that seemed to look like an escaped convict. I would have moved my seat if there was room but I wound up setting by him. He was silent most of the trip until about 3 hours into the trip when he said something at a stop. As it turned out he was going home to Salt Lake City and had been on the bus since Tampa after seeing his mom and gay brother. It had been 24 years since he saw his mom and wanted to restore the family bonds again. The problem was the brother was in the way, caused problems and genuinely pissed off this guy. He said to hell with it and went home, he figured it was better this way since he'd been without them for so long, it wasn't worth the trouble now. Pretty sad if you ask me. The other person was this little Asian girl, sweet as can be and took an interest to the previous guys tattoos (his arms were covered). She was very nice and got off the bus in Salt Lake City too. From then on, the bus was pretty empty and I spent most of the time asleep. There was a mom and daughter (daughter was about 3 or 4) and they were pretty nice, the daughter was pretty funny and went to sleep pretty early on.. She bounced from seat to seat enough until she fell asleep I guess. The mom didn't say a whole lot, when she did she sort of sounded like Katie's mom which was strange she too went to sleep after a while. From the Utah stateline to Reno the bus was quiet atleast the few moments I was awake anyway. ;)  All in all, I met a lot of nice people and one day if I take the bus again hopefully the trend will continue.

						   I'm back! After many hours of bus riding, I made it back from Denver last night. I really like Denver, it is one cool town and even though I was walking everywhere, thankfully I never had to walk more than a mile to get where I needed to be. I found it interesting that nearly everything was just right downtown. The Interview went well (I think) and I should find out about the job in a few days. Keep your fingers crossed! I learned a few things on this trip.  The major bus stop in LA sucks, its in the most ghetto place I think I've ever been to. Las Vegas sucks too.. I mean 90 degrees at 11pm?? No thanks.. Utah is pretty much still just "Utah". Colorado is very colorful, and I enjoyed the scenery a lot! On the trip in, we went through Grand Junction and along Tennesee Pass, there are some cool towns up there, I even passed places like Vail and what not. We reached Frisco which is wayyy up in the mountains, along the old Boreas Pass line of the Denver South Park and Pacific. It was cold sort of rainy but it was pretty up there. The bus then went up the highway more and we kept gaining altitute working up to around 10,000 level before going through Eisenhour tunnel. I had forgotten the tunnel was there and when we exited the tunnel I was shocked to see where we were.. Silver Plume! Thats right, this trip I got to see in person for the very first time the Georgetown Loop Railroad. Its a neat little operation, and I hope next time I am out there I will get to ride the railroad and spend more time exploring that area. From there we shot down the highway to Denver and I got dropped off at the Union Station in Denver which is a pretty cool building.  On the trip back, we took the same route out of town, but rather than going through Silver Plume and the tunnel again we got on to I-40 and headed to Winter Park. This highway alone is one of the most amazing roads I have ever been on! The road wound up the mountain side like stairs until we reached the top of Berthoud Pass, nearly 12,000 feet. The view was beautiful! If I move to Denver that trip will be one I take from time to time when I need to get away. I only wished I had a camera!  The rest of the trip wasn't very exciting, mostly because it was dark and until we reached the Salt Lake City area I couldn't see much. It had been 5 years since I was in SLC and it was still like I remember it weather wise. There were some new buildings and a very nice transit system, I was impressed. The rest of the trip was Desert and I remember that part very well from my previous trips out that way. I reached Reno around 4:30pm and Corey and Lori met me to pick me up, when I got home, I sat down, had something to eat and just relaxed. It was certainly an amazing journey, and even if I don't get the job, I am happy because I got away for a while, out on my own just exploring the world.  I want to say thanks to the people that helped me on this: Lynn: She was a HUGE help in getting me a hotel room in Denver. I couldn't have made this trip without her. On top of this, when I "didn't want" to go, she kicked my ass and told me to stop being stupid and go.  Corey and Lori: They picked me up from Reno with little notice. Originally Lynn had planned to pick me up but some things came up and she wasn't able to make it. In addition to picking me up with so little notice they were both late to work and I felt bad for making them late, but I really appreciate what they did.  I will talk more about the people on the bus tomorrow, I met some interesting characters on the trip, and thankfully no real weirdos. :D

						   This is it.. An hour to go..  I have nearly 3 days of bus ride ahead of me, and I am nervous, and scared. But this trip was my choosing, its a great gamble and one I fought and decided upon mentally to do. Things may wind up being great, they might wind up terrible. Either way, its an adventure. Even though some things had to be changed last minute, things are looking up.  I take with me the well wishes of everyone here at home, and those abroad. Farewell my friends, I shall return to you all soon.  I will have my cell phone with me and I will try to call everyone I can when I get settled into my hotel. IF for some reason you don't hear from me by Tuesday night, call my cell OR contact the Continental Hotel in Denver and make sure I have checked in.  I'll talk to you all soon. Wish me luck

						   I leave tomorrow at 4:00 for Denver. Currently the plan looks like I will arrive in Denver around 11pm on Tuesday. I will stay the night, go to my interview at 10:00am on Wednesday. After which I'll wander around downtown for a while and get back on the bus at 5pm for the trip home. I should be home around 8am on Friday. All of that travelling for nothing more than a few hours. :P I don't really have anything else to do in Denver, and I don't know anyone there so there is no reason to stay longer at the time being. This weekend has been enjoyable. Corey, Lori and I have been playing a lot of Battlefield 1942. Daniel plays some too but usually winds up shooting us even if we're on the same team. I bought a neat graphic novel yesterday called "Marvels" its essentially the telling of the beginnings of Marvel super heroes from the eyes of a mere mortal. I read the whole thing lastnight, it really is a great story. I wished it was longer than it was. ;)

						   Today is payday.. this of course means its now time to get my ticket to Denver.  For the past 2 days I have been debating going on not. In leau of recient events I've really been in a hard place when it came to planning. It was lastnight however that all of that changed. Lynn, my old drinking buddy came online and was talking to me about my interview. Well I told her that I wasn't going to go because I couldn't afford to get a place to stay in Denver, and so I'd just let this job slip away. But Lynn, always keen to kick my ass when she needs to demanded I stop being stupid and don't do my usual passive dismissal of things when they go wrong. To top it all off, she said she'd pay for a place for me to stay just as long as I went. So the good news is I am without a doubt, going to Denver, and I am going to go to this place and interview my heart out and get this job! I am not planning on staying in Denver longer than I need to this trip. Because I still have rent due at the end of the month I can only miss a few days of work, so I should be gone about 4 days and only 1 day will be actually in Denver. As always I will have my phone with me so if I am needed, it will be easy to get a hold of me. My plan is to leave Monday and be home by late Thursday night.  This all sounds good on paper.. but not in my heart. The company I have the interview with is a VERY professional company and does impressive work. Sadly its more impressive than anything I've done graphically.. Backend coldfusion wise its stuff I could do, but I've never been able to stretch my legs graphicly here at foothill.net A result of this, is my page designs being having very dated appearances. Its because of this, I have this feeling like I am not going to get the job and that this is a waste of my time.. But I know that is in my mind and I CAN do this, its just hard to let go of those fears sometimes. Either way, I am going to go and do my best and present things to the best of my ability.  I'll see where the road takes me from there.

						   Have you ever wanted to explode into say.. pure energy? and say.. level a whole city block? Thats how I felt lastnight. See...  I called someone I hadn't talked to in a while.. got someone I wasn't expecting and got hung up on! I didn't say anything to piss them off.. Just found out it was me, and hang up. The only thing I did say, my tone was a little weird so maybe that upset them.. ok I can deal with that, I was in a state of shock.. But I mean come on??? WTF  In other news: My interview is offically June 16th at 10:00am in Denver with Spire Media. Looks like I am taking greyhound, and sleeping on a park bench. WOO...  Corey, Lori and I managed to make a damn good Burrito the past two nights as we've perfected the recipe.. Its the best Burrito EVER!  I am starving.... Keven owes me $20 that I have been waiting on for the past few days. This money of course, was my lunch money for this week. By the time I get it, I wont need it I am sure now since I get paid in 2 days. But until then, I have nothing to eat here at work.. and this really sucks.. Sooo hungry.... Maybe I'll steal someone elses food..

						   An article on fark today listed the "50 Greatest Song Parts". Thats right, not the whole song, but the best parts of songs. To see the list go here:  urlLink retroCRUSH: Top 50 Song Parts . While its a good list and obviously influenced by personal taste, some of the parts may not appeal to everyone. I decided, that I to would list my favorite 40 song parts. So here we go!  40: The Beatles - "Sun King" As the previous song fades out, the crickets pick up in the beginning of this song. Its really very soothing. However not many people have heard the crickets because they don't listen for them.  39: Ben Folds Five - "One Angry Dwarf.." I have always loved this solo because the chords have a very jazz like tone to them, except they are played angrily, and then at the end he goes into a little run that lends another hint of anger to the song.  38: The Beach Boys - "California Girls" Most people don't catch it right away, but the words "Girls, Girls, Girls, Yeah I Dig Girls" is the perfect touch to the end of the song.  37: Little Guilt Shrine - "Jet, Jackie and J.C." Sure its a song about Jackie Chan, which is alright. But the very end of the song has always seemed to get a chuckle out of me. Out of nowhere comes this seemingly random 60s horror movie ad for "Dr. Jeckl and Sister Hyde". If you haven't heard the song before, let me know. I'll arrange for you to hear it.  36: George Harrison - "Run of the Mill" This is one of George's truely masterful guitar creations. This little piece speaks a lot for the song itself, if you can find a bootleg acoustic version, give it a listen. Otherwise the album version from All Things Must Pass has the same effect.  35: Nick Drake - "From The Morning" If you're a fan of Nick Drake, you'll know all about his "Drone Note". If you don't the "Drone Note" is a note Nick Drake would play repeatedly not as a bass line as an additional sound. Sometimes I've found the most powerful part of a song is not always a solo or verse, but the subtle changes most people miss. This is a perfect example, this simple flat note change sets the whole tone of the song. The prime example of this takes place around 1:06 in the song. Listen for it through the rest of the song once you've heard it  34: The Beatles - "Getting Better" Crisp, bright and to the  point. When this came out in 1966, this chord change would have been the greatest thing anyone heard. Its pure genius on Paul's part, the progession is simple and effective, its catchy and stays in your head.  33: The Guess Who - "American Woman" (Single Version) Like #34, this chord progression will stay in your head all day, its very catchy and gritty. This riff is so memorable that you'd be hard pressed to find someone who DIDN'T know it.  32: Doc Watson - "Shady Grove" Even if you don't like Bluegrass, you have to admit that the alternating guitar/banjo solo work on this song is smart. Essentially the "solos" are variations of what they play during the main verse and get more complex as the song progresses, providing a melodic evolution throughout the song.  31: The Beatles - "Get Back" Billy Preston's Keyboard Solo on "Get Back" sets this song in stone. There are two parts that MAKE the song Get Back, John's Lead Guitar, and Billy's Keyboard. If you've ever heard a version of Get Back without the Keyboard solo, it just sounds empty and hollow, Billy came up with a Solo that is memorable, something everyone knows filled with melodic changes, it seems to be all over the place. I've been guilty of whistling along many times.  30: Allman Brothers Band - "Blue Sky" Normally I don't like long guitar solos, but this is an exception. Starting at 1:07 the solo runs until 2:28 when a second guitar kicks in by 2:42 the solo has been handed over to the other guitar seamlessly and the solo continues until 4:15 when they make their way back to the lyrics. Essentially this song is one long guitar solo, but its smooth and pleasant to listen to, if you are in the right mood, the solo conveys the emotion in the song.  29: The Beach Boys - "California Girls" Ahh the intro to "California Girls", Again we revisit the Beach Boys and the genius of Brian Wilson. The intro has an epic sound to it, its an intro that takes you somewhere.. where? why to California! If there could be music every day when the sun rose over California, it would be this first 22 seconds of "California Girls". Use your imagination and picture LA as the sun rises with this as a background and you'll see what I mean.  28: 10,000 Maniacs - "These Are Days" The Opening 45 seconds of "These Are Days" (Unplugged version of course!) is a suprisingly interesting piece of music. First its the Mandolin, then the Guitar Joins In, Then the Bass, Organ, and Piano all before Natalie Merchant even sings, The timing of every instrument is perfect and builds the song up to a rising start.  27: Arlo Guthrie - "City Of New Orleans" Of course I had to do a railroad song, but not any old railroad song. This is the ONLY song that captures the sense of riding a train, musically. Listen to Arlo's light melodic guitar as it drives the song. The piano adding the additional "sway" and the simple drum track adding that "clickity clack" sound. While the song itself is a sad tribute to the death of the railroad, the music itself keeps the essence alive.  26: Dave Matthews Band - "Spoon" Bela Fleck's banjo work on "Spoon" is amazing. From the handsome banjo solo to the compliment to Dave's guitar Bela does a beautiful job with the song. This is no folky banjo, this sounds very much right at home with the mood of the song. What always sticks in my mind is the little "secret song" played by what sounds to be Dave Matthews, Tim Reynolds and Bela Fleck. Its a running improvision which Before These Crowded Streets was tied together with. Part of this "tune" can be heard at the very end of "The Last Stop" and shows up again in  a longer haunting form with words after "Spoon".  25: The Beach Boys - "Heroes And Villains Suite" There is a bit of Orchestra at 2:06 in the unfinished track from  Smiley Smile . This is NOT in the later released version of "Heroes and Villains". Smiley Smile was intended to be Brian Wilson's masterpiece, sadly Brian never finished it with the beach boys. While bootleg versions differ in how "Heroes and Villains" sounds, one includes a neat little orchestra backing written by Brian. This little bit of music captures the essence of the song, a tribute to Americana.  24: George Harrison - "I'd Have You Any Time" The Lead Guitar in "I'd Have You Anytime" is classic George. Elegant and beautiful, each note is refined and sings the emotion of the song. The guitar seems to reach out invite you into its embrace just as much as the lyrics.  23: Gordon Lightfoot - "If You Could Read My Mind" "If You Read Between The Lines You'll Know That I'm Just Tryin To Understand..". When someone leaves you, its hard to understand the reasoning why. In a song that captures that feeling beautifully, this one line stands out because its not a simile like the others. In fact its telling the person who left him for the answer, because he himself does not know. Its a powerful statement one a lot of people can associate with at one point or another.  22: Ben Folds Five - "Philosophy" The Opening Piano to "Philosophy" is An absolutely beautiful piece of music! It has always suprised me that this song wasn't more popular and not played on the radio. Everytime I hear it I wish I could play this on the piano.  21: Jewel - "Varg Och Delfin" At around 1:31 Jewel hits a high note on "Varg Och Delfin" or "Swedish Lullaby" for those who can't remember the title. Jewel has a beautiful voice, but when she hits that long high note it sends chills down my spine. This is one of the most beautiful songs Jewel sings, if you've never heard it, give it a listen, you'll be impressed.  20: Fleetwood Mac - "Rhiannon" How can you NOT love that guitar riff at the beginning. The riff itself is simple, but its hypnotic and stays with you. Ask someone about the song and chances are they will remember the riff specificly.  19: Murray Head - "One Night In Bangkok" Half Instrumental, Half Pop Song, All 80's! The Song starts out like a soundtrack and then at 1:48 it all changes and becomes an interesting pop song! Its a unique mix of good orchestrated sound and what was modern at the time. Even if you hate the song, it suprised you the first time you heard the song thats for sure.  18: Dave Matthews Band - "The Stone" When you see a musician live and they switch from one song to another seamlessly its always a treat, but when they do it on a studio album, its even better. In this case the orchestra backing Dave Matthews on "The Stone" pulls a fast one on you, one you might not have even caught until now. At the end of the song around 6:12 the orchestra starts playing "Can't Help Falling In Love" the transition is so natural with the rest of the song, that even the astute of hearing don't usually pick it out.  17: Jarvis Church - "Run For Your Life" As I pointed out before, background vocals sometimes say things you miss. In this case, you can't miss what the background vocals are saying. In a song about crazed fans, what would help drill the point home better than a rousing chorus of: "Run For Your Live" "Cuts You With A Knife" "Lying On The Sidewalk" "Heart In Your Hand". You can't get any more direct than those lyrics!  16: Santo And Johnny - "Sleepwalk" Everyone has heard this song once in their life. Not everyone knows the title or who performs it. :) Its one thing to make your guitar sing, but to make a guitar cry like this song takes some skill. If you are feeling down, and hear this song, you will want to cry! It always makes me want to cry.  15: Cake - "Love You Madly" Sometimes I hear a percussionist that makes me wish I could drum. This song is a perfect case of just that. From the opening "ticka-swish" gentle cymbal ringing to the background "shuffle" sound this is a busy percusive song. Pay attention to the drum track sometime and hear it for yourself.  14: Johnny Cash - "Hurt" Its one thing for Johnny Cash to have done a cover of a Nine Inch Nails song, but to do it with so much emotion and that you feel regret and sorrow as you listen is worthy of praise. Now to be fair, I am cheating a bit, the song is a lot more power if you watch the video for it. Just as the piano starts around 2:28 the video becomes very powerful and will wear down on even the hardest of hearts.  13: Mazzy Star - "Fade Into You" The chord progression of this song, as simple as it may be, has a habit of popping in my head everytime I feel down. Combined with the fact this song has some of the most depressing lyrics ever written, this song is pure 100% depression. The interesting part, is that the song is the same chords over, and over, and over on the guitar. If I were to ever kill myself, it would be to this song. All kidding asside, I have an odd fascination with this song. While it is depressing, it is beautiful and gets stuck in my head quite often.  12: Bobby Horton - "Long Ago" I love Civil War music, this song has a pretty melody and the introduction is no exception. While the rest of the song is about the brotherhood formed between soldiers (as told by aged soldiers), the intro perfectly captures the essence of youthful innocense of these soldiers marching to war. While the song is about the Civil War, the message is timeless.  11: Eric Claption - "Layla" If there was EVER a favorite guitar lick in my mind its the opening riff of Layla. Its instantly recognizable, full of energy and a true classic. If you hear the riff, you'll want to scream out "Layla!", I know I do.  10: Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds - "Warehouse" (Live At Luther College) By now you should know I am a sucker for intros, this one takes the cake. Weighing in at 3:30 this intro starts simple and becomes a full blown symphony of music. Dave and Tim working together here paint a beautiful musical portrait. If you listen carefully, you can hear throughout the intro where Dave and Tim stay perfectly in sync with each other, complimenting the other. This is my all time favorite intro!  9: Fleetwood Mac - "Big Love" (Live) Off the Best of CD comes this live gem. Most importantly the solo is a testiment to the skill of Lindsay Buckingham. I am always a fan of complex picking, and this is some of the cleanest and fastest picking I've heard.  8: Dave Matthews - "Stay Or Leave" Dave is known for catchy riffs and bass runs, this song is no exception. However it has one thing going for it orchestration! 2/3rds of the way through the song the Orchestra kicks in and helps drive home the whole message of the song. As the song progresses it starts quiet and builds with more power and energy which feeds the emotional reflection of the song. This is a perfect case of a song being "completed" by an orchestra.  7: Led Zeppelin - "Bron-y-aur Stomp" Yes finally Zeppelin makes it on the list. ;) This song has one of the most creative rhythm guitar parts I've yet heard. However, this is VERY hard to hear in the song except towards the beginning. While a band today would simply used some power chords or a basic riff for the rhythm, Zeppelin goes one further by using one wicked little bass run in there.  6: Dave Matthews Band - "Halloween" Hearing a musician cuss sometimes isn't a big deal. However when you hear one cuss you usually avoids it, you KNOW he's pissed about something. However if you'd been in love and asked someone to marry you 5 times and get turned down like Dave was, you'd be resentful too. What better way to vent your anger than with a song! Around 3:02 Dave lets loose with the line "Tell us are you satisfied with fucking..." At this point his voice is a complete growl and that anger is very apparent. Something few artists can truely capture in their voice. I imagine Dave had a sore voice for a few days after he recorded this one. However, you can't get much angrier than this song!  5: The Beatles - "Dear Prudence" My idea of a perfect song is one that evolves as you listen to it, such is the case with Dear Prudence, it starts slowly, hypnoticly. However around 2:50 the song reaches a crecendo before coming to rest softly and gentle just as it started. It is during this time that you can count 6 different instruments if you've been paying attention, while the beatles couldn't have played all of them at the same time, the use of tracking here pays off beautifully and the sound generated is vibrant, exciting and alive.  4: The Beach Boys - "Surfer Girl" Everyone loves a love song, but no love song is as perfect as "Surfer Girl". If you pay attention to the lyrics its evident that Brian Wilson was a smart songwriter. Here we have honest words of admiration from one person to another. There is nothing tragic, no problems or anything stopping these two lovers. Brian paints a picture of perfection between a boy, a girl and their ocean. No where in the song does anything come between what he loves best, the ocean and his surfer girl. This song offers a view into the perfectness of true love, a view of what is important, that special someone and how much of a part of your world they are to you.  3: "Ashokan Farewell" Often associated with being a Civil War song, this song is actually ABOUT the Civil War and was written afterwards. In the right setting, this song will make even the strongest heart cry with its beauty and haunting sound. As far as waltzes go, this is the top of the top. Another case where the song evolves, starting alone and building a harmony of instruments this song reaches its peak with a full orchestra. But the most moving part of the song is the very when all other instruments cut out, leaving a single violin to carry on.  2: The Beatles - "The End" When your band is releasing its last studio album, how do you say goodbye? Well you give them something to remember! In this cause, the alternating guitar solos in "The End". Paul, George and John all take turns in that order playing solos each one showcasing their individual style from Paul's refined sound, to George's Elegance and John's raw upfront style. Each one of these solos is a beauty! but the last solo from George will send a shiver down your spine. All in all, the perfect way to say goodbye to your fans.   1: Dave Matthews And Tim Reynolds - "Typical Situation" (Live At Luther College) I know I know, What am I smoking? This song as number one? Over The Beatles, Zeppelin, Etc?? Well there is a good reason why! This song features what I consider to be the "perfect" guitar solo. Tim's handywork pays off as you listen to it, every note compliments the Dave's playing, and unlike most solos this isn't Tim's show off time, its his chance to shine melodicly with Dave. Around 5:25 Tim sounds to do the impossible, if you listen closely Tim has managed to himself and Dave to sound like 3 guitars! I absolutely LOVE this solo and when it comes on, I crank the volume on my stereo just to showcase it!  Now I don't expect you to agree with me here, but those are my favorites. Tell me what favorite song parts you have in the comments section, I'd love to hear them.

						   Well I am all moved, it took a couple days, and I am still sore. But now I am moved into Tony and Corey's house, its a nice place. Daniel is there as well, he and I are sharing a room at the moment. Although he seems to have vanished, he wasn't home all night lastnight and wasn't there in the morning.  Today at work we had an issue with Sprint and were "down" for about an hour. During this time I was unable to work on my current projects so I decided to not just sit and stare at the wall. I went back to a favorite pastime: Colorizing Photos. Yep sounds nerdy huh?  Its actually quite enjoyable, and its something Taylor got me hooked on doing. Essentially I take a black and white picture I find somewhere and add color to it as realisticly as possible.  Lets take a look shall we! Original Black and White:   I've had this picture on my computer for a while, someone was selling it on ebay so I stole their scan. I do this quite often and yes I know I am not "supposed" to, but it makes for good reference material. One day I will build a model of this little engine, its the only EMD Model 40 I've liked. This engine still exists at Traveltown in LA. It does not however, wear this paint job. NAS stands for Naval Air Station in case you were wondering.  Colorization:   The first step I always take is to start doing basic color work to fill the scene in. I use about a 5px diameter (feathered) brush in Photoshop set to "overlay" at 51% opacity (sometimes less). I begin painting color over the gray tones, this helps to keep the depth in the picture. One important note, when using overlay, if you brush something and brush it again, it WILL wash out the detail and make the color brighter. Another tip, use colors darker than your desired color. Since you are using transparent colors they will turn out lighter than what you selected in the color picker. Once you get the picture colored up, take a moment and look at it, neat huh?  Additional Depth:   While the color looks nice, it lacks one thing, dark shadows and vibrant color. On the whole, an image will look washed out when using overlays. I work around this problem by adjusting the color/hue or the brightness and contrast. In this case I selected everything but the sky and upped the brightness to +27, the contrast to +30. But what about the sky? I rendered a light on the picture. In this case I used an omni directional light moved way up above the top of the picture, this is what gives the picture that "bright sky" look.  Caveats: Now this picture isn't 100% correct colorwise, most of it is speculation on my part. The switcher I did not know the color for, I know the Navy did like to use blue on their engines (and cars) at one point. However they used a darker blue than I used. The freight cars are in "generic" colors, excepting the boxcar on the right, which I did in fact know the right color for (it is colored appropriatly). Other than these things, I am pleased with how the image came out, I could easily fool a lot of people with it on the first glance.  What do you think? This

						   Its amazing how fast time flies. I remembered today that some of my oldest friends I have are the ones I care about the most, and ones that care about me the same. In this case, my best female friends or my "Angels". We all have friends that have influenced our lives in some way, my "Angels" are the brightest example of influence in my life. I figured I'd take a little time today to talk about them, some of my friends may have never heard me talk about them. This doesn't mean they aren't important to me, in fact they are very much so.      Celeste   I've known Celeste for 7 years now. I met her back in the spring of 97 through a chatroom I used to visit frequently. Her and I talked for a while and then found out that we lived very close to each other. Early on we talked on the phone a lot and one day we decided to meet in person, I made the drive down to Citrus Heights to meet someone who would change my life forever. Celeste is not only the first person I ever met from the internet but is the first true friend I had ever had. While her and I never went out because we didn't want to hurt our friendship, we've always been close. In those days I was very depressed and trying to conform to what was "cool" by the definition up here. Because of this I was never really happy. Celeste taught me that I didn't need to fit in with everyone else, that I was fine the way I was. In her eyes it was everyone else that didn't accept me as the problem. She taught me how to be a good friend and to just be honest and to not let anything stand in the way of caring for those around you. I learned that depression was simply a hole I had dug myself into, and everytime I felt bad about myself, I dug myself deeper into the hole. Through her kindness and love I became far more caring to others around me and realised that seeing others happy, was deep down one of the things that makes me happy. Celeste has always been part of my family, and the rest of her family accepted me as a part of their family, I became such a part that I was there for Celestes graduation and I have spent every Christmas with them. Sometimes its the only thing I know I can count on in the world. Those of you that know me, know I wear a silver ring on my left hand. I've worn it for the past 6 years, inside the band is engraved the name "Celeste", to always remind me of our friendship.     Hope   If Celeste saved me from losing myself years ago, Hope brought out a part of me I had always tried to hide. Its no secret that I am a geek, but 6 years ago I did my best to hide it. Hope and I had similar interests and I met her through Celeste. What set her apart from everyone else I knew was her sarcastic wit, a trait I currently posses thanks to her. So if I become such a smartass that you want to slap me, you can thank Hope for that. Hope also helped bring the geekiness back out of me, she was one of the first people I really met who wasn't ashamed of being a geek. I learned not to hide the rest of who I am and to just be me, and that people who accept me for who I am, would be greater friends than those who wouldn't. Hope and I did go out for a few weeks but it didn't really work out. In the end things turned out better because of it. Hope has always stayed a close friend and while I lose track of her sometimes she always finds me sooner or later and we catch up. Sometimes I do miss "Hopie" very much, but I always know that she's around somewhere.     Missy   What can one say about someone that makes it a point to keep an eye on you? Missy and I met around 5 years ago through my friend Corey (now my roommate). Missy and I hit it off and went out for a short while, while that didn't work out, we stayed good friends. Missy and I have always had a supportive friendship to each other, if there is one person I know I can confide anything in, its Missy. Most of all, I know the advice she gives isn't going to be sweetened up, its going to be the honest, brutal truth. Though Missy lives in LA, I still see her when I can, and last year alone I made atleast 4 trips where I saw her. She's done everything from give me a place to stay, to riding around with me when I needed company. I talk to her on a nearly daily basis and give her advice just as she gives me. Most of all Missy has taught me how love someone and to be a friend and be supportive. If there is an example of a true friend in the world, Missy is that friend.     Katie   What can I say about Katie that I haven't said elsewhere? Its been almost 4 years since Katie and I met, yet it seems like only yesterday that she found me by accident. Katie has always being the shining star of what I've lacked in my life. She's been nothing but supportive and helped bring my love for railroads back to life. All of my devotion to railroads the past few years, the hard work at the museum and on websites, have been because of Katie, my muse. Katie and I have a bond with each other that others could never dream possible. Her and I watch over each other and guide the other through life. Katie is someone I know I can tell anything to, no matter what it is, just as she knows she can do the same with me. When one of us falls, the other gives a hand and dusts us off. Our friendship is based on love, trust and support. Sometimes we go a while without seeing each other, but we both know that we'd do anything or go anywhere for the other person.    Each of these 4 people has influenced my life in many ways. So much so that its hard for me to put into words what they've done, and just how much they mean to me. While its hard to write about what makes each of them special, we all know between us how we feel. From Celestes smile, Hopes laugh, Missy's hug and Katie's eyes our love and friendship is one that needs no words to explain between us. I know that out of anyone else in the world, these 4, my "Angels" will be part of my life no matter what, until the day I die.  I love them in every sense of the word.    But they already know that :)

						   I spent some time today scouring ebay for photos and paper for my collection.  I've found a few interesting items I may bid on before they end.  I'm not going to list what they are just incase anyone reading this might want to try and outbid me.  ;)    I started work on proper lettering for North Pacific Coast railroad passenger cars on the computer. I managed to find a font that is so close its frightening. With this I'll be able to help the decal project on one of the email groups I belong to. This of course means that a couple of the models in the contest at this years Narrow Gauge National Convention will carry my handy work. To top that off, I'll be attending the show!  My first ever trip to a National Convention like this. I am very very excited. I wish I had a model of my own to enter in the contest, but sadly nothing I've done lately is of that kind of quality.    In case anyone is wondering, the next page of Henry Yerington tales will be out in a couple days. I am dragging my feet I know ;)  You might even get 2 pages! HAH    Anyway I should get back to work...  I still haven't heard from Katie..  I wonder if she'll ever come back?  Seems like forever since I talked to her last, I miss her..

						   Its was a busy weekend, that much is for sure.  Friday night after work, Corey, Lori, Justin and I teamed up to do the first Task Force Mission in City of Heroes..  8 and a half hours later... hundreds of vile minions defeated, my exhausted body hauled off to bed and passed out.  Sometime around 2:30pm I woke up.. I sort of sat at my chair in a daze and couldnt figure out what to do.  After wasting the hours away watching Enterprise Reruns, Lori went to work.  Corey, Justin and I went to Fry's and to take Justin home.  I managed to pick up the Disney DVD I wanted with all of the WWII cartoons on it.  When I got home I watched that, finding my bed eventually.  Sunday I woke up around 3pm.. Tried to go see my mom  not home  Tried to see my Dad  not home  Went and saw Johnny for a bit then he had to leave.  Got bored and went to Keven's...  not home  So I sat there until he got home, we then wound up going to Katie's (Foresthill) to hang out with her, her boy-toy and her friend Christina.  After that we went down to Matticus' and watched some Invader Zim.. packed up our stuff and headed back to Auburn.. I think I got home around midnight. Certainly a long day!    There, now anyone that thinks I don't do anything can chew on that! HAH    Actually hanging out with a bunch of people was fun, and it took my mind off a few things that have been troubling me..  The dreams are still continuing and I don't know what to do about it..  I think I need to go for a drive and go to one of my quiet spots for a while. I know I can't go to either of my "homes" at this point. Maybe in a few weeks I can work out a trip.

						   Usually when I get stressed or angry at the world, I tend to forget the only thing that keeps me sane. I am someones hero. I always forget that I am looked to for advice and support, I forget that I am cared about. I forget that they would do the same for me as I do for them. I apologise for not being a hero these past few months, its been rough times. I forget sometimes just who I am, I remember who everyone else is, but I always forget myself.  On a lighter note..

						   Nothing much to say today.. The week is going alright. I felt pretty crappy lastnight but gradually got better before I went to sleep. I really didn't do much beyond sitting there with a massive headache. Today I've been doing the usual work, and during my lunch break I worked on the comic strip. As promised, here it is! The first comic strip in hopefully an on going series! I plan to write them page by page so what is going up today is the first page. My goal is to do about 8 pages per "Chapter". The first chapter is called "Introduction" for obvious reasons. ;)  So here it is! Enjoy!  Eventually I will have a page on the site allowing you to read through the story as it progresses, I just haven't felt like writing up the page yet.   urlLink Chapter 1 - Page 1

						   Its another day at work today.. I had to divert a little attention to the Foresthill Community TV website again and it reminded me of why I dislike my job so much.  My bosses have a knack for stupid ideas to make money. Lets take a look at the projects that promised to bring in MASSIVE DOLLARS! in the past 5 years I've been here.   Norcalsearch  Originally Norcalsearch was intended to be a search engine for Northern California. However as the idea grew it simply became more of a big online yellow pages of Northern California, offering the sale of ads and priority placement in the listings. The problem? Well nearly every online yellow/white pages out there already does this, and had done it since before I started here. Eventually the idea was bushed to the side, and finally lost in a server crash (no backup).   Yachtshare  Yachtshare is the project that wont die. The purpose is to create an online classifieds of sort to allow people to sell timeshares on their fancy yachts, in addition being able to buy/sell/trade yachts and other yacht gear. Its a pretty solid idea. The problem? This project is now 4 years old, and has been worked on by no less than 3 different programmers (myself included initially), in 3 different languages. After all this time, the site does absolutely nothing. Reason? Well the idea was sound, but the motiviation wasn't, my boss is obscessed with getting a yacht one day, so in theory getting this site to make money would give him the access to yacht deals, etc.. So to this day, its still an idea that gets brought up, and occasionally fooled with.   FnFMail  This was intended to be an online email filtering system which allowed only people you choose to be able to contact you. By locking access to all of these people, the idea was to give you a completely spam free email box. The problem? Any one that sent you a legit email, would get blocked unless they filled out an online form, which was then forwarded to you for your approval. The catch is, while it cuts down spam, it increases the rest of the time spent with email, filling out forms, etc.. In the end I figured most people would give up bothering to email anyone using the system.    Gns2000.com  The only money making idea thats come so far! This site is an online organizer for GlobalNet IBO's. Whats that? Well GlobalNet is an offshoot of Quixtar.. Whats Quixtar? Well Quixtar is "Amway" just with a different name now. This site has been my sole project for the past 4 years, and has not only kept me with a job, but kept the company a float. What does it do? Thats a good question, despite the fact that I wrote it, I can see NO logical reason WHY I would shell out $20 a month to use it. There are some neat things sure, but its marketed towards complete muppets. Believe me, the people that use the site, are so plain stupid I am suprised they can pick up the phone and call us. It pays the bills, so I don't complain much.    Spam Guardian  FnFmail came back! Sort of.. The idea behind FnFmail came back in an effort to get our internet service on par with that of other providers that offer spam filtering. The catch? Ours was to be better and more flexible and came in two versions. A standard which simply blocked keywords, and a "Plus" version which did nearly the exact same thing FnFmail was suppsed to do. Originally "Plus" was a pay service, but when a whopping 10 people signed up after nearly a year of the service being around, it was made free.   AEBolts  After the Gns2000 site was picked up my boss started to gain more interest in "Multi Level Marketing" *cough*Pyramid Schemes*cough*. At one point 2 of the GlobalNet "Diamonds" left and went to a new company. To assist these new diamonds, AEBolts was created. This site worked as a sort of contact book type of site which would allow you to send a message out to everyone on your list from anywhere, up to 1000 people! The problem? This site worked pretty much like a spam system, and we got many many complaints about it. Eventually it failed and the paying crowd dwindled, finally the server crashed and there was no good backup. All was lost and the site was abandoned.   Swap  The boss became interested in Barter systems, and decided "Hey we can start our own". The promise was to make an ebay like site for only barter. This is to be free for people to buy, but to sell and get registered you had to pay an annual fee. The problem? Its a barter system, I'm sorry but barter does not work on a national level very well. Ideally a national barter system gets rid of the whole idea of barter and simply becomes a new currency. This project is being "worked on" but I have a feeling it will die.   Netproductsales  Not happy with just the barter system, my boss has devised his own Multi Level Marketing system, in which you signup and have the ability to sell electronics on your own site! So basically, its Quixtar with more technical goodies rather than household products. The problem? This seems to be a bit more than this company can chew so to speak. He's talking about creating this site like it will be a piece of cake, nevermind that we have no source for these products and its really a pipe dream that will never get followed through.   Foresthill Community TV  Orignally this started out as simply a neat website for the local TV station. Somewhere along the lines its become a potential to make money. How? Well by selling the same site to other local TV stations giving them an outlet online. The problem? Content! Currently the site is nothing more than a HUGE flash animation showing the same powerpoint slideshow that the station runs, with a few downloadable clips. There is an advertising system that is being written to allow supporters and advertisers on the site to get banner adds around the site promoting their business. The problem? Its a community TV station, unlike a normal stations, these stations barely run anything that will interest the average person who watches TV. Personally I've recounted that the Auburn station 90% of the time is a Windows Desktop or a Blue Screen of Death with some corny music/talk radio playing. Thats quality TV there! Not to mention, a tv station run this poorly would have no way to afford a website that offers the same boring and pointless uninteresting information ONLINE.  One day, maybe just maybe, someone will come up with a good idea that makes money. Rather than the typical foolish online service that is pointless and has already been done.  I am sure I am fired now after this so I don't care anyway.  :D

						   I realised today that there are a lot of things I miss now.. Since I've moved and in the past year a lot has changed, I am not the same person I was a year ago.  These are some of the things I miss these days..  I miss hanging out at Jays and the fun we used to have there. Life seemed so much slower those days. I miss Zach and his weirdness, riding around just being crazy. I miss getting in the car and just going for a drive, didn't matter where, just driving. I miss working at the Auburn office, it made my work day seem shorter, and I felt more in touch with the rest of humanity.  I miss the ocean, and the mountains.. I miss camping and getting away from it all for a while. I miss my friends that have gone away.. Zach, Bonnie, Keslie, Jodie.. I even miss old Kristal and Pat.  I miss working at the museum, something I haven't been able to afford in a while, and I miss wandering around taking photographs afterwards.  I miss places no one would expect me to miss.. I miss LA.. I miss Missy and driving around with her. I miss San Diego.. I miss Katie and her family..  I miss Celeste and Hope and I hope they are alright.. I miss so much, and all of these things gone feel like a void in my heart.. I wish just for one day, things could be back the way they were 2 years ago, to relive those days of happiness, the smiles and the love I shared with my friends and those I care about. I wish for one day again, to hold those feelings in my heart and never let them go, to remember those days of purity and how it was all so "right".

						   Lately Corey, Lori and I have started playing "City Of Heroes". CoH is a massive online multiplayer game, where you create a superhero, powers, costume, etc.. and fight crime! The game is too darn addicting thats for sure.  So far I have one character: Henry Yerington Yep, only in my strange mind would I come up with that to use as a name. The best part is that I wrote his little origin which is creative and again, only something I could think up. So here we go! The origin of "Henry Yerington"   Henry Yerington was born as Darius Toben sometime during 1857 in Kansas City, Mo.  Growing up a simple life on the family farm he longed for adventure, in 1878 at the age of 21, he headed to the famed Comstock Lode to seek fame and fortune. There he landed a job working the tiny Silver Eagle mine  for a man named Thomas Harrison. Harrison, obsessed with precious metals often employed questionable methods  to make his mine more profitable, exposing Darius and other miners to hazardous conditions above and beyond  those common of the period. During an "experiment" Harrison modified an air drill to fire small amounts of  nitro-glycerine towards the hard rock in the mine. The experiment was a failure, and a distraught Harrison  claimed the men working the mine were at fault. An altercation began between Darus and Harrison, during the  scuffle Harrison struck Darius with a shovel, sending him backwards into the nitro-glycerine storage area.  The result was disastrous, and the resulting explosion wiped out not only the mine itself, but all of his  fellow miners. Thomas Harrison was believed to be the sole survivor.  However the exposure to nitro-glycerine to Darius' skin triggered a long dormant mutation, allowing him to  control pure energy. Freeing himself from the mine he sought revenge against Harrison, finally catching him  near the town of Dayton, NV. Darius spared no mercy on Harrison whom he knocked down a ventilation shaft  with his new found powers. Witnesses claimed Darius killed Harrison out of cold blood, and Darius became  a wanted man. Fearing death and confused by the nature of his new found powers he fled the area. Heading East,  he adopted many different guises to hide his past. Wandering from town to town lead him to experience the  honesty and compassion of many strangers, he adopted the name of a kind gentleman that had once helped him  in his days in the Comstock: "Henry Yerington". Under this name he has lead a lifelong crusade against  villainy in the name of the hard working folk.    Creative huh? ;)  In addition to playing the game, I have decided that I will make a weekly comic strip based on my characters exploits in game. I may or may not run with it for more than a few weeks. I am not sure how well accepted it will be. The best part, is that while I can write the stories, I can't draw the comic myself. Rather than have someone else do it, I felt what better way to capture the feel of the game than through screenshots.  Oh but thats cheesy! you say?  Not quite.. Simply using a screenshot would be cheesy, this is where I am going on step further. Using advanced photoshop techniques I am going to take those screenshots and convert them to comic art. The images will be something along the lines of what would be seen in a graphic novel.  Impossible you say?    urlLink Take a peek at this   Enjoy :) and keep an eye out for the first strip next week sometime.
