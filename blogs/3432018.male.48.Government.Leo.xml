      How much impact does blogs have on mainstream political reporting ? An interesting  urlLink comment  of Rachel Smolkin, an AJR ( urlLink American Journalism Review ) senior writer. I found the report through  urlLink this article of Political Animal . She notices the following political blogs :   "There are the rock stars of political blogging--Glenn H. Reynolds ( urlLink www.instapundit.com ), Andrew Sullivan ( urlLink www.andrewsullivan.com ), Joshua Micah Marshall ( urlLink www.talkingpointsmemo.com ) and Mickey Kaus ( urlLink www.kausfiles.com )--moody maestros who stroke their keyboards more quietly but no less fervently than Coldplay's Chris Martin."   There are more links to be found there so  urlLink read the report .

       urlLink This article translation  is a  must read  really. How comes that Arabs in general again and again indulge themselves in sheer illusion ? They certainly deserve better ! There is still a lot of work to do for Arab media but I fear that this article won't be found in the "respectable" Arab newspapers. Freedom of expression hmmmm...

       urlLink Iran's Revolutionary Guards Official Threatens Suicide Operations  : some excerpts...  [...]  "Tehran's secret strategy aimed at taking over the Arab and Muslim countries by means of helping revolutionary forces and organizations"      "Haven't the Jews and the Christians achieved their progress by means of toughness and repression? We have a strategy drawn up for the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization and for the uprooting of the Americans and the English."       "The global infidel front is a front against Allah and the Muslims, and we must make use of everything we have at hand to strike at this front, by means of our suicide operations or by means of our missiles. There are 29 sensitive sites in the U.S. and in the West. We have already spied on these sites and we know how we are going to attack them."     I wonder if this article is true... have to check if the  urlLink MEMRI-site  has good credentials. Anyone with an opinion on MEMRI ?  Update May 31 : I had my doubts about MEMRI and I'm not the only one. Read this article :  urlLink Brian Whitaker investigates whether the 'independent' media institute that translates the Arabic newspapers is quite what it seems

      You stumbled already on a lot of blogs in which people compared the Iraq  débacle  to the Vietnam quagmire ? Well, the Strategic Studies Institute published a  urlLink report  written by  urlLink Dr. Jeffrey Record  and  urlLink W. Andrew Terrill .  The report concludes rightly that the differences between the two conflicts greatly outnumber the similarities, especially in the strategic and military dimensions of the two wars, but that some similarities are noticeable in two aspects of the political dimensions of it: attempts at state-building in an alien culture, and sustaining domestic political support in a protracted war against an irregular enemy.  Lessons learned... or not ?  Hey,  urlLink even Tom Clancy remarks that "good men make mistakes"  ;-)

       urlLink Political Animal  gave some really good comments on the main question in Iraq :  "  Was the very idea of bringing democracy to Iraq ill-conceived, or did the problem lie in our implementation ?  "   Being a military officer I found quite some instances where the concept of "Security" was almost exclusively narrowed to the notion of "Military Security"... You know : "we ought to have more troops there than we'll have security". That's the first and typical flaw. But even if you take into account all aspects of security, the problem still remains that security as a  conditio sine qua non  for democratization in Iraq might be a compulsive precondition but not necessarily sufficient. Okay, I know, we already over-simplifly the problem statement (as if the Bush administration's motive was the democratization of Iraq ;-)  I do advise to read the article, ponder about his conclusion as quoted hereunder and perhaps add your 2 cents to the panoply of comments already there :     "Well, it means that democratization via military occupation is impossible in Iraq. I'd like to be talked out of this gloomy view, but it's going to take some mighty good arguments. Any takers ?"

      Whether you are an  urlLink American soldier  or  urlLink three Iraqi brothers  you can have your own blog to comment on developments in Baghdad  while being in Baghdad . Or you could be a  urlLink sweet woman  or  urlLink a dentist  hey you could be anyone : it all adds up... "First person only" blogs (or "second closest" blogs - see the comment of Tim) are great ! Perhaps not the most objective but certainly the most penetrating.

      It definitely is. I'm casually perusing heaps of bloglinks today and i'm  flabbergasted  !  Some ten years ago when i started to discover the internet it was already clear that journalism on the net was something to look forward to, but who could have predicted that virtually anyone would have the possibility to start publishing his thoughts in such a slick and smooth manner.   urlLink Professional journalists  have come a long way since then, even my favorite local Flemish newspaper  urlLink De Standaard  (in Dutch) couldn't resist the temptation of having his own blog.  There is a a vast panoply of blogs to find though, so i wonder how to find the jewels hmmmm.... I found  urlLink Blog Search Engine  quite neat at first sight, particularly because of the categories it offers, but i must admit that the categories at  urlLink Blogarama  are more abundant. Also Intelliseek's  urlLink BlogPulse  seems interesting but i have to try it out a bit more to be sure : anyone who used it already substantially ? this portal-like "automated trend discovery system" sounds sexy though...  One thing is sure : i took the right blog-environment here at Blogger :-) It definitely  IS  smooth and slick. And if you don't believe me I can assure you that  urlLink I'm not the only one who finds Blogger quite neat .

      Although I'm very much interested in political developments in the Arab world I must admit that my knowledge of the Arab language is largely insufficient. Needless to say, i was very much delighted with  urlLink Aljazeera.Net in English  for that matter. Not that i don't trust western media of course.... but, you know, perceptions differ to say the least...  Why this interest in the Arab world you might ponder ? I'm an officer in the  urlLink Belgian Army  and, as such, in the beginning of the 90s, had the opportunity of being a military observer for  urlLink UNTSO  (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) in the Middle East. In short : i'll never forget the smell of Gaza. And this was the time when the  urlLink Oslo Agreement  still gave some hope... things must be far worse now compared to some ten years ago.  Still, after a decade being back in my homecountry, I still feel very close to the Middle East. And that's why i started this blog. I'm not sure how it'll evolve... let's see.... insh'allah...

       urlLink DEBKA  came up with an  urlLink interesting analysis  :    " there was more than meets the eye about the instant handover of the deposed president to his newly-sovereign successor and the foot-dragging on his trial. What Allawi did not tell the media is that he aims to keep Saddam and his circle under tight control and on tenterhooks, as hostages of the new regime. "

             Saddam Hussein and 11 others (among them Tariq Aziz and Ali Hassan Majeed "Chemical Ali") will stay in physical custody of American troops though.   Arraignments are on Thursday so that will be interesting to monitor I think. Up till now I couldn't find who the other 9 are (I don't think Comical Ali will have the possibility to steal the show up there - lol !)

      Remarks by PM Blair on transfer of Iraqi Sovereignty, Hilton Istanbul, Turkey :   And that's why it's important to see this as a whole picture.  The fact is, if Iraq becomes a stable and democratic country -- and I'm not underestimating for a single instant the difficulties in doing that, incidentally -- but if it does, that is a huge blow to the propaganda and to the effort of the extremists.  That's, in fact, why sometimes I think they have a clearer idea of how important it is to stop us, than sometimes the Western world has of why it's so important that we get there with Iraq and with the Iraqi people.  And so the Greater Middle East Initiative and the idea of spreading democracy there, resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue on the basis of two states, both democratic states -- because what we want for the Palestinians is not just their own state, we want a democratic state for them, where they have proper freedoms, as well.  So I think that you can see this as part of an evolving strategy, where we realize we've got to be prepared to take tough security measures and tough action where necessary, but we know that that is not all that it's about. It's also about trying to show that there is a value system there that isn't related to any religion or one religion, one civilization. It's about these basic values of humanity, that wherever they're implemented and tried, you get greater security.  Because, basically, democracies -- well, they have to fight sometimes when they have to defend themselves, but they don't have the same aggressive intent that these unstable or extreme or fanatical regimes do.    There are thin lines between vision, dream and propaganda... Strong convictions can overwhelm and scare... Well, I said I won't comment on this... have to go to work anyway.

      Why didn't I come up with this one : in a surprise move sovereignty was handed over to the Iraqi government ( urlLink see report ). That's one way to avoid the foreseeable attacks at the former official handover date and... it gives  schwung  to Bush in Istanbul. Official handover... hmmm...  urlLink does this really change the real power balance  ?   Read some comments :  urlLink Roger L. Simon  |  urlLink Michel Rubin  |  urlLink Robert Alt  |  urlLink BBC News     urlLink Comments may heat up  y'know... Do we really  urlLink have to take this serious  ?

                      .....     As if the situation wasn't already precarious :  urlLink About 100 Die in Rebel Attacks in Five Iraq Cities . And seemingly the number of casualties is still rising as I'm writing this. Additionally, the  urlLink Iraqi prime minister becomes a target  too...  It's quite clear that terrorist groups intend to beef up their attacks in order to mess up the official handover. The longer American troops have to stay because of the security situation the more anti-Americanism can be instilled within the Iraqi people. And I don't see Iraqi security forces tackling the problem efficiently in the foreseeable future.  One of my teachers in earlier days always said : "Well, boy, if you wanna start something you better know beforehand how to end it too..."

       urlLink BBC News  : The basic Hotmail account will  urlLink reportedly  be beefed up to 250 mB [grin]  Oh, by the way, barely having my Gmail-account myself thanks to  Mike  ( urlLink see my earlier post ), I already have the honour of granting Gmail-invitations myself. Supposedly every 3 to 4 mB of usage grants you 6 invitations I've the impression.  So if you are still looking for one and you have a blog... just email me with a link to your blog and the email address to send the invitation (you find my email address through my profile-link at the upper right of the page). Vanity isn't completely strange to me so I wouldn't mind being mentioned at your blog once you got an invitation ;-)

       urlLink BBC News  reports that   " urlLink many people in Britain think the Palestinians are occupying Israeli territory and not the other way round "  !       Ordinary people lacking the background because of the media's virulent BNS (Breaking News Syndrome)... It's commonplace to put the blame on the media, but let's face it : where do you find decent background information on any lingering conflict in the world ? It take's quite some effort to find quality in-depth information properly nowadays and, seemingly, more and more people are not up to it anymore. News volatility and oneliners rule... I thought it clear that it was Israel occupying some territories... for security reasons and I may somewhat concur with it from a strictly military point of view being a military officer, but politically it's a tremendous pitfall - that's what I learned the hard way. Okay, I know it's only my 2  euro cents but look at  urlLink this note from marcland , hmmm.... to put it diplomatically : stretching the meaning of the article ? Hey, just see the bright side of it : blogging is all about opinions isn't it ?  Try to have a nice day, though...         ...

       urlLink Khaleej Times  reports :  urlLink Hamas scrambles for role in running post-Israel Gaza Strip .  Seemingly Hamas is not only lobbying for posts in the Palestinian security forces but also in the education and health ministries. So putting Hamas into the bath might smoothen the sharp edges, right ? A decent Hamas with government responsibilities...  I don't believe it. Even if they would get some posts within the Palestinian Authority, no way they gonna stop their attacks outside the Gaza Strip anyway. It would mean that the Palestinian Authority as a whole would be fully criminalized then...   Hamas suffered a lot of casualties recently so they are just bargaining somewhat in my opinion. Save face indeed...  Meanwhile, in  urlLink this report  from  urlLink Israel Insider  Shimon Peres laid out conditions for joining Sharon's government.  Time to chill ;-)

Just wait till Harry Potter comes on the scene (and I don't mean the European Union for that matter : we are too busy to ruminate on our EU poll results -  urlLink could it be China  ?). Am I mixing up history here or is history being made ?    No serious... Compare this stuff with  urlLink DEBKA's  article " urlLink Arafat Turns to Damascus to Get Egypt out of His Hair " I wrote about in an  urlLink earlier post ...  Any bets on Egypt vs. Syria ???

      What a promising blogosphere it is...   I was barely dreaming about  urlLink Gmail  (see my yesterday's post) and then, during my morning ritual of reading email and having coffee, I splattered most of my coffee all over my keyboard (quite sticky with sugar) :   a new bloggermate sent me a Gmail invitation   :-))))   Now that's what I call international solidarity indeed.... You wanna know how I got it ?  Can you imagine ? I'm barely introduced in Blogger Universe while looking around for blogs that interest me.   Very quickly I notice that trackbacking is a neat way of getting known bit by bit (that's why I added  urlLink HaloScan  here) and so I stumble upon a guy with an interesting blog :  urlLink Mike Rodriquez's Online Journal (All the Pages are My Days) . Having read Mike's post " urlLink Sometimes I Wonder " I trackback on it. He notices my excerpt, looks at my blog, and reads about my Gdream - lol !!!   So this bloggerdude sent his invitation with the note :   please consider this an international gesture of good will ... as we say, love our country, hate our president. :-)  thanks for the trackback ping on the germany in the 30s. I agree, it's not that bad, and we can help ensure it doesn't get that way by raising questions and being aware.  take care,  mike    THANK YOU MIKE !!! And be on guard for extreme right...

      Rumours, facts, threats, anger, love, hate, awe, devotion, worship... jee it's as if  urlLink Gmail  triggers the best and the worst of humankind's emotions (just  urlLink look at all those feelings right now  at Technorati - i'm sure, even if you've found my link at a far later stage then when I was posting this, that the discussion is still up and running).  Okay, I must admit that I'm on one of those swap-lists too... I'm just too curious notwithstanding the critics and the fact that  urlLink Yahoo started the battle  too. Some bloggers who very recently moved to Gmail already regretted it because of the Yahoo counter-attack... I wonder what will come out of this battle, but one thing is sure : I don't think that Gmail can afford lingering on far longer with the competition breathing in their necks. PS. This was just a thought of mine so I might get that invitation through my Blogger login in the long run. Dreams aren't forbidden until further notice - lol !

      Low turnouts and big gains for opposition parties  urlLink spread dismay  among senior European politicians.

Okay, my country  urlLink Belgium had the highest turnout  (90%) but voting here is compulsory so... And the 12th consecutive progress of extreme-right ( urlLink Vlaams Blok ) in our elections is particularly worrisome... again ! Another sign of the ever-growing anti-politic feelings among Flemings.

      Today it's the  urlLink final day of EU parliament vote .   In Belgium we also have regional elections at the same time, so as a Fleming (Dutch speaking) in Brussels (large majority French speaking) i had to make my point at the ballot in order to secure my position as a member of perhaps the most institutionally subsidized minority in the world - lol !   I won't elaborate on the complexity of our institutions (you might enter  urlLink here  AYOR if you have the guts, but I advize you to read it in Dutch or French because the English translation is awkwardly insufficient, if ever). Complex as Belgian institutions are, just to comfort you I'll whisper you a secret : Belgians don't know themselves how this little country is organized but, astonishingly, it works... and that's what count isn't it ;-)  This morning I was already awake pretty early, which is exquisitely rare in the annals of this humble writer who cannot possibly categorize himself being the perfect morning guy. I suppose it was my enthusiasm for election day that made my biological clock wake me up at such an inhumanely early hour.   And there I went at starting hour to the ballot : bureau 75 in the "Pedagogisch Centrum Vlaesendael" in Neder-over-Heembeek, which is part of Brussels. I regretted my early start the moment I went into the building. Some PC problem started the, yes,  electronical   (wow ! progress they call it) voting day with some delays already : one might instantly vote extreme for lesser frustrations pfff...  Anyway, at last, I made my point (I mean my minority voting point) and yes I'm rather  urlLink liberal  (link in  dutch  only) if that's what you wanted to know...  And the results will be ? ...  insh'allah

       urlLink Steve Outing  wonders in  urlLink The Blog-only News Diet  if one might quit reading the mainstream news media in favour of perusing blogs to grasp current events. He also makes a round-up of the best blog sources.  I found this through  urlLink InstaPundit .  Presumably the mainstream media won't go away that easily.   In my experience to get a real overview of current affairs you still have to look up a few newspapers. But blog reading is a fine way to find refreshing opinions, whether based on objective argumentation or sheer frustration. It makes your personal newsgathering all the more colourful and exciting.  And those first-person blogs makes you able to "sniff the local smell" far better don't you agree ?

      So I wonder if  urlLink Sharon's planned pull-out of Gaza  will hold in the long run :  schwaye schwaye min fadlak  because the Israeli government voted  in principle  to dismantle all Gaza settlements and four West Bank settlements, but its implementation will be postponed until next year. Okay, the four-stages plan is slated to be completed by the end of 2005 but each stage needs the Israeli Cabinet's approval. Sharon's original plan reportedly was to be implemented in one stage so these 4 phases seem to have been the negotiated bottom-line in order to get the plan voted. The opposition  urlLink Labour party withdrew a parliamentary no-confidence motion scheduled for today , but Sharon's position is still very weak. Now wait for Mubarak's move as  urlLink Arafat accepted the Egyptian security proposals . Concurrently, the  urlLink largest-ever conference on aid for Palestinian refugees has opened in Geneva . At last it's moving again... See also some  urlLink juicy DEBKA-information  on Egyptian moves (is this stuff propaganda or not ?)

       urlLink Rumsfeld urges Asians to join war on terror , seemingly because "some Europeans countries" don't follow blindly ? Rumsfeld even compared those critical European countries to the Chamberlain attitude vis-à-vis Hitler. So I suppose that's what he calls "the old Europe" : thank you Mr. Rumsfeld, why would you need enemies with such an ally... Needless to say,  urlLink he also emphasized the growing danger of terror in Asian countries too . Of course, one might be vigilant without being scared blindly (and reacting conformingly) but I suppose such countries would be part of "the old Asia" - lol !

       urlLink The New Yorker  came up with an interesting article :  urlLink Were the Madrid bombings part of a new, far-reaching jihad being plotted on the Internet  ?    "The day of the bombings, analysts at the Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt, a Norwegian think tank near Oslo, retrieved a document that they had noticed on an Islamist Web site the previous December. At the time, the document had not made a big impression, but now, in light of the events in Madrid, it read like a terrorist road map. Titled &#8220;Jihadi Iraq: Hopes and Dangers,&#8221; it had been prepared by a previously unknown entity called the Media Committee for the Victory of the Iraqi People (Mujahideen Services Center)."    "The Internet document suggested that a new intelligence was at work, a rationality not seen in Al Qaeda documents before. The Mujahideen Services Center, whatever that was, appeared to operate as a kind of Islamist think tank. &#8220;The person who put together those chapters had a clear strategic vision, realistic and well thought out,&#8221; Amirah says. He told Hegghammer, &#8220;This is political science applied to jihad.&#8221;    "al-Qaeda has four different networks..."    ..."This question is central to the debate about whether Muslims in Europe can integrate into their new communities or must stand apart from them. If France can be considered part of dar al-Islam, then Muslims can form alliances and participate in politics, they should have the right to institute Islamic law, and they can send their children to French schools. If it is a part of dar al-Kufr, then strict Muslims must not only keep their distance; they must fight against their adopted country."    "The Internet is the key issue... It erases the frontiers between the  dar al-Islam  and the  dar al-Kufr . It allows the propagation of a universal norm, with an Internet Sharia and fatwa system."    I still have to ruminate properly on the article but it seems quite interesting and detailed indeed...   [Listening to: Musica Arabe - Chaabi Pop Du Maroc Rass -  urlLink Musica Arabe  -  (03:37)]

      Kafka would jump out of his tomb this instance when reading various misleading comments  made upon the UN General Assembly's Resolution concerning Israel's so-called "security barrier".  urlLink So here are the facts  :   The resolution was adopted by a recorded vote of  150 in favour to 6 against,  with 10 abstentions, as follows :     In favour   :  Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Thailand, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United Republic of Tanzania, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

       urlLink al-Ahram  reports :  urlLink Islamophobia and racism are alive and kicking in France  (a round-up of recent events and some statistics)  The problem is that sometimes  urlLink reports are just a hoax,  or beefed up by the myth of victimization, especially when it is reinforced by ideology ( urlLink see also AntiWar report ). Pity to say that even  urlLink Time  doesn't have the decency to stop  urlLink moralizing  on it (they bluntly state that France "today is a place where such acts of anti-Semitism and racism are commonplace".    Commonplace ???    Time has a very bad taste of jokes indeed... Perhaps Time ought to be much more concerned about Sharon's aggressiveness towards the so-called "uprise of anti-semitism" in France (calling for all Jews in France to make  aliya   immediately ) !  Of course the mythomania around anti-semitism in France was just a perfect timing for Sharon as he already planned to muster more support for aliya from French Jews anyway ( urlLink 20.000 were slated based on a report in March of this year ). Neat coincidence indeed... So I suppose the new Zionism doesn't want to attract Jews to make  aliya  based on economical distress nowadays, but rather from France's riches based on biased ideological choice. I'm quite sure the Jewish community in France will respond with ample maturity, worthy of being the representatives of a great Jewish Nation (which I can't particularly say from Israel as it is run today... in fact, the way Sharon behaves is a disgrace for the Jewish Nation)    [Listening to: Arabic-Iam Taxi-Dini[Assia] -  urlLink Assia  -  (05:06)]

      Thanks to  urlLink Rob  who  urlLink granted me a Gmail account , being a real supporter of  urlLink Google , and already using  urlLink Hello , I was initiallly enthusiastic about the Google's take-over of  urlLink Picasa  too of course.  The Hello-stuff was better than nothing to upload some pics at my blog although I'm a bit desillusioned about the "take-it-or-leave-it" possibilities of it : some strange code is created on your blogpost and I can't figure out how to tamper it the html-compliant way for layout-reasons (the pics are just posted with your text above or underneath it but the vspace and hspace stuff doesn't work to wrap the text around your pics. A bit disappointed about it I must admit. Additionally, my  urlLink Bloglines  feed doesn't seem to recognize the pics either - very nasty !  So now I added the free Picasa with it. Not really THAT fancy but it organizes yours pics on your hard disk quite well, in such a way that it gave me some hints to re-organize all my picture folders.  Some hints for the Google-dudes there : make Hello a bit more html-compliant so we can make better layouts around uploaded pics, integrated it with Picasa and - of course - integrate it with my Gmail account so I can have an overview of archived pictures at my Gmail... probably I'm re-inventing hot water here coz I'm sure the Google-dudes already put that in their "business plan" already ;-)

Arafat's  urlLink sacking of two senior security commanders  didn't help at all ( urlLink UK Independent ) : designating one of your cousins to replace a senior security commander doesn't particularly counter accusations of widespread corruption.   Anyway, his cousin Musa Arafat effectively  urlLink took command  of the Palestinian security forces at a ceremony in Gaza City ( urlLink BBC ) ignoring all the protests because "I take my orders from His Excellency President Arafat," he said.

The Gaza turmoil also  urlLink worries the Israeli press , fearing that the current developments will be blamed on Israel ( urlLink BBC ).    Arafat is indeed at a crossroad now : either he takes reforms seriously or the general Palestiinian opinion might turn against him. The main question is : who can replace Arafat ? Nobody can, I fear, so there might be anarchy looming in the occupied territories....    [Listening to: Dalida-Egiptian song.

       urlLink Radio Netherlands Wereldomroep  reports that four of the Netherlands' 12 provinces face a serious threat of possible terrorist attacks. The country's Interior Affairs Minister Johan Remkes said on Thursday that the heightened alert and related security measures announced last week are to remain in full effect for the time being. His statement contained the first detailed remarks from the Dutch government about the heightened terror alert which has been in place since Friday last week. Furthermore, the Netherlands is the only country in Western Europe where a heightened warning for terrorist attacks has been issued ( urlLink see article ).  Reportedly, the Bin Laden deadline towards Europe has influenced the decision to raise the state of alert in certain parts of the Netherlands. Tourists will certainly notice beefing up security measures at the country's main civilian air hub, Amsterdam Schiphol airport.

The report,  Cultural Liberty in Today's Diverse World , was launched in public ceremonies here today with Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and Administrator of the United Nationas Development Programme (UNDP) Mark Mallow Brown. Belgium, where the Flemish and Walloon populations have long struggled to forge a working compact, is cited by the report as an example offering valuable lessons for other multicultural states.  Almost every major democracy that is ethnically or linguistically diverse practices some form of asymmetric federalism : Belgium, Spain and the Swiss Federation are prominent examples. The success of federal arrangements depends on careful design and the political will to enhance the system's democratic functioning. What matters is whether the arrangements accommodate important differences, yet buttress national loyalties.     The top 10 this year are Norway, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Netherlands,   Belgium  , Iceland, United States, Japan and Ireland.

      In a stunning report leaked to  urlLink openDemocracy , a consultancy firm has advised al-Qaida that  Osama bin Laden should allow himself to be captured by the US .  Asked by al-Qaida's senior management to carry out an independent analysis of their campaign, consultants at SWISH (South Waziristan Institute of Strategic hermeneutics) claim that an 'incompetent' Bush administration actually benefits al-Qaida, and recommend that al-Qaida consider short-term tactics designed to aid the Bush campaign. They suggest that "although the martyrdom factor should not be underestimated," the detention or capture of Osama bin Laden could help greatly, "especially if this could be arranged within a month or so of the US election."   Other findings from this report include:    the key factors that have aided al-Qaida's recent progress    details of the poor decisions by the US that have inadvertently benefited al-Qaida's cause   five actions that, if carried out by the west, would present 'a serious threat to the integrity and viability of the al-Qaida strategy'    The report concludes: "the future looks bright. Any actions that you can take to ensure that your opponents continue with their current policies will be to your advantage"    urlLink  Read the full report here     UPDATE Jul 15 : Relax... just settle yourself in your most favorite chair with your favorite pet on your lap (might be your wife of course) and enjoy this  urlLink very romantic roundup  !

Well,  urlLink reasononline  came up with some additional information :    " urlLink a number of Al-Jazeera employees are seriously considering joining the new BBC Arabic-language television station "    But on the other hand :  urlLink I saw good old al-Jazeera back today  so I wonder what is really happening...

      Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research ( urlLink PSR ) came up with some  urlLink poll results  on Palestinian public opinion that might be interesting.    The most watched television channel : al-Jazeera   Fateh might still win local elections but it's very close !   Differring views at how serious the Palestinian Authority is about holding elections   A whopping 75% supports introducing women quota between 25-30%   Yasser Arafat would still have an absolute majority voting for him for presidency   Absolutely "NO" to Sharon's disengagement plan  ... and a lot more !  urlLink just have a look

      Robert Fisk  urlLink reports  that US military officers censored the media coverage of Saddam's hearings last Thursday. And rather blatantly you might say after reading the article...   Just handover that guy effectively into REAL Iraqi custody so he can be done with quickly but pleaaaaaaaaase don't start-up this kind of stalinistic make-believe. The Iraqi people won't believe it and we, westerners, won't either - I hope. Or am I talking like an "old European" again ?  Pssssss... I just hope all those  urlLink nasty Fisk-haters  won't find my blogpost here because a few of them seem to be in a raging cut-throat mood !

      Thanks to  urlLink Dean's World  I found a  urlLink very disturbing Washington Post article  that exactly corroborates my sentiments about the Arab press in general during the last weeks.          I had this awkward feeling already for weeks myself : a large part of the Arab media doesn't particularly condemn the horrible beheadings we have been seen recently and, slowly but definitely, starts to condone the political statements that are supposed to be related to the al Qaeda network. It confirms my eerie feeling, while chatting with some Arab friends in the Middle East, that even moderate Arab intellectuals tend to silently approve of this development. It is one thing to agree to some or more extent with the political arguments of terrorists but it is a scary leap forwards to start approving the violent means of a terrorist network to make its point.  Or to say it with the words of  urlLink Betsy  :  urlLink It is so depressing to read about what the Arab media says or doesn't say about the brutality of terrorists' beheading prisoners and other acts of terrorism .  It also struck me the same way that even  urlLink al-Jazeera , being the generally-aknowledged litmus test of a free independent Arab press, is sliding away into this slippery path too (see the link here in this post to a very good book on al-Jazeera).

      NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer predicted a gloomy picture on the future of Iraq and Iran if the US and the international community didn't come up with a common agenda ( urlLink read the report ). An article which is very much to the point indeed, stating exactly the state of mind in Europe today towards the US. But probably this will be considered again as an "old Europe" whining, pfff...

      The Guardian  urlLink reports  :    American commanders will risk launching high-profile military actions at targets in Iraq even if they go directly against the wishes of the new Iraqi government, a senior US general said yesterday.    I suppose that's the practical consequence of getting full Iraqi sovereignty just a couple of days ago... Sooooooorry if I sound too cynical. No further comment needed for most people with a brain I suppose.   As if the Iraqi didn't know themselves :  urlLink  of course they do   !

       urlLink Rob  made a HaloScan-comment in an  urlLink earlier post  and wondered why I could somewhat understand Israeli occupation in a strictly-military point of view although politically it's a bottomless pitfall. So here comes my 2  euro cents...  The building of outposts and, as such, the expansion of Israeli settlements within the occupied territories serves at first the dream of Eretz Israel (Greater Israel) which is part of religious thinking within parts of the Israeli community. I won't elaborate on the religious motivations but suffice to say that a large part of Israeli settlers are triggered by this motivation and, subsequently, create facts on the grounds by occupying land, say, for biblical reasons.  In general there isn't the political will to stop these settler's initiatives and therefore the Israeli army finds itself in a situation to defend these outposts which most of the time evolve into larger settlements. It takes military resources to defend the perimeter of those outposts AND the lines of communication towards the heartland (also called the settler's roads). So, in this story, military deployment started at the tactical level simply to defend the settlers and their roads towards the mainland.  Most Israeli governments additionally motivated Israeli's to settle in the territories mainly through financial incentives. So basically an Israeli settler is religiously and/or financially motivated to go there. Why did various Israeli governments came up with financial incentives ? Well, of course partly for religious endeavours but also for military-strategical reasons : settlements give some territorial depth to the defense perimeter of the mainland - on the condition of course that there is territorial continuity between the settlements. Don't forget that historical Palestine is territorially VERY small so depth is crucial (Hey ! I can tell because I'm living in a country myself that barely reaches the dimensions of a handkerchief :-)  Additionally, settlements might be political trumpcards : they can be part of the bargaining chip during negotiations - y'know, keep 2 and give up 2 as a 'gesture'. Religiously-motivated settlers of course won't agree of giving up, but financially-motivated ones might... if the price is right (f.i. the 300.000 USD per family offered at settlers in Gaza to move out voluntarily).            Territorial depth at the perimeter of your mainland buys you time in case the shit hits the fan, certainly if your forces are somewhat thin and you opt to maneuver on internal lines through keeping the larger reserve units at the center, which through necessity was the option the Israeli army had to take in their wars with the Arabs (my favorite book is on the left here).  The problem in the Israeli case is that you don't buy time at all because those bufferzones are to be defended themselves. These settlements certainly trigger enmity among local Palestinians and heat up things considerably. Settlers alone can't defend themselves properly against attacks rising, so more military forces are needed just to defend the settlement's perimeter. Subsequently most of the time you won't find any larger reserve unit anymore at your center because most of your troops are thinly spread along the perimeters of your bufferzones. There goes your neat solution of maneuvering on internal lines of course... How to get back a larger reserve unit at the center ?  By having less troops needed at the settlement's perimeters.  How can you do that ? Through building walls to stop infiltrations at your perimeter of course... Again a military solution... But what happens with the Palestinian mind ? They become even more upset so attacks rise even more.... And... And... And...  Rob, the truth is that historical Palestine is so small and both Israeli and Palestinian communities are territorially so much intertwined nowadays that it would be utterly insane to try to separate both.   I had the great honour to talk privately once with Yitzhak Rabin just before the Oslo Agreement went public in which at a certain point pondering about "green lines", "demarcations" and the-like, he sighted :  "We [Israeli's and Palestinians] simply cannot separate anymore"   Exactly, they are doomed to live together... or continue to suffer. But who am I...

      Algerian authorities have provisionally frozen the activities of al-Jazeera without giving explanation :  urlLink see report .   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika didn't like a recent debate at al-Jazeera at which his national reconciliation programme was questioned... Really shameful considering the large Algerian audience that favors al-Jazeera... Just hope it'll be a temporary ban though.  It's a long and arduous path towards democracy...

       urlLink Haaretz  reports that the US Administration is checking the possibility of pumping oil from the Iraq's Kirkurk area to Mosul and then to a Haifa oil terminal, via Jordan. The Americans requested a cost estimate of  urlLink repairing the old Mosul-Haifa pipeline , inactive since the end of the British mandate in Palestine in 1948.   I presume this idea wanted to avoid the old Syrian track on the Golan via a bypass through Jordan... Of course, if you consider the US government's growing anti-Syrian stance, one might foresee some additional "pressure" (jee, what an understatement) on Syria, in order to keep the old Golan pipeline track option open.   Israeli Minister for National Infrastructures, Joseph Paritzky, stated that the pipeline would cut Israel's energy bill drastically - probably by more than 25 per cent - since the country is currently largely dependent on expensive imports from Russia. This pipeline would have the added advantage of giving the US reliable access to Gulf oil other than from Saudi Arabia.   That will make a lot of people happy, particularly in the Arab world. Especially Turkey will love it because it will lose it's current transit fees for relaying Iraqi oil. Of course Jordan will be soooooo happy being in an impossible position in the Arab world, but the poor country would be quite enticed by receiving the transit fees.   As  urlLink Daily Kos  remarked :   urlLink why does this make me nervous ?  This idea could indeed be feasible in the long run when comprehensive peace in the Middle East is consolidated, but it's a powderkeg idea in the current crisis situation...

       urlLink Reuters  reports that  urlLink Israel Seeks to Reassure U.S. on West Bank . Now that's presumably the best way to muster confidence among the Palestinian people I suppose ? By the way, notwithstanding the plans to enlarge it still, Maale Adumim I think has already at least five times the number of Israeli residents as the number of settlers slated to leave the Gaza Strip according to the Sharon withdrawal plan. And Maale Adumim will cutt of Palestinians in East Jerusalem completely. Supposedly that's the Israeli way of building confidence measures for Palestinian residents... pfff...
