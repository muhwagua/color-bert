      ::sigh::  Well I was sleeping, but I was awakened by a phone call.  I don't mind it though, I like waking up to the sound of her voice. =)  Anyway, we were talking about our plans for New Year's and well I was planning on cancelling on Micc cuz, well, duh financial reasons.  And I figure, the cheapest, most practical thing for me to do would be to hang out with the fam in Menifee.  Makes sense, right?  The only thing is.. I feel so bad bc I don't want her to just hang out with MY family on freakin' New Year's.. that's whack.  Besides, as Miss Mya would put it, she's single, sexy, and free!!  Why wouldn't she want to go out and have fun?  Hang out with friends?  Or is it just me?  ..because I was pushing for her to go and I think I might have upset her? =X  I dunno, I'm completely content chillin with my family, and I just don't think it'd be fair for her to feel like she'd have to be with me just bc we're "talking."  Call me koOky, but..  eh, I really think she should go out.  And, we're spending the entire weekend together, so it's not like I can complain about not seeing her for one night.  Am I trippin?  I guess were I in her shoes with her pressing for me to do other things during New Year's would sort of offend me because it woULD be nice to spend the first moments of the upcoming year with someone you love and would like to see more of.  Ooookay, I guess I was trippin then.  Hah, I'm such a punk.  Now that that's settled though, I'd like to vent about something else that crossed my mind..  OK, so the other night (Friday), we went to BK's.  Jes ends up getting maaad drunk and we get escorted outta the club (but shhh.. I didn't say nadings! lol).  K, well throughout the night, we were hanging out with a couple friends, Nellie and Kong (sp?), and I guess they were accompanied by another dude--Charles, I think his name was.  Well, I was pretty freakin wasted myself, but from the flashes I remember.. hmm, well I don't even really know the beginning/middle/end, so let me just say what I remember.  I remember talking with the guy, then kissing him (yuuuuuuck!!! I dunno how the FUCK that happened!  Would I have agreed to something like that?!  I've been drunk before and that has NEVER happened.) And all of a sudden his hands were hella up my shirt, and I remember sobering up real quick after that, so I'm pretty sure his hands were hella groping (it takes alot for me to get offended, ask anyone).  The thing is, I didn't get mad, I just helllllllllla pulled away/pushed him away, and told him I needed to check on Jes.  AHHHHHHH why am I so frickin NICE?! ..and then I thought about it and ILL!  What an ASSHOLE!!  There's no way I'd be leading this little shit on, especially after I saw how UNattractive he was (let's not forget to point out the fact that I was at a DOWN club.. uh to check out the ladies?!).  I never really agreed with that whole-- alcohol being the cure for ugliness thing anyway.  I know, I know, I'm being mean and I'm usually not (I swear!), but in this case, he deserves to be called UGLY. =P  So anyway, I feel he  completely  took advantage of me / the situation.  It sucks because I hella thought he was cool when we were talking; he was talking about taking care of Jes..  Deng, and I was there with her too, and I remember wanting her to sober up cuz I started freaking out and I didn't wanna hang out with the guy anymore.  AND I felt sooooo bad about what happened that it made me cry--i thought to myself, but apparently loud enough for her to have heard.  (I'm sure that was the alcohol tho, and I just didn't want her to think that I wanted that ish in the first place.  OH and the fuck even bragged to her saying "yeah, i kissed your friend"  WTF man?!  I guess I'm lucky it wasn't her though because she was hella more fucked up than me; he could have taken advantage of that shit.  Then again, I remember telling Kong that mr. man made me hella uncomfortable and I didn't want him anywhere around us. =X  And he was so sweet too, he was like "okay girl, don't worry about, i'll take care of it.." of course, as I reflect back on it, he could of just said that to calm me down, but still I don't remember seeing the dude much more after that, so THANK YOU KONG! lol)  Ahh, and I feel so stupid because I'm like every other girl out there who doesn't say ISH, out of fear?..out of embarrassment?..out of freakin physical discomfort?  I dunno dude, and maybe this is unfair to the male population as a whole, but do I wonder why I'm GAY??????  HELLLLLLLL NOOOOOOOOOOO!  Talk about unwanted ISH.. blah.. the thought of it just ewwwwww, makes me want to gag or something.  AND that's the first time kissing a guy too, how sad is that?  I couldn't even have a nice first kiss with a guy..  NO, it had to be with a jerk seeing the perfect opportunity to get fkn fresh and seizing it.  Man, F!@# that.. he's lucky I was faded.  I hope his manhood gets infected and falls off..too harsh?  shoo, i don't care right now.. haha.  But whatever, I'm over it..  I guess it's little things like these that remind us we are surrounded by lil fuckers (hey, not all boys necessarily, my best friend is a guy!), damn ishts are everywhere..

      blah. blah. blah. blah.  I've determined that four lines of "blah" will fill the entire ad at the top of my site.  haha.. how funny, huh?  I really need to ask someone about that.  =X   Anyway, let's move along..  I am so stressed!  I'm going to  the bay  this weekend and planned out this whole lil mini vacation with me and you know who.  I wanted us to check out a couple of  down  clubs (club Q and cherry bar, for those of you familiar with Frisko) and on one of the nights (I hadn't decided yet) I wanted to make reservations for us to eat at this Italian restaurant at Fisherman's Wharf.  BUT, unfortunately, the work I thought I'd be getting, or better yet, the MONEY I thought I was going to get.. is no more.  The couple I work for (it's a cleaning job--not a very dignifying job, but I work when I want, how I want (as long as the job's done), and get tax-free cash) won't have work for me until after New Year's.  I guess the military folk don't believe in moving out of Base Housing around this time.  Boo for me! =\  AND, we're planning to leave butt-crack early on Friday.  NO TIME!!  On top of things, it doesn't look like Micc and Ash are going to join us, which would have made the cost of our lil road trip a little less..nutts!  Ahh, woe is me..  So, like I said before, I already made the reservations and I'm not about to cancel.  I guess I can change the room to a standard one, but eh, I don't know if they'd have any available anyway.  And on top of everything, it's that time of the month, starting today.  When it rains, it pours I tell ya.  Aw, and I was going to have a dozen boxed roses sent to our room while we were at dinner, so we would come back to them afterwards.  Ay, I just hate when plans fall through.  Especially when you're really REALLY looking forward to it.  It's like, when I plan something I visualize every detail and I go to great lengths trying to make things happen the way I imagine it happening in my mind.  Man..  money is lame.  It prevents people from having fun.. lol.  Ok well not necessarily, but it sure does put restrictions on a lot of what I want to do. =T  Hmm, what to do, what to do..  AHH geez, what an impossible situation.  Anyone have two bills I can borrow?  I even offered to double any donation made by anyone in my household (by next week even!), can you tell I'm desperate?  Haha, this is just too funny.. I have to laugh.  ::sigh of frustration and despair::  Well I'm sure everything will work out, I just.. have to sell myself at the corner for a couple nights.. hahaha.. sheeeeeit!!  Damn the man..  alright, well I'm gonna go count my pennies.  I really am taking donations. =P    Thank you and good night.

      Ok.  Just call me computer illiterate because that's what I am.  Well, two things: 1) How do I change my template so that my posts aren't hidden by that immutable (or seemingly so) google ad at the top of the page? 2) How the heezy do I put my email address on this site?  (If you consider yourself a natural do-gooder and would like to help me out, by all means, email me at  xlboogiesx@aol.com .  K done.  So, moving along..  I'm staying at her house while she's at work, and she came all the way here during her half hour break (knowing full well we'd only get to hang out about fifteen minutes or so) just to spend it with me.  Isn't that the sweetest thing?  This (yucky) love stuff makes everything else in my life seem like a backdrop.  I love the illusions of love, it's no wonder why those who have succumbed to its power feel absolutely untouchable, because that's exactly how I feel.  Whether that's a good thing or not is debatable, I'm sure, but who cares! =P  Ahh.. she is so beautiful.  I can just stare at her for hours on end.  She has such an amazing smile, the cutest lips, the most attractive body, a mesmerizing face..  ::(good)sigh:: ..here we go again..

      Hm.  See I told you it wouldn't last long.  Btw, belated Happy Holidays everyone.  So plans have changed, I am no longer going to Vegas with Mica, technically the ex, but she's closer to being a best friend.  We've had our ups and downs lately, but I'm glad that her and I can maintain a really good relationship despite how hurt she is.  Cece's another story.  That chick won't give me the time of day.  It's understandable I guess, but.. it still sucks.. oh well life goes on.  Anyway, I digress, I've come to the conclusion that going to Vegas with Mica and her friends might not be such a good idea since she's not completely healed, and I don't want to risk getting into an argument with her when I'm all the way over there with her and her friends.  That'd REALLY suck.  On top of that, we'd be drinking like mad women and everybody knows that drama and alcohol equals trouble, so needless to say, I'm looking for something else to do to bring on the new year.  Got any suggestions???    Christmas was nice.  It was for the most part quiet and intimate, or from what I heard from Mary, Kata used the word "boring".  I admit, it was pretty uneventful and it seemed to go just as quickly as it came, but being around family is always a comforting feeling, you just have to learn to appreciate it, I guess?  So, I had a good time.  I even got really cool presents this year.  Among them, a cool ass book called "This Book Will Change Your Life" from Urban Outfitters, a shot glass chess set (oo yeah baby), a stereo for my room (jealous huh?), and the goapele and dido cds (they freakin rock btw!).    K, well I should go.  I'm going to head down to San Diego and hit up "Bad Kitty's"--an average girl club, but unfortunately the only one in daygo (unless you're wanting to put up with the lame music and way older crowd of "the Flame").  We  were  supposed to go with Kata and thems (and see Cece for the first time since the major drama hit san diego), but it I just found out they're not going anymore.  Cece doesn't feel like seeing me there (  her  or  she  is what she calls me.  I'm no longer worthy of a name, only pronouns. ay.)  Oh well.  We had enough respect to remain homebodies for the past three weeks when they went, so I'm not stressin.  I have no problem seeing anyone there, but hey, that just saves me the trouble of looking over my shoulder to see if I'm getting any death looks from anyone (more specifically my nemesis.)    One last thing, I'm planning a trip to Frisko the weekend after New Year's, so we'll see how that works out.  I made reservations already, but I have to work my ass off to actually pay when we check in. =X  I miss no. cali..  I hope everything turns out OK.  Anyway, I'm off..

      k... I know, I know FOURTH entry on the first day.  Believe me peoples, it won't always be like this. =P  So I just got off the phone with Jessica, and I cancelled on her for New Year's (we were supposed to hang out). =X  Well see, this is the story...  Prior to all the drama that surfaced when people found out about her and I (and to maintain my sanity I'm not EVEN going to go into it), I had already asked a couple friends to go to Vegas.  AND it was Kathleen and I who were planning it in the first place (well, and Mica too).  So before I committed to Jes, I guess you can say I was already committed?  Does that make sense?  ...so it voids the second obligation right?  Or why would it even be an obligation since I'm not with her?  Am I just reaching for shit cuz I don't want to feel like an ass?...lol.  But who am I kidding, I love the girl (ahh...such a strong word; so little time has passed!!), so of course I'd want to know how she felt about me going.  Anyhow, so I assumed that plans would just fall through since things were rocky with me and a lot of folks, but I guess it was arrogant of me to think that way because Kata just told me it's still a GO!  woooohooo...  So I made a choice, and I figure, HELL, how often am I single on New Year's?  Better yet, how often am I single???  NOT OFTEN.  So Vegas, here I come!...

Want to hear something beautiful?   ..and as I take a deep breath, I close my eyes.. I say a little prayer for the sun to rise.. today..   ..smile today.. ..smile today.. ..feel good today..

      Ah, entry #2, woohooo I'm on a roll!  Actually, it's  FINALS WEEK  and I can't sleep for the life of me--not that I need to be sleeping when my ass is trying to catch up on half a semester for two classes IN ONE NIGHT, but hey, let's not talk about that.  So what's new with me?    I found myself in not a love triangle, but a love SQUARE, that's right folks, you heard me right. =X  OK, well so there's CECE who's an ex...MICA who's my ex...and JESSICA who's Cece's ex.  Can anyone guess who I've fallen for??  Aye...d r a m a.  It never fails, I always seem to get myself in situations like these.  I need a chastity belt for my heart, because I can never control the damn thing.  Anyway, time heals, so that's what I'm waiting on.  I love Cece and especially Mica, and I anxiously wait for the day that they've completely forgiven me.  In the meantime, the more I kick it with Jes, the more I realize how beautiful she is.  But shhhhh... I'm not trying to jump into relationships after coming out of a two-yrs-and-then-some one.  Anyway, dating's fun... no strings attached! ::winks::  On another note, Kathleen (younger sister) and I made up.  We're friends again--yay!  I hate fighting with sisters.  That's got to be the worst thing ever. =\  But we're friends again so YAY! =D  Christmastime is upon us once again and once again, LEILA HAS NO FUNDS.  Man, I need a job...  I guess on to studying...

      So I've succumb to the whole BLOG thing.  At first I thought to myself, 'it's just like having a diary, what's the big deal?'  Now, after reading a few friends' sites I realize that life's filled with so many unexpected turns that v e n t i n g to anyone that'll listen can be the only way to go.  And with that... I'm off.  Of course, being computer almost-illiterate, it's going to take me some time to get this site to look like what I want it to.  Any suggestions?

      Hm, it's already Friday.  You can tell that school has started.  My posts are becoming fewer and fewer as the days go on.  That's okay, as long as I remember to update it every now and again.  Seeing as though this is my alibi for forgotten and/or delayed emails.  Anyway, so what have I been up to?...  School is stimulating.  I love all my teachers and feel like I am going to learn a lot from them this semester and actually get elated before class starts--seriously!  Maybe when we're more into the semester and projects get a little more complex/difficult, I may feel overwhelmed, but as of right now I'm learning/re-learning a myriad of ways to express myself through art and it's the most rewarding feeling.  I guess when you're an idealist like me, getting some of those ideas outta my head and onto paper is such a relief and sometimes even empowering.  Hm.  I've noticed that my passion for art has grown to unparalleled heights.  Well no, that's a lie.  I'm very much so passionate about the relationship I'm currently in, but you'd have to be new to my site to not have known this already.  On a completely unrelated note, we (her and I) have this "thing" where, instead of buying each other presents for our (monthly) anniversary, we--both being the avid art students that we are--will create (by any means) a piece of art and give it to the other person.  We just did the exchange tonight, and I gotta say-- this beats having to buy/receiving something bought ANYDAY!!  I don't know if it's because of our interest in art or if it's knowing how much time/consideration/preparation/skill went into the piece, or even if it's just the fact that the other person MADE it from scratch that makes it so different, so real, and so precious, but it's soooooo cool!  If we last a while (knock on wood), my room's going to look like an exhibition of jessica's artwork.  Hey, that'd be pretty cool.. hah. =P    Ok, let's see, what else did we do today?  Oh, Mica came over today and Wednesday too.  It's always nice seeing her.  It just doesn't feel right when we don't see each other for a while.  And no, it's not because of the whole "ex" thing, it just has to do with the comfort level we share and the friendship we've managed to retain after the "break".  I will always love that girl, no matter what..even if I cringe at the company she chooses to surround herself with sometimes..haha, ok i'm kidding.. sheesh.  What'd we do?  We went to the mall and (kinda) helped Jes look for some "girlie" clothes and I've come to the conclusion that three lesbians shopping for "girlie" clothes can be a very difficult thing..haha.  By the way, ONE: if you refer to feminine wear as "girlie" clothes, then that's a sure sign you're not girlie and TWO: if you hang your "girlie" clothes over your shoulder like a construction worker who throws his toolbelt over his shoulder at the end of the day, well.. LOL.. I think my example speaks for itself.  =X  hahaha.. ok so that's what we were laughing at.  BUT, I think it's cute!  (She did that with her jacket at a club in Frisko and I thought it looked pretty sexy.. I don't know why, I'm kinda weird like that sometimes. ::shrugs::)  ay.  I'm so sleepy........  I would love to continue updating, but I'm struggling just trying to look at the screen.  Therefore, I must end it here.  Til next time...  thank you and good night. =P

      "l e i l a"  random thoughts for tonight:  If you turn your back on someone for so long, don't act so surprised if, upon your return to her, you find that she has done the same to you.  AND  Though it's a difficult concept to grasp, not all friendships can be saved; be thankful of the ones you have and let go of the ones you've lost.

      Tis the second week of school..    I'm finally done with crashing/adding/dropping classes.  Actually, I just have to submit this for with Admissions and I'm all set for the semester.  Now the only thing I have to worry about are the art supplies I need because they're already costing a GRRRRIP and I haven't even bought half of what I need.  Worth the classes?  ..every cent.   Have I told you the girlfriend is an Art student too?  Isn't that tight?  Ahh it's so weird and nice to share my passion and admiration for art with someone.  I love it.  Anyway, she's in this photographic imagery class and had to take two rolls of film worth of pictures of people.  It was pretty fun.. lol.  And NO, get your mind outta the gutter, it's for her class. lol.  She even let me take a few, I enjoyed myself. ;)  And watching Suzie and Mark take pictures was entertaining.  They're cool peeps.. very funny and cute together.  I especially liked the 'ghetto' pose, yup, that one's a keeper. hah.  Saturday was fun.  Suzie came in and showed us like three pairs of shoes that she bought that day. lol.  OH and how can I forget, Jes cooked up a bomb ass dinner--from scratch EVEN.  Can you believe it?  Yeah, neither can I.. haha.  j/k =P  Hm, what else.  Ahh, it was a  long  night filled with endless, and I mean  endless  talk.  It was great.  Learning people is so much fun, especially when it's someone you've fallen for.  But yeah, fun fun fun night on Sat.  Sunday was all recovery and dinner at BJ's.  mmmmm calzones are great.  ooo and the desserts.. but for the life of me I can't remember the name of it (what's new?).  So, that's my weekend in a nutshell.  I'm actually REALLY looking forward to this semester.  Things are just going too good for me right now, it's almost like the too-perfect scene in a horror flick and I'm waiting for tragedy to strike.  Maybe it never will, but all I know is that life is good.  Fuck the stress, money, and drama...       Life is good .

      allo allo...  Ahh, the first week of school is almost over.   Can you believe it?  Man is January flying by us like nothing.  Or at least that's what it feels like to me anyway.  Well let's see, quick update..     **I didn't get into the Stat class I wanted to crash, but a really sweet guy offered me his spot.  And of course, after complimenting his thoughtfulness, I denied the offer.  Wasn't that nice of him though??  I thought so.  **My books and supplies are OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive this year.  I should be more stressed than I am, but I'm relying on a financial aid check to roll on by.  And it's going to be so sad to watch that thing withdrawn just as quickly as it was deposited.   **Anatomy class is a MAYBE.  I'm the next one down on the list, but I gotta say, it's a pretty intimidating class.  First class meeting we were already jumping head first into a plethora of medical terms and observing (for my first time) a real-life cadaver!  Where's Cece when I need her?? HA! shyeah.. right..  **I'm really SUPER excited about my art classes.  It's exactly what I need to determine whether or not this is something I want to pursue.. but from the looks of it, my mind's already made up.    I love my girlfriend.  We haven't even been together a month, but she already makes me feel like I can do anything.  And it's so weird because .. I don't know, maybe it's the distance.. but the attraction between us just seems to grow..  I love it!  ..and I love waking up next to her, it makes my day (whatever it may hold) so much more bearable.

      First day of school.. not bad, not bad at all.  Of course, today and Thursdays consist of two art classes, so of course I'd enjoy it.  I've come to the conclusion that I absolutely love art and I kick myself in the ass for not getting into it sooner.  There's this painting class that I'm really excited about, so we'll have to see how that goes.  I've never really had any experience with paint with the exception of a class I took in Junior High, but even then I remember it sparking an interest.  I was debating on whether I should experiment with acrylics or oils, but the instructor said that if we were looking to compose abstract art (which seems more interesting to me, but I don't know) that acrylics would be easier because they dry faster and are more suitable for beginners anyway.  Anyway, it'll be fun..  K so one of my best friends and I had the funniest of funny conversations this evening.  He and I have come along way since we met three years ago.  I wish I had more friends like him in my life, but then that would take away from what we have, so scratch that thought.  I was venting to him earlier about the little things in life that have been irritating me.  Guys have this gift of seeing things in a whole different, less complicated, light.  I dunno, girls (and those who think they are..lol) are just drama sometimes--alot of times.  It's always a relief to talk to him, I can't think of one time where he wasn't  there  for me.  Especially now when it seems like everyone's doing their own thing, it's nice to have at least one familiar face keeping me grounded.  So, that's my thought for tonight.

      I'm pretty sure I'm coming down with something.. bleh..  My body felt 15lbs heavier this morning, or maybe it was the icecream I ate last night? =X haha.. I just dunno..  I was taking a shower a few minutes ago and it hit me, it's funny, I always have epitomes in there.  Anyway, I realized that I was an ass last night to someone who means a lot to me.  You know, I pride myself in being fair, level-headed (for the most part) and rational, but then the instant I feel hurt or pain, all that I have mentioned shoots itself right out the window and I say the most outrageous things.  Pain is such a strong emotion, strong enough to raise someone's defenses at any given moment, justified or not.  ..and I guess that's not something I'm used to.  Or maybe it is  because  I'm just, that I get so upset when I feel like I or someone I love has been or is being treated unfairly.  These things that I was upset over seems so trivial to me in hindsight, but everytime the subject comes around I just feel that it's so wrong and my mood shifts with the wind.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is  I'm sorry .  Association is a powerful thing.  I guess that's why I was worried.  In the end, things will be the way they were meant to be, and I just needed to take a moment to see that.  We all make choices that, in one way or another, alter our lives forever and in the end all you're left with is whether or not it was worth it.  And if every single time the answer is yes, then you made the right decision. =)  ..off to school I go..

      This is worth a thought:           "It's not that some people have willpower and some don't. It's that some people are ready to change           and others are not."

      Feeling a little better this evening..  So I start school tomorrow and I'm a little anxious/nervous.  I always get a tad apprehensive the first day of school because there are just so many things that can go wrong, and I try to prepare myself but sometimes to no avail.  In addition, the thought of making friends/meeting new people is, to me, an unnerving experience in and of itself.  I don't know why, I've always been like that.  Go figure.  I'm going to have to crash two classes this semester, an anatomy/physiology class and a statistics class.  Cross your fingers that I get in.  Then again, I really wouldn't mind NOT getting in because then I would get to keep all my art classes.  Were my attempt to crash/enroll prove successful, I'd be forced to drop either painting or figure drawing so as not to lose my sanity this semester.  So we'll see.. I'm not really stressing either way.  After this semester I'll only have a couple more classes to take before I can officially transfer to a UC.. woofreakinghoo!  All I have to say is it's about freaking time.  Everyone around me is graduating from college and here I am rejoicing over a future transfer to another school..haha, oh well..each at her own pace right?    Well, there's quite a bit more stuff I need to do to prepare myself for tomorrow, so I will be ending it here.  But not before saying I MISS MY GIRLFRIEND!!!  LOL.  Ahh.. I can't imagine doing this distance thing for any distance greater than it is now, but I dunno.  I'm such a needy person I think.  It's like, I have to have the person physically 'there.'  I guess I just need something tangible.  I tried this distance thing a few years ago and she was all the way in freaking Illinois while I was here in good ol' Cali-forn-i-a, and let me tell you, it was the hardest damn thing I've ever had to do.  I guess that's why I told myself .. never again.  But what I have now is nothing like that, not at all like that.  Still hard, but like I said before, I'm sure (or am I) that once we get 'used' to a schedule (but I don't like routine? lol) then things will get easier.  Hm.  I don't know.  But it's too early to be thinking about stuff like that, all I know is that not seeing her kicks my butt. lol.  Ok, the end.  Goodnight.

       Leila's on the lookout for a weekday girlfriend, so those interested please email resumes to xlboogiesx@aol.com or via snailmail at:    Leila Bunjoobees ..look me up.. Buttcrack Middle of Nowhere, CA 92suhinsuhins   SO.. when I'm on a roll with posting stuffs and all of a sudden I go a day or so without writing, chances are, I'm with my newfound love.  That's right, school's back in session, which means time is limited and precious.  More specifically, the time I spend with her is what is going to suffer, so I cherish every second we have together.  (Aww, sweet huh?)  Like I said, space is good and healthy and everything, .. but it is soo difficult having to let go, even if it IS for only a few days.  What can I say, we were spoiled over the winter break--aka our vacation--and I still have to get used to not seeing her as often.  I dunno, I'm sure I'm just being a baby though (oo gotta add this to the book); separation anxiety is common among new couples, isn't it? lol.  Anyway, I had pics of Jes and I posted up on this thing earlier in the evening, but I took em out because geocities (or maybe it was that I) was being retarded and the pics weren't coming up.  I'll just toy around with that stuffs tomorrow.  Today I just wasn't in the mood. =T  So on a lighter note, my weekend was really good.  It was soooo nice to see her.  I can't believe four days is the longest stretch we've had, of not seeing each other, since the end of November.  Sickening isn't it? haha.. don't be jealous!  So needless to say, I was happy she was here.  It remained pretty uneventful (sorry again) but it was .. memorable nonetheless. lol.  Jessica kicked mine and my brother in law's asses in chess while we were all faded.  I'm bitter, but OVER it. haha.  ..and of course, I DEMAND A REMATCH. ::insert cheesy AOL face here::  Later, Ed gets stuck with cold water.. Jessica's fault.  The next day, and maybe even that day, we have intense wrestling matches and are left with bruises, scratches on backs?, to prove it.  And my back, though sore as hell yesterday, is just now feeling normal and functional again.  Hmm.. haha.. yeah.  I guess I can go ON and ON.. because you know, sometimes it seems endless.. but i'll leave it there.  I'm calling it a night.  Til tomorrow..  [side note.. I was kinda errked 'bout a Vegas trip we were so casually left out of (understandable though, cuz of Cece--I guess.  although KATHLEEN  is  supposed to be a sister, but whatever..), but then I thought, ahh whatever, fuckems.. everyone goes their separate ways at one time or another.. life goes on.]

      It's buttcrack early in the morning and I was supposed to go to work with Ed and Lanie, but it turns out that Lanie's not feeling well enough to go. =T  The doctor gave her this pill that is supposed to completely remove all the tissue left over from her miscarriage.  Doesn't sound to pleasant, does it?  Well from looking at her, you can tell it isn't.  Poor woman, she's been through too much in her life and she's just like the energizer bunny, she just keeps going and going..  Kind of reminds me of my mom..  What strong and determined women they are.  OH, heroes!  I couldn't think of any when I was answering that question book, but this is the perfect answer--My mom and older sister; they are my heroes.  Indestructible women.  How could I not look up to that?  Ha.  Great.  Hey Jes, remind me to add that when you come over. ;)  SO as I was saying, I'm kinda awake, well no actually I'm pretty freakin awake for me sleeping past 1am and it only being 5ish.  I was going to go back to sleep, but I figure, I'm going to wake her up, or give her a wake up call, at 6:30a anyway, so I might as well just stay up.  Now that I think about it, I had a whole hour to nap--dammits, lol.. But nah, I might not have gotten up anyway.  Speaking of the lady, I talked to her a lot last night.  I think it made me miss her more.  It's funny, you'd think that it'd appease the persistent feelings of longing and desire I have for her, but no, it just intensifies it.  She hasn't been having the greatest of weeks this past week and I tried to assure her (and hopefully succeeded in doing so) she can always talk to me and I will always lend an ear, especially to her.  One of the things she was hesitant to tell me about was that she was a little bothered that Mica and I drank when Mica was here; which of course led to Mica spending the night--and on my bed bcuz we're just so used to each other--which also hit a nerve with the gf.  yikes!  Sounds bad, doesn't it?  I know, now that I look back on it, yeah I guess I'd be pretty disturbed as well.  SO from now on, no alcohol if it's just us two and I'll take the floor when she comes over?  Haha, that'd be odd, but to do it out of respect for Jessica makes perfect sense to me.  I'm sure she'd do it for me, so I'd do it for her in an instant.  That's the way love goes right?  Respect and Love woven together through Communication.  I love this girl, and there is nothing that pleases me more than to see her happy.  Seeing her smile is good enough for me, but knowing that I am what lies behind that smile is a thousand times more gratifying and I become addicted to the feeling.  Ok, enough yucky love stuff.. haha.  What's great about our talk is that we are both so level-headed, and though it was like pulling teeth to get her to open up to me (I guess she wasn't so used to doing that in her other relationships?), once she did, it was smooth sailing from there.  I know she understands that Mica and I--albeit "exes"-- will always be best friends (and hard to swallow, she admits), but I hope she realizes that she has stolen my heart and therefore I cannot give it to anyone else.. I'm hers..  [Random thoughts]:    *****Mary left for westpac again yesterday. =\  I don't understand why the hell the US is still in IRAQ in the first place.  I'm no politician, but wouldn't it just make sense to pull out and let them deal with their own country??  Ahh, I don't get it.  I say DEAN for president =D (don't know too much about him as of yet, but anyone's better than the ________ (you fill in the blank) we got filling that position right now!  ..talk about making the US look bad)......  *****Stuart visited my site..YAY!  ..and he said the image of the two girls kissing in their white underwear gave him a WOODIE..YAY! =X  haha.. well it IS a nice picture, though Jes and I think we could do better..HA! >=)  *****I have a couple emails on their way, so if you are reading this (you know who you are), calm ya'self cuz it's a-comin'..haha.  *****I start school next week, YAY!  I miss it..weird huh?..no, not really..  *****I'm itchin' to work out.. no idea why..  hidden aggressions?  hmm..

      Hm.  So.. I was sorting through my crate.  And I stumble upon an envelope that I hadn't noticed was there before.  And inside it is the sweetest, most reassuring note.  ..already a month later and I just now find it.  I just wanted to say thank you, I will cherish it..  that's all..    [ side note ]: I am so lucky to have experienced so much love in my life.  I dread the dark days because I feel like I'm pressing my luck with all the times love worked in my favor; bad luck will find me eventually and when it does I wonder what I'll do..

      The RandomEST of Random Thoughts:  Squeak-age and Friction suck when it comes to doors/covers.  (I came to this realization in the car with Mica, don't ask me why weird shit spontaneously pops into my head, cuz I dunno..)  It's Tuesday..  my miss started school yesterday, so it's busy busy busy body for her.  It's a good thing because it gives us space to miss each other, but missing someone can be so agonizing. =\  Distance makes the heart grow fonder.. riiight..  I'll keep telling myself that.    Aside from that, what have I been doing?  Hm.. well Mica came over last night.  She came to drop off some knives that my mom asked her to buy.  It was nice hanging out with her again, it had been over a week since I last saw her at Christmas.  She reassures me that now, really, truly, she believes that she's well on her way to recovering from  us  and that her outlook has become a lot more positive, a turn for the best.  Of course, I've heard all this before, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little skeptical, but like I tend to do, I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt and waiting to see if she changes her mind.  If not, I'll be overjoyed because I cherish our friendship so much I'd miss it dearly were it to fade away again.  I'm crossing my fingers that she proves me wrong.  Anyway, so she spent the night and left about an hour ago.  And in case she's reading this bcuz she couldn't help herself from doing so, HA! I BEAT YOUR ASS IN SCRABBLE~!!! (dig that squiggly line thing too! =D )   Man, I gotta clean my room.  I guess I'll go do something a little more productive.  ..Reorganize my drawers and rid myself of clutter, sounds like a plan.  (I saw this thing online? on tv? in a magazine?  in a book?--I don't remember =X--talking about how organizing/reorganizing, and keeping your space clutter-free are techniques that incorporate some of the aspects of Feng Shui and aids in keeping negative energy at bay.  Pretty cool huh?)  I can't help it, I keep getting distracted.  I feel like something's missing and I can't concentrate..   ..Day dreaming.  Reminiscing.  Fantasizing.  Dwelling.  Wondering.  Feeling.  Thinking.  Remembering.  Treasuring.  Missing.  Longing.  Loving.  Wanting..

      Hm, it nears 11.oo pm, and I really should sleep soon because I'm leaving for work with the sister and brother-in-law which means my ass has to be up and ready to jet by 5.30 am, BUT the girlie doesn't get off work til late tonight and I want to hear her voice before I call it a night.. sweet huh?  or ewww gross? lol.  I think it's the former, but I'm sure I'm the biased one. =P  Anyway, I figures, might as well update this thing since I'm on such a roll.    So last night was  Ronnie's shindig , and overall, I had fun.  I was preparing myself for the worst and hoping for the best--because, you know, that's always the way to go--and well hey, there were no hateful words exchanged between me and anyone (besides calling Kata an asshole for not calling me lately =P ) so I guess the night went good?  No, it did go good.  Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel uncomfortable for a good portion of the party, but then the alcohol kicked in and I had no worries. =P  (and who wonders why I swear by the stuff, because it's a solution to everything! haha.. ok maybe not, but it's fun anyway!)  I guess it was just awkward because I didn't really know (like, hang out with/talk with) anyone there besides Kata, Cece, and those who I made friends through Cece.  And well, just look at my options. lol.  When I've gone to parties like these in the past, I always hung out with Mica, and dah, we're not together anymore, so I was a little nervous to see how things would go.  On the upside, Jessica's friends showed up, and they're mad cool peeps.  I ended up hanging out with them, her--on occasion, kata and dat for a hot second?, and Mica.    It was cool because Mica and I got the chance to talk, and it's always nice talking to her.  When it's only the two of us, everything goes back to normal and I feel like we've maintained the friendship aspect of our two year + relationship, but then I always have to wonder if the next day she'll change her mind about things and want to distance herself from me again.  I guess I don't feel like I have too many friends down here, so I want to hold on to whatever I can?  So when we don't talk, I feel like something in my life is missing.  Well, I always have Greg and Mary--but I know she's busy, and Amber of course--but the girl is so far and busy with school/work as well, but it's different?  Ah, I dunno.  Maybe it's because my most recent relationship was with her and so I still feel like the comfort level is where it was when we were together?  Anyway, I'm glad she was there, because she calmed me down and reminded me that I shouldn't give a fuck about what other people thought (I was kinda stressin' because I felt a little animosity from C and her peoples. Well I don't know what it was exactly, but I caught glances that lingered a little longer than most comfortable looks last.)  So, thank you Mica.  It kinda sucked that I didn't hang out with Jessica more.  I felt bad, but at the same time, I felt like Cece was already dissin me and I didn't want to rub it in by hanging around Jes the entire time.  Lame huh?  I mean, I understand why I did it, but I guess I feel like Jessica's already my girlfriend, and it seems unfair that I felt like I had to hide it because of certain people.  It's not like I wanted to make out with her in front of a gang loada people, but acting like a  couple  would've been nice.  Wouldn't they have to deal with it at one point or another anyway?  Then again, no one was holding a gun to my head, so I guess I could've been more open about it if I wanted to, but then that'd be inconsiderate--that's not me.  Oh well, maybe next time.  On that note, I hope Cece comes around eventually because it is soooo uncomfortable being around her.  She confronted Mica at the party asking (in a not so friendly tone) why she was hanging out with me, Jes, and her friends.  It's okay though because Mica threw that attitude right back at her and told her not to tell her what to do. lol.  Ah, drama.  Anyway, I know I'm still the bad guy, I just wish for my sake, her sake, and others--who are affected by the grudges she's holding on to--that she let it go so we can live and let live already.  Holding grudges just makes people bitter and mutual friends uncomfortable.  Why hang on to misery?  I read my sister's post earlier and she was talking about not sweating the small stuff, and two things: I completely agree, and this (to me) definitely qualifies as small stuff.  Here's a nice quote:          "All blame is a waste of time. No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much  you blame him, it will not change you. The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration. You may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him, but you won't succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy."     Time, time, time.. I know, I know..  [Random ish from that night]:  Mica cuts her finger, Dat is the straightest gay boy i know..lol, obnoxious assholes at mexican restaurants suck, I'm too nice when I'm drunk (especially when it comes to guys), Julius and Pika (I think I spelled her name wrong..hehe sorry) are super nice, Ven is super funny, Leah sucks cuz she dissed Jes, mmm carne asada chips, photo album time at jessica's (btw I saw those pics you when you were sleeping..cute..haha), mica and kata followed us home (like whoa.. it was a nice surprise).  [Random ish from today]:  cell phone bill's a bitch, how's your leg miss?  Still cramping? ::winks::  Where did the day go..

      Ah, another day, another blog.  I've touched base with a couple of long lost friends, it always feels nice to know that people haven't forgotten about you completely.  Today was uneventful; I worked, I worked out.  It was a beautiful day today.  As I was sitting on a upside-down bucket outside the house I was cleaning, I basked in the sun, admiring the breath-taking scenery and the perfect weather.  It made me nostalgic, of times when  life seemed a little bit easier and simpler ...  --climbing as high as I could on our tree outside the house we used to have in Sacramento and feeling on top of the world.  --sitting by myself when Amber had her sac united tournaments and playing with the grass.  if the grass is right and you pull soft enough, you can separate the blades and it's the most satisfying feeling (trust me!, try it).  I imagine it brings me as much joy or pleasure or comfort? as Amelie gets from dipping her hand into a barrel of.. what is it?..beans?..seeds?  --when Kay and I would smoke (the legal stuff-cloves) and lie on our backs, on the ground, and gaze at the stars during the dark nights.  --this one time after a rave, Mary and I could NOT for the life of us stop laughing, and so we did-- for HOURS!, ahh that was some good shit..haha.  --once upon a time, it only took straight A's to make the parents happy and proud.  --being one of the first girls chosen on teams (when we had to choose teams) was always a good feeling.  --camping with family and friends (especially when someone oh-so-INconveniently forgets to bring the poles for the tent.  did we ever know who that was??)  --when I didn't have a license and didn't have to deal with all the STUPID drivers in the world.  --when money was never really an issue and time never seemed to go fast enough. .. .. ..then I snap out of it and realize there's still a lot more work in the house for me to do.     I'll end it with that.  Goodnights.

      blah, blah,  more blah,  and blah..  Dammit! lol  I swear just a few hours ago, that damn ad disappeared and I thought to myself.. 'whew, thank fkn goodness it did because that isht bugs!..'  And just like that, baMm!, it's back.  Ahhh..  Someone's playing tricks on me I swear..    Hm, just got off the phone with Greg.  Talked to him for about an hour.. it's always nice talking to him.  We were trippin out because of all the days of the year, the day I decide to ask Jessica turns out to be the same day as Greg and Joy's anniversary.  How weird is that?!  Ah, that Greg.. Anyway, I love talking to that boy.  He is so supportive of me no matter what I do, and he gives me that extra push when he knows I need it.  It's so weird having such a strong male figure in my life since I haven't really had one.. well ever.  I'm lucky enough to call him one of my best friends, it's weird how you stumble upon people who end up making a huge difference/impact in your life, isn't it?  It's nice.    Anyway, I should sleep now, gotta get up buttcrack early tomorrow morning.     last thought : One night without her and it already feels like something's missing.  It's so scary to feel like someone i've known for so little time completes me in ways no one else can.  ..weird..  ..a  good  weird.. ::winks::

      ..So today, Jessica realizes that her hidden talent is cooking potato soup from scratch! =D ..haha..  We decided (for unknown reasons) to make dinner for us and the rest of the family and it turned out really good.  It consisted of caesar salad, potato soup (mm.. HELLA good), chicken with mushrooms, and (for her and I) ice cream or (everyone else) blueberry pie.  What a meal, right?  Anyway, don't be jealous, it totally hit the spot and left everyone tired as hell.  ..or as she would say, "food coma."  Ok, so I just read the gf's site and realize there is a lot I neglected to write about in regards to our SF trip.  First of all, everyone who were supposed to show up and stay the night kinda cancelled last minute, so there we were with a room that had two beds and there were only two of us.  We had big plans to use them both as we were both  single , in search of some  honies , but for some reason that plan fell through? lol.  Although, the bed was put to use towards the very end of the stay, so HA, what am I complaining about. =P  Anyway, I'm really glad no one else ended up going.  It was nice and intimate and  perfect  for this lil vacation.  FRIDAY: Check in early.  Hotel charges us for the room at check in.  Leila goes, "eh?"  Ok buddy sure..  We get up to the room, rest, and (as usual) Jes knocks out for years and I sneak out to get us food.  First place I spot is a Chinese restaurant a block or so away. And me being the spacy person that I am sometimes order this package deal that comes with Kung Pao shrimp.  What's the problem?  She's allergic.. like r e a l l y allergic to peanuts.  Who knew that was in there?! Well apparently Lanie, since she's the one who informed me (w/out laughing at my ignorant ass FIRST of course..haha.)  K anyway, I make up for it and get another order (mushroom shrimp, oo score with the mushrooms! hah).  Later we head over to Castro after walking around Union Square a little.  And Leila discovers that yes, there is a difference between Muni and Bart, and just because it's underground doesn't automatically mean it's Bart.  I learn something new everyday.  At the Cafe, we can't shake this Italian man who spends the night telling us how beautiful we are and how he would love to cook for us (he's a chef that's been all around California but is presently at a restaurant in Burlingame).  Then at the end he asks me if he could kiss me, and I think 1.) you DO know I'm with this girl right? and 2.) you DO know this is a gay bar right?  He was so sweet, but sometimes the confidence guys have can be a little annoying.  And my response was?.. drum roll please..  NO  (in the nicest way possible, of course) ..sorry mister.  And what's up with straight guys at gay bars?  I have no clue.  So that was Friday.  SATURDAY: It's absolutely beautiful weather out.  We check out the SFMOMA and it takes my breath away.  I realize that being an artist and having my art viewed by the public is something I want to strive for.  A calling?  ..we'll see.  We walk our asses over to Chinatown and for the life of me I can't find the lychee candy that Lanie and I crrrrrave.  Oh well.  Kay calls and we hook up with her and Ruby back at the hotel.  I'm glad we got to hang out.  I love kickin it with old friends that you haven't seen/talked with in a while and pick up exactly where you left off years ago.  Like I told Kay, that's when you know they're keepers, and keepers are exactly what Kay and Ruby are. =)  Hook up with Cheryl later at Cioppino's (WAY later since she got HELLA lost =X) and indulge a craving for Italian food and Sangria. =D  Later in the night, it's Cherry bar and the Cafe (mentioned it earlier).  SUNDAY: Miss Jessica treats us to Macaroni Grill (her fav restaurant, and becoming mine too..) and it's mmmm mm good!  We head back to Menifee feeling a little more relaxed and ready to take on the world.  Don't you just love vacations, mini getaways to escape routine life.. I LOVE IT!  On the way home Cupid shoots us in the ass with premium arrows and the ride gets uncomfortably quiet, but then i hear her sing (ever so softly) and  ahhh everything's okay .. =)  ..so that's it, the trip in a nut shell.

      - I'm back from FRISKO.  BTW, all of you out there who have an appreciation for art (or an obsession with modern art, as i do) MUST check out the SF museum of modern art.  It freakin ROCKS, that's all I have to say.  I left the museum feeling motivated and driven, I haven't felt that inspired to create art in a really long time.  - Amber, if you're reading this, I will call you soon!!  It's just easier to update this thing because I never know what's going on in everyone's lives.  Sometimes, through no fault of our own of course, life bombards us with shit and time becomes rare and precious.  I never know when it's a good time to give that best friend (whom I KNOW I can always rely on) a ring..  - So.. the single life proves short-lived and I'm in for another adventure with yet another special someone.  Sometimes I feel like a floater.. floating in and out of people's lives.  Is that a bad thing?  Am I cursed to temporary happiness forever?  I just don't know.  The cynic in me wonders how long this one will last.  The rest of me looks forward to life with her in it, she inspires me.. especially with art (what would one expect from a fellow artist?).. it's great and she's  a breath of fresh air .  - My sister had a miscarriage. =(  I didn't know what to say.  I guess it would have been easy to give her the 'everything happens for a reason' thing, but sometimes I feel like that's such a cop-out thing to say.  Is that supposed to give comfort to someone?  I know, I know..  Hey, I'm all for looking at the bigger picture, but sometimes support is the best thing you can do for someone.  And with that, I hope she knows she can count on me to be there for her.  - Cherry bar with Chikun, Cheryl, Jes.. whack but cool anyway (The Cafe afterwards, packed and Leila tired.)  - ...and once again, Leila is brrrroke.  It's the price of having fun now and again, and worth it EVERY SINGLE TIME.   RANDOM THOUGHT FOR TODAY:  I HELLA want another tattoo.. the itch is becoming unbearable..

      Three words: Sisters are great.  Well especially when they bail you out during a time of deep despair.  My older sister, Lanie, lent me some money for the weekend.  AW!  Isn't she just the bomb ISH?!  And she's not exactly rollin in dough either.  I don't know if she decided to do it because she knew I was so desperate or if she knew that I was trying to make it a special trip for Jes and I, but whatever the reason, SHE ROCKS!  Seriously, it means/meant so much to me, I think I was even taken aback by her offer.  Man, there are times when you take family for granted, but ultimately, they will always be your rock.. the only people you can rely on for the rest of your life, through thick and thin.  I hope I mean the same to them.  Well, Kata hasn't been around lately nor have we really hung out as much, but I think moving out is the best thing for her.  Besides, family relationships tend to strengthen with distance and space, so I'm sure we'll be okay.    On another note, I'm about to leave for FRISKO--a little more stress-free than I would have been had Lanie not been so generous.  ::good sigh::  ..this is going to be fun. =)  Life is sweet..

      t h i s a d s u c k s a s s.    ooooooomyyyyyyyygoooooooosssssshhhhhhhh.  is all i have to say.  MAN, i wrote a HELLA LONG ASS POST last night, and the shit went wacko on me and  didn't post . now it's all gooooone. =(  so let's see how good my memory is.  i'll try and write everything i can remember...  it's saturday and i'm posting. that can only mean one thing.  yup,  she's in san diego  and i'm here in menifee.  geez, i miss that girl so much when we're apart...it's  crazy .  must still be honeymoon season. =P    so, what's been going on with leila...  i've been pretty caught up with school, school, jes, school, and the fam.  that's basically what my schedule is like.  the further along i get in these art classes, the more driven i am, so needless to say, i'm really  anxious to transfer , finish school, and either get on with my life or go back to school for some more! =P  i'm thinking about attending an art seminar at  UCLA .  it's an informative seminar that discusses the different art programs they offer at UCLA, the prospective jobs that are out there waiting for artists, and other miscellaneous issues like portfolio preparation, and the difference between attending universities, private colleges, and technical schools.  the only qualm i have is that it's $55 for a three hour meeting, and if you were in my shoes, that's NO chump change my friend! haha.  BUT, i think it's going to be more beneficial for me in the long run.  it will help me narrow down the schools i'm thinking about applying to.  i'm not sure how difficult it is to get into UCLA with an art major, but being that it's a UC and that it's in the LA area, i'm sure it is.  i'm not going to let that discourage me though; at this point, i have nothing to lose right?  i was even thinking about UC berkeley which i KNOW is an impossible college to get into (if you have my grades), well because my brother-in-law MIGHT have been able to get my foot in the door, but now i'm not so sure.  it just seems so far from family and... the move would suck... and... well there's another reason, but it's still too soon. ..but just know i'm thinking about it. lol.  we'll see though,  nothing is ever certain with me .   now the only thing left to do is prove to myself i'm university material.   i better not fuck up this semester !  if i do well, it'll be the first time in yeeeeeears that i do well two consecutive semesters in a row, maintaining above a 3.5 gpa, and NOT withdrawing from any classes.  woohoo! =D  craziness.  where has all the time gone?   since when was i 24 ?  i don't get it. lol.  well at least  i'm focused  now.  it's always better late than never, so don't listen to what anyone says.  the only real distraction i can think of is missing jessica.  i know, i know, it gets old.  i just miss her so much when we're apart (so much that i'd say this same sentence twice in one post).  when we're together, we don't even have to do anything special, but as long as she's with me i feel completely content (she might feel differently though, i'm sure she gets bored, hah.. sorry! =P) sometimes i wish we'd live closer together.  other times  i fantasize about us living together , but as desirable as that is, i'm not sure if that's the best thing right now.  for whatever reason, this inky dinky college over here is doing it for me as far as keeping my head screwed on straight, and she's just a year away from graduating, so she's doing her thing over there as well.  how about midway?  escondido??? hahaha.. i'm kidding, i'm kidding..  well maybe it's better, it keeps us on our toes, and keeps us from jumping into things too soon, if that's even possible with us. lol.  well, i'll just concentrate on getting a door, a door with a lock please. lol.  maybe  one day  though.  yeah, i'd like that if only because our place would look (aesthetically speaking)  tiiiight ! heheh.. ok i think that's it for now  random thought: baja fresh's bean and cheese with chicken and pinto beans served enchilado style minus the sour cream and pico de gallo plus the baja salsa  fkn kicks ass !  haha.  i love that place!  ok, over it! ;)  another random thought: ah dammits.  i know i had one last night, but for the life of me i cannot remember what the heck it was.  oh well, maybe it'll come to me later.  adios peoples!  OH i remember it...   lent is in full effect , what have  you  given up?  myself?  guess.  you'll never believe it. lol.

        ooo our president can suck my ass!!    i visited a friend's website today and read this banner:  "Which is worse? Screwing an intern or screwing the country?"  how true!  bush's intentions of amending the constitution so as to permanently ban same sex marriages makes absolutely no sense to me.  i have little tolerance for close-minded, ignorant people, but for the fucking president of the united states to be this way is just inexcusable.  all i have to say is, i didn't vote for him, and if he wins another term, i swear to buddha my ass is moving to another country.

      yo!    friday:   drive up to SD and make an appearance at the ever-so-popular-with-the-local-gay-homos poor excuse of a club:  bad kitty's.  but hey, i'm not hatin'.. it's the crowd that makes the party, too bad half of them are drama prone.  not bad.  i had fun, saw kata .. bought me a drink.. cheers.  dance with friends; this chick who swears starts drama (indirectly involving me), but whatever, i have no patience for immaturity these days.  saw cece; attempted to be a civil human being and say hi, but to no avail.  i've said it before and i say it again.. harboring ill-feelings for someone just makes you a miserable and bitter person inside, so grow up, let it go, and move on.  GEEZ!  there's so much more to life, and if that's something you're going to dwell on forever, then maybe you need re-evaluate your own life and what it may be lacking.  because really..  whatever drrrrrama you're holding on to is just an infinitesimal moment in this game of life, and do you REALLY want to waste so much energy resenting someone?  i don't get it.  and this one's for you mica.. =P : humans adapt and rationalize and that's what sets us apart from our fellow primates.  therefore, i WILL NOT accept the argument that "that's just the way [a person] she is."  I REFUSE!!! no one is permanently a certain way.  we have a lifetime of experiences that are constantly changing the way we act/think.  isn't that what it's all about?  learning, learning, learning???  haha ok.. i'm over it.  but like i said..  maybe not now, and that's why i'm dealing with it, but one day..   OH! and, jes added a line to her cingular acct because talking to me has proved detrimental to her financially (need i say more???).. lol yeah.  so anyway, unlimited m2m is back in effect for me.  which means, if you're with cingular, let me know so i can give you my number.  if not, haha.. sorry, call the house.  moving on..    saturday:   went to san pedro with jes.  saw a HS dance competition.  pretty impressive.  i found myself thinking (on several occassions)  'damn, these kids are just high school students???'   ...niiiice.  other than my ass and back hurting from the horrible seating in that small ass gym, i had a fun time! =P  oh and, found the drill girlies outfits and routines quite amusing.. i dunno why??? ..hehe..    sunday:   hmm.. what did i do sunday?  oh!  hung out with meeksalot.  gf had work allllll day.  ate arby's (YUUUUUMMMMMMM!)  had a long talk with mica.  same stuff.  we decided that sd folk are drama and we want to move away. lol.  ok that's sunday.  oo oo and gf let me play with her camera and take random pics all over her house.. haha.. fun!  which brings us to today.  that design project i mentioned earlier is kicking my A- us! ahhhh!  i'd cry about it, but i was already being a baby to jessica on the phone about it, so no need to vent some more. =P  it's a big fuckin pain in the ass.  'nough said. ha.  ::looks around:: maan, yo, my room is a mess A-GAIN.  i swear i can't keep this room clean for longer than a day.  how sad.   m u u u s  t   d o  l  a  u  n d ry!  it's because i have no clothes and therefore am constantly recycling my ish! =X  how sad again.    OK THE END.

      so i never got the opportunity to give you the full uncensored update, but i'm not really in the mood for organized thought.  therefore, you guys are just going to have to deal with what i write.. hah.  first and foremost: financial stress sucks fatty ass.  i've decided that worrying about money (or the lack there of) is just wasted energy that can be directed (positively) somewhere else.  i've fallen back on plan z, the very last of last alternatives.  upside?  clean slate.  and i  cannot wait  for that.  i've decided that i really need a door for my room.  i can't really concentrate when i'm in here, and that's an understatement.  ay.  no space, no privacy, no quietness--is that a word?  on top of it, parents buggin (indirectly), feelin the itch to move out and be on my own (so to speak) again, AND gf offered.  eeks, but i dunno about that one.  no money, too much pride. ..tempting though.  school is good.  who knew art was such an expensive passion?  constantly buying stuffs.. my room is looking like a mini art store.  psych is good, richard kandus is the most chill and down to earth professor i've ever had.  i dig him. =)  had a quiz in design that i was unaware of. =X  didn't do TOO hot, hopefully the project will make up for it.  it's a SUPER tedious project that requires a lot of tracing, precision, time, and lastly--patience.  we'll see.  i just noticed.. i'm in a blah mood right now, i don't know why.  man all my friends are so far away, what a saddening realization.  maybe it's cuz my room is a mess.  it's fucking with my room level and ultimately my mood. =P  for those of you who are sim fanatics like me, you'd think that last sentence was pretty funny.  hah.  for the rest of you.. uhh.. sorry. lol.  maybe i'm sleepy.  eeyah.. i'm gonna just call it a night.    [geez, not even two months.  is that a bad thing?  everyone knows me.  i freak out with i realize how attached i am.  thrown in the fact that it has only been a short while and it's all over.  i think needing someone is scarier than falling in love with her.  need develops out of love and therefore means that the love has reached a new level, where life would feel incomplete without it.  maybe that's an unsettling thought because i see myself in one big transition phase of my life and well who knows where the road will take me.  away from her?  maybe?  ..how vulnerable my heart feels.    ::sigh:: it's a ways away, i'll just cross that bridge when i get there.  in the meantime, i love her and crave her presence.]  and i'm sleeeeeeeeepy, so i'm just going to have to end this on that mushy note..haha.  deal with it. =P

      all i gotta say is ahhhhhhhhhh geeeeezz.  i don't get it.  do you ever find yourself so sure and confident about something one minute and the next minute completely vexed?  ::shrugs::    anyway, emmy's cute.  she's the cutest klepto i know.  she comes in here, grabs random stuff (she just walked outta my room with candles in hand) and makes her way back out into the living room.  she's in, she's out.. she's in, she's out..    hmm.. mica's on my mind.  i miss having her friendship.  i mean..  i know i still have it, in a sense, and i know it could never be what it was, in a sense, but it has sort of felt non-existent altogether for the past few weeks.  i think it has crossed my mind before, but i guess i keep trying to tell myself she's in that recovery stage and if I don't give her her space i'd just be making things more difficult in the long run.  the thought of being in her company is such a nice one, but when it comes down to it and we're sitting there in the same room or side by side, you can almost see the wall of tension between us and i don't know about her, but i know that i've come to ignore it or accept it?  ..but i do hope one day that wall will be gone and things will go back to feeling more natural or comfortable.  and since i know she's reading.. until that day.. i'll be here, and regardless of the trials and tribulations we face along the way, my friendship is something that she can always count on, cuz neither it nor i am going anywhere.    i wish i could say that this applies to everyone because at one point i think i believed that it did, but, once i open myself up wholeheartedly to someone, a part of them remains with me for the rest my life.  there's no taking back all the love that i gave and all the memories that we made.  where do we go from there? (from two people who were in love going back to being "just friends") is always the hardest question to answer.  and for the record i don't have one, but i just do what feels right to me, and what always feels right to me is cherishing and appreciating what i once shared with someone. no matter how deep within myself it's tucked away, it's always still there.  and that's why i can never harbor any ill-feelings towards anyone i've ever loved (or at least NOT for an indefinite amount of time).  and we all know who my "exception" is, and i'd be lying if i didn't say it hurts to know what she thinks of me now, but hey, we all see things a little differently.  maybe in her eyes, i  have  done the unthinkable and the unforgettable and therefore the unforgiveable.  anyway, it pains me to lose friendships but i've come to realize that life isn't perfect and that, as disheartening as the thought is, friendships  do  fade and sometimes the only thing left to do is let it go.  on the upside, because you know, there's always an upside, no matter what, nevermind the fact that the friendship is long gone (were it to come down to that), memories and impressions last a lifetime--and  that , no one can take away. =)      "Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future."

        I fell on my ASS on Sunday.    Haha, isn't that something?  It ranks as one of the most embarrassing things I've done in a while, but throw in the fact that I was drunk, and it takes away from the shock value.  So I guess it wasn't  that  bad.  Nevertheless, it was the funniest freakin thing, and it just HAD to be right in front of Lanie and Jessica.. haha.  And I'm sure I was falling slow enough that ONE of you guys coulda saved me!! eh-HEH =P  Anyway, damn that chair..  So moving along.. I had to recap real briefly on such a memorable moment like that one..hah.  I was thinking yesterday about whether or not I'd get a sleeve, or get a massive ink job on my back.  I mean, the only difference would be  location , but sometimes that makes  all  the difference.  What do you guys think?  It's just a random thought though, I know it's something I wouldn't end up doing (if doing at all) until a few months from now.. haha i wish!.. nah, a year or two sounds about right.  Btw, Jes and I are in love with Greg Horn's   Elektra  .  I advise everyone to check that chick out, comic or not,  SHE'S HOT ! =X hahaha.  Maybe I can have a her rendered in a popular Venus pose (like the  Birth of Venus ) and then that way have the hot chick AND the significance of my ruling planet ALL IN ONE!  oooo.. gotta keep that one in mind. =D  I just have to say that Heidi, Kristen, Ian, and kids rooooock.  They are such good peoples--thoughtful, considerate, kind, generous, fun.  ..AND they flew all this way just to see friends.  I mean really, we all want to be good friends and visit that one person who lives oh so far away, but how many of us actually go out and do it?  To set time aside like that is admirable, maybe it's because sometimes I think people are way too attached to their busy lives.  It's like, sometimes you just have to let it go and live a little.  Which brings me to say, I wanna go on that cruise!  Who's with me, who's with me???  (..gotta say it like Jerry in Jerry Mcguire..haha)  Hmm $1200 by June huh.  I guess we (you included ate lanie if you're serious about wanting to take that class with me) will have to see if that conflicts with our summer school schedule.    Damn, I lost two bets in only a couple days.  I'm losing my winning streak.  My memory fails me more and more and more.. ohhh noooo!  I hate to imagine how I'm going to be when I'm older.  Or maybe I'll be different and remember  everything  when I'm older.  Hm, now that would be an interesting question.  Would you prefer remembering things when you are younger or remembering them when you are older?  I'd have to go with the latter because at that point in your life, you'd have accomplished/experienced/gained so much that it'd just make too much sense.  How can you gain wisdom without reflecting on what brought it about in the first place?  Besides, we all have those falling-back-in-the-chair incidents when we were young that we wouldn't mind forgetting about.. hahaha.    Ok well, I just wanted to update this thing.  Maybe I'll do it again laters.  Til then..  Ciao!

      notice how I rarely post on the weekends??.. hm.. wonder why..    let's see, friday jes gets her first TATT woooohoooo!.. and I got to partake in the exciting moment.  ahh,   tattoos are great.   too bad not everyone thinks so. =P  yup and saturday the ITCH IS GONE.  that's right, you heard me, .. itch? what itch?  actually it hasn't really.  I'm already thinking of the sleeve (or partial sleeve) I'm going to get ONE DAY.  I definitely want some chick on there.. either a dope ass comic book chick or a beautifully rendered VENUS to add meaning or significance--but a hot one will do just fine. hahaha.  anyway, this weekend was cool.. chillin with the girlfriend again.. never gets old to me.  but today we agreed on an open relationship..hehehe.. (she's gonna DROP kick me when she reads this) ..so we'll see how that goes. you know what that means, if you're interested, by all means,   drop me a line  . HAH!  this weekend is LOVE DAY weekend.  I'm excited that it's going to be emmy's bday and a whole buncha peoples will be here.  well.. ok, maybe not a whole buncha peoples, but i'm looking forward to my uncle's cooking! =D  hopefully elman and joy won't flake since I didn't get the chance to see them today. =T  it occurred to me that I haven't really been single SINGLE for any valentine's days since.. ohh.. I was fifteen or so.  CRAZINESS isn't it???  lucky me?  i don't know.  anyway, I'm looking forward to spending some QT with my woman.. I think we're going to chill at her place.  Oh and I lost a bet so it looks like I'm going to be in charge of dinner.. coooooL ;)  ..but it doesn't really matter what we do, I enjoy her company regardless.    BTW, the orientation for the egg donation went GREAT.  Melodie, the director, ended up talking with me one-on-one since the others were running late, and she was really thorough.  I  do  have a couple of questions/concerns after the fact, but that's just because I think I was excited because 1.) the W hotel is a tiiiiight hotel--I'm going to stay here one day with the weekday gf ;) 2.) everything was sooo nice and I felt a little intimidated 3.) the more I thought about  why  I was there, the more anxious I was.  But that's okay because I can always email her with my concerns.  Anyway, who knew it was such a lengthy process???  First is the consultation (check), second is the psychological eval, third is the legal consultation, fourth is the medical examination, fifth is synchronization, and finally is the treatment (shots that I'm supposed to inject into myself).  Who cares, it's all worth it.  And like I said before, it started off as doing it just for the money, but the more I explain to people why I'm doing it, the more I realize that it's soooo much more than the deng money involved.  I honestly don't even think about the financial aspect anymore.. seriously!  ..and I NEED money too, so that must say something.  Ahh, the waiting game begins..  OK, well I should be calling it a night.  I missed tom's first class last week because I accidentally slept in.  ..don't want to get into that BAD habit again, so I'm going to play it safe.

      Hello purple peoples.  A day in the non-eventful life of a girl named Leila...  Hm, where to start.  Jes left this morning.  She surprised me on our one month by showing up unannounced.  It was the sweetest thing, she called me and got me to go outside to look for an atm card she supposedly lost in my car, and I go, only to find a rose petals on my hood and a single rose with a note which read... Well that's none of your business, but basically she was here and I was =O.  I would have been COMPLETELY surprised, but Bailey sort of blew her cover by telling me beforehand that her and Kawaii were coming that night, but I wasn't entirely sure (you know how kids are), so it was a surprise nevertheless.   I love her.  =)  We cooked dinner--pasta and chicken by yours truly, and yummmmy potato soup by the lady--had wine, and EVEN topped it all off with a little apple pie (minus the apples for me) a la mode.  Gosh, I love cooking and eating a home-cooked meal.  I'd prefer that over going out to eat--any day.  I would love to learn how to cook, and I mean knowing what spices go with what foods, how to make sauces from scratch, all the basic stuff you need to know...  Maybe one day when I'm settled down I'll take a couple  culinary classes .  That'd be so cool.  Of course that wouldn't happen for years and years, but I can totally see myself doing something like that.  I think I'd like to get my  teaching credentials  sometime this lifetime as well.  You just can't go wrong with something like that.  Teaching is a lifelong lesson in and of itself.  Besides, it's a way to have an impact on so many lives and the future that they hold.  Doesn't that seem so rewarding??  Just the thought makes me a little anxious.  I never thought I'd want to teach, but I thought about it today and realized that sometime down the line (not in the near future of course), it'd be something I'd want to try out.  Personally I think everyone should, but then again, nah, there are a lot of not-so-bright people out there.. Forget it. =P  Ahh it seems like I'm forever drawing.  I love it.  I figure, it's tedious work, but hey, I can only get better right?  I just hope I stick with it and don't get behind like I tend to do.  Come on self =P, you can do it.............    Aw Kawaii's on my bed.. chillin.. She might be a somewhat permanent roommie (until her mama finds another place) since her mommas landlord is being an ass and is making her get rid of the dog.  Sucker.  Oh well, I won't mind the company.  Don't worry, I'll take care of her >=) ...haha, no really... She's in good hands! =D    Let's see, what else...  Oh hey, I'm gonna go to an orientation on Saturday to get more information on  egg donation .  The more I think about it, the more I want to do it, but I don't wanna get my hopes up in case I don't meet the requirements for any reason.  I don't know, I admit, my initial curiosity mainly concerned the financial aspect of it, but now, I just think about the couple I'd be helping out, and it just seems like such a noble thing to do...more rewarding than any sum of money they offer the donor.  Besides, it's not like I'm trying/wanting to bring a new life into the world anytime soon, might as well help two people who  do .  I'm pretty psyched. =D  Stitch is growing so fast.  He's the cutest black lab puppy EVER!  Too bad I don't have a pic to upload onto this thing, maybe next time.  The past few mornings I've been waking up to the two of them (Kawaii and Stitch) sleeping side by side at the foot of my bed.. and it's awww cute..   Looks like I've just gained two new roommies..  woohoo!  yep.. They love me! ::winks:: lol.

      awww.. i just had a long ass post.. and that ish dista-ma-peared.  hm, k.. i started with..  today i was woken up by the cutest thing!.. someone licking my ears, neck, face and chewing on my hair.. NO! it wasn't jessica! hahaha.. it was stitch!  he escaped from confinement by climbing over the fence (again) and sought refuge in my bedroom, more specifically in my bed, cuddled up against me.  i think he got frustrated because he couldn't wake me up, but well, who can?!  so he just nuzzled his little head right up against my neck and fell asleep.  say it with me: (one, two, three..) "awwwwww... cute!!"  yep, he loves me.  ::big grin::  yesterday we played trivial pursuit--the pop culture edition.  and of course, i lost, but what's new, i always lose in that game.  i ate way too much food and passed the funk outs, more than i should have and more than i have in a looooong loooooooong time, nor do i care to eat that much in the near or far future either.  haha.. i was/am traumatized.  so mica, i apologize for sleeping for so long while you were here, but hey at least you got to spend some QT with the fam.  they miss you, you know.  and thanks for staying the night.. against your will. lol.  you know it's all love and we just didn't want you to hit those roads under such shitty driving conditions.  anyway, don't be mad! =)  i think in my post i also said something about painting being an intimidating class because there are so many people in that class that have been painting for years and have already developed their own style.  ..then there's me.  lol.  but i came to the realization that everyone's gotta start somewhere, and i'm just one of those 'late-starters'   hey, it works for me.  ..baby steps. =P  oh and my room is cluttered and it's increasing my level of anxiety.. haha.  my art stuffs is everywhere! i need to do something with it.. hmm, what to do, what to do.. moving along..  [warning: for all you haters out there, stop right here.  that yucky love stuff is about to be upon you.]  hoody hoo!   happy anniversary   to me!!  i've been lucky enough to find love time and time again through it all (whatever  it  may be, in this case, an extremely complicated love triangle) but there's just something that distinguishes this one from the rest.  is it because the relationship i came out of lasted so long?  is it because we share the same passions?  is it because i'm just trippin and it's only been a month, so DUH of course it'd seem different?!   is it because she's younger than i'm used to them being?  haha, i just thought i'd throw that one in.  i don't know.  the only thing i'm certain of is the emotional intensity that i feel when i'm around her.  it must be love right?  will it fade?  who knows..  honestly, i'm not concerned with that right now.  i feel like i'm on top of the universe and no one can touch me; she makes me feel this way, and until god  herself tells me to wake the fuck up, that's where i'll remain.  i feel alive, i feel capable, and i feel loved, what more can i ask for?    it's all an illusion  --this place where love has brought me, i know, but then i think...       what in life isn't?......................

          HAPPY BIRTHDAY ATE LANIE!        (now everyone go to lanie's site and wish her a happy birthday! =P)   Good morning! I woke up half asleep, delirious, confused, the sound of the house alarm blaring in my ears, the sight of jessica almost frantic, sharing the same confusion on her face, her mouth moving, but unable to comprehend what the heck it was that she was saying. haha. Turns out Ed set the alarm and it went off the instant she opened the door, and when she came into the room to wake me up, for some reason I thought she was asking me if I forgot to set my phone alarm (that she was using to wake her up), so I was like.. "huh? did I forget??" LOL but I guess it's just one of those things you have to be there for.   I've decided to post while I wait for my leftovers to de-heat (my alternative word for cool-down. why can't you deheat if you can defrost?). MMmmmm, macaroni grill; the restaurant that was two months ago completely unknown to me, now quickly becoming a favorite. Three words (two if you hyphenate): Twice Baked Lasagna.    HITS THE SPOT    every time! =D So, we celebrated Lanie's 27th birthday last night here, compliments of the ever-generous, sweetheart of a girlfriend, Miss Jessica Dagum...dag-uhm? lol. And I, being the hopeless occasional toper that I am, provided for the Asti champagne..ahh yes.   Saturday night we hooked up with Gregggerrrz and his woman. They are too cute of a couple, I love hanging out with them. If you're reading this Greg, I had fun and thanks for the   SANGRIA  ! I hear it made Jessica's temperature rise.. =X ..haha. Afterwards we crashed a party and hooked up with Jes' friends, Ven and Julius. FUNNY FUNNY peoples. Then, we head for a local Denny's but not before she locks her keys in her car at the gas station (long story, but basically she went out to stop me from paying and it slipped her mind that her keys were in the car and she has that auto-alarm thing on it) and are surrounded by a butt loada homos (and I use the term playfully) and lesbos. FUN. Then we head home and .. and .. and .. then crash at about 6am or so wake up and .. and .. and watch the superbowl. and UNFORTUNATELY for me,   I MISSED JANET'S EXPOSED BOOB  . As gf would say,   boo!     And now it's Monday morning, another week of separation. (Where did the time go???) Ay. Hey btw, tomorrow's my ONE MONTH anniversary (I know, it's   ONLY BEEN A MONTH  ), so don't forget to wish me a happy one. haha. Okay, it's about that time that I get ready for class. My new week's resolution is to work out. Someone motivate me!!! haha.. peace! ::pulls a jessica on drama night:: whuuh, huh? huh? whaaa? what are you talking about? LOL.

      i'm bored.  the gf is lying right next to me, out cold.  i'd wake her up but i'm notorious for waking gfs up, so this time i'll let it slide i guess. lol.  she whines when i wake her up but then when she ends up knocking out for a couple hours it's like "aw, why didn't you wake me up???"  see, i can't win. ::shrugs::  hm, what to do, what to do.  i'm excited for these next few days.  it'll be nice on friday seeing the people i haven't seen in so long.  i'm sure once we're all there and the initial post-drama uneasiness passes, everyone will be back to normal again without skipping a beat.  of course this applies to everyone with the exception of cece and i, kata and jes, and of course cece and greg.  hahaha.  that last one i just threw in for shits and giggles.  that still cracks me up to this day.  HAH.  well and this is of course, assuming that cece stops acting like a child and attends mica's dinner, if only for her sake.  she can hate me if she wants, but why does anyone else have to suffer?  oh well, that's cece i guess.  something about her i never have and will never understand.  she just can't let things go.  i remember that being an issue when we were together too.  never dropping shit; the same stuff always being brought up when we fought.  anyway, go figure.  on saturday jes and i are going to watch varekai.  yay!  and it's going to be LIVE! even better!  i remember when mica brought a video of cirque du soleil (sp?) when we all lived at 297 and i had never even heard of them.  now two years later, or is it three??, i'm finally able to watch it live.  it's kinda exciting too because we're going to get dressed up for once.  i was telling jes last night that i like how we're both faaaar from being "girly" and yet we are both capable of doing so and on occasion don't even mind it.  aw, if i start then i'm going to flake as far as wearing a dress goes, boo!  oo but she's going to be a hoochie mama, i mean, a sexy mama on saturday.  i can't wait! haha.  ::thinks ahead:: ohhhh yeah, baby! ::insert cheesy AOL face::  aw, to switch the mood a little.. greg leaves next week.  i'm going to miss my elman.  he and i click on so many levels, it's amazing how we didn't hook up.  different temperaments i guess. haha.  he and i have had our fair share of SHIT, but many many good times.  and in these past several months we've started to talk more, are back in each other's lives and are constantly 'there' for each other, and then now i'm going to have to adjust-- again.  geez, i love chatting with the boy.  we can talk about everything and nothing in one conversation and it's never uncomfortable.  i don't think there are enough hours in the day for us to talk.  aww.. greg!  well, we'll see where the future takes us, hopefully not any further than the distance that's been between us so far.  watch him get stationed in hawaii or something.. noooooo! lol.  my phone bill would suck!!  i just have to say, i'm SUPER, i mean HELLA proud of the boy, he will become anything and anyone he wants.  he's just that type of person.  he gets what he wants (well.. usually.. =P )  i have no doubt in my mind that he'll go to that school, kick major freakin butt, and be the freak who jumps outta the helos.  yeah, i think he's an adrenaline junkie too.. =P  well my partner in crime, i wish you luck in nc, but i know luck will have nothing to do with it when you succeed.  i love you and you mean so much to me.  don't go anywhere far!  ooookay enough sappiness.. peace!p.s. hit jes up for that pic. haha.  maybe it'll be a graduation present when you get back.  let it motivate you.  HAHAHA.

      omgoodness.  just took a runny run with the doggie dogs and the bruddah, and *whew* what a run it was.  as we approached the house it was pretty evident that even kawaii and stitch were beat because they practically pulled us through the door.  i thought i was either going to faint due to the lack of brain to my oxygen (for my gf, that was intentional. lol.) or my head was going to explode because of all the pressure.  luckily, i made my way to the bathroom and splashed the heezy outta my face with cold water.  and i thought i was in good shape, or at least getting there. lol.  i thought wrong! haha..  on that same note, i love that i'm becoming more physically active.  it makes me feel so much healthier and so much less lethargic.  in addition, i think it's beneficial to my state of mind.  when i sit around and do nothing, i dwell on the most petty things going on in my life, and it's so much better to be proactive than to mope around and feel sorry for myself or others.  know what i'm sayin?  anyway, so be proud.  it's been a while.  AND another PLUS is that i don't look so bleh for the summer.  you know me, outta control self-conscious. yeah, yeah, yeah..  i am and there's nothing anyone can do about it. lol.  now just take away my gosh deng incessant hair growth and you've got a more confident leila.  don't hold your breath cuz i'm not. ha.  so i was thinking today--a seemingly random thought now, but i'm sure at the time it was in relevance to something else--that I THINK the majority of gaining wisdom is applying your knowledge and experience through understanding, in such a way that you are aware of the diversity of every individual and situation and are reluctant to pass judgement.  I THINK people who practice tolerance are imperative members in a diverse society, but those who practice acceptance are the admirable, invaluable ones.  if you're the more religious type, then you might interpret it like this: God is out 'there' and SHE/HE is overlooking every little detail of life, even when it's something simple like sitting in traffic for two hours.   maybe it's because I really do BELIEVE that life is filled with too many coincidences for events and occurances to NOT happen for a reason.  and believing this brings forth so much peace of mind because then, that bill or bills or relationship or friendship or fight or exam or whatever it was you were so distraught over doesn't seem as important.   maybe  there was a lesson to be learned by the experience.   maybe  you were meant to fail the test in order to become more studious.   maybe  you weren't meant to be with that person but instead to help each other grow into more beautiful people.   maybe  old friendships will be rekindled down the line and you will cherish it more because it was once lost.   maybe  that two hour traffic jam you were in saved more lives in the long run.  is this too much?  am i on to something or am i just an admirer of passivity?  at first glance it does seem like the easier thing to do, but how many times have we passed judgment on, criticized, complained about, made fun of, etc, etc--anything or anyone?  a lot.  passivity is an art.  haha i'm sure very few of you would agree.  hm, metacognition in full effect.  let me just emphasize that these are random, not-well-thought-out presuppositions and i neither assume i'm right nor do i expect anyone to agree with what i've said.  well, before i lose you all (and myself) completely let me just end it here.  ::ended::  =)    words to come soon...

      never have i seen so many lovely ladies with beautiful bodies, wearing so little clothing,  conglomerated by the pool.  did i mention there were practically no men?  man, it was quite the experience.  not only was the atmosphere soooo comfortable, everyone was so nice to each other (saying hi to and conversating with random strangers in passing).  i think what did it for me was that for once, i could be as affectionate as i wanted with jes and no one gave a fuck.  things heterosexuals take for granted.  and there were no obnoxious males getting off on it, not that that's a bad thing sometimes, but other times it's just annoying, know what i'm sayin'??  needless to say, i had a good ass time.  next year we're planning some shit cuz this time i want my own room! =D  only downfall to the experience aside from all the drama (not worried cuz it didn't involve me--well for the most part. lol.) were the insane prices of not only the drinks, but the events.  who charges people to cram into the pool area and listen to AIIGHT music anyway?  but hey, they can, and us womens will pay to see girlies half nekked, so i guess whatever goes right?? haha.  oo speaking of half nekked, there was this beautiful lita-lookalike (according to jes, but i agree) chick who frickin worked it like nothing else.  i was mesmerized.  then jessica was over it and so i had to be too. hahaha. 0=)  amber and i were stunned though. =X  a chain of events are going to keep me busy the next couple weeks, but i'll try and update this thing.  if not, happy spring break to me!  and my apologies (though i'm sure you guys don't mind) for not posting any words, guess you're going to have to put your vocab learning experience on hold.  for now anyway..  peace outties.

      it's about that time.      friday  : hung out with greg, joy, jameson, jean, vince, and DOH! I forgot her name, but vince's girlfriend.  we went bowling and leila got her ass beat both games.  oo and my gf kicked greg's butt the first game..woohoo!  seeing that made me get over my losses.  haha.  afterward we played quite possibly the most intense game of air hockey of my life, and yup, you guessed it, i lossed again.  damn you jessica!  grrrrr!  i demand a rematch!  lol.  ok, so i'm the competitive type, so sue me.  i love it how she doesn't rub it in my face, but she has this smirk that is almost worse as if it said 'like that, like that? i won't boast about my win, but me smiling at your defeat is enough said.'  yup, that's what her look says alright.  ahh, that was fun i admit.  later that night we checked out bad kitty's and jes was faaaded.  it was fun because i was actually NOT fucked up, so for once, i remember dancing with the girl.  =X  hehe.    saturday  : went to MS walk.  cheated on the walk.  got called cheaters. haha.  disappointed because there was no pizza hut. >=\  rode with mica and kathleen.  it was nice to hang out, even for a little bit.  things are still kinda fuzzy we her and i, but we have a lifetime to recover, so i have no worries.  that's the good thing about family.  you can't get rid of them, even if you tried, so the only thing to do is forgive, forget, and keep on loving them.  it's great.  one day when i get married, i hope i see my relationship with 'her' like that.  anyway, afterwards i pass out on the car ride home and then mica and i go to jes' party.  aw mica is all i have to say. =(  geez.  i feel like we've taken two steps back, but then i realize, it's for the best, so that's what we're going to do.  i kind of feel like i'm to blame because i push for a friendship at the level it can't be at right now, and so that's what happens, the healing process gets all fucked up.  i think it's because a lot of times i feel like all i have is her and greg (aside from my sister and my gf), so i try to patch things up and have them back to the way they were, as far as how close we were.  i feel so helpless, but i know that nothing i can say could make things any better for her.  i do care about her so much though, and that's why it's frustrating for me to see/hear her hurt so much.  blah.  time heals, so that's what i'm counting on.  this time i'll be more patient.  again, i'm not going anywhere, so i'll be here..  anyway, the rest of the night was fun.  burm? berm?  doh, i don't know how to spell it, but her and nellie are cuuuute together!  it was a nice change actually acting like a couple in front of people unlike ronnie's party where it felt like we were only there as friends or something.  kinda glad cece didn't come.  but shhh don't tell her that. lol.  i have to admit, at first i was thinking 'man, this really isn't my crowd', but then after a couple of drinks, loosening up, and talking with random people, i got over it and it really wasn't that bad.  i think i'm slowly approaching that age or phase in my life where these parties just aren't my thing anymore, but nevertheless every now and again it's fun, and this party was definitely one of those times.     sunday  : walk on the beach.  la jolla weather sucks, but it was still nice.  very chill.  tried to outrun water but it was too fast.  ..that and we were laughing hysterically.  starving.  ate at claim jumper.  food was OK still not as good as they used to be since they got rid of their pork ribs; next time will be tony roma's.  one day.  afterwards i was mad sleepy, so sleepy that i didn't want to do anything.  so i didn't, got home and knocked out.  lol. and that's my weekend in a nutshell.    ......................................................      [words for your mother]       personable   (PUR-suh-nuh-buul): attractive, pleasing in appearance, handsome, comely, fair, presentable  [in recent years,  personable  has come to be used to mean having a nice personality.  you should avoid using the word in that way.  the words sociable, affable, and amiable already suggest people who are friendly, pleasant and approachable.  reserve  personable  for someone who is either attractive in appearance or attractive both in appearance and personality.]    resolute  (REZ-uh-loot): firmly determined or settled, resolved, having a set opinion or purpose, steadfast, unwavering, persevering.   [ANT: irresolute, unsteady, vascillating (VAS-i-lay-ting)]    supposition  (SUHP-uh- ZISH -in): an assumption, theory, hypothesis  [hypothesis is a preliminary or incomplete theory based on insufficient evidence; a conjecture is an assumption based on so little evidence that it is merely an educated guess; a  supposition  may be based on ample evidence or no evidence at all, and may be either sensible or irrational.]    arbitrary  ( AHR -bi-TRAIR-ee  or  -TRER-ee): unreasoned, based on personal feelings or preferences rather than on reason, logic, or law : "an arbitrary price for a product is not necessarily a fair price"; "his arbitrary decisions have cost the company a lot of money." [ arbitrary  has two other useful meanings.  it may mean determined or arrived at in a random or illogical manner.  it may also mean exercising unrestrained or absolute power.]    monotonous  (muh-NAHT-uh-nus): lacking variety, tediously uniform, unvarying and dull.    i'm officially missing her.  ridiculous and pathetic ain't it? =T

      woohoo!  guess what.  so i talked with my counselor, who was extremely nice and helpful btw, and technically, i only have  three more classes  to take before i'm  done with  this  IGETC  stuff and can apply to a university.  who'da thunk it?!  ok, actually, i already knew that, but going to her office and hearing her say it and me see it for myself was kinda cool. =P  only thing..  my years of lounging and having too much fun have taken it's toll; my  gpa sucks  ass.  that would be the only thing standing between me and the four year university of my choice.  bleh.  well i'm not going to get down.  i'm gonna try and kick ass this semester and this summer, and we'll see how my gpa is then.  because of budget cuts, the UCs aren't accpeting students during the spring or winter, so if i want to attend college next fall, i'm going to have to  apply this november .  i'm a little  apprehensive  because, well, my fear of  rejection  thing, but you know what, screw it, we all get rejected sometime or another.  i'll just keep going to community college til i get in.. haha.. deng that might take forever. hmm..  anyway, so that's pretty good news.  the gf is now officially on spring break.  woohoo for her!  yeah, it kinda sucks that our breaks don't coincide with one another, but i guess you can't have it all.  i'm glad she's going back home for a few days, i'd miss my family if i were away from them as much as she is, especially the kids.  i'm going to miss her though.  hm, speaking of spring breaks, i wonder what to do for mine.  i'll probably just chill at jessica's house and  watch her  walk around in nothing but  her pasties .  oooo.  hahaha.  i actually wanna do something, but the powers that be (i.e. money) are preventing me from doing so.  oh well, my time to venture out will come soon enough.  in the meantime, my ass is staying LOCAL.  ha.  i'm thinking about  finding a job .  gosh, it always fucks up my school though.  i think i have a problem with time management.  or maybe it IS because i have phases of  extreme indolence  when everything goes to shit and i don't do anything about it.  geez, that'd be sad.  i hope that's not true.  and if it was, i hope that's not how i am now.  this weekend should be fun.  we might go bowling with mr. greg monera and co.  and on saturday is a bring-on-spring (break) celebration at jes', so that should be fun.  haven't consumed my usual dose of  liquor  since we've been together.  isn't that weird?  from someone who used to be ALL ABOUT IT, to well.. being a person who RARELY craves/drinks alcohol; it's quite a change.  hm, maybe it's because i'm more focused at school.  maybe i just  don't feel the need anymore .  ::shrugs::  ok this is random, but who thinks  bondage  is "freaky"?  i had a conversation with a friend whom i'm sure all of you could guess, but anyway, i said it wasn't.  he said it could be.  well, by my definition, "freaky" is  too much for leila .  so i guess that's not too much for me.  haha.  wait, did i just disclose something??  HAH.  ok, i think that's it for now peoples.  i'm going to find something to eat.  ta-taaa!

      ::britney's toxic song playing in the background::  i don't understand what she was thinking when she ok'd the video.  totally killed the song when i saw it.  boo to you whomever thought it up. lol.  k anyway.    deng my neck hurts.  someone come over and give me a massage already! geez. ::winks::  i have an appt to see a counselor tomorrow.  kinda excited, kinda scared.  how about if she tells me something tragic like i'm going to have to retake a billion classes or i'm over units or my grade sucks so i should just get over trying to transfer. lol.  ok, so maybe i'm overdoing it, but hey, you never know.  (haha! i just heard lanie say stitch--the dog--tripped.  how funny! is that possible??)  i want to get out of this school and move on and move out too.  i think i've reached another phase in my life where i want my own place again.  you all know me, it happens every now and again.  i know, i know, get a job.  rrrrrright.  i honestly don't mind living with the family, it's just.. not them, it's me. lol.  doesn't it sound like a lame break up?  no rush is right, i don't think i'm going anywhere anytime soon.  i should go move into those apts right by the school.  then i can walk my lazy ass to school instead of driving.  oo and i'd save on gas money.  lovely.  haha somehow i don't think that's a very practical solution.  sounds good though.  new apts are always fun. =P  ay jessica.  i love that girl.  i try not to talk about her as much because i know those of you that read this get tired of it.  sometimes i can't help it though.  besides, it's my blog and i can say what i want.  =D  haha.  i'm kidding sheesh.  call it  good   venting.   she's motivated.  she has dreams and is driven to make them come true.  when something isn't right, she has the courage to step up.  (watch out for her bark, but her bite is no better! lol my dresser can testify to this. lol.)  she meets me half-way and then some.  she isn't afraid to say what she feels.  she's an ardent lover and lover of art.  she has a fierce, uninhibited side that shows itself every now and again and leaves me speechless every time.  her subtle actions, gestures, expressions, and tones pull me in and i find myself so hopelessly in love.  of course i am, or why would i talk about her like this?  and why would i want to spend so much time on the phone when i don't even really like talking on the phone.  or being online (emphasis on "LINE").  any form of communication is what i settle for, as long as it's with her.  what a strong feeling.  i wonder if it's a good thing.  i mean, everyone knows how great it is to be in love, but it's such a huge distraction too.  my world freezes when i'm with her while the rest of the world goes on turning; tragedy strikes, people are stressed, deadlines approach.  but it doesn't matter.  i stand unaffected because it all seems so negligible.  that can't be good, can it?  then again, maybe it's a perspective that more people should share.  then we wouldn't stress over the trivial and material shit that gets in the way of living life to its fullest.  no?  hm.  anyway, i'm done, i just wanted share what's been in my head.  on an entirely different subject, i made a painting using sumi brushes and ink wash in class today.  it was really fun and exciting.  and i say that with no hint of sarcasm whatsoever.  i wish they offered an asian art studio class, that'd be tiiiiight!  anyway, i'd like to pursue this medium someday, it's so simple it's fascinating.  i actually think i'm getting sleepy, so that's it for me.  i'm getting old. =P  peace out purple peoples.

      quick update.  yesterday, bored out of my mind.  it was nice though.  i went outside in the backyard, hung out with the doggies, lay in the hammock.  nostalgic.  my dad used to do that a lot.  i heard somewhere that two hrs of direct sunlight is recommended.  hm, wonder if it's true.  regardless, there's something about the sun hitting my face that leaves me feeling serene yet aware.  every sound outside, whether it be the lawnmower (as obnoxious as it usually is) or the kids next door jumping on their trampoline while simultaneously singing along to a popular song (it sounded familiar to me, i think it was a maroon five song, but i'm not entirely sure), it was unusually enjoyable.  anyway, i have to cut my post short because an exam awaits me.  laters people.  here's one word you should all know:  ALOOF (uh-loof): apart, at a distance, removed, withdrawn, not wishing to speak or associate with others (synonymns include unsympathetic, unapproachable, standoffish, and indifferent)

      hakay, it's the routine end-of-the-weekend, beginning-of-the-week update.  exciting isn't it?  let's begin with thursday.  it started off kinda blah, littlest of little tiffs with the gf.  those always suck.  distance definitely takes its toll.  sometimes we'd like to be 'there' for each other a lot more than it allows us to be, but luckily it's far from getting us down.  sometimes i feel so helpless.  it's only been a couple months though, so we'll see.. everyone knows resent long distance relationships at all costs, but this one's not THAT bad?  lol, i'll just keep telling myself that.  like i said, we'll see.    meeks swoops me and we head over to lb to get her ah-brows threaded.  on the way there, decide to be adventurous and take a path not taken before.. the seventy somethin or other that connects the 15 and the 215.  it turns out not to be so adventurous after all because we remember taking that route to the outlets waaaay back when the idea of us moving was just that, an idea.  now look at us, all settled in, with no money to spare. haha.  it's okay though, the one important reason we bought it is about to be in full effect once again.  that's right folks, the clouds have gone, the rain has ceased, and warm weather is about to be upon us.  that means sunny skies, 100 degree heat, and refreshing POOL for days!!!  ooo fun.......  oh, but i digress..  as i was saying, we head up to LB, she gets threaded, we decide to eat where a kid can be a kid.. mmmm pizza. =)  and we make a bet on that one game where you have to drive the steering wheel to get the ball down the barrier-less, curvy platform to the hole at its end.  i almost lost because she made one in (best out of five), then on my last turn, BAM the ball practically jumps in there.  we tie and it voids the bet.  ::shrugs::  hit up the mall real quick to pass time then greg calls and we meet him at his pad.  there we watch the top 100 celebrity disputes (or some shit like that) and talk about sex, sex, sex, touched on politics, then back to sex, sex, and more sex.  what a lovely topic.  he shed some insight, as did we.  it was fun. haha.  ..pull hair back, slap ass, and say "flip over, bitch!"  k. got it.  it was mad chill and we didn't really do shit, but i really enjoyed it.  you know you're amongst good people when the only entertainment you need is each other and good conversation, nothing else.  mad love.  k so.. that's thursday.  friday i head up to san diego to hang out with jes.  while she was at practice, i hung out with mica again.  it's nice to be in her company and not have things be awkward like they were for such a long time.  i remember why it was i fell in love with her.  she always treated me so good.  though we lost the relationship aspect, i'm thankful of what we have now and i hope this time it lasts.  the rollercoaster of a relationship we had was getting frustrating and confusing, for both of us i'm sure.  now things seem different, so i'm glad.  i know it seems a little odd to retain such a good friendship with an "ex", but fuck the labels, i was never about them anyway.  moving along... one word: boba. mmmm.  good ish.  went back to jes' and hung out for a bit.  you would think that it would be way uncomfortable for the three of us to hang out, but it's not that bad.  i wonder what all the hooplah is about.  i said it once, and i'll say it again: people swear.  we were debating on going to bad kitty's that night, but didn't want to stir up trouble.  damn the junior high kids.    saturday, checked out a dance comp in torrance with jes, but not before we had our first fight.  ay girls. lol.  we concluded we needed to work on the communication thing.  anyhoo,  i told jes and mica that watching these comps make me wish i paid more attn to them while i was in high school.  i never realized the talent some of these kids possess.  it's pretty admirable.  in high school, everything was clique-ish--which is expected; there were the athletes, asb peeps, drill team, band, journalism, yearbook, cheerleaders, and masterpiece (then a billion other clubs that seemed to segregate students more than integrate, but that's just my own opinion).  well i was part of the athlete/yearbook/journalism clique, and once you were in there, you, like everyone else, developed biases.  you got to love high school, though it resembled a complex, confusing, and frustrating social problem on many days, the interactions you have with teachers, peers, and friends, and the relationships you develop at that level and in that environment never seem more important and more meaningful than during that time in your life.  agree?  no?  ok, maybe it's just me.  anyway, we hook up with greg later and eat some philly cheesesteaks while watching the top 100 hottest hotties (or some shit like that).  i forgot who it all came down to, but i don't remember being too impressed.  i agree with his co-worker, i could actually feel my IQ start to decrease.  why do i always get sucked in to watching shows like that?  i know, because i only watch tv with other people, and those shows are good ice-breaker shows.  ahh, makes sense now.  i love greg.  he freakin rocks.  i wish i had more people like him in my life, but then again, nah.. then i wouldn't appreciate him as much. hah.  i guess it's all you then buddy.   and by the way, you're the only straight guy that can check out her uhh.. her.. necklace.. yeah, her necklace and get away with it.  like that, like that?!?  all mine, baby!  haha!  feel special?  hey babe, do you feel exploited?  hahaha.  oo i can make some money! >=) LOL! i'm soooo kidding.. you swear!!!  always respect a lady. ;)  that brings us to..  hm, what does that bring us to?  oh oh, before i forget.  on.. uhhh.. wednesday?  yeah, wednesday when jes and i were browsing the video cameras at best buy, we were confronted by a strange man who basically gave us his card and told us to give him a call if we were interested in getting into "the business" and would like to start up a website.  wtf?!?  that's a first! hahaha..  should we be flattered or something?  i dunno.  oh okay, so that brings us to sunday.  oh wait, saturday afternoon on our way home we make an unexpected stop at san onofre state beach?  actually, i forget what beach it was, but it was a state beach. lol.  and we saw a skunk up close and personal.  good thing we were in the car.  whew.  when jes was done resting we headed back to sd.  k, NOW it's sunday.  jes worked.  beautiful day.  hung out with mica.  did hw.  ate pizza.  cinnasticks rock.  rough night.  i need a mirror.  i want to watch a movie.  suzie and mark come home.  just in time?  or not?  hm, we'll never know.  and i love, i love, i love to love her.  ay, here's to another few days apart..

      and here i am by myself with a bowl of chef boyardee's ravioli and rice.  that's right, i said rice!  and what of it??  it's just like spaghetti-o's and rice.  don't TELL ME you've never had that either??  haha.  weird?  you're weird!  i love having imaginary conversations.  so anyway..   i'm allllll byyyy myyyyyself (don't wanna be)...   haha shit, that goes back to me and cece days, oh my.  i think i have alone issues.  i'm feeling kinda lonely here.  well, maybe it's because i'm used to the kids yelling, either that or being yelled at. lol.  or maybe it's because we're apart.  or maybe it's just because i want some company dammit! hm.  funny because i really want a place of my own.  i think that'd be different though.  my space.  ah yes.  let's see, i finally scheduled an appt with a counselor.  we'll see how that goes.  get me outtttta community college!  please!  omgosh.  everyone needs to  abstain from sex  because when you DO get it on, it (without a doubt) considerably enhances the intensity level.  too much info??  hahaha.  ok i'll stop.  hey, it was just a suggestion.  ok fellow learning enthusiasts, here are the first few words.  you may already know them, in fact i'm sure you'll know a lot, but we're working our way up, so bear with me.  mica, i'm sure you'll remember a lot of these, or at least you better!! =P    [WORDS to your mother]      ostensible  (ah-STEN-si-bul): apparent, appearing or seeming to be true, professed or declared as true without being demonstrated or proved.   (more difficult synonyms: plausible (PLAW-zi-bul) and specious (SPEE-shus); specious has the negative suggestion of using deception to make something false appear true.   ostensible  is used often in opposition to real or actual.)    digress  (di-GRES or dy-GRES): to wander, stray from the point, ramble, deviate, go off in another direction.

(synonyms include straightforwardness, outspokenness, forthrightness, and ingenuousness.)    morose  (muh-ROHS): gloomy, moody, glum, grumpy, ill-tempered, depressed.

      good morning.  are you bored?  nothing to do?  curious?  miss me?  is that why you're reading?  why thanks, i'm flattered you care.  or wait, are you here to pry or judge or post hate tags?  haha, either way, that STILL shows you care, so HA!  anyway, i've decided to post a few words every now and again to aid in our quest for a powerful and extensive lexicon.  sound good?  i've always been fascinated by people who can speak--intelligibly, and since i feel like my vocabulary isn't quite up to par, maybe doing this every post i make will keep the learning experience more consistent.  yes?  besides, this president's term, and realizing his ignorance clearly by his inability to articulate, alone inspires me.  well, i was going to post some now, but it seems i've run out of time.  eeks.  gotta jet, school awaits me.  say good luck on your quiz.  thanks.

      oh my. what a day.  last night was pretty bad, this morning too.  i was about to post a conversation that caused a lot of people involved a lot of heartache and anger, but then i thought to myself.. publicly humiliating anyone, especially family, is never something people want to see.  not only are you hurting them, but you're making yourself look like an ass too.  i hate fighting with family, especially sisters.  i think i get so upset because i love them so much, and there was one point in my life where i felt like i had lost them and i hated it.  so now, anytime i feel threatened, i flip out.  in other words, sorry for my last post.  emotions get the best of me sometimes.  things are somewhat resolved now, talking talking talking always helps.  for those of you non-talkers out there, remember that!  TALKING ALWAYS HELPS!  i am the strongest advocate of open communication--no holds barred.  it's the answer to everything, trust me.  i guess of course unless you're cece and you insist on hating me for the rest of your life..haha.  ay.  so this is how life should go:  something hurtful is said, he said she said stuff happens, pain is felt, miscommunication is to blame, issues are talked out, people are forgiven, things resolved, and bata bing, bata boom.. life is good again.  life is too short to have it any other way.  simple.  done.  lesson learned?    family is and always will be family   and nothing will ever and can ever change that.    p.s. i pity you who pity yourselves.

      the hills are alive with the sound of music.  so how many of you know that that sentence is my favorite sentence to type on the keyboard, huh?  those of you who do, wow, you really DO know me.  weirdos. lol  ok so it looks like i only have three or so weeks left of school.  where does the time go?  of course in hind sight it seems that everything went by so fast, but rewind to the beginning of the semester and i'm sure i was bitching about the days not going by fast enough!  needless to say, since i've decided to challenge myself with four art classes this semester, i will be spending the next few weeks cramming to get those last few sketchbooks/portfolios/projects turned in.  acks!  so far (knock on wood) it looks pretty promising for me though, as of RIGHT NOW i have A's in all five classes, but we all know how art classes go.  turn nothing in during the semester and for the most part, your grade rests on 1)your sketchbook(s) and 2)your portfolio, which probaby wouldn't be half bad if i actually kept up with them. =X  i know...BAD LEILA.  but i just wouldn't be me if i didn't wait until the absolute very last minute, terrible i know.  i thought procrastination was an art you eventually grew out of.  obviously, i haven't.  if you have any suggestions, by all means, feel free to help me out.   let's see...  wow, one of my best friends is getting married to a handsome, attractive, wonderful, sweet, caring, and extremely flirtatious guy.  (haha, i had to throw that in, or it just wouldn't be stuart!)  i doubt that they visit this site at all, but congratulations to you two, may you have lots of sex and babies.  oh, and i guess i should wish you happiness too, that could come in handy.  haha.  aww, we're all growing up. hm, i wonder who's next.  OH duh and i forgot to mention amber and sheree!  they got engaged a month or so ago, woohoo for them too!  may they have lots of sex and babies too.  only, in regards to the babies, i advise you guys to save lots of $$$ first, or agree on some gay dude.  hehehe...  i'm kidding!  ay.  when will it be my turn...  ::shrugs::  no ball and chain for this one.  it's been hot lately.  i'm debating on cutting my hair.  hm.  i'll cut it.  i'll cut it not.  i'll cut it.  i'll cut it not.  oh well, i guess i really will wait for my papas to return so then at least he can see me with longer hair before i ::whack:: ax it off. =D  well no, we'll see, i'm not sure what i want.  (what's new? lol)  he comes back home in the beginning of june and i haven't talked to him in nearly a year.  weird.  (::distracted:: just whacked two flies)  wanna hear something sickeningly funny?  i used to have a huge fascination with flies.  i would trap them in my room, catch em either with my hand in the air or up against the window.  then comes the terrible yucky ISH...  then i'd either pluck their wings or a leg or two or three or all and see how well they would walk.  OR i'd throw them in a lego house i built (had to pluck the wings so they wouldn't fly) and watch it walk around.  OR i'd just throw it/them into the spider webs and watch nature at its finest.  SICK huh?  poor flies.  what'd they ever do to me???  eww one of them is still alive!  it's insides are already hanging out and yet its defunct body refuses to give up.  should i let it live?  but it's miserable isn't it, wouldn't it be worse to let it live?  i should kill it and put it out of its misery, it's already going to die isn't it?  it should've just pretended to be dead.  dumb fly.  brb.  ok well, i guess we all know where i stand on euthanasia.  only difference:  i'm the one that tried to kill it in the first place.  haha, am i weird?  i just realized i'm talking about flies.  am i doomed to reincarnation as a rock in my next lifetime?  ha, if you believe in that stuff then probably.  oh well, i better live it up now...................  peaces.

      yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!! the quiz i could have sworn i BOMBED was returned to me today and guess what??  i got a B!  ...only three points away from an A.  woooohoooo!  aw man.  and i was starting to get disappointed in myself for missing so much class lately, but thankfully someone's looking out for me.  from here on out, i'm determined to keep my head screwed on straight, if only to finish this semester off.  can you believe it?  only a month or so left of class...scary.  well, i'm anxious, but i feel as if i'm crammed for a huge deadline.  actually the only thing holding me back from feeling comfortable in my classes as a whole are all the paintings/drawings that i'm behind on, but as soon as i'm caught up with those, it's smooth sailing from there.  i can't wait.  well actually, in addition to those, i have an exam tomorrow in psych that'll make or break my A, so we'll see how i do then.  wish me luck!  ok well, i have some major updating to do, but let me just touch up on some of the highlights:  **flat tire, had to buy another one.  :(** **gf has el territo's for the first time. mmm margarita!** **bennigan's with kong, nellie, mark, suzie, gf. $$$ fish bowl drinks** **eat @ aloha j's with bro, older sis, and gf.  mmm..$16 jungle juice!** **UCLA seminar.  informative.  gf and i hungry as hell!** **eat @ kaduki ? with nellie, berm, dj** **hook up with marlo in irvine.  that night, yay fun. ;) ** **macaroni grill, mmm mozarella sticks with garlic spread is to DIE FOR** **get drunk off of hefeweizens with suzie, mark, nellie, berm, bev, and kong.  unexpected fun.. yay! wwf with jes** **balboa park: gf takes pics.  developed.  tiiiight.  museum of photographic arts.  =)** **ruby's. YUCK mayo.  eat it anyway. "all psychological" says jessica.  oooookay.  over it.**  [FYI: my proofs. my pics. my tape. ::winks::]  ttfn!!

      ok.  here i am.  greg's gone.  i didn't get to see him  before he left..bummer.  it seemed like he was busy though, so i took a back seat.  i figured he had enough on his plate, sosee you in four months elman!  hm.  that's a good chunk of time.  no mobile to mobile too.  boo! you suck greg! haha.. kidding, kidding.  i guess we'll live.  let's see, thursday was fun.  you'll never guess who was all congregated in one area.  that's right, me, my gf, my ex(es), and the gf's ex(es)--to make it simple.  i personally don't like to be labeled an "ex", so what i meant to say was me and jes (duh), mica, cece, and lyn.  it was a tad awkward at first, but things got more comfortable as time went on.  first of all because cece disappeared, and then because lyn gave us unexpected words of encouragement (re: jes and i AND the haters).  it was a very nice gesture.  however, i did sense something that wasn't quite right that night with mica and i.  it saddens me to see her so distant when i'm around her and jessica.  it would be an understatement to say i feel so torn when we're together.  i've rushed her healing time in the past, so this time around i've been giving her her space.  i want to ask her what's ailing her over and over and over again and be the one to make her feel okay, but i know that in a sense, that's no longer my place, and though i would love to be her best friend, now just can't be the time--for her sake.  sometimes i miss what we had.  it was a great thing.  but it's in the past now and everything happens for a reason.  isn't that cliche just the answer to each and every one of life's most tragic experiences?  all sarcasm aside, i wholeheartedly believe that this is better for us, and were we to fastforward to when we've both graduated, we'd realize it.  i just hope we don't lose ALL that we had.  i have no other friends like her, so i pray she doesn't abandon me completely.  i guess we will just have to flow with the currents and see where it takes us.  so that's our story.  back to friday night, it was a memorable one.  it's relieving and just..nice.. to hang out with the sister again.  all drama aside.  i wish things weren't so tense between her and jes, but i'm not holding my breath, nor do i really want to get into that.  i don't expect everyone to like each other, maybe in a perfect world, but since the one we live in isn't PERFECT in any sense of the word, then i just expect us all to be civilized (whatever that may means) adults.  in other words, go ahead and have your beef, but check the shit-talking at the door.  that's why when i get caught up with cece, i don't let myself get too excited. lol.  in my defense, my words are brought about because of REaction, but i digress. haha.  i think the subtle undertones of drama that may still exist in my life is completely overrated.  the horse is freakin dead already, and i'm exhausted.  at this point, people can do and say as they please.  it no longer affects me, at least that's what i'm shooting for.  the end.    oh, i forgot to mention that we went to nellie's afterward (not before i had a side of drama with the gf).  it was all laughs.  nellie, berm, bev.  electric taboo. hah.  more drinks (leila back to her old tricks).  pics.  massages.  ah, it was great.  home at 5ish in the morning.  long night.

      hello cOOKIE peoples!  you're missing me, aren't you??? and if not, why the hell not?!  haha.  well i'm having a C H I L L time here in sacramento.  we're actually not really doing much, but it's such a nice feeling to be away from everything for a little while and amongst old friends in a place i once called 'home'.  it makes me nostalgic, to say the least.  sometimes i wish i lived closer to here because it seems like i have more friends here, true friends, not seasonal ones you get drunk with and shoot the meaningless (yet still fun) shit with.  know what i'm sayin'?  i was looking through my yearbook (well amber's, but of my senior year) and it almost made me sad.  i mean, i still have a few of our clickety click whom i continue to keep in touch with, but not nearly as many as i would have liked.  i know, people 'grow up' and 'go their separate ways', but i can't help but think that maybe if i would have made a little extra effort then they might still be in my life, but i guess that's the way life goes sometimes.  it's a game of gaining and losing.  that's okay, i absolutely love the ones in my life right now, and if this is how it is, then this must be how it's meant to be for me at this time in my life.. and i accept that. =)  i do miss them though.  on another note, i noticed how my circle of friends used to be so diverse (ethnicity wise), but i look at my 'friends' down here in socal and realize they're all filipino.  wtheezy??  maybe THAT'S why it doesn't feel right, freakin' filipinos are drrrrama! haha..  we all know that, so don't even fake the funk.  anyway.. lol..  hey, i'm not a hater, just being honest.  hm, mica started school this week.  i wonder how that is going.  fine, i'm sure.  she was always a smart one, too bad she didn't see the potential i saw.  maybe she does now.  ::reflecting back on the week:: hey! btw, varekai was the freaking bomb.  my next goal is to see O because my friend kay saw it and said it was a definite must see.  she saw mystere too and said that if there would be only one that i go see that it should be O.  so that's that!  i love plays and musicals and all kinds of shows, but too bad i don't go see them as often as i would like to.  oh and i love getting all girlied up with the girlie.  it's actually fun, different, and nice.  it makes me feel more my age. lol.  i think we should have taken more pictures.  i don't take very many with her. hm.  i used to take pictures a lot.  i think with my age has come some serious self-conscious issues.  what the heck? btw, amber says she's heard me say that phrase for as long as i've known her, so ... =X sorry nalani. haha.  man, i want a digital camera.  i gotta go buy one so i can take pictures, not only of my family/friends/random people lol, but of the art i have too so i can post it somewhere for faraway friends to take a look at.  hmm.. that's a goal too.  if anyone knows anyone that can hook it up, by all means.. let me knows.  ok well, i've been here for a while.  i'll end with a i miss everyone and though i'd love to live far far away from it all, i think i'd miss you guys too much. =P  so you'll be stuck with me for a little bit longer.  and someone please get me a door!! hahaha.  peace out.  [miss jessica, i miss you and can't wait to see you.]

      oooweee, i'm doing the countdown til micasan's birthday, so i can't sleep just yet.  oo the big 27, isn't it?  or is it 28? HAH.  can you believe i was with someone that old???  ok i'm kidding, sheesh.. ha. ha.  i know, very funny motherfucker. =P  man even though we've had drama like no other these past few months, i love this girl.  when we were together, i seriously think she'd bring me the moon if she could.  that always made me feel like the luckiest person in the world.  even now that we're friends, i don't know if i've ever had anyone care this much about me.  so thank you, i'm always flattered.  enough of that though.  she's the bomb and she knows it.  everyone wants to be her friend just cuz she's MICA~!!!  ..a softy with a tough shell.  it's all about the mystery and she plays the role well, don't be fooled.  there's a lot of character to be found there and i was one of the lucky ones.  i'm sure someday she'll find someone else to be the lucky one.  until then, live it up miss mica, cuz you know i would. ;)  so this is a birthday shot out to one of my closest friends.  we've been through a lot...ALOT... ALOT ...  ALOT  , and we're still going strong, so that's got to say something right?  it means you're a keeper, and we have a lifelong friendship ahead of us, so let's not blow it k.  ::cheers my friend:: i'm not going anywhere...  p.s. hope you like your presents.  and i'm outties.

      oo shit.  yesterday i got sun, today i got MAD sun.  my freaking face feels like it's on fire and is super duper red.  ouch!  and yet, i had so much fun at the beach today so it was alllll worth it.  smashball is the frickin bomb, is all i gotta say.  55 baby, what!! haha..  kata, laura, mica, aracelli (sp?), mary, stuart, jes, and i were all there to bring on memorial day, and it was good times.  no drama.  i'd talk more about it, but my face is starting to bug and the lakers are about to blow the timberwolves outta the water, so next time na lang!  ow. my face. :(

      today i got some sun. =)  random: jes looks pretty hot in the swimsuit we picked out.  too bad her boobies keep (ALMOST) falling out.  no excessive play in those. haha.  the bbq ended up being a close and intimate gathering.  a lot of the time these are what i prefer though, so no complaints here.  lost at trivial pursuit.  no surprise, i was never good at that game. hmph.  i've come to the conclusion that companionship is what keeps people sane.  so many problems stem from just that, lost friendships between family, friends, lovers, acquaintances, etc, etc...  it just goes back to what i've always told mica.  life isn't about the success you have in the end, it's about the people you've met along the way and the impression you have left in their lives; life is about the who, not the what.  and i'm not talking popularity contest either, you know what i mean.  too bad a lot of the time i feel like a recluse.  in kindergarten my teacher took my mom aside to suggest i see someone about my anti-social behavior, funny isn't it?  of course, my mom just replied with something along the lines of "no, if she feels uncomfortable with what the other kids are doing, then she'll just keep to herself".  non-conformist?  hm, ok that's unexpected self-reflection.  anyway, this was random.  i should get going.  we're hitting up the beach bright and early tomorrow, gotta run off this fatty i got going on!  tsk tsk...bad leila!  peaces.

      So today was a fun-filled day.  For those of you who haven't yet, give my sister, Kathleen, a call and wish her a HAPPY 22ND BIRTHDAY!  Yes, the foolio is officially OVER the 21 stage.  But for all of you who've known us, she was probably OVER being 21 waaaaaaayy before she was actually 'legal'.  ...Ahh, the benefits of having older sisters--one recovering alcoholic in particular.  HAH.    We went out to dinner (YUM), stopped by Mica's house (it's nice to see her parents' eyes light up when they see the kids), and for the first time visited Kata's place, which I must say, is quite nice and newer looking than I had pictured it.  It also inspires me to frame my work since all of her roommates' paintings are just that--framed.  Anyway, from there, we headed to Mica's bro's house for his birthday luau, and it was such a good time.  I always enjoy their company--the older, less drama, more mature crowd that still knows how to kick back and have fun.  That's what I'm talkin' bout! ::winks::  Old faces are always a pleasure.  Hm, oh, Cece was there.  It was nice seeing her; it's been a while.  I think she has been hiding from me.  Oh well, at least she said "bye" to me when I did (she could have left me hanging).  I caught up a bit with Mary.  I always love talking to that girl, she's always a good time--not like that!  haha...  Everyone there was shootin' the shit, having fun, watching the kids run around, and on top of all that my whole family was there; I was happy we all decided to go.  We don't all go out much when it comes to a non-family event such as this, but I'm glad we're keeping in touch with the folks at "goonie central" regardless of what's happened.  See, that's how life is supposed to go.  At least I like to think that's the way it's supposed to go...  I'll be posting pics soon enough.  Happy Birthday again to the sister.  We've been through a lot of  S H I T  this past few months, but one thing still remains--you're still my sister; and I love you.  Now all you have to look forward to is being 25 when you can rent a car without making a down payment first and accompany your underage friends into DNB.  HAHA.  Have fun!  I'll be there soon!  Goodnights.  BTW, those of you who missed tonights festivities, missed out on the Ed's famous Tahitian Dance!!!  It was great! haha.. check out the mpeg when I post it!

      wooFUCKINGhooo!!!  i am SO ELATED!  i just came back from my final (hardly a "final", it was more like a casual dinner) and that was the last class i was waiting on (to see if i got an A or not) and it turns out i did.  oh, what a relief.  after so many years of withdrawing from and failing classes i've gotten so discouraged.  i just figured i had lost the ability to do well academically somewhere in my years in high school.  true, i had people always telling me i could do it (and you know who you are, thank you for that), but i've never really proved it to myself until now.  anyway, i'm going to go now, i just wanted to post real quick because i had to share with someone!!

        this was in my inbox today.  something to ponder.    The Legacy You Leave  All You will leave behind for the world to remember is Your Legacy, so ask yourself:  Will you have earned the respect of your peers and the admiration of your critics?  Will you have acted humbly at the peak of success and graceful in the face of defeat?  Will you have kept your childlike wonder and reveled in the beauty of the world and the small miracles that each day brought?  Will you be remembered for how often you laughed and brought smiles to the hearts of others?  Will small children and the elderly have been overjoyed to be around you?  Will others have trusted you with their inner most secrets?  Will you have forgiven and offered heartfelt apology?  Will you have looked for the very best, and done your utmost to build worth, in others?  Will you have fed a hungry child or clothed a naked man or given hope to a stranger in dire need?  Will you have left this world a better place by the life you have lived?  What Legacy will You Leave?

      well it was a lovely day...  another A in the bag for me.  yay!  the gf and i got into a little argument.  it's amazing how two people whom are so alike in so many ways can have so many disagreements. ay.  then again, it makes sense doesn't it?  we both want the same thing; we have the same expectations, wait for certain responses, and crave the same attention.  when we BOTH want it, no one's willing to give in (or are aware that she should), leading to both of us being on the emotional receiving end with no one to give, and this results in SHIT.  then again, what's life without a little spice right?  take in a little of the crap with the really, really good?  yeah, that works for me.  man, i love this girl.  we just have to find a comfortable middleground that has yet to reveal itself.  anyway, enough of that.  i want a kitten, and my own place to live. lol.  and when i get older i'm going to retreat to the mountains and live like a hermit.  anyone wanna join me?

      hey crackerjacks!!!  missed me, didn'tcha?  what, you didn't?  well why the hell not?  so, as you can tell from my tone, i'm not sick anymore.  well scratch that, i have this persistent, annoying as hell, dry cough that i'm unable to get rid of.  any suggestions?  yeah, i almost threw up last night because my cough attack was that bad.  glad i shared?  yeah i bet.  let's see, well what else is new?  oh! pictures!  here's a little visual as to what has been keeping me busy this may:       those are pics from the baseball game we went to (boo padres...LOSERS. on the other hand, their ballpark is pretty spiffy), lanie's scholarship award night, leslie's wedding, and auntie marilyn's 50th birthday.  i have some of my paintings/drawings on hand too, but those will be another time.  mind you, they are beginners, BEGINNERS work.  if you keep bugging me then maybe. hah.  AND, guess what?!  i'm FINALLY done with school!!! woohoo!  well keep your panties on, cuz i'm only talking about the spring semester.  three more weeks or so and my ass will be singing a different tune.  oh well, i can't have it all.  i'll find out what my grades are at the end of the week.  so far i have three A's.  i can't wait.  if i get a 4.0 this semester, i'ma shit a frickin' brick because that'll be a FIRST in all my college career.  check that shit out.  but... we'll see...  so, since i'm outta school that means leila can play. (insert cheesy aol face here) and since the gf is back IN school (LAAAAME!) i'll be in sandy mangoes, so call me up so i can schedule you in. ;) haha.  anyway, i'm going to do something productive.  OR SOMETHING.    man, i need a tan.  (..and i'm a poet and didn't even know it..HA.)

(everytime i say, "big time!", it reminds me of my dad... and he'll be back in town soon... i'm excited!)  i feel soooooooooooooo drained.  i have to seriously talk myself into using the bathroom or even just to sit up and blow my nose.  how sad!  here i am, trying to cram for the typical end of semester deadline, and i can't even get myself to walk my dragging ass over to the water cooler to put some fluids in my body.  acks!  anyone willing to take over my load?  i'll pay you!  ...well, not with money though because i'm broke as hell.  anything in mind?  we'll see what we can work out. ;)    guess what guys...  jes outted herself to her parental units.  go girlfriend.  deng, it reminds me of my not-so-good ol' days when i came out in high school.  seems so long ago.  i found out another friend came out to her parents as well, and she's my age.  i can't imagine doing it now, but i could imagine how much of a relief it would be after so many years.  i went through a huge SHIT TIME, but it was all worth getting it over with earlier on so then the family has time to heal and move on.  things are great now, and you'd swear our family and home was a safe haven for "a gays"...haha.  i remember lanie and i talking, and it turns out that every single one of her kids has a gay aunt/ninang/ninong.  isn't that craziness?  i wonder if it'll make them more open minded in the long run.  they're so young, but they know what's up.  my nephew understands my love life more than i do sometimes, it's kinda funny.  they're great kids, sometimes i take them for granted, i know.  what it comes down to is that they're kids and they crave attention, and what we prioritize is trivial to them just as it's vice versa with us.  i have to admit though, going outside to get a flower or staying inside and playing video games with family is just as important, if not more important than, checking email, paying a bill, or stressing about life's nonsense drama.    anyway, as usual, i digress.  congrats to jessica and chikun.  welcome to the wonderful world of being out to your family.  it only gets better from here.  no secrets, no denying, no stress.  i'm happy for you guys.  cheers!  oh, this is somewhat off the subject, but, i have to share.  after telling her mom she was gay, one of jes's mom's responses was something along the lines of, "is that why you never wear earrings?"  hahaha... isn't that funny?  i don't know, it just seemed like such a cute question to ask; such an innocent inquiry.    well folks, cross your fingers.  i don't know how i'm going to get my work done, but i gotta gotta.  we'll see how i'm feeling.    peaces.

      i'm tired of the way this site looks.  i'm thinking of getting rid of it.  my head freaking hurts and it FEELS like i'm quadruple times sickER than i was yesterday.  big BLAH.  on top of everything, i feel the discomfort of relationship troubles, so big BLAH x2.  yuck.  i don't want to be with someone like me--i'm too fucking high maintenance.  haha.  anyway, i think i'll try and sleep.  and yes, i know i'm being a big baby, but i'm allowed to dammit.  i feel like shit. =(

      hm. so here's the   dilemma  ...  i just got off the phone with the girlfriend and she informed me that we were invited to her ex's graduation reception at her house.  now, i'm cool and all with the chick, we're not homies or anything, but she's never given me grief, so i have no problems with the girl whatsoever.  thing is, i'm with jes now, and this chick is  "the ex"  in her life (the others sort of serve as a backdrop as far as her relationships are concerned), and i think it'd just be weird being there, at her house, with a girl that used to be hers.  maybe it'd be okay if we hung out on occasion but NO we don't and this is completely out of no where, but i really don't think i'd mind if that were the case...OR...if there were going to be mutual friends there or some shit, you know???  am i trippin?  i mean, i really do hate when i get insecure (funny cuz jes and i were just talking about this), and to break away from old bad habits, i think twice and then some before i get upset or mad or what have you, but... blaaaaah.  and then if and when she goes by herself will i feel a little uncomfortable?  of course.  how about if she doesn't go, would i, knowing full well that she wanted to, feel guilty and then upset with myself?  geez, probably.  it's a lose-lose situation, huh?  ...one of those,  get-over-it, you're-not-going-to-win  type of dealies?  gosh.  i really don't want to give her a hard time about this (i know you're reading this, so i really don't want to give you a hard time about this), but i'm only human and i can't stop these stupid emotions from getting the best of me sometimes.  i don't know, call it insecurities, call it over-reacting, call it emotional bullshit; whatever it is, i feel it and i can't seem to get past it, not right now anyway.  and i have so much pride that i hinted that i don't want to see her tonight because of this stupid ish, all because i got hurt, and dammit i hate getting hurt!!! ...lol.  don't get me wrong, i've got a high tolerance for pain--hi, i've got piercings galore--but physical pain is freakin cake, it's the other shit i can't hang with.  blah, and anyway, i know and she knows (i know she knows) that not seeing her is the last thing i'd ever want.  so stupid.  relationship worries.  haha shit, this is the part where i just gotta laugh because this is just a reality check--a reminder that nothing's perfect (no matter how perfect it seems) and nothing is too good to be true.   naive .  i forget that sometimes...  BLAH!  this is retarded.  i think i'm being retarded, well part of me thinks i'm justified, but since i'm bitchin like a sensitive biatch, i think i'm being retarded, lol.  man, i need hobbies, or i need to go out more or something.  this petty stuff is fkn ridiculous.  eh, but i'm not going to go for sure, i might just end up a party pooper like in-denial-mica (hahaha, sorry mica, but don't tell me you don't agree--you're a party pooper!).  at least i know what i can't handle.  i'll just grin and bear it when she goes...  ps.  sorry to the gf, but hey if you can't vent in a freakin journal, where can you vent?  i guess this is what happens when your 'available' friends are limited.  and i apologize to my-kah if i insulted you, i'm feeling a little riled up... be scared...lol. >=O ::GRRR!::

      don't you just love alicia key's new song?  no?  well you should...   Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power Some people live just to play the game  Some people think that the physical things define what's within And I have been there before, and that life's a bore So full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everthing means nothing If I ain't got you  Some people search for a fountain That promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them  Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me  If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby

      ew.  it sucks to be sick.  maybe it's the heat, maybe it's the fact that i AM sick, maybe it's because finals are around the corner and i'm still up to my eyeballs in drawings/paintings/projects that need to be done, then again, maybe it's because jes left and that feeling of incompleteness has found its way back to me again.  we were talking earlier today.  it seems as if being away from each other has become more difficult lately.  i wonder why.  you would think it'd get easier, once the initial honeymoon season was over and done with, but it's quite the opposite.  it's interesting.  i am completely fascinated with her, it's great! =)  i can almost hear you guys gagging out there.  haha.  ok ok, i'll stop talking about her.. lol.. sorry, can't help it!  this semester is almost over and i'm crossing my fingers that i get a 4.0.  all of you should too!  it would really REALLY help out my overall GPA since it SO TOTALLY stinks as a result of my inability to get focused the other times i went to various colleges.  this year is different though.  i had a 3.75 last semester and i'm aiming high this time.  and if i get it, who's buying me drinks?!?  it'll be something to remember because it'll be the FIRST TIME GETTING A 4.0 IN COLLEGE.  that's right!  finally, right?  ay... but let me not get ahead of myself.  there is still so much work that needs to be done.  let's see how this next week goes.  if i'm productive--REALLY productive--this week then i think i can pull it off.  if i'm slacking off like i have been the past few weeks, then uh ohs, we're looking at a couple of B's. =X    anyway, as for the summer, i'm taking a critical thinking class, a graphic design class (to keep me busy and to learn how to use a couple programs), and a portfolio prep class.  eeks, looks like i'm going to be stacked this summer.  thank goodness we have a pool so on my days off i can relax and enjoy the sun.  anyone who's interested, just call me up! =P  on another note, i am so broke again.  it's sad.  well i really don't want a job (who does--true--but there are people out there that actually don't mind it (my babe)), but it's the not having money part that's depressing...haha.  then again, that's at the bottom of my list.  school is definitely first at least until november because i REALLY need to do something about my grades.  hm.  we'll see...    btw, like the drawing?  i'll try and post more every now and again, esp. since i have this AWESOME digital camera i absolutely adore. ;) (whispers:  thanks love! )

      quick blog.  figure, it's been a while and since i'm not reaLLY doing anything except enjoying the company of my gf next to me while she works on her magazine layout (and oh how cute she is when she has her random bursts of creative ideas!).  she leaves today and though she's coming back tomorrow night after work, i'm still going to miss her.  it's so odd, being this attached to her when it's already been four months.  maybe it's because we don't live together because we all know everything changes when you move in with someone.  at least everyone that knows my past knows that that's how it is, or--is it just me? maybe.  hm, but we want to move in together eventually... i guess we'll see when that time comes, whenever it comes.  this semester is almost over.  i'm still undecided on what classes to take over the summer.  lanie and i might take a graphic design class with jason (my design teacher) only because it's computer lab time and we'd get to familiarize ourselves with adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator.  i figure, well, of course i'd benefit from it because it wouldn't hurt since i'm an art major anyway, and well, lanie being the future educator who is already familiar with similar programs (kinda sorta.  thanks to yearbook) could update her skills and help me out on the side too. haha.  well we'll see.  i am definitely taking a critical thinking class, so looks like leila will be writing some papers this summer.  holding off on deciding whether or not i want to join a figure drawing workshop in corona, but who would turn down the opportunity to draw nekked people?!?  haha, trust me, it's hard.  on a serious note though, i recommend figure drawing to every serious artist because rendering the human figure--well--is probably the most complex, fascinating, and rewarding technique to master.  ...my two cents.  as i was saying, corona might be too much of a drive for me, and since i'm already taking that portfolio prep class in LA, i think i'm going to have to pass. :(  oh well, there will be plenty of other times.  i think leslie (my figure drawing teacher) is going to have a class in the fall for once, so i'll definitely try and do that if this summer falls through.  the heat has approached us.  you know what that means.  that's right folks, swimming pool AND jessica in a bikini!... woohoo!  it just doesn't get better than this...   hahaha...  peace out!

      i forgot to mention how terribly sorry i am that i neglected to call you at all yesterday, miss jessica.  like i said, you have permission to kick my butt, after last night, i think a lot of people have my permission to kick a little leila butt. lol.  i'm so lucky to be around people that take care of me and worry about me.  that means you're surrounded by people who love you, and what could be better than that?  i miss her.  i think i would very much like to live with her one day. ...very much indeed.  hm...

      i've just woken up from what is quite possibly one of the most embarrassing and traumatizing nights of my life.  you know that whole saying: beer before liquor, never sicker...   well, even with ed repeating it over and over again (didn't know that til he told me this morning) my stubborn ass eventually took 3-4 shots of spiced rum (again, don't remember doing it) after already drinking somewhere between 5-8 beers (taking into account the beer bong, yes they had a beer bong).  consequently, this led to my clothes being changed by my aunt, throwing up on myself and on clothes that weren't mine, bro having to carry me to the van AND i throwing up on him too!  ...ahhhh blah!  man, someone please hide hard liquor when i'm drinking beer because i just don't know when to stop.  how sad!  anyway, i'm sure i had a good time, to what expense though.  haha.  terrible, just terrible.  i'll be posting the pics from this memorable night soon enough.  til then, here i'll be... recovering...

      i honestly believe that       TRAFFIC CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO KILL!!! grrrrr...  this frickin' lady practically helped herself into my lane with me still in it.  what the heezy?  i mean i know blind spots are tricky and all, but if you're not absolutely sure, don't pull a cece lane change!  i'm sure you all know what the heck i'm talking about too! lol...  sorry, traffic is a pet peeve.  ESPECIALLY when i'm the one in the driver's seat.  so anyway today was the first day of school in LA. it made me long for the city scene.  i'm not that type of person though, i think i can't handle being in the fast lane for too long, but it'd be a nice experience.  ...maybe someday...  ok well i better go because boobica might read this and wonder why i wasn't working on my essay. HAH.  oh, and the class seems like fun already.  i can't wait.

      alas, school is upon me once again, or should i say has been upon me for over a week now.  well, it's definitely keeping me busy.  english is intriguing as always--when presented with a good teacher, one who challenges all and everything at that.  nice, i love knowing that i'm learning, and when my assumptions are proven false, i know i'm learning.  right?  graphic design is fun.  i admit, it's a little frustrating as i know absolutely nothing about photoshop or any other software we will be exposed to, but nothing is better than jumping head first into a field you don't really know.  ok maybe not that bad, i AM an art major, but the technical computer stuff really throws me for a loop.  luckily i have girlfriend to come to my rescue (her being a graphic design major and all) and save me from all my troubles and worries.  which brings up another point.  it's funny because i see her more than anyone else, friends and what not, but i miss her the most.  maybe because ever since i've started school, we don't have as much of that lounging-around girlfriend down-time that always feels so nice.  however, things will change as this is her last week in school and she will be spending more of it here with me.  she even rescheduled her work availability so that she could take me to class on wednesdays (an anticipated horrendous two hr drive to LA during rush hour); isn't that the sweetest?  not the drive, but JESSICA.  anyway, i digress...  i apologize for the spaced out updates, but we all know how that is don't we.  gotta go, bram stoker's dracula awaits me.  by the way, i recommend the book to anyone; it seems that i'm hooked...

      waddup my loyal listeners/readers.  quick blog.  and summer school starts...  it forecasts intense studying and learning for leila for the next six weeks, but hey, i guess that's a given when you go from what is it, fourteen or sixteen? to six... quite a downsize.  i'll elaborate on those later on when i have more time.  in the meantime, i have thus far learned:  -there really are closed minded people out there -you'd be surprised (i was) to learn that there are gay people out there who are anti-gay marriages -i'm surrounded by people who think bush is the greatest president in all time (and i'm going, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.) -advertising is evil and manipulative, but what isn't?  i'm in it for the art. -every single day that goes by i am more in love with my girlfriend.  ...and this is a great quote i came across:  "Get rid of self-conceit.  For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows."--Epictetus  nice huh?

      last night i realized...  just how ridiculous you look when you're fucked up drunk in public.  i've never really REALLY had to deal with it until last night, and for once, it wasn't me.  then again, i'm not the type to get that sick anywhere out of the home (or relative's home), at least nowadays, and nor do i plan on it anytime soon.  i think i'm traumatized.  so, quick recap...  my girlfriend celebrated her 22nd birthday at DNB's last night and let's just say, it wasn't a pretty sight.  me, mica, and one other girl had to carry her from the rear of DNB's to inside the car, but not before she gave me absolute hell in the bathroom.   never try to tackle a drunkard on your own, i've determined it's a lost cause.  anyhow, i'm glad she had fun and overall it was a good night for me too.  ..a little out of my comfort zone, but fun nonethless.  by the way, i suck at taking care of people when they're drunk.  i don't think i have the patience, they end up pissing me off.  haha.  so CHEERS to those of you who've taken care of me in the past, i commend you and have only one question: how the hell did you do it?!?  next week i start school.. yay.  actually, i really am excited.  i'm just about ready to do something productive in my life................  that's a rap.

      "If you're never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances."  ..isn't that just the greatest quote?  it inspires, gives hope, and provides comfort.  life, every now and again, brings forth the shittiest of shitty situations in your direction, but the key to survival lies in HOW you deal with it.  like the bellboy in my best friend's wedding said, "this too shall pass".. so roll with the punches and keep on the keep on my friends!  sometimes i feel so optimistic, other days i feel like leaving it all behind.  how complex life gets!  and through it all, there are always a selected few who never cease to provide endless love and support, and those are the people you need not take for granted because they are, without a doubt, irreplaceable.  they reveal the truth, that LIFE really IS SIMPLE; you should have faith in yourself, practice the art of patience, give generously, have compassion, sincerity, LOVE, and be thankful.  how could you not feel even the slightest bit at peace if you tried to live like this?  yes, shit happens, but life has this peculiar way of working out--every single time.  and if you don't see it at first, you will (and usually do) later.  at least this is how i think, and it keeps me sane--especially in this insanely insane world. this concludes yet another day in the life of me...   sweetest dreams peoples....................

      who talks about their own breast-isises?  no comment. lol. so...anyway, leila updates:  the papa is home!  yaywoo!  it's more comforting than i had anticipated to have my dad back home again.  i guess i really didn't realize how much i had missed him.  i mean, true, we talked maybe TWO times the entire year he's been gone, but i guess you can say i've just gotten accustomed to not having him around.  maybe subconsiously i didn't want to communicate with him because it made it easier for me to deal.  maybe a part of me still resents what he has done.  or maybe this past year has just been so dramatic for me that i've neglected to look outside the petty drama in my own life.  well whatever the reason, i'm glad he's back and i look forward to his jokes, vulgarity, criticisms, dorkiness, cooking, smiles, laughs, and singing.  bring on the karaoke says pa.  then, after only one month, he's gone again.  when will this madness stop?  on another note, he said if i get one more tattoo he's going to kick me out of the house.  i said "that's fine".  he replied with, "knowing you, you'll probably go get one tomorrow, just to get out, huh?" i (ever so nonchalantly) answer, "yup."  then he goes, "you dork! leila, you're still a dork!" and laughs.  he knows how well i respond to threats.  haha, ah, to have him back again. oh and the nagging...  "so leila, when are you going to get married?  it better not be in massachusettes!  ...hey, when are you going to give me grandchildren?"  blah, blah, shmah, shmah... can you believe i actually miss this?    you know, i was actually in the mood to post earlier, but i think the hot ass swim i just had changed my mind.  the freaking water IN THE POOL was hot as hell!  grr, kinda defeats the purpose of taking the swim.  i guess i was looking forward to the cool and refreshed feeling.  i wanna take a nap or something.  ...just chill...  summer is great.  oh and hey, congratulations to you graduates!  i admire you... one day i hope to be one myself.  if i knew it would be this hard for me i would have answered the question "what do you want to be when you grow up?" with "a college graduate."  nevermind all the other stuff afterward; i just want a degree i can be proud of.  i know it's just a piece of paper, sometimes hardly to one's benefit, but i feel like i've worked at it for so long and if for nothing more than self-assurance purposes, i'd really like to have it already!!!  ay... one day at a time.... riiiiiight........  i could talk about other, more serious, things that have plagued my mind, but it would just be me jumping into another circle of previously talked about topics.  i've decided i'm not going to do that anymore.  how many times can a person say sorry, really?  life goes on, you either move on with it or get left behind...

      today is a better day.  definitely a better day.  well there is one thing that tugs at my heart, and that's the well being of a person i used to spend my time with exclusively.  things have changed and we are no longer together.  as with all break ups, we've had our fair share of shit, and i'm ready as i'm sure she is deep down inside, to move on and salvage whatever friendship we might have left.  the thing is, she can't let go.  and i understand, contrary to what everyone says to me when things are "over", i'm very capable of imagining the hurt they feel.  i don't know firsthand how it feels (for now, but karma is sure to kick me in the butt one day), but does that make me any less compassionate?  i don't know.  i'm starting to think that those of you who told me, in the very beginning,  to "cut it off" for her sake were actually right.  it is what i should have done.  and now in hindsight, i might have actually made the situation worse for her, and i am sorry.  i went against my better judgment because i was selfish and i wanted so badly to retain the close bond and the friendship that we had, minus the relationship aspect.  i allowed for no healing period and now five months later we find ourselves stuck in limbo, a friendship put on hold.  and i am flattered that she loves me the way she does, for as long as she has, but the time has come and gone for her to do something for herself for once and let me go.  everything she does is for me, and i see that and i know that, but what do you say to that when you yourself have already moved on and have a new life ahead of you?  i just want my friend back, and i know that i must wait however long it takes.  i broke her heart once when i told her i had found a new love; i don't have the heart to do it again and again by reminding her that what we had is in the past.  i guess this is why, though i've been really concerned about her lately, i have just been giving her her space.  and i know you read this, and i'm sorry if it seems like i've been dragging you along.  you know i would never do that to you.  for your sake though, please, please, please... maybe you need to hear me say it...?  you are holding on to a past that has no future.  any more time gone by like this (in reference to the tension between us) and we may find ourselves unable to pick up "where we left off".  do you see my concern?  i would love nothing more than to have you in my life, for the rest of my life, but it can't be like this.  if i have to let you go in order for you to move on and live your life for the sake of  living  instead of for me, then i'm prepared to do that--for you.  i just hope you see it in that way, and not that i'm a heartless asshole who has her own life and won't give her friends the time of day.  you know me better than that woman!  i've said my piece, and i should go.  we all miss you and look forward to the day when things are "normal" again.  " Love is never lost . If not reciprocated it will flow back and soften and purify the heart."

      today is just one of those days.  ever just feel sad?  ever reflect on the choices you have made in life and question whether they were the right ones or whether you could have done it differently to minimize the pain for the people involved?  ever feel like a gray cloud is following you around?  yeah, i'm sure you've all felt that way.  today is a moping day.  i'm sitting in the deafening silence and i am indifferent to it all.  not a care in the world.  just going through the motions.  how dull would it be if there were never any emotions involved.  ::sigh::  ever look someone in the eyes and see her spirit stripped from her?  emptiness and a blackened heart.  why is the heart made to be so fragile?  so susceptible to pain, not easily mended.  ignore the birds and chase the sun away because today is just one of those days...

      16 games of pool for five bucks.  man, you just can't beat that!  so that's what we did yesterday.  kata, jes, and i.  kathleen has come around, go figure.  it's fun though, and the past is the past, so let's leave it at that.  besides, moving on is so much more exciting.  you never know what's going to happen.  the past, on the other hand, is just way too predictable.  don't you think?  anyway, on saturday we went to a luau/wedding reception for friends of the family and it was grrrrrreat!  oo hula dancers are the ones for me.  where can i get me some???  hahaha!  i mean uh, they were AH-ITE.  (i love you jessica! insert cheesy AOL face here)  corona + tahitian dancers + mickey hollerin like a damn fool = maaaaaaad fun!  later that night, my girlfriend just about scared the living daylights out of me (through no fault of her own of course) and decided to have an allergic reaction to the peanut oil they used in the palabok (who knew???).  after hearing from lanie it was just that that they used, we rushed her over to the emergency room where we deleriously awaited the doctor.  luckily for us, her reaction was unusually mild (ask her about her other experiences with the evil peanut), and she got away without having to receive any shots.  this made me realize just how precious she is to me, and how miserable i would be without her.  when i was getting our stuff together to take her, my thoughts were travelling at lightspeed and i could feel myself overwhelming with worry.  she is my love, my rock, and everything right in my life.  i prayed that she would be okay, and deep down i knew that she would, but whew... what a scare.  for goodness sakes, watch what you eat babe! (haha, ok ok, just thought i'd remind you!)  quick thoughts:  mica, you're forgiven.  let's be friends again. tash, i know you don't read this, but welcome to san diego my long lost friend! greg, where the hell are you?  thursday.  menifee.  be there or be circle. emmy (and the rest of you dorks), i miss you!!!  haha, k bye!

      again, let me stress that i never said 9/11 was NOT biased.&nbsp; it totally is.&nbsp; but what news source out there isn't?&nbsp; honestly?&nbsp; that's why i encourage people to watch it, and determine FOR THEMSELVES, what the truth is.&nbsp; but to ignore one side of the argument is only hearing what you want, and the truth will never be revealed that way.&nbsp; it's my thinking that one would have to hear it all, bogus shit and not, and then take a stand.&nbsp; i've read many reviews, and even some of&nbsp;those who are far right, who are angry because of the film's implications and total bias (who wouldn't expect that though, it's michael moore) acknowledge its importance and the impact it will have on a lot of Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;besides,&nbsp;&nbsp;i do it all the time when i'm listening to those assholes say my lifestyle is whack.&nbsp; i need to experience things myself and have sense of the whole picture.&nbsp; and like i said again, hey, that's just me.&nbsp; i could understand why some people don't jump at the opportunity to see this film;&nbsp;there are harsh truths out there.&nbsp; though a lot of it is moore's self-promotion and ridiculous effort to make bush look stupid (uh, who didn't know?), he lets a lot of the documentary speak for itself - and that's what one should pay attention to, if nothing else.&nbsp; no offense ate lanie.. let's just agree to disagree on this one.&nbsp;

      whoa, what the heck?&nbsp; i guess blogspot is getting popular because the options are becoming endless.&nbsp; i can bold, italicize, set the colors and fonts as i please without having to fuck&nbsp; with the templates.&nbsp; well lookie lookie here...&nbsp;&nbsp; cool.&nbsp;  what   can  i say,  i'm   easily  amused.&nbsp; hah, anyway... &nbsp; SUNDAY: "all i gotta say is: i didn't vote for that piece of shit." - amber's first words as we were walking out of the theater after watching fahrenheit 9/11.&nbsp; and honestly, i agree completely.&nbsp; but you who know me already know that.&nbsp; this movie is a must for everyone out there, especially if you know or are someone in the military.&nbsp; bottom line is: in this world of politics,&nbsp;we are surrounded by two&nbsp;extremities and it is our responsibility to examine and search for the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;even if&nbsp;you consider yourself republican, even if you don't consider yourself &nbsp;a "bush-hater", watch the movie and determine, for yourself, the lesser of the two evils.&nbsp; mainstream media gives us only one side of the argument and we should never settle for just that.&nbsp; just my two cents, don't have to agree. &nbsp; also SUNDAY: recovery from the night before; watched maybe 5-6 episodes of the L word straight&nbsp;and got HOOKED.&nbsp; thanks amber and sheree.&nbsp; didn't end up leaving until 10 or 11 at NIGHT! eeks!&nbsp; luckily girlfriend was sweet enough to drive most of the way because she knew i had class the next morning, but little did she know i wouldn't wake up to them.&nbsp; bad leila!&nbsp; luckily, i only have two weeks left, so pray for my lazy ass. =X &nbsp; SATURDAY: mary and stuart's wedding&nbsp; (they were beeeeeeeautiful), felt kinda&nbsp;uncomfortable walking in because we were young and colored... hahaha.&nbsp; after the wedding we had a bbq and drrrrrank up before the reception.&nbsp; phil and dayja,&nbsp;&nbsp;(sp? i forgot how to spell her name! shhhhhh!) showed up.&nbsp; missed them.&nbsp; went to the reception and stayed for&nbsp;a bit.&nbsp; nice house.&nbsp; big.&nbsp; wealthy peoples.&nbsp; went back to amber and sheree's and drrrank some more.&nbsp; end up going to "club 21" with amber, michelle, jes, kata, kay, ruby, mica, laura, sami, sheree is way too drunk and ends up staying home (kinda funny cuz it was partially her idea in the first place), kata gets in with jes' ID (someone stole-did-did hers, long story), amber and i get kicked off the gogo dancer's lil stage, we gets jiggy, it's all F U N.&nbsp; good good times. &nbsp; FRIDAY:&nbsp; pool and dranks.&nbsp; kata, jodi, derick, jen, amber, sheree, me, jes, cori, ken, kay, ruby.&nbsp; so much fun!&nbsp; oh and had mac grill but didn't quite hit the spot this time.&nbsp; could it be that the food was cold?&nbsp; yes.&nbsp; had a potent italian margarita though, and that made up for it. ::evil grin::&nbsp;  &nbsp; THURSDAY:&nbsp; left for sac &nbsp; so that's my weekend update.&nbsp; i've been getting a little behind in the schoolwork department.&nbsp; don't worry though, that's the way i work it seems.&nbsp; the relationship department has been getting hit hard lately, but it's starting to look up.&nbsp; i don't often speak about it because well 1)you read it, hi, yes you and 2) i'm a private person.&nbsp; but sometimes, man, i just need to vent.&nbsp; we'll see though, you all know me.&nbsp; i'm not the first to settle.&nbsp; ok with that, i'm out.&nbsp; here comes another full week, and i'm already missing my girlfriend.&nbsp; i don't get it, esp since we bug the shit out of each other SOMETIMES.&nbsp; i guess that's just besides the point because she still completes me.&nbsp; hm, gotta love relationships.&nbsp; girls are drama, didn't i say that from the get go???&nbsp; but dammit, they are sexy as hell and i can't seem to get enough of them. hahaha... oh leila... that'll be the death of you.............. &nbsp;

      holy shitballs, has it really been that long???  as you might have guessed it, i've been a busy little bee these past few weeks.  i can't even update here and there.  when i DO have free time, there's always something i have to catch up on.  then there's girlfriend time, but you know, can't nothin' interfere with the galprend's time.  haha. (that was FOR the gf in case you were wondering)    so let's see, what's new...  i registered for classes for the fall.  i only get a two week break between summer school and school school.  what's that all about?  i better let loose as soon as school's out! shoooo...  as i'm planning on transferring next fall (about damn time right?!), my schedule's loaded.  oh and she-ra, if you're reading this, i'm finally taking your advice and taking a ceramics class.  i can't wait, i think it'll be fun!    what else... finished dracula--a must read classic.  gonna tackle war of the worlds next.  english is fun, we're dealing with the supernatural stuff.  first essay was a stand on one of the big court cases going on these days (i chose the mr. guilty-is-my-middle-name, scott peterson case), our second paper was on an urban legend (texas chainsaw massacre was my choice for that one), third is on an unsolved mystery (pyramids/stonehenge, i'm not sure yet) four is on something supernatural, i think i'm leaning towards spotaneous human combustion.  what do you guys think?  any suggestions?  hey, i'm open to anything. ::winks::  aw man, i'm so tired nowadays.  my room looks like an absolute trainwreck, and no matter how much it aches my eyes to see it everyday, i just cannot muster up enough energy to do something about it. and i neeeeeeeeeeed to start working out again, i'm gettin chubby wubby!  someone motivate me!  help!  luckily jes is sweet enough to DO IT every now and again.  gosh that girl must love me.  you know, no matter how much i see her, it never feels like enough.  it's almost as if i miss her more.  hm.  weird.  i guess that's when you know you're in love right?  haha, enough love stuff, i can already hear you guys gagging.  well folks, my time's up here. til next time!  don't miss me too much...

       INSERT huge gigamongous sigh of relief HERE X   guess what..  that's right folks, school's out for the summer..  that means two weeks of rest, recreation, and relaxation.  what fun!    i actually just returned from one of the best weekends ever.  maybe it felt extra nice because i've been so unbelievably stressed this past few weeks, but nonetheless, it was a wonderful weekend and i have my girlfriend to thank.  she's so good to me..  anyway, we went to vegas and c h i l l e d the funks out.  very needed if you ask me.  prior to our little vacation we over did it with pride in san diego.  never go out three nights in a row, or maybe it's just me - i'm getting old huh?  that was fun; tiring, but fun.  i thought i was in the mood to write, but i'm really not, so to all of you whom i have neglected lately, don't kick me to the curb yet!  i'm just in one of those isolation funks. haha.  this weekend i meet jessica's mom for the first time.  keep in mind that jessica just outted herself a few months ago.  so wish me luck, i hear she's vicious; sounds like jes. hahaha...  yikes...
