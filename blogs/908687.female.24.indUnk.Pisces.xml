      So like my 17 year old sister is pregnant. Now I know you are thinking "Well you're Mes'can, so what's the big deal?" The big deal is that I spent 4 years at a fucking ivy league college to drag my family out of the barrio, only to have my horny, clueless little sister flush us back in. To me, an elitest bitch, this is a great crime. I really never saw my sister as that clueless. I mean is it hard to buy a condom and have your high school dropout boyfriend place it on his insufferably small dick? I think not! On other things, I saw this sign on Highway 59 the other day "NO WAR IN IRAQ". This is Houston. I also went to pick up my dog from my mother's house. She lives in a small city 6 hours away. Its a great drive. I am not being facetious. My new job is pretty cool. I listen to talk radio a lot. That's a little dangerous, but since I also read Salon.com et al. not horribly so.  READ DAVID SEDARIS!

      1. The sign was gone. 2. I bought 20 dollars worth of groceries for some Mexican immigrants because I felt sorta guilty about going to the store to buy cheap wine. I'm all trying to score points with Jesus! 3. ED DAMES AKA "DOCTOR DOOM" IS ON ART BELL TONIGHT!

          When I was job hunting a couple of weeks ago, I found that interviewers were fairly impressed by the fact that I had a website. My advice to all job hunters, therefore, is to rig up some sort of website and put the url on your resume. If you are looking for a job that may require a writing sample, then post some samples on your site. Anyhow, it took me approximately a week to land a decent job. I start Monday. I'm relieved because I kept hearing horror stories about job hunting in this economy. Since I'm only going to be working for about a year before law school, I wasn't too worried about landing my dream job (aka. bartender in a resort town in the Caribbean; goat herder in the mountains of Peru) and I think this was good because I wasn't too picky. I'm thinking that working a regular, ho-hum job will give me time to start work on my "Great American Novel". I'm a regular reject. I tried to save all my rejection letters, but I lost them when I moved.       The past two days, while sitting in rush hour traffic, I spied the most curious sign draped over a bridge located directly above a fork on highway 45 in southeast Houston. The sign, crude black letters scrawled across a white sheet, proclaimed "THE PENTAGON HAS ORDERED 60,000 BODY BAGS. THEY ARE NOT FOR THE IRAQIS." The last couple of words were a little obscure because the sheet had been crushed against a metal railing. Anyhow, I want to take a picture of this eerie sign, but I don't have a camera. The sign trips me out though because it reeks of conspiracy and I love a good conspiracy theory. I wonder what crackhead put it there?

      My take on this recent, midterm election is similar to the opinion I formed during the 2000 presidential election, which is that the Democrats are really horrible campaigners unless a candidate with Bill Clinton-like persona is running. The Democrats should have gained more seats in the house and won the majority in the Senate, but they didn't. The Democrats are floundering in a stale morass of political relativism. They don't know what they stand for and they haven't known since Clinton left office. If they have known, then they haven't told the public. This is a big problem for a political party that touts itself as the opposition of the Republicans. To be sure, the Democrats are an umbrella party and as such, must embrace a variety of factions and interest groups, but they should be able to effectively channel the competing interests of their members into a coherent and viable message. A significant amount of the U.S. population should be able to embrace that message without having to think too hard or too long about it. If the a political party can't produce a coherent and tangible message, a statement or various statements of what it purports to stand for, then it is a failed party.   Message building is not a new thing or particularly difficult. The Greens, as their name implies, embrace primarily environmental issues. They stand for the environment. The Socialist Workers stand for socialism. They want workers to have more power. The Republicans stand for family values, tax cuts, and well capitalism. The Republicans are an umbrella party and it certainly contains a number of competing interests, but their 'values' can be defined fairly succiently. Nobody gets confused.   Its harder to define what the Democrats stand for.

      Not to sound too right wing and fanactical, but when I click on an internet radio station with the expectation that in less then a few seconds my ears will be greeted with some fine trance music but instead get a mini diatribe against President Bush and the war against Iraq, I get a little annoyed. Far be it from me to deny anyone their right to free expression, but when a station begins their broadcast with "RadioPower, our radio stations are dedicated to Anti-Bush, Anti-war..." blah blah blah, one has to wonder if they are really 'anti-war' or just 'anti-bush'. Experience and an overabundance of media exposure has told me that its probably the latter. Dumarses.

           I promised myself that I would start writing on here on a regular basis. I've never been good at keeping a journal, so we will see how it goes. Afterall, this is mostly just for me.   I WAS HORRIBLY SCARRED (PSYCHOLOGICALLY, I mean)  On friday, my roommate went on a date. On Monday, he went home. My roommate mentioned that her new beau had wondered aloud about my absence from the living room most of the weekend. I reminded my roommate that I had been sick on Sunday.      That's only a half truth. When I ventured down the stairs on Saturday evening to let the dog out, I inadvertently stumbled upon a copcious lovemaking session on the leather couch. I didn't actually see anything scandalous. I nearly did but when I heard the 'slurpacious' sounds of a pre-orgasmic moment, I turned heel, ran up the stairs to grab my keys, ran back down the stairs and let the little doggy in as I flew out the door. Whew! That could have been bad.         I swear that I've encountered my roommate's new plaything in a chat room several months ago. I chatted with him briefly and he had a picture on his profile. Its the same guy. I think that's pretty amusing.

      The world is a strange and dangerous place. Intimations that it might have once been otherwise lack any basis in fact. Journalists and opinion mongers now lament some imagined recent past that if not more peaceful, was at least more stable and not filled with the uncertainties and anxieties of the present. In the 1990s, they like to assert, the world was at peace, the economy was booming, and people liked us Americans. Well certainly, the world liked us or at least tolerated us better. But if the genocide and terror in Kosovo and Bosnia, if the endless African wars, and closer to home, if the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1992 signify a glorious Pax Americana, we have to ask ourselves if this was a true peace. What then is peace? Is it when we, as a society, can gorge ourselves on fly by night business schemes and extravagantly lofty ideas that, while having merit in the abstract, are eviscerated by real world imperatives? Is it when we purposely kowtow to dictators, and ignore maniacal Islamic freedom fighters in order the keep the up a semblance order and prosperity? I think not. Contrary to what the spin-doctors eagerly espouse, the world was not more perfect in the 1990s then it is now. The information technology bubble and a clever administration in Washington lulled most Americans to sleep. When one is making bank on Enron stock, who cares if Osama Bin Laden’s minions are plotting to bomb a U.S. ship stationed off the coast of Yemen? Where is Yemen anyways?

      I went to New York on 11th to visit my very special friend. The weekend was spectacular. On Saturday we awoke to an ominous gray sky that promised to fill the concrete streets below with cold drops of unclean water. We decided to go have breakfast at a nearby diner. Midway through our meal, the clouds began to glide apart to reveal a vibrant and warm sun. Pale New Yorkers raided the streets of lower Manhattan to bask, crawl, dine, and shop.    I've been suffering (gawd, I hate that word) from panic attacks and depression for the past 3 or 4 weeks. On Monday, I finally decided to go see a psychiatrist. She prescribed Zoloft and Xanax. They last time I was on Zoloft was last April. The psychiatrist had droopy boobs. I have to stay medicated for two years or so.    Whomever runs this place gave me a lawn chair. Now I can sit out front with my rifle and shoot at Hoss when he tries to steal my shoes and my American flag.

      Instead of studying for the LSAT or jogging 3 miles, I spent the better part of yesterday evening whining about the pain in the back of my head. I was pretty much convinced it was the sign of a burgeoning brain tumor, or a bulging vein on the verge of hemmorrhage. Now, however,  I'm inclined to believe that the pain stems from the fact that some insidious bastard stole my chair and replaced it with an uncomfortable and unadjustable substitute. Hence, my back, which was never that great to begin with, became strained and began a painful revolt. I've since swapped the offending chair for one which I hope offers a more gentle seating experience. My neck is less strained now, but I could still use a massage.

      If the clouds hadn’t parted to allow the sunlight to rain down upon the cracked gray concrete  and if a few dollars hadn’t somehow appeared from deep with the musty confines of my old, red jacket, I may have stayed inside. As it was I felt well, better than I had in days, in fact, and figured that it would be a shame to remain inside the shelter. It had been raining for days, as it often does this time of year, and the shelters were filled to capacity with homeless. Some, like me, had jobs and we tended to avoid the shelters unless weather or lack of immediate funds or plausible alternatives,  forced us to partake  of their foreboding hospitality.   urlLink  continued..

      Without warning the newly formed Department Of Peas was destroyed late Friday afternoon by an inadvertent deletion of a few irreverant and hilarious words. Democratic presidential candidate, Dennis Kucinich is said to be extremely distraught and just a little bit perturbed by the whole situation. He was seen running naked through the woods behind his home early yesterday morning. Neighbor Jack Crump was quoted as saying "Ol' Denny was just shouting and was totally flabbergasted. What a jittery bastard!"

        &#160; &#160;During the course of my many spiritual wanderings, I was introduced to the god that is known far and wide as the smoothie. Touted as a healthy drink by the Atkins, Creatin, South Beach diet crowd, the smoothie does not naturally attract the 'fattie foodie'. We 'fattie foodies' are usually drawn to the wondrously creamy delights of cheesecake and chocolate ice cream or the salty sensuousness of a mega bag of corn chips, preferably barbecue flavored. My virgin taste buds first witnessed the tangy sweetness of the smoothie when a kind coworker purchased one for me as a reward for staying late to toil in the drudgery of document processing. As if caressed by a lascivious incubus who sulks secretly into an innocent maiden's bed chamber at night, my senses were overwhelmed by the fruity concoction.      &#160;&#160; I fell prostrate before the delicious smoothie god. I am not, typically, a religious person. Yet, as I ride up the escalator in the morning, my rationality is uncomfortably disturbed by the tug of the smoothie shop in the next building. I yearn to guzzle a cold, seed-filled, pink drink. I can almost feel it drizzling down my throat and filling my stomach with Lunar Lemony goodness. Heaven should be this concrete. Tofu should be this tasty.      &#160;&#160;Fortunately, the smoothie's healthy image is a fraud. Store produced smoothies often contain more calories then a standard Big Mac and this is without the addition of extras like chocolate chips and health supplements. Therefore, 'fattie foodies' like myself, need not be frightened from the lush alter of the smoothie.

      When Ol' Shel McMahon's chilen' was quite tiny and smallish, she used to labor inside her home in order to begat them a proper raisin' up. Her chilen', them's poor things, had varieties of ills. Espec'ly the scourge of beings a father lack'n. The trag'dy being that nones of them's fathers never was espec'ly stuck on Ol'Shel. See Ol' Shel is a rather broad femmy, both in face and in form. Often she occurs to be rather 'hirestute', as doc. jim robeson would say, meaning she was hairy. Her voice lacked the more femmy qualities of a woman. But she always seemed to have an abundance of manly callers. Howsever, now en days, Ol'Shel works at the local Pac 'N' Pay 'cross from the 'illage loitery farm. She rings up tobaccy sticks and poison juice for the genilemen who's work all day. The tobaccy sticks, they's 'ythethic, meanin' impost'res and mean 'spensive. The mens who's labor'd in the loitery farms 'lways 'served theres pon's for em. Some even' hid theres wify's pon's. Ol'Shel always had a sort of sad disp'sition, like she was a waitin' for some fool to die or maybe 'nyone.   There was eh day when Ol'Shel, she rang up some rag from the outter loit'rys. The loit'rys whichs grew them large an'mals that the gov's call'd cows and wh're ours lech would sprout from. That rag, like alls em from 'nether the collection, didn't no have 'nough coups to purch'se her dire nescessities. She's was a 'ather tall 'un, with longish hair, the type u 'air that I didn't think was 'llowed in the outter loitrys. An' was she eve' overbig, she did look like she'd been pliferin' from the feed.

      	I’m exaggerating. Nevertheless, the city embodies a lassiez faire quality. A talk show radio host once announced an ingenius plan to eradicate the city’s homeless by hiring a caravan of Greyhounds and shipping them to San Francisco, where they would be sure to experience a more inviting, if not lucrative, environment. The show’s listeners wholeheartedly embraced the idea. Some offered to donate money, others to print t-shirts, and still others to attend benefits to raise the bus fare.  Houstonians are nothing, if not good hearted.   	Yet they are. The inhabitants of this swampland are unabashedly friendly and helpful. In the grocery store, they will open the door to a freezer that contains cut-rate pot pies for a woman overburdened with  impulse buys and a significant lack of planning. They will even place the ever-tantalizing pot-pie into her overflowing arms and offer to get her a cart. In the office, they will learn your name even though you were never formely introduced to them and they will greet you each day and laugh with you when you do something silly. At the beach, they will offer to help you get your little car unstuck from the wet sand, even though they also have only a compact car, and they will wait and make sure that the your vehicle gets loose. They will offer you a proxy life. An entry into their world, free of strings, vengefulness, or spite and even when you self-destruct, they won’t make a huge fuss. Above all they smile and say ‘hi’.   	Despite the polluted, cloudy skies, the empty husks of Enron and the Astrodome, the overcrowded highways, the university student committing suicide in protest of war, an subtle leitmotiv of optimism pulsates through the city.  It goes on. It works.   	Iranian exiles protest the theocracy in their native  land in front of an Islamic school financed by the Iranian government.

      	Allow me to regale you with the horror and majesty that is Houston, Texas. Beneath the haze of humidity coupled with particulates of industrial waste, lies a vast capitalist haven of un-zoned lots and haphazard high-rises. Houston is the backwater bastard child of the United States. It has neither has the impenetrable pretentious ness of New York City nor the glamorous cachet of Los Angeles. Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States, is ultimately an oil city. Houston is southern. It is the sticky reservoir that drives the economy. From the towers of downtown you can see the refineries do their work. The lights atop the stacks are lit and the smoke lingers in the air long enough to create a semi-translucent shield over the entire metropolitan sky.   	The city stretches. It reaches and extends itself throughout the vast expanse  of a land that was once a swamp.  The bayous, the stifling humidity, the endless summer and spring rainstorms, the random crocodile in quiet suburbia are necessary reminders of the metropolis’ past. Amidst the expanse of skyscrapers, hotels, and tract homes there  is certain cohesion,  a singularity of purpose, a reason for a madness  that necessitates a modicum of pure freedom;  a freedom to build whatever you what, wherever you want. Take  the  typical  strip bar owner, in any other city he or she may have to brave countless restrictions and zoning regulations. Indeed, he or she may be restricted from building in certain residential or business areas, however, in Houston this is not typically the case. So one may take a leisurely ride or stroll along Westheimer, a vastly important throughfare, and encounter many a strip bar integrated with various commercial and residential establishments.  This is beauty.

                     As I leisurely munched on pretzels and surfed the 'net during my Thursday lunch break, I stumbled upon an interesting article about an insidious little plan to track discount household goods with tiny radio transistors. These clever devices would be used to fatten the often thin profit margins of superstore behemoths like Wal-Mart by monitoring the location and quantity of common products like razor blades, chiclets, and orange Fanta. Of course that location could be your vehicle, your bathroom, and ultimately that pleasant little sanctuary you call your garbage can.           Perturbed and anxiously wanting to learn more, I moved on to a website whose owner's ultimate mission is to see the demise of all consumer tracking devices. The F.A.Q astutely warns readers that they may be giving up more than their signature and address when signing up for that plastic count card. Indeed, the hapless consumer may be giving up his or her soul. They may be signing away their very life force, whatever that is, to the owners of   BIG GROCERY .           Folks, I, your brave scribe, own one of those very cards. I succumbed to the temptation after many weeks of trekking to the Krogers, the closest grocer to my meager apartment, and noticing that the bill for my typical purchase of beer and pumpkin seeds was considerably larger then what I had been used to spending at the large grocer near my former abode. One day, adamantly determined to lower my beer bill, I marched right up to the customer service desk and requested an application for the Supersaver card.             Little did I know that I was actually applying to Supersave my soul right to hell! Allow me to aimlessly buctherize a pertinent quote in the bible. Somewhere in Revelation before all the odd, genetically altered creatures fall to the floor in fealty before the Almighty or perhaps afterwards, the angel gave John the ultimate catch 22, receive a tattoo in such unsightly and highly unfashionable places as your forehead or right hand, or die. By 'die' the angel was basically referring to the fact that if someone refused to take the infamous mark they wouldn't be able to buy or sell food, rather they would be hunted down and used as 'man meat' and eaten as biscuits by demonic locusts from the nether dimensions of, well, hell.         Today, I realized that I had inadvertently taken the mark of the beast when I signed up for my Kroger's Supersaver card. I cannot buy supposedly discount food without scanning the little card on my keychain into the barcode reader. I have forfeited my at inheriting the vast, majestic majesty of God's love and good graces. To be sure, I won't become locust feed, but neither will I taste the wonder of the divine.

      Check it out, they updated this biatch! Okay, admittedly, they probably did this a while ago and I've just figured it out. I came up with three new story ideas today. Most likely, they are highly pedestrian and have undoubtedly been done before. However, since there are only seven original stories in the whole world, I think that it wouldn't be too nuts if I wasted my time writing them. Nuts, I have to scan.

Occasionally, they carry some very nice things at reduced prices and for those willing to wade through racks upon racks of mismatched clothing some nice deals can be had. I am not able to remain in Marshalls for any extended period of time. I am inexplicably bewildered by the shear mass and variety of steeply discounted, brand name clothing. However, I was determined to procure for myself some cute and sexy underwear, and because this would be my first attempt at purcha

      I dislike taking showers on Sunday. Sometimes I go to work on Sunday, but I don't take a shower before I do. Every now and then, when I'm feeling especially heretic or when I'm at my mom's house and feeling guilty, I go to church. I don't take a shower then either. I'm one dirty ho. Baby Jesus doesn't like it when I take showers on Sunday. Sunday is the Christian day of rest. People shouldn't clean themselves on Sunday, unless they happen to be priests or pastors because they are performers and they wouldn't want to be all smelly and stuff for their congregations. They don't want their already dwindling flock to run away because they smell as if they just swam across the Rio Grande. They don't want to smell like mojados.I'm neither a priestess nor a pastoress (sure), so I can be smelly on Sunday. I can sit here and stink. I like to drink mojitos on sunday too.

      Contrary to popular belief, the process known as 'darwinisim' by some and 'evolution' by others, is a theory. It has yet to be conclusively proven. In fact, many commonly held scientific beliefs are actually theories that remain unproven and therefore, should not be taught by the public school system. I shall list a few.  1. the moon landing  2. the earth is round  3. you don't smell    Damnit I'm bored! Go here -->  urlLink  Creation Science Fair 2001

      The art of crafting a perfectly contoured eyebrow does not come easily to me. Not only am I mostly disinterested in the task, I'm also quite inept at it. My first problem is that I rarely choose to work on them when there is enough light to make apparent all the nasty little ingrown hairs and design imperfections. My second problem is that I'm lazy. I tend to attack the problem with little zest, and with only the most rudimentary of tools, namely tweezers, a small mirror, and one of those plastic eyebrow bush thingies. My only ambition is thin out my naturally bushy brows. To be sure, I am no Frida Kahlo. My brows do not arch downward and touch defiantly. Rather, they simply grow and creep. The black hairs appear insolently above my eyelids.   Hair is both a blessing and a curse. I desire long, straight hair. I do not wish to keep my bushy brows. However, it took me a while to figure this out. In junior high school, I belonged, quite comically given my relatively short stature, dumpy body, and graceless movements, to the basketball team. I was the focus of much silent ridicule. It has become painfully clear to me that contrary to my past perception that the other girls were just jealous of my exotic good looks, or budding super-heroine powers, their laughter was quite rightly directed at my bushy eyebrows. I've come to this conclusion because I recall a conversation in which one of the girls inquired if I had ever plucked my eyebrows.   At fourteen, I was much more clueless then I am now. I was caught up in my very own naive 'California teenage fantasy'. There was little doubt in my mind that someday a car would hit me while I was crossing the street. Thus I would require quite a bit of cosmetic surgery. The doctors would mold my face into that of stunning maiden, replace my unmanageable frizzy hair with sleek, shiny black hair, and suck the out of the many folds in my stomach. I would also get a brand new set of fashionable clothes with the settlement money. After six months of intense, life changing struggle, I would emerge from a plaster cocoon and wow the town with my beauty. So, the ridicule didn't quite faze me.   I didn't start plucking my eyebrows until I got into college, because my younger sister taught me how to go about it.  I wasn't the most attentive pupil. Now every week or so I trudge out my sad little instruments of torture and haphazardly go about the arduous task. I can't stop plucking now because then all the hairs will start coming out funny, or thicker, or something. Where's that damn car already?

      I'm just not qualified to do anything. I lack the fundamental skills required of any office-drone. I can't sell anything. My cold calling technique is postively obscene. The only thing that I can do is opine obliquely about random subjects that nobody cares about such as Russian history or the problems with eminent domain or string theory. No wonder no one will hire me. Pooh. :(

        Yesterday, after submitting my resume to Barnes & Noble, I noticed that a Linens & Things was opening in the lot adjacent to the apartment complex where I reside. I decided to call the number on the billboard that was advertising employment opportunities. Today, I attended their job fair. It turned out to be a rather dismal affair. The interviewers were set up in a converted motel room at the Comfort Inn and a recruitment tape looped on a small tv set in the corner. The interview itself was no better. He, my interviewer, informed me that he had only been with the company for a few months and given that his manner and questions were fairly pedestrian and awash in managerial naivete, I believed him. He told me that they were hiring 100 temporary workers to help set up the store. The pay was 6.50 and hour and if I were good enough, I might be hired full time. This satisfied me since I haven't been employed at that rate for about 5 years and I think it would feel good to return to my roots.       When I was informed that I would have to take an Employment Profile test prior to my application being considered, I felt my opportunity to work in the fast paced and exciting world of textiles slip away. The questions ranged from a practical assessment of simple math skills to the  measure of a person's physiological prowess for working in a well lit, blanket filled environment. The latter gave me the most difficulty. I could not answer them with any kind of confidence or honesty. After all, how many times have I weighed what I would do if I caught a fellow associate smoking crack ? Doesn't answering that I would tell the supervisor about the incident go against my natural libertarian instincts of live and let live? What if I were to join in? Would partaking in the sweet succulence of cheap cocaine byproducts really prevent me from folding towels properly?       Is there no job for Tab?! Perhaps there is, however, for now I shall go back to searching and to learning all the words to  The Song of The Major General  .   I am the very model of a modern major...

       Just as soon as this show breaks for commercial, I'm going to go out and get us all some of that deliciously refreshing Groovy Lord Lovin' cola. Manufactured by the wholesome and god-fearing congregation at the Rapture Ready Evangelical Church Of Jesus Christ Is Lord, Groovy Lord Lovin' is the drink of the new pre-tribulation generation. Its sugar-free, caffeine-free, additive-free taste is sure to become the mark of those of us who are most beloved by God.    Now I know y'all are warning me not to waste my time and I hear yea! But, if I didn't think that this drink was sure to save a few souls, would I be taking my shiny, new yellow Hummer out to the store? Of course not! That would be the act of a proud woman, and I, for one, am not a proud woman. I'm humble enough to know that I am a sinner, and in fact, y'all are too. So how 'bout putting a few dollars on the table? Pitch in for the juice folks! Its this or damnation and I know y'all don't want to be standing in anticipation at the gates of Heaven only to find Saint Peter release the hell dogs on you.   Nate, no, no, that's not a threat, its a fact. You've just been reborn. I don't think that wading through the pollution filled waters of our local, man-made lake instantly qualifies you as a biblical scholar. Give me that fiver, son! Should you call that Rachel? I think you certainly should, Jews must be saved and if this tantalizing new beverage will help 'em reach golden gates then, by golly, we must stock our refrigerator with it.    Just wait until I tell Pastor Ned. Just think, one day, we'll be going about our ordinary tasks. Nate, you'll be refurbrishing those antique stools that you found at that estate sale and Chrissy, you'll be doing ol' Ms. McGovern's hair when suddenly, out of nowhere, the sky will open up and y'all will be welcomed into the presence of the Lord. Be sure to kneel now! Remember to wear clean underwear. Won't the Lord be proud when he sees those empty cans of Groovy Lord Lovin' sitting next to where your physical temples used to be?

           I like to pretend that I'm not bitter, but these days, I damn well am. After enduring eleven grueling months as wage whore at Fulbright & Jaworski, LLP, I decided to call it quits. Grant it, the decision was rather impulsive, or not, because in truth it had been festering inside my brain since my second or third week on the job. So after immaturely calling my immediate supervisor 'dude' and making a hysterical scene, I submitted a terse and simple letter of resignation and left the job for another, more patient and more robotic soul.       It wasn't until this evening, however, that I realized the full crappiness of my job. Today, I stumbled upon the advertisement for my former position on www.monster.com. Its a pretty fair description of the job - being called a 'young lady', scanning documents with the forced precision and dedication of a death row inmate partaking of his last meal, burning cds, mindlessly drumming your head against the edge of a desk for countless of hours on end, and being scolded for being unable to perform mundane tasks with a hundred percent accuracy. They failed to mention the impossibility for advancement and the IT guys with History and Business Administration degrees who assume that anyone without a penis also lacks computer knowledge and skills. Everyone in the Operations department at Fulbright is a man! It's crazy.     They are seeking someone with only 2+ years of college. I feel inadequate. Did someone just chop off my nonexistent balls? Its become cliche to point out that a college degree from an ivy league university gets us ordinary, poor folks, no where these days, but its my turn to moan.

        For the longest time I assumed that Dick Cheney had permanently fallen off a deep, dank ditch. I thought that his cheese encrusted arteries had finally burst. Or that, perhaps, some insidious flight attendant had lured him to an Illuminati sponsored kegger where the booze had flowed so freely that Mr. Cheney, so overwhelmed and flustered by the sheer decadence of the moment, could not help but to dive into a pool of milk where he subsequently died due to a severe case of lactose intolerance. Imagine my utter surprise when good ol' Dickie showed up at Rice University last week.     My epic battle with unemployment had finally reached a temporary trough when I decided to take a job as a caterer, i.e. a waitress. To my utter delight, it turned out that the VP himself was the guest of honor at my first 'gig'. I saw him. I served his peers, associates, and intimates. I heard a few lame jokes. I did not kill the Mr. Cheney, although from what I saw, it probably would not have been too difficult to pull off.     Seriously, I expected snipers, helicopters, and maybe a ninja. Instead, a couple dozen off duty police officers milled around the tents while some hyper serious secret service types ordered us lowly food jockeys to keep our dirty paws of the VP's precious vehicle. Dismayed by the utter lack of proper security, I decided that in the case of any dire emergency that I, Tab, would risk my life to save the Vice President.     So since I was also fairly bored, I started to pretend that I had been implanted by a secret government agency to protect the life of Mr. Cheney. Who would ever suspect the little mes'can woman in a crowd of similarly short and brown waitstaff? Assuming an expression of stark seriousness, I moved about my tasks with all the prowess of a woman with chubby little unmuscular limbs. My assignment was simple. I was to manipulate my position as a banquet waitress to maintain a keen intelligence on activities of the caterers and waitstaff. If I spotted anything untoward I was to report it to one of the secret service agents. I was also authorized to make split second decisions if I deemed it necessary. For example, if my serving partner had had the audacity to throw his shoe at the Vice president, I would have necessarily had to lunge forward and throw myself in front of the V.P., thereby taking the blow of the black sneaker.    I had been given no easy task, however, the reward of knowing that Mr. Cheney would live to send more troops to fight other unnecessary wars and to pocket more profits from his vast oil interests made it all worth while.

       On rainy Sunday afternoons, after the well-dressed have emerged from the confines of warehouse-like houses of worship, they often rush  home to feast on the mayhem that is Sunday afternoon football. Yesterday, however, they were all invited to partake in the delights and adventure offered by their very familiar and distant friends, whose two young sons where celebrating their sixth and seventh birthday parties, respectively. The parents of these two young squires had stumbled upon a plethora of good fortune upon graduating from a  Texas agricultural university years earlier and had subsequently been graced with the ability to purchase a substantial piece of land some miles west of the huge metropolis in which they made their home. Disappointed by the dusty and uncultivated terrain, the couple arranged for the planting of grass and the creation of a large fishing pond and of a flattened polo field. Some months later, the property was deemed ready for utilization.   So it was on a rainy and hot mid-November morning that the help arrived to set up for the festivities. The couple, wishing to make their sons' party a smashing success, had hired a catering company, an event company who traveled equipped with a climbing wall, a trampoline, and a dunking booth, and the "crocodile Man Traveling Show" which featured three live crocs, a cobra, and a pair of adorable caiman crocodiles. The catering staff conversed about the difficulty of finding the 'farm', the absurdity of wearing tuxedo pants and dress shirts to work a child's party, and the minor humiliation of being deemed of a 'lower class' by the guests of the events they staffed. They also speculated as to whether or not many guests would show, given the monstrous thunderstorms that were plaguing the Houston metropolitan area. These thoughts dissipated as the clouds cleared and newly planted green grass sparkled ligthly underneath the winter sun.     The humidity increased ten-fold with the withering away of the clouds. The guests arrived. Mothers and fathers in jeans and t-shirts complained about the rain and the heat and complimented their most gracious hosts on the beauty of the 'farm'. Some children whisked their parents away to fish while the catering staff ran down a hill after them with pitchers of cold lemonade and peach iced-tea. Others ogled the reptiles who languished within a horse's trailer specially fitted with plexi-glass to allow for optimal viewing.    The bees arrived sometime after the first guests. They were no doubt informed of the abundance of sweet liquids by a formidable scout and soon were overwhelming the drink table. They attached themselves to mouths of the iced tea pitchers and struggled to push themselves into open cans of the sugary soft-drinks. Quickly, they swarmed around the member of the catering staff who had been designated as the 'drink lady'. The drink lady was initially quite skittish about the situation. She had never been stung and sincerely hoped never to experience the revenge of a severely irritated bee. However, the drink lady had been given a task of utmost importance and that task was to served drinks to little kids and their Aggie parents. The drink lady was determined to complete her mission and so she engaged in an elegant ballet with the hungry insect insurgents. She filled and poured the plastic glasses with care and efficiency, gracefully dodging and avoiding the buzzing bees. Soon she lost her hostility toward the magnificent little creatures which had accosted her and her wares. She was lost in a subtle dance with them, their movements becoming hers and hers theirs until their thirst was, at last, substantially quenched by a single glass half-filled with Sprite which she had carefully placed away from the majority of the guests. At the end of the day, the drink lady could not help but shake her fist a little at the injustice of life, when, alas, she spied the body of a bloated, little yellow bee floating lifelessly in a vat of semi-sweetened lemonade.

      Boy do I lack judgment, common sense, and foresight. Now I'm positive that I shouldn't have quit my job. I should have just bit my lip and bowed my head in utter remorse. I wonder if its too late to beg for my job back. Hmmm....I think I'm on some sort of blacklist. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a job. Have I complained about this before? Great! Deja vu! Will you please rehire me? I need to wash my clothes. I mean consider this a long vacation. I won't take another for a year. Hell, I don't even need benfits. I just need 12 to 14 dollars an hour so I can pay for my dumb, expensive schooling. Can I sue my university since no one will hire me?

      My friend Davy is a hillbilly. He comes from verdant mountains of Appalachia.  As a youth he was drawn to the hilly pastures and the animal delights of his uncle's farm. At the tender age of nine, he was give responsibility over a small calf named Bessie. His uncle said, "Stand tall now, young Davy! For yonder is my gift to thee. A young calf for you to raise and do with as you will. Treat her rightly lad, for she comes from the mystical Swedish lands!"  Davy did as charged and treated Bessie with the greatest respect. Soon she grew to be a large, robust cow with breasts full of milk. And so, Davy milked her. Grabbing and squeezing her large nipples, he took pride in getting the milk for his family's breakfast table. When Davy was 13, he was walking through the pasture as he did every afternoon. However, on this day, when spied Bessie eating her grass, he heart and other things moved in a funny way that he had never experienced before. Frightened, he ran home. However, he cold not contain his burdgeoning  urlLink  passion   and so thrust himself at Bessie. And so he was released and fell into a mad lust for the Swedish beast.

          Brian Greene contends that time is  urlLink subjective . This is probably true, so I wonder what the implications of this are for us regular human beings. A couple of years ago, a character named John Titor appeared on internet message boards. He claimed that he was from the future with the hope of procuring a rather obscure computer from the 1970s. After his 'departure' in early 2002, and indeed, even prior to it, Titor and his story developed a large internet  urlLink following . The probability, of course, is that someone had a great time play acting the role of a hardened time traveler from a not so distant and somewhat familiar time. But is it so improbable that this man did come from some 'future'? I think he could have.      Anyhow, I'm rambling on today, but I guess the point is that I like to think that time and reality and all this bullshit is subjective and stuff. Admittedly, I probably don't understand theoretical quantam physics as much as I would like or maybe at all.

      Was Ralph Nader a   SPOILER  candidate in 2000? Let's take a look at the recent history of elections results where a 3rd party candidate ran, by popular vote:  1924: Calvin Coolidge (54.04%), John Davis (28.82%), Robert LaFollette (16.60%) 1932: Franklin Roosevelt (57.41%), Herbert Hoover (39.65%), Norman Thomas (2.23%) 1936: Franklin Roosevelt (60.80%), Alfred Landon (36.55%), William Lemke (1.95%) 1948: Harry Truman ( 49.55%), Thomas Dewey (45.07%), J. Strom Thurmond (2.41%), Henry Wallace (2.37%) 1968: Richard Nixon (43.42%), Hubert Humphrey (42.72%), George Wallace (13.53%)  1980: Ronald Reagan (50.75%), James Carter (41.01%), John Anderson (6.61%) 1992: George Bush (37.45 %), Bill Clinton (43.01%), Ross Perot ( 18.91%  )  1996: Robert Dole ( 40.71%), Bill Clinton (49.24%), Ross Perot (8.40%) 2000: George W. Bush (47.87%), Al Gore (48.38%), Ralph Nader (2.73%)   spoiler???   Come on! Is someone actually going to argue that getting a miseasly 2.73% of the popular vote makes one a spoiler candidate?  I still argue that Al Gore ran a crappy election. More people probably sat out the election entirely then voted for Mr. Nader.  I think its fair to say that Ralph Nader was as much a spoiler in 2000, as Strom Thurmond was in 1948. I argue that a 3rd party candidate should get at least 5% of the vote in order to be considered a spoiler.  This is simply common sense, because there are so many other factors going on in an election (especially when the election is close) that to give a 3rd party candidate who got a bare pittance of votes any credit in the determination of an election is, I think, giving him too much credit. In fact, in 2000, one could combine the votes of all the other 3rd party candidates and find that, they too were spoilers, since they got 1.01% of the vote.  Hell, had Gore gotten those votes, he could have won!  (Of course, if Gore wasn't such a wanker, he still probably coulda won.)  Thanks to http://www.uselectionatlas.org for having a great compilation of statistics and "what if" scenarios from every U.S. election since our little polity was founded.

I really do admire Mr. Moore's ability to wreck havoc on the rich, white, elite men of American society while sitting in his elaborate Manhattan apartment, stroking his beard, and mostly like consuming copious amounts of exotic Dos Ecces.  I admire the fact that he has cohorts of supporters and he's like rich and fat. Its just so damn American and that's why I admire Mr. Michael Moore.

       Today,  urlLink Slate  columnist David Plotz tried to make sense out of what he sees as a blacklash against  urlLink New York Times  columnist, David Brooks.  This in of itself did not bother me.  It was an interesting   urlLink article , albeit a bit insular.  It is the sort of piece that journalists write for their fellow journalists.  Quite frankly, we non-journalists could care less about how David Brooks' peers view David Brooks.     But I digress from my original point which was that Plotz made the following interestingly ignorant statement about the 1990s:"the world was at peace."  Unfortunately this sentiment is not uncommon among journalists and lay persons.  However, it willfully ignores the fact that the the United States was involved in at least 3 (possibly many more, but I don't feel like researching right now) wars during the mid to late 1990s, including continuing hostilities in Iraq as we and the British enforced the "no-fly zone".    That the larger media conveniently ignored our bombing of Kosovo (because we did it under the auspices of the U.N.) or the constant attacks on U.S. interests by Islamic terrorists (from the first World Trade Center bombing to the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole), indicates less a lack of world conflict during the 1990s then a lack of concern among the New York and Washington elites.  That in itself is disturbing.  More disturbing is the media's continued insistence that the "world was at peace" in the 1990s.

      I'm going to lose my scholarship.  I've yet to receive my grade in Torts, however, since I need at leat an A to keep my scholarship...well..suffice it to say that I am not holding my breath.  I am going to lose my scholarship.   The breakpads on my caro need to be replaced (aka gray ford focus, sad little columbia license plate holder on back...wave at me) and so does one rotor.  The damage? $140, unless the nice lady at the dealership can get under my warranty. Now wouldn't that be nifty?    Finally, If I want to go to law school full-time this fall, I'll need someone (Bueller, Bueller, anyone, anyone!) to cosign a nice fatty (~4000 to 8000) loan for me.

          I'd like to say goodbye to a great hero of mine who valiantly led us to victory over the evil communist scum while making tax cuts and small government popular again - Ronald Reagan, good bye.  As I type, the tears do not quite brim in my eyes, but my mind does wander to that essay I wrote in the second grade in which I too denounced communism and extolled the virtues of the free enterprise system with all the verbal liquidity of an eight year old.  The essay won me a position as a junior grand marshall in the New Years Day parade (or Thanksgiving Day Parade, but I forget), and thus, my career as a wishy washy, but awfully proud libertarian began.     When I was eight, I believed that Ronald Reagan was actually Ronald McDonald.  I happened to love McDonalds, as it was the place my sisters and I were often taken by my father, a long haul truck driver. You can imagine, then, my utter delight at discovering that Ronald McDonald was the President of the United States.  Of course, I immediately decided that I too would want to be president someday, but my parents bought me an astronaut barbie for Christmas and she rode around in a gray convertible.  Nevermind, I would combine both lofty ambitions. I would become the first female president to hang out with the astronauts in space while eating a lot of greasy happy meals.

        My Contracts II professor is a slim and compact man. He is quite an improvement over my Contracts I professor who had all the teaching charisma of forgotten golf ball stuck in a muddy puddle.  Suffice it to say, I did not get a very good grade in his class.  Don't get me wrong.  I certainly don't blame his lack of ability to coherently explain the magical miasma that is promissory estoppel or the Statute of Frauds for my dismally average grade.     Rather, I prefer to blame the whimsical bell curve.  I've never fallen squarely in the middle of the bell curve.  Instead, I've always teetered precariously on the downward slope.  Alas, I'm just slightly above average, bright enough to understand the basics, the moderately difficult concepts, to be able to read about the genius I wish I was, but not (sadly) able to emulate the great minds of history.   So, bell curve! Maddening, monstrous, mischievous bell curve! Bell curve, I shake my brown fist at thee!  May science smite you with its analytical tongue! May my guinea pig poop on you! Poop!

      What? Mexican-Americans (aka. The largest population of so called Latinos, Hispanics, greasers, maids, etc in the U.S.) aren't all the same?&nbsp; Well knock me up (again), get me a taco, and call me Lupe!   urlLink  "But courting Hispanics is complicated and nuanced in a state where some families of Spanish heritage trace their lineage back to the 17th and 18 centuries and others are more recent arrivals from Mexico and other Latin American nations."   It is finals time again. :( mooooooooooooooo

       "I'm listening but I may or may not agree."   I finally saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last evening.  It was entertaining, edgy, funny, and emotionally evocative.  It was classic Moore.   It was also somewhat, well, boring.  The endless humdrum of Bush bashing, corporate bashing, and capitalism bashing got old after about, say, forty-five minutes.  I suppose, to true believers or to those who don't know any better, it was probably not at all boring.   I wanted to walk out not so much because I disagree with Mr. Moore's thesis (which as far as I could gather amounted to "Please, please, please vote for Kerry or we're all going to hell."), as because I'm pretty well-informed.  No, not just nightly news, New York Times, Washington Post, The Economist informed, I'm also studies, books, listening to all sides informed.  Yeh, I'm tooting my own horn and being condescending and all, but quite frankly, Moore's documentary consists mostly of old news cleverly chopped to form a bitter and emotionally charged polemic.  Wait, not just old news, but stale, old claptrap that any politics/policy/world affairs wonk would have already gathered, and gathered in CONTEXT.     It bothers me that nothing was put in the context, not just of current affairs, but also in the context of history.  It bothers me that the movie is labeled "documentary" when really its just a Rush Limbaughsian propaganda film tailored to the "don't tell me too much details, just feed my emotions" masses.  It bothers me that no one, not Mr. Moore, not Mr. Limbaugh, not Mr. Bush, is clearly explaining that nothing about terrorism is simple and that they are unsure about what to do about it.     This whole terrorism thing was, at least, 60 years in the making.  Its not all our (the U.S.) fault, but we do have some culpability.  Its the product of historical forces and the answer to the problem is as elusive as its origins.    I'm going to now read a whole lot about the Ottoman Empire, WWI, and the formation of the modern day middle east from non-biased historians.  I suggest you do the same and form your own opinions.  Oh and if you must vote for someone, well good, you should vote!

          Ultimately it was the broken side mirror on my Ford Focus that forced me to conclude that I would not need to take the sertaline pills anymore.  The past two weeks have been pretty bad.  I faced the possibility of abrupt homelessness because of my freakishly slovenly ways. (My kitchen cleaning and pet poop picking up skills are not as good as they could be. Priorities, priorities...)  My calling capabilities were revoked by the evil capitalists at Cingular Wireless.  I had to borrow time and money from a friend.  I'm going to be forced to prepare for class at the library, because I can't afford books for a week or so.  My sertaline tablets ran out.        This morning I accidently broke my side mirror while backing out of one of the parking spaces of my sleek new abode and instead of just totally losing it, because, well, my life sucks the big greasy one, I stopped the car, ran into my apartment and found a roll of duck tape.  urlLink  Duck tape , as you are probably aware, is one of the most versatile and useful products known to man.  Duck tape can be used to fix broken things, paste loose things together, correct  urlLink  bad writing , tie naughty people up, get someone out of a sketchy situation, and make bombs, bongs, and other tools necessary for everyday existence.  Luckily the mirror was still in its black casing and hanging on by the cord that allows a driver to control its  movements from inside the vehicle, so all I had to do was fit casing back on to the side of the car and tape it together with a couple of pieces of duck tape.       Ahh to live in America at such a technologically wonderous time is, in a word, bliss.
