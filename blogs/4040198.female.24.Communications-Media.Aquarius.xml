       Looks like all that backstreet mocking finally got to Nick Carter. Looks like he took his rage from being forced into showbusiness at an early age (and seeing his little brother get with hotter girls than him) and put a well-manicured hand on girl-toy Paris... seems today the papers are reporting  urlLink Paris is burning , er, bruising. Oh Par, I bruise easily too. It is probably just our fragile psyches...

       Personally, I think   urlLink this  is the cause of  all the "negative energy brought forth by unfriendly and envious stares, unkind glances and looks of ill will." Especially if you wear it out in New York City. But hey, it's a HOT BUY.... wait a second, it's a $26 piece of string! I wonder, how many celebs are currently sporting makeshift dime-store red thread, not blessed by some prayer and tied on by a long-suffering assistant?  You're right, they'll never know the difference.

       so now that the rush of going to press is over, I can return to my other passion- searching fruitlessly in a savage city for an apartment I can afford. In a hopelessly trendy area. Okay, okay, I will take three blocks away from said trendy area. I can walk it when I need a cup of artesian-blended coffee. What I won't be able to take is when Williamsburg hits the shitter and everyone is flooding Queens, and I won't be able to get my currently un-fabulous apartment back. My big bone to pick is that I was born within city limits, I suffered through the public schools, and I currently pay out my nose tax after tax, and I can't stay. I won't be able to raise my unconcieved/unborn children here. How can I ensure that they grow up as wise and cynical as me if they are playing in a fenced-in yard all their lives? In Pennsylvania?

       I just saw this really weird item on channel 4. Len Berman told me that during the Met's abysmal 19-10 loss in Montreal tonight, Todd Zeile had to take the mound to throw knuckleballs after Franco got himself kicked out of the game. Probably because he is a jerk, or at least plays like one. Last I head, Todd Zeile plays first base... or third... depending on the day, but he's not a pitcher. Please Art- I like you. You might be missing Bobby V.'s passion, but you deserve a chance. Drag Duquette into the office by his ear, and tell him you want them out in this order: 1. John Franco 2. Joe McEwing 3. Mike Stanton 4. Mike Piazza You had better come up with two amazing pitchers and a slugger in time to make a run for it. Because, you know, ya gotta believe...  (UPDATE: Unfortunetly, it was not just  urlLink a bad dream ...)

       The only thing I love more than the Mets winning (which obviously left me wanting this weekend) are the Yankees getting  urlLink beat . Badly. By Boston. And A-rod having his pretty face smacked.

       I had a lovely lunch at the taco stand.  Not so much a taco stand as a little booth built into a wall in a non-descript office building in midtown. The security guards, however, are fully away of who is there for the tacos, and they are happy to guide first-timers downstairs into the crystal pavillion of 805 3rd Avenue.  Tucked away in a corner is Pampano Taqueria. Get the $8 lunch special, make sure one of your three choices of taco is the pulled pork, and take lots of limes.  Snag a seat in the sunshine, and enjoy a truly filling and fabulous meal. The chips are worth the carbs, and you can wash down that hot habanero hot salsa with your free soda.  Good company helps as well, and they can also tell you if there is a cilantro leaf stuck in your tooth.

       My alarm clock broke about a week ago, and too cheap to get a new one (plus, think about the breaking-in period where you are even later while you realize that is your new alarm clock going off and not your roommate's,) I have been chronically late to work since- and by late, I mean about 5 minutes after nine. This is late to me because I am forced to take the subway into work. See, I grew up in Queens where there is nothing wrong with taking the bus. I have bussed it all over this city, and while yes, ther smell of urine in the back where it is hot is sometimes unbearable, there is usually seating, it is a senic ride, and you can actually see where you are going. I used to express-bus it in from my parents house, and now there is a bus runs from the corner of my apartment building to the corner of my job. Why wouldn't I take it? Now, yes, there is the issue with traffic. Sometimes the bus crawls. But obviously you can't take it when you don't have time- that is like taking a cab during rush hour (if you can get one, the bastards.) Well, the subway is wearing thin. I have been touched and stared at in a way I thought people avoided when riding the subway. People fall off the platform and scream for help and people ignore them- why are you looking at me? Did I forget to wear a bra? Is there mascara all over my face? Yes. And, yes. I am going to buy an alarm clock today. I miss my bus.

       Why do journalists do what they do? I would imagine for many it is nosiness, curiosity, insatiable need to know what is going on... the ability to work on your own schedule against a deadline always helps, too. I hear rumors of people rolling into work at 10 a.m. and leaving shortly after. To, you know, work on a story. Meet a source. The important thing is that the work always gets done. The perks to being a journalist go beyond the posh lunches, seeing movies before the public does, being able to distance yourself from said public... The real perks are ones that most likely only a journalist would enjoy. Like knowing everything before anyone else. And at least once in any journalist's career they will have the chance to help someone, or a group of people. Getting their cause publicized, erasing stereotypes, that sort of thing. I had one of those moments today. I recieved a letter of thanks from the subject of my last story as well as a few others for dispelling a stereotype. I didn't even think I did, and I hope the piece was not too cookie-cutter public service, but it feels kind of nice. I was told it was the "best" story on the case There are downsides, of course. I am finding it hard to talk to people because I know a lot about almost everything. That darn curiosity, I soak things up like a sponge. An ex-boyfriend used to get extremely pissed everytime he would try and be the first to tell me about something, from the mundane yet entertaining, such as Paris Hilton's latest exploit, to the real, like the fire down the block... to which I would usually be able to reply, "Yeah, I heard about that." He was probably more like me and had the same thirst for knowledge and to get to a story first, but I still think it would have been wrong to dumb myself down. Hell, this is all I have going for me at this point.

       This afternoon my travels took me to a restaurant I probably had no business eating in.  urlLink Asiate  is very good, and though I found the broth that my red snapper was swimming in to be disarmingly similar to that which the Tribeca Grill floats their fish in. Which struck me as a little uninspired. However, the fish was incredibly fresh and lovely.  The place was, as my company called it, "dead posh" and deservedly so. The view was pretty cool, I find the 35th floor to be a good height because it is low enough to see things in detail (like this rock in central park that was scene to one of my early indescretions) but high enough to feel like a giant.  One thing I will enver get over is how The Service Industry In Manhattan could stand to remove the sticks from their behinds. Having worked as a server myself, and chilled with a lot of these otherwise fine folk, I find the transformation to utter and total bitch/male-bitch when on the job to be disarming. Now get me my soufflé!  Yes, the Mets won- again. No, I still can't watch them on Time Warner Cable. Yes, they will probably lose the weekend games that are broadcast on local TV.    I am making my first trip to Ikea this weekend. I know, I know... not normal for a twenty-something in a cramped apartment. For argument's sake, my apartment is actually huge now. Which is precicely why I am looking elsewhere. I can't stand the alternate reality this presents. I am supposed to stub my toe repeatedly or bang my head on a pipe because the place is too tiny and poorly arranged. I can do a cartwheel in my room. it is just not right. I feel like I am taking food out of the mouths of the poor. I'll shut up now.

       not much brewing today...   The Mets won, only making it harder to digest that they will not make the playoffs. It's like, take your place on the bench, kids. I am totally all about football now, anyway. Go Jets/Bears! Thursdays are great because I am on a rush the entire time. Now, when my co-workers see me napping at my desk or perusing Gawker, don't be fooled- that IS me on a rush. I am just pacing myself. But it is- it is the day I have to try to flesh stories out, I frantically scan the news for ideas, doings, and basically send out a ton of emails. I am not sure if this is how it is supposed to work. Either way, I like being busy rather than not. I am not a good person when I am bored. This week in the possibilities pool- a DJ, a Democrat wearing republican clothes, a lawyer, and phone cards... :::sigh::: On another plane alltigether, here are some nice  urlLink pictures  of what is probably the coolest building in all of Queens. Yes, I know that is not a difficult feat, but it should be of note to anyone who likes a good curve. There is news coming in that Jet Blue will take over (it has been closed since 2002) which is a good fit, I think. I took my first international flight from Terminal 5 to Lisbon about 4 years ago, alone, but the building made me feel like I was in an alternate universe anyway- it was a drug to help calm my nerves.

       Awww. Bob Murphy, who every kid in Queens remembers calling their Met games, died yesterday of cancer. I was well into my third glass of wine when I found out, and when I stumbled home, the memories rushing back to me, I wanted to call that call-in sports show on NY1. You know, to tell my story. THANK GOD I hung up before any damage was done. The guy screening the calls somehow missed that I was slurring my words-  A rough transcript:  Guy- "What's your name?"  Me- "Jiiiiilllll" Guy- "Whaddaya wanna talk about?" Me- "Bob Mur(hic!)phhhy.... the memmmories... from when I was a kid. I mean, I am young..." Guy- "How olda ya?" Me- "Tweeennnnny four?" Guy- "Allright, hold on"  And he put me on hold to talk to Tom, the host. I came to my senses after about 10 minutes of listening to the show on the phone and hung up. Had I gone on TV, using my real name, drunk... No. Just, no. But here I have to luxury of prattling on about said memories. I was never much of a baseball fan, I was somewhat pleased when they went on strike. Anything to piss my dad off at the time, who was probably thinking the same towards me. But looking further back, to when I was 6 or so, and the Mets could do no wrong, it was a simpler time. The sounds and smells and feeling is stronger than any visuals I get, but I know those summers were all about my dad sitting on the couch, watching the Mets with Murphy's voice absolutely blaring through the tiny TV speakers. The windows were open, it was a warm summer weekend day game, and I could smell grass that had just been cut (yes, that kind, too)... the sound of the bus tearing up the street, letting exhaust off to seep into the house... and Strawberry hits a line drive, which I know about thanks to Murphy's very distinct delivery. And my dad, alone in the living room, begins to clap for no one in particular.  Now, as a Time Warner Cable subscriber, I was unable to see the game yesterday. As my father, a long-suffering Mets fan, said, "At least you won't have to see them lose." Well, they didn't! In fact, they killed the Brewers in a show of, well, not much, as it  was  the Brewers. But they won, presumably "for the Murph," and gave sports fans and sports writers everywhere the chance to quote the man himself: "The Mets win the ballgame, they win the damn thing."  Mike Lupica outdoes himself with a  urlLink bittersweet  piece of sports journalism that Murphy would have blushed over in the  News  today. (Can you tell the old html tags are coming back to me?)

       I nearly wept after reading  urlLink this  stunningly accurate piece about the Met's evidently failed season. One reason was because, well, I am a Met fan and it just kills me to read how every little detail of the Metsies brief run at the pennant (albeit a fragile one,) fell apart game-by-game.  Secondly, because I would die to be able to to write a sports feature like that. The black cat part must have been a bit of editorial magic, though. What probably happened was that a black plastic bag blew across outfield. I've been in the Shea pressbox and saw a  Time's  hack reading  The Da Vinci Code  while one of the better games of the season took place below. Either way, the Mets have blown it.

       I love the Daily News. Really, I do. I admit to buying the cheap rag that is Page Six, oh, I mean The Post, but my heart lies with the News. Besides the superior writing and class, it is just a better voice for New York.  My reasons this week stem from their comprehensive coverage of Apollo's walk through Forest Park in Queens yesterday, including his short jaunt on the Jackie Robinson. How no one was killed is beyond me, but thank god. I used to drive that highway, if one could call it that, to Brooklyn College for a semester. Once I saw a dog hovering on the side of the road (there is no shoulder)  and I myself almost caused a pileup. In fact, I am still haunted at the thought of what happened to the poor thing.  Anyway,  urlLink here  is the News' story. And a link to the totally vital  urlLink cover   Oh, and  urlLink honey?  Obviously your m.o. ain't working. We need a win like nothing else in this world. Next time, try something different. And by the way, welcome to New York. Now shut up.

       Good for McGreevey. Not good that he resigned, but that took nerve. I hope someone wasn't standing on the side waiting to release incriminating photos or something. But this should set of a change in tide on how the rest of America thinks of the, you know, "gays"...  And on the day California renegs on all those marriages, no less.   UPDATE  Well, there WAS someone standing there, threatening to out him in an unseemly way... and evidently the NJ papers are laughing at our incredulousness.

       Holy Jesus Harold Christ. The apartment search is not for the faint of heart. Yesterday, I walked alongside the BQE, sidestepping shit (no, literal shit. I am not sure dog or human or what.) and broken glass. I got blisters. My blisters grew blisters. I jumped puddles, avoided maniac Acess-A-Ride drivers (I would never let my grandmother ride in one after seeing the drivers tear through local streets like they are on a go-kart track.) Then, it rained. Hard. I walked into a place this guy "Sam" keeps advertising on craigslist. His spelling and diction are horrid, so I figure the place is a dump if it is still available (Sam posts the same two apartments every day and has been trying to get rid of 111 Richardson Street for 4 months. We found out is it next to a Halal Chicken Slaughterhouse. (I would wait until the cool winter months when the stench is not so strong to try and rent it, Sam.)  The tenants were not there, so I had to imagine what it would looking like with my stuff it their place. Which was not hard, because much of their stuff was from IKEA. Which, when seen in the dark, dingy apartment, does not look so cool and Swedish. Also, there was the world's largest collection of Japanimation DVD's. I had no idea what they were about. It could have been porn. Japanimation porn is the absolute weirdest. Anyway, the place was literally on the BQE, so it was a no from the start. I need light, and the option to open my windows without soot filtering in. This was not, however, the worst part of the evening. Nothing quite topped the experience I had at King David Real Estate, which was my first stop. King David himself walks in and without a hello, a how are you, a thank you for choosing my business where I will charge you a 12% fee and use your personal info in unscrupulous ways, nothing. What we got was a question: "It's a 5th floor walkup. If you like the place when will you have the funds?" I conferred with my would-be roommate and came up with the 15th. Keep in mind, it was the afternoon of the 11th. "What I would do is come back here closer to the 15th and we'll show you whatever we have. I am not going to waster my time showing apartments if you are not serious" was the reply. The man would not listen to reason. We asked why we could not see it. We told him that is an integral part of the process. We even got so desperate to see it that told him we could give him a check that very day. He picked up a phone call and proceeded to ignore us.  I hate injustice. That was injustice.  As we left his dumpy office, the rain began. It rained until we reached Metropolitan, where I was ready to begin asking people on the street if they had a place for us to live. "We can write a check today!" I wanted to say.  SO UN. PROFESSIONAL.  Had it not been for the pear cider sustinence I recieved at Spyten Duyvil, (in a 20 oz. glass; I was legitimately buzzed) I would have not made it to the hovel on Grand Street. On the "other" side of the BQE. After we saw that place it rained agin. I got on a bus that brought me back to my neighborhood that I have been so scornful of and felt bad. It is Queens, it is my hometown and my home boro. I have two windows to shower me with sun and breeze in the morning. I have a view of the train and rooftops. That I have a rooftop at all is a coup of some sort. Granted, I have an extremely nosy landlord who can see into parts of my apartment but I keep it at bay.   I am sorry, oh beautiful large two-bedroom half a block from the subway! I am sorry I have foresaken you!

       every week I say the same thing after I finish a shitty story on Tuesday morning after staying up late on Monday night, not getting anything done: "Whew. I won't be doing that again."  And every Monday night, I start to get the pains, knowing that it will happen again. Then I go for a drink!

       'Tis a newsy day, but I am not sure how to get it all done by deadline! I saw Garden State this weekend. Really a good movie, and the plot is not so sappy and overdone that it is easily forgotten. The soundtrack is really, really good and is burning up my ipod. Then I went to IKEA for the first time. I say, build the damn thing in Red Hook. In fact, build one on every god-damned corner of the city, becasue there can never be enough IKEA. I used to think Target was the shit for cheap pressed-wood furnishings and home decor. I was young and naive then. Ikea uses real wood, and they are so much more fun and Swedish. I bought $120 worth of stuff at Target for $49 at IKEA. My roommate came home from a shopping trip there with a large bag of frozen Swedish meatballs. You just can't get that at Target. There will be a public memorial service for Bob Murphy at St. Patrick's Cathedral at 2 p.m. on Wednesday. I will be there, hopefully *sober* and keeping my  urlLink "memories"  to myself.  I have been putting out calls all morning and now we go into the waiting period. I hate that. At least I have story ideas for the next few weeks stored away. It was a most productive weekeng, story-mining wise. Then, just when I thought today was going to be all business, I stumbled across a website today and nearly died. A  urlLink Chilean cat blog . HOW CUTE!

       You may have noticed I enjoy going out to lunch to places where I am served. It gives my life strange new meaning.  urlLink Gente  is in your standard midtown setting but offers pasta cooked correctly, not an easy task as most restaurants would have you believe.  Al dente  is not a dirty word,and should be adhered to when making pasta. Anyway, the place was comfy, stylish and worth the trip. It gets busy around 1p.m., noon is the best time to go. I can vouch for its girly lunch charm.

       So, the Mets blow. Like, totally, hopelessly stink. I am not sure if they are even still playing, if they are back on tv at all, and if they are still losing. To make myself feel better, I have enlisted a few co-workers of mine to organize what is quickly becoming the 'dred company softball game.' I should have learned my lesson from a year ago when I took on a staff BBQ. What. A. Nightmare.  But alas, softball is all about the thrill of the game, the althleticism, and the fun. As well as the beer afterwards. And the Tylenol the next morning (Since we are all getting old now...) We had our second sparsely attended practice yesterday. There was high comedy (One poor soul drinking out of a water bottle left there by a group of players before us- he thought it was ours) , low comedy (in the form of ball jokes via the guys) and plenty of good plays. There is no real strategy, just power and smarts. Of course, this will only work if the other team is dumb and weak.

       I just bought (gasp!) the new Rilo Kiley cd at the recommendation of the guy at  urlLink stereogum.  and it seems pretty sweet thusfar. Mind you, I am only 1:03 into track three. Which I played first at his recommendation, as well.  As most of New York City, I don't buy cd's often. Except, of course, those liars that Time Out NY interviews on the street. 8 out of 10 of them claim to not download music. You are all dirty, filthy liars if you say that. So there. Speaking of my favorite websites, stereogum, et al, I am unsure of what to make of the new editor at  urlLink Gawker ,  urlLink Jessica Coen.  I don't mingle with the blogger community in nyc (is it me or do they all hang out every weekend at  urlLink MisShapes  or what?) so it is nothing personal. I just happened to think  urlLink Choire Sicha  was hysterical. She has large shoes to fill. Me, and my one faithful reader (thanks, Kathryn!) are just fine by ourselves at the Irish bar across the street where you can still smoke and the bartender is cute as pie. Warm, gooey apple pie.

       Yes, my friends, it is raining cats and dogs.  1. It's literally raining, and a dark grey cloud has enveloped the city 2. Two Irish businessmen got the  urlLink great idea  to launch a magazine about New York Dogs. Granted, they are a more pampered and sophisticated bunch than their suburban counterparts, I still question their judgement. Maybe they had a spare couple million lying around and no other ideas. It will feature haute coutre fashion spreads. Yes, the dogs will be wearing expensive clothing. My favorite part: Jimmy Breslin is writing a column for the magazine on how he, for one, does not like dogs.  3. On the other side of the animal fence, cats, who could care less about our petty human industrial pursuits, are getting their  urlLink own café  in Manhattan this week. Picture lots of cats being pried from the saftey of their carriers to hide behind things and insane multiple cat-lady owners running amok. Yours truly will be at the opening night party, trying to make sense of it all, and pocketing samples for the cats who live in the basement of my apartment building. Yes, the one I am leaving soon.
