      I often wonder the alterior motives of women who come out to the Backporch.  Of course this is a broad generalization, and there are always exceptions.  Moving right along...  Tonight there was a trio of ladies that sashayed into the bar about 11:30.  All three of them were fairly attractive, but at the same time it seemed they were trying way too hard to impress what I like to call the 'invisible element'.  One of them I recognized as one of the vetran dancers from Paulo's over on Fisher Street.  The other two seemed like they had been yanked right out of their freshman year, and poured into the uniform of the street walkers.  The blonde one had been really gutsy and was sporting a pair of black, vinyl, 5" silletto thigh high boots.  Amusingly enough, she looked realistic enough...if that's the look she was going for...until she started walking, or trying to.  Inevitatbly they garnered quite a bit of attention.  Unfortunately, I think they got a bit more than they expected, and from an unwanted audience.  To my way of thinking, if you wanted a particular type of audience, you'd target them and then reel them in to do...whatever it was they wanted to do.  I couldn't help but laugh when boot girl stumbled over to Bane to ask him to remove a table of regulars for harrassing her.  -Harrassing- her!  It was ridiculous.  Of course he turned her request down, after explaning to her rather bluntly that if she didn't want to be stared at, she might try some less reflective attire.  By this time I was bent over with laughter.  Of course I felt her pain...not really but I'm not really a cold heartless bitch.  The regulars she had attracted probably consisted of more ink and metal than blood and flesh, but we can't go judging based on appearance now can we?  Now who needs reality tv?

       I was late for work last night.  I wasn't exactly moonlighting, but I can never turn down an opportunity to make a few extra bucks.  I was coming from the University and subsequently the library, researching ways to get myself back into grad school, when I was stopped by a carousing group of what were obviously Frat guys.  I should have remembered it was initiation night.  John, the guy who has decided to pay for his friends and be initiated into that antiquated circle of male homosocial bonding, stopped me and asked me to join them.  I was blunt, but pleasant and sweet.  I had to work and Myra was already going to chew me out.  I decided to at least make it worth it.  We bantered for about ten minutes and finally they asked where I was heading, I told them I was on my way to work at Hades Backporch. they agreed to stop by later and John slid his arm around my waist, "claiming" me.  When will guys ever learn?   I returned the hug enthusiastically and let my hands wander seductively as I backed away toward the cab.  His friends whistled and they headed to the next bar.  I couldn't help but laugh out loud, the Cabbie checking me out in the rearview mirror just to make sure I wasn't decorating my entire face with lipstick and rolling my eyes in the back of my head.  We were about a block from Hades when I opened John's wallet.  Bingo.  At least three hundred dollars.  I'd say it was worth it.  He'd never know either.  The brothers would be buying and he wouldn't realize his wallet was gone until he woke up with a hangover.  God I love my job sometimes.  I winked and smiled at Bane as I entered the bar, making sure to brush up against those muscles of his.  I don't know what it is, but there's something sexy about tall quiet handsome muscular men.  I appologized on the run to Myra, jumping behind the bar immediately, already taking orders from a group of suits.  Suits are good.  They tip well, and well... Who doesn't have a Pretty Woman Fantasy brewing inside her?  I didn't have to fake my giddiness last night, I was raking in the dough.  I will say that I was a little off put when the frat guys showed up.  Myra took care of them, making thm feel more important than their little greek letters actually made them.  I hustled back and forth between tables and the bar, smiling, winking and genuinely enjoying my job, when I noticed Myra come from around the bar.  Man she is not someone I want to mess with.  I knew that since the first night she hired me.  That's why we get along so well.  Anyway, she was busy setting them straight while I was smiling at a delicious thing with blonde hair and ocean blue eyes in a suit when I heard the word Bitch directed at Myra.  I shuffled down the bar slightly and my hand went to a crowbar we just happened to have there (HOW it got there I'l never know).  I managed to continue to take orders when Myra launched in on the guy, in front of his friends no less.  I couldn't hold in the laughter and the rest of the bar errupted into applause and laughtr as the guys were litterally tossed out by Bane and Raph.  I knew I'd like this chick when I first met her.    I knew then that I had no reason to feel guilty that night.  I left with a huge roll of tips, Jackass Johnny's wallet and I even got a card from a suit.  Sometimes I just love my job.

      Last night I was working the early bar shift.  I was on my own until Victoria came on at eleven thirty.  Of course the usual girls, Tamika and Jenn were working, along with Bane and Raphael.  About ten o'clock a group of seven guys wandered in.  They didn't appear to be troublesome, actually they looked like a lineup of freshman having wandered off campus.  Wanting nothing more than there patronage I flashed them my 'tender' smile, and waited behind the bar as they all took up seats on the row of stools.  The first hour or so when rather smoothly, both behaviour wise, and money wise.  It seems that they were initating a new member, and the amount of alcohol they poured back was amusing to say the least.  Raph had wandered over once, and I mentioned that he should keep an eye on them, just so that when they left, there would be a cab or two outside waiting to take them back home.  He glanced at the guys before ambling off to pass on the message to Bane, before returning to his perch at the far end of the bar.  I would assume it was his imposing stature that intimidated the initate.  I say this because for anyone to be so inherently stupid is just frightening.  In any event, the young man decided that he needed to make some comment about female bartenders needing huge blockheads to take care of business.  While normally I let petty comments go, this one was enough to get my attention.  I politely (of course) told him that I was perfectly capable of taking care of myself.  The others guys laughed it off, but he seemed to take offense...and from his profound cache of insults hurled 'dumb bitch' at me.  I laughed at his attempt at humour...and then quite bluntly told him to get the fuck out.  While the rest of his friends seemed to take the cue, he had to be pulled off the barstool, and dragged along....hurling more insults all the way.  Waving Jenn behind the bar, I followed the pack towards the door, Bane picking up at my right.  The guy...who I figured was called John...broke away from his friends and got up into my face.  The last straw was when I heard the words...'stupid bar wench'...pass his lips.  While I feel guilty in taking advantage of the inebriated, I swiftly dropped his head to my knee and connected my boot wrapped ankle into his groin.  Like a good boy he stumbled back yelling with a strange mix of wailing and cursing...I of course took my leave and left the rest to Bane.  In his deliciously effective manner, he expelled the little shit out onto the street.  All in all, I'd say the night was pretty uneventful.

      I would really appreciate an explanation of why guys think they will successfully pick up a bartender when they are drunk.  While I am by no means shunning the hoards of eye-candy that wander up to the bar...I really do love my job...I'm just wondering why once inhibitions are drowned I'm often the focus of stanky-breathed pick up lines that my 7 year old cousin could put to shame.  A common scene at the Backporch, and recently revisited two nights ago:  I was working the bar with Leo, and everything was pretty much running smoothly.  I was dressed in my usual, mostly black look, that is just so me.  My signature if you will... Anyways...it was getting to be just after midnight and a guy that I'd crossed gazes with a few times was eyeballing me.  One of the first rules of survival in a bar, is to be able to take people staring at you.  It doesn't matter if you're dressed with minimal coverage, or maximal there are always people that find it necessary to drool alcohol infused saliva into their laps.   Getting back to this guy.  He actually rated pretty high on the 'hot' scale, however I'm not sure if it was the bloodshot eyes, or the rank breath that shot all his chances to hell.  With that in mind, I flirted in the manner that ensues maximum tipping, but usually gives the impression of 'I'm not interested in your sorry punk ass'.  Obviously the amount of JD he'd put back had affected his sense of perception, and with enough liquid courage to fend off a river of piranhas he shimmied down the bar to talk to me.  Of course, the first route is to be polite but detached to the customer, however I'm under the impression that the idea of detachment was lost from his pool of understanding.  Resigned to his drivel, I constantly moved up and down the bar...mostly to get some 'fresh' air.  Honestly...his breath was nasty.  With his breath, who needs crack?  The one sided conversation went on for about forty five minutes, with the occasional nod and 'mmhmm' from me as I continually refilled his drink.  I was tending a bunch of rowdy suits when Leo nudged me, and whispered something in my ear, directing my attention to C rack Breath.  It seems that the last ten shots of JD had had an ill effect upon him...he'd passed out on the bar.  Well at least the pollution control board would be pleased...calling over Bane I left the bar under Leo's direction, as I wandered out and over to the guy.  There are many reasons to love Bane...he's great and he makes an even greater bouncer.  Throwing Crack Breath over a brawny shoulder, a walked with him to the front door.  Sliding CB's wallet from his back pocket, I checked his address...what a surprised, another uptown lackey.  Communicating the address to the cabby waiting outside, I paid him in advance...from CB's funds of course, before sauntering back to work on Bane's arm.  Literally.  Did I mention that he's fabulous?

       Clunky heels.  The best invention since leather pants.  I witnessed the most unique and effective use of a pair of clunky heels last night that I have ever seen.  It was later in the evening, probably around 1 or so, the time where it gets to be a bit too hectic running around with a tray table to table, and I was tending bar at the far end.  A couple found their way through the crowd and magically found seats at the bar right in front of me.  He was the slick, looks like he has more money than he actually does, sleazeball kind of good looking guy.  She was the typical trash that accomanies those sorts, she had a good size frame, and clearly worked out.   She was drinking a beer out of a bottle (another fine weapon), talking to her girlfriend who they apparently met there, when she turned and noticed her boyfriend (apparently his name was Asshole...) eyeing up some little number on the dance floor.  If my memory serves me correctly, she was one of those same girls who complained a few nights ago about being harrassed.  He was talking close to her and happened to lean over and kiss her (yep, you read that right). Well Baby (that's what he kept calling her...) litterally lost her mind, turned and grabbed the girl by the arm, and snapped at him.  The conversation went something like this:  Baby:  Did you just kiss my man? DID you JUST kiss MY man? Tramp:  Yeah.  If that's yo man, then he just kissed me. Baby:  (looking at her friend) This bitch is stupid enough to admit it! (Looking back to Tramp)  Get your skanky ass outta here before I choke you with that rubber band you call a skirt!  ((At this point the tramp leaves and heads to the other end of the bar and Asshole is getting all irritated, like she had no right to do that))  Asshole:  Oh, that's nice.  You feel better?  I was just sayin hello to an old friend and you loose your mind like that. Baby:  I KNOW you ain't talkin to me... That tramp wasn't anyone you know and I HOPE you don't think you're commin home with me!  Your tired ass is walkin home. (here, she slammed her glass on the bar, more of a mess for me to clean up...) Asshole:  Aww Baby, why you gotta act like a bitch? Baby:  Bitch?  BITCH? (At this point she reached down whipped off the clunky heeled shoe she was wearing, held it by the toe end and CRACKED Asshole on the side of the head with the heel))  Now ain't THAT a bitch!  I wanted to call the cops but I was laughing so hard I could barely catch my breath.  The guy was completely flustered and moved to a dark booth and ordered a cup of ice for the huge goose egg on the side of his head and Baby apparently went home with someone else.  Ahh, the joys of working at a club.  I need to get myself a pair of those shoes...

      Yesterday afternoon, I had a rather lengthy telephone conversation with my mother.  She doesn't seem to be able to talk to me with out finding some way to provoke me.  It's rather unnerving, but considering the vein of the issue I'm glad she brought it up.  Both her and Dad were a bit put out when I decided that I didn't want to go to university.  Constantly she badgers me about why I work at Hades, convinced that I'm too good to be working in 'such a place'.  I've always seen it as a great experience and I'd never give it up.  The skills I've learned while working here have offered so much more than four years of a sheltered institution ever would.  Working my way up from the bottom, I've seen what is needed for a successful business, and now to go about getting it.  I've made so many contacts, not to mention friends, that I would not have made coming out of school.  The job, and the lifestyle that comes with it suits me very well right now.  Honestly I don't think I'd be happier anywhere else.  Maybe I should call Mom back and thank her for making me realize as much.  I think she'd freak out...great idea!

       Last night an old man came into the bar.  It was strange because I would have sworn he was blind...but he seemed to be able to find himself an empty seat without difficultly.  In any case, I went over to see what he needed, and we actually ended up having a rather lengthly, albeit peculiar conversation.  Never one to jump to conclusions, he seemed like he was some sort of dealer.  Not the sleazy, backstabbing genre, but as if he was really interested in moving some stuff.  The odd thing was, is that he thought that I might know someone who could hook him up.  Odd for one, because he asked if I was the manager, so it's like he knew who to talk to.  Odd for two, because there have been rumours whispered about some pushing going on.  This however is in circles far beyond me...I just work here.

       This place has been insane for the past few weeks.  You expect the holidays to slow down a club like this, but no... not Hades.  Even Christmas was full of surprises.  I worked that night, sadly.  You would imagine that I would have something better to do with my time than work at this club constantly, but I don't.  I've decided that getting into my grad program won't be as easy as I thought.  The money, while it's good here, isn't there yet.  I'll be saving for quite a while.  Nevertheless, some customers brought in some small gifts for me on Christmas Eve, nothing big and fancy.  A few of the Suits thought jewelery would be a nice gift, I agreed and smiled pleasantly as I silently tallied how much I could pawn each piece for after the holidays.    I decorated my room here at Hades with some lights, childish perhaps, but it put me in the festive mood.  I have turned the place into a rather decent living establishment, if I do say so myself.  Myra must think I'm nuts, but I'm just happy to have a roof over my head and a place to work.  Usually the security here is pretty good, but recently I've been noticing some odd characters sliding through here, never ordering anything, just taking up in a booth "waiting" for someone.  Odd.  Maybe I'm getting paranoid.

      It’s funny how things like this can disappear, only to reappear again at the strangest times.  I was sorting through some of the file cabinets in my office, when I came across the journal that I used to keep with Vic.  I left a note in her box, letting her in on my little discovery.  Who knows, maybe we’ll be able to add to this little capsule of Hades’ memories.  Hm.. we’ll just have to wait and see I guess.

       Wow, it's amazing--the things you forget and the things that forget you. I had forgotten about this journal until I found a note from Myra in my box. It only makes sense to start jotting down incidents, thoughts, observations. Perhaps tonight's little interaction isn't the best, but it's something I need to mull over. I'm sure Myra will get a kick out of it when she reads this. Probably for more reasons than one.  So I have been doing my rounds at the tables, working the bar, convincing Bane to help me carry the supplies from the coolers to the bar when we ran low, and of course, still out and about with the Suits who think they have found a piece of arm candy. The only problem: One of the Suits has a soul. At least that's the way it seems. Usually, they just come in, they want to talk, we smile, flirt, I get lovely gifts... but this suit is different. I didn't meet him at the BackPorch, I met him while on campus trying to figure out when, if ever, I could return to my education. I've been happy with my life at Hades, and I don't think I'm ready to leapfrog back to the lifestyle I once led--not that I could. Too much has changed. I think I forgot how to be the "upstanding, responsible" woman my family knew. At least I forgot how to pretend to be her. Anyway, the library is usually a quiet place to battle my conflicting thoughts, but this suit approaches me and asks to join me. He just sat there and thought too. Beyond strange, I know, and I couldn't think because I was wondering what the hell he was thinking about the whole time, so my thinking time was ruined.  I got up to go and he asked me to join him for a drink. He was a suit afterall, and a good looking one. Over a cosmopolitan I found out this suit was a Smart Suit, a Prof. We talked, agreed to meet up again. Honestly I can't tell you why I agreed. I didn't get but a drink from him... and I felt completely uncomfortable at the thought of lifting his wallet. I need to stay away from that place. So after a few meetings, casual, talks, chats, conversation that I never could have with a customer on the graveyard shit at Hades, I decided that he was dangerous to my chosen lifestyle. I didn't call him. I didn't even give him the nuber of the Phone in the Hallway outside my room. He knew though. He showed up tonight before the rush.  I was busy polishing a glass set for a few of the regular suits who wanted their shots in snifters, and I look up to count the number of them and find the Prof in front of me, collar up, hands folded on the bar. The super brief conversation that followed, well, I can't remember much of it. I was just shocked. The one thing that trew me for a loop: He told me I was the most amazing woman he ever met. And then he left. What the hell! You can't leave after that! Myra was busy with her end of things, and I watched him smile up to Bane with a confidence that ignored the fact that he was in a totally different neighborhood, a part of town I didn't think he even knew existed. He just left as if I should know how to react to that! What did that mean, and why do I care? Screw this writing thing, I need to find Myra... she'll knock some sense into me.
