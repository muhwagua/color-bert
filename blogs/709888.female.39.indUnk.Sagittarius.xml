       To jump start this blog, I've been watching a lot of movies lately--Hoo-ray for unemployment! So it's time for some brief, mostly tangentally, reviews. I watch generally two movies a day. So, going back a few days...   Saturday, July 10    urlLink Biozombies ---It's Japanese Horror Day. The disk was bad from Netflix, but I did see about 3/4ths the movie. Everyone in the movie is dumb as a box of mealworms and just a little bit less ethical. It's a schlocky Dawn of the Dead rip-off. So, yea, it's good because and I've said this a million times before---you just can't screw up the zombies-in-a-mall concept. It's solid gold every time. The zombies come about from a soft drink made by Iraqi's, because as the movie says, "they make the best biological weapons since the Americans." Hmmm? And who knew zombies could fall in love.     Joe Bob gives it three thumbs up.    urlLink The Eye ---After the Sixth Sense, a lot of these kinds of movies just seem redundant. It's a pretty movie, filmed in all blue like most modern, edgy horror/thillers---you can tell the directors have made many, many music videos. The plot--- Blind girl gets a set of eyes, sighted girl sees dead people. The plot drags on and on. There's a decent end to the movie, and the movie was made by the same people who made the Japanese version of the Ring, Ringu. But pretty pictures only go so far. It's mostly an exercise of style over substance.    Sunday, July 11    urlLink Capturing the Freidmans ---Fantastic documentary, a great movie to discuss and debate after it's over. I don't want to say anything about it. Watch it on HBO, then watch the other semi-related doc that started this doc, Just a Clown. But see it. I netflixed the DVD and bonus disk just to learn more about this fascinating story. It's a story full of suprises, ambiguity, family life and a whole host of issues. Who do you believe? See it, the film should have won best documentary last year over Bowling for Columbine.   urlLink The 4400 ---Okay, technically a TV series, but the first episode was two hours long. I was going to say "Taken meets X-Men," but the IMBD link says "X-Files meets X-Men." Good enough. I agree with their first posting. Bad writing and bad acting on a great premise, but I'll watch it to to see what the mystery is.    Monday, July 12    urlLink Shattered Glass ---True story of itinerate liar and journalist Stephen Glass at The New Republic. I just got a free subscription of TNR and it's an interesting magazine whose politics are hard to pin down. I like that Stephen is extremely likable and that the details of the magazine are spot-on. Of course, there's a downfall and we do grind toward a predictable end. The acting is great and the commentary is good because they have the actual editor of TNR whose played by Peter Saarsgard filling in the gaps. It's a solid movie, not fantastic, but solid.   urlLink The Shape of Things ---I didn't realize when I TIVO'ed this one that it was a Neil LaBute movie, otherwise I would have watched it earlier. Why does the TIVO guide summaries suck so much, made it sound like a teen movie, but I like Paul Rudd and Rachael Weitz. Anyway, it's a cross between In the Company of Men and Friends and Neighbors, two earlier LaBute movies. The transition from stage play to movie really shows and Paul Rudd overplays his nerdy acting in the first half of the movie. That said, I did guess the ending about a third into it, and the movie is all about the ending. That's okay because the ending is still pretty conversation-worthy and, like his other movies, doesn't make any judgements on the bad people. That said, weak=bad, strong=good. While there was much I didn't like about the movie, it's still has me thinking days later. Plus every movie should have Elvis Costello-only soundtracks. That's cool, even if a few of the movie cues didn't work.   Tuesday, July 13    urlLink Marnie ---Can't go wrong with Alfred Hitchcock. Made after Psycho and shares the same cold fish thief for a female lead. Usually in Hitchcock movies, there's a moral absolutism, the bad guys don't get away with it. Here, philosophically, there's a much larger sliding scale and-it could be argued-the good guy (Sean Connery) could be the bad guy. And the bad guy gets away with it. Blame it on psycho-babble. Hard to say. The shocking ending isn't much of a shock and years of movies, you see it coming a mile away. Plus, I'm not a fan of Tippi Hedren in this movie, how Sean found her sexy, I don't know. However, his sister-in-law was a cutey. Overall, a bit long, but a nice, mid-shelf entry from Hitchcock.  I saw another movie on Tuesday, but darned if I can remember it.    Wednesday, July 14    urlLink Matchstick Men ---Nicolas Cage and Ridley Scott, can't go wrong, huh? Well, this blue-o-vision movie (Do they film these things while high on Viagra?) just didn't grab me. And I don't have any complaints, the acting's great, it's occasionally visually interesting, it's about con men, there's a father/daughter relationship. It just seemed lacking. Too clever by half. I didn't even guess the ending, but by the ending, I just didn't care that much. I'm actually a bit perplexed by my underwelming reaction to the movie. The sum was less than it's parts. On the bright side, I did enjoy the hour-long documentary on the making of the movie included on the DVD, learned a lot.   urlLink MST3K Wild World of Batwoman ---One of the most confusing movies MST3k has ever screened. And one of the funnier episodes. The movie almost didn't need much commentary from the bots what with all the bikinis, mole men, happy pills, ching-chang-ching, lack of cutaways, mexican wrestlers, stock beach characters and on and on.

        Bumper Sticker (Set) Of The Week:     First, picture the setting:    a silver-ish, small-ish, not-bran-new-ish car (college kid?),  with flower leis and marty gras beads hanging from rear view mirror (party-going college kid), six perfectly placed stickers: three across the back window, two on upper bumper, one on bottom of bumper, (perhaps a bit obsessive?), and they were all identical sized (all bought and stuck at the same time).   Reading left to right, by row:    Boys are great. Every girl should own one.     Boys LIE!     (sorry, I forgot this one, but it wasn't happy)     I lie to boys.     Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers     Come Closer. So I can slap you.    Wow, honey, that must have been a really bad break-up.

      The other morning I heard Daydream Believer played by  urlLink Lord Sitar , and all I could think about was (sigh)  urlLink Davy Jones  and that adorable little side step he did when singing that song. If you are roughly the same age as me and like boys, I'm sure that you fell in love with Davy like Marsha, Marsha, Marsha and I did. In any form that song takes me back to an innocent beautiful place. Plus, I love hearing familiar songs done in a new style.  Like Dolly Parton's "Shine" that we heard again last night. I really love what she brought out in that song. Looks like she's doing a couple more covers on her  urlLink new album . It's looking at something you've always seen in a different way. And you see something you've never seen before.

I think someone tried to chat with me earlier tonight, and I didn't get it figured out before they logged off. Sorry!   Try me again another time.  I'm usually on-line during my 'sweet hour' of the day, the time between when my kids go to bed and when I do. (anywhere from 9:00 to 11:00) and more on the weekends.   Tomorrow is HUMP DAY.

      Along with my great new commenting system, I have a new edumucational goal: to learn  urlLink CSS , so I can make my own comments template.  And W3 schools has quizzes to see what you know. Just for fun, I took the HTML quiz.  W3Schools HTML Quiz Result: 11 of 20  55% You must study harder!  I know I still have things to learn, but just a couple months ago I would have scored probably 15% or less on this test, so I've learned a few things.

      That last post was supposed to generate a lot of comments, I'm looking for everyone's opinions about the camera. But then my previous commenting system went down for over two days!! Needless to say, bad timing! I have researched a bit, and found a new system I like:  urlLink haloscan . I haven't finished customizing it, so it's a bit plain now, not to worry, I'll make it more colorful! This system seems very useable, and the person who made it uses some of the same blog thingies I do:  urlLink Blogger ,  urlLink Bravenet , and  urlLink Site Meter .  Makes me feel good about the research I did and the choices I made.

      Here's the latest obsession: I decided I NEED a digital camera. Yes, I have known for a while that I have to get one sometime, but I was thinking of a really great one that would put me into debt, with all the bells and whistles. But what I've figured out now, is that I can buy an inexpensive one now (and I know I'll get what I pay for), and I'll still save for a better one. So I'm looking at spending up to around $60. Here's my research so far:  urlLink This one  is cute, I love Yahoo! stuff. Though  urlLink this one  looks more like an actual camera. I really liked the specs on  urlLink this one  until I saw the picture. Kodak is always a name you can trust, I do like  urlLink this one.  My two favorites after all these and many more that didn't even make it this far in the running, are  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one , one more camera-like, the other more pocket-pencil like.

        And from the  Silver Lining  Department:   I got a ticket for improper registration Thursday. I did have the new plates, I just hadn't gotten them put on yet. I figured I would be ok if I got stopped, since the new plates were right there on my dashboard. But I got the ticket while parked. Do you know what an improper registration ticket goes for these days??   A Hunnered Bucks!!  Yikes.  As soon as I got home I called the police information number and found out that I could get the ticket waved if I took my registration in to the City Attourney's office within ten days.  Whew! Now here's the  really  cool part: On the fourth floor of the Hall of Justice building (where the City Attourney's office is, and where I've never been before) there are some really awsome paintings by a wonderful local artist:  urlLink Leora Platte . Such cool stuff, I had to just stare for a while. And I never would have seen these if it wasn't for the stupid ticket.

      I had a houseful of young men last night for a sleep-over. Pre-Men, as I call them. My two sons: 11 and 9, our close family friend: also 9, and my cousin who is almost 8. My cousin is the little brother of two sisters, so he really enjoys his male bonding time. The older three took it upon themselves to teach the younger 'how to be a boy'. This consisted of talking about girls and wrestling until someone got hurt.  Boys are fun.

      It's Saturday again, I can't believe I got out of bed early (8:30 is early on a Saturday!) this morning. I had so much blog stuff in my head, I couldn't go back to sleep!

      I watched the preview of  urlLink The Rerun Show  last night. I'm not overjoyed that I let my kids watch it, as it did get a  little  bit freaky, but  I  really enjoyed it. Maybe it really IS  urlLink good for the planet!

       Thursday Bit O' Beauty  OK, I know this is kinda a cop-out, but today's bit o' beauty is my new template. Still just one of the basic Blogger templates, since I haven't learned CSS myself yet, but kinda funky. Hit refresh, or click the title to change the colors. Very Technicolor, if you ask me.

      One thing I really love about  urlLink Blogrolling  is how it allows me to set my preferences to list my links in order of being updated. I just get a kick out of that, seeing what is the freshest. I've noticed that  urlLink wannabegirl  is at the top of this list most frequently lately. I always enjoy the cool things she has found, like  urlLink the Sandwich Project , to which I added my infamous PB&M (don't worry, I've never made one for anyone but myself). Thanks Firda for a great (IMHO) blog!

      I decided to make a  urlLink Yahoo! Group  to display the artwork I've been doing lately. Take a look. I'm very happy with what I've created this weekend. I really got lost in the creative moment. Don'cha just love when that happens? But crazy run of bad luck, first I can't get the new graphics to show up on the blog, plus error messages on my template, then after doing a couple more this evening, all of a sudden my monitor is going whacky. Everything looks blue. It comes and goes. Oh, well, I guess it must be time for my blue period.

       Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'  Another cool thing I've just implimented,  urlLink Blogrolling . It will keep my list of Blogs I like to read fresh, and  get this  it puts the most reciently updated Blog at the top of my little list over there! It also tells me on my personal Blogrolling page who and how many have linked to me and my links. Um, hey G-Man, for all your supposed  urlLink media empire   I  was the first to Blogroll you.

       Whew,  found that nasty missing piece of code!    Warning, this post contains geek speek  In case you didn't notice, the last three days my blog has had this terrible empty space at the top right, due to one tiny "tr" missing.  Helpful geek hint: I remembered what my friend Bobbie taught me about comparing documents in Word, and I used that on my current code vs. the origional code. It was still a needle in a haystack, but it definately made it tons easier! Funny side note: I haven't learned yet what the tr even means!

This  urlLink guy  actually doesn't look bad in a skirt, I'm amazed at how natural he looks. There's  urlLink toenails ,  urlLink noses  AND  urlLink mucus , folks who want to  urlLink clone Jesus , obsessive/compulsive  urlLink personal ads , and whatever  urlLink this  is.  And in the top ten list of bad sites, number one is the web page that origionally made me realize how sick we have become, but you'll have to look it up yourself, it's too disturbing.

       Yay  Sometimes the solution is so simple, it makes you mad you didn't figure it out sooner. You know, like 'if it were a snake-it would've bit ya'. Well, that's what happened with my image issue. The simple solution was there all along, I just didn't find it. Didn't see the tree right in my face, for looking into the forest, cut off the nose to spite the face, missed the circus trying to fix the merry-go-round.  OK, that's going a bit too far  Anyway, please notice all the wonderful graphics loaded here, and be prepared for more!

       IMs  Notes from a recent conversation:  urlLink Bravenet  offers a wonderful IM for free to download. It is actually coming from  urlLink Odigo , so I guess you could download it from either place. It will connect to AOL, Yahoo!, ICQ, and MSN, at least. It has some nice features of searching for people with your own interest, and listing your interests and why you're on-line for others to find you. I haven't gotten any random porn spam from them (oohh, that's a googler: random porn spam) like with some others. By the way, I usually try to be on-line for chatting on Thursday evenings, if anyone's around tonight. On AOL look for: Shelda Raspberry, on Yahoo! look for: shellymrlft.

       Thursday Bit O' Beauty  Surfing yesterday took me to some castle, which reminded me of my trip to Europe with my college choir. (OMGosh, that was 18 1/2 years ago.) We went to Amsterdam, France, and Switzerland, and had a pretty stone-set schedule of tourism, but it was wonderful. I remember so many wonderful, inspiring, beautiful things from that trip (and good European beer, of course), so I hunted for a web pix of one of my favorite stops, the Garden of Versailles.  It amazes me now to think that I saw  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  in person. (thanks to someone else's  urlLink vacation photos , sometime, I'll have to dig out and scan in my own) I will probably never see those in person again, but I can see  urlLink this one  with just a short car trip,  urlLink this  is just around the corner, and I see  urlLink this  everyday (ok, I know it's a bit phallic-but still cool looking). Point: Go where ever you can, across the ocean, or across the street, beauty and inspiration is everywhere. And these are just some man-made things, natural beauty is even more abundant.

       I am starting to hate ME  When I got my new PC, summer of 2000, it arrived with Windows 2000 installed, and since I ordered it at exactly the right moment, I would soon receive a disc of Millennium Edition. At the time, I was thrilled. When the disc arrived, on an otherwise downer of a day, I even danced around a little bit. I installed it right away, and have been using it ever since.  Like any computer, the hard drive has been getting full, and therefore slowing down, and now I'm down to the preverbal crawl. So last week, I'm trying to run scan disc and defrag and stuff, and I can't even get the defrag to work!  Call the (work) help desk: best bet is to get that ME off of there! OK, no problem, I've got all the necessary discs. But the 2000 backup disc says "Warning, all files will be lost"  Yikes!  So all of my free time last weekend, (and I took Monday off since the kids didn't have school) I worked on getting all the files off that I didn't have back-ups of. This is mostly all my artwork! Can't lose that!! (and, of course, some  urlLink RCT  games that I hope will load back in so I don't have to start from scratch). And I'm not done yet. I hope this is going to be worth all the effort!  Note to Self:  save computer artwork onto disc when finished!!

       Art stuck in my head:  Yesterday, a friend told me about a trip to the zoo, with the giant goldfish swarming to catch the pellets they dropped. She said she was surprised to see a circle of big catfish in the goldfish pond, and that they just stayed in a circle even when the goldfish would swim through and momentarily split them up.  I had the image pop into my head of these catfish swimming like they are the petals of a flower, with their tails fluttering, and maybe one of the goldfish would swim into the middle for a minute to be the center of the flower. I need to draw this.  Also, a couple weeks ago, I dreamed of a drawing I did of a blue bottle, the dream drawing was very nice, and I have been trying to replicate it in the 'real' world. Brings the question to mind, can you create in your sleep?

       Something New  Well, new to this Blog, anyway. I can't say that this is an origional idea.  You've probably heard of the Six-Degrees-to-Kevin-Bacon game, they've even made a good spoof of it on a recient commercial. Well, someone I read a while back Blogged a kind of a 'six degrees'. I thought I'd try it. First I'll start with the Blog sixth on my Blogrolling list right now. That would be  urlLink The Hestia Cronicles , I enjoy this blog for the poetry and writing links, and this is where I first saw  urlLink BookCrossing .  From here, I'll bounce to  urlLink So Anyway  (cool graphics and nice bumper stickers), and from here to  urlLink chaotic neutral  (ooo, she has beads), and bounce again to, oh, wow! there really is a  urlLink Six Degrees of Bloggeration ! How cool.  OK, I can't go any further, I have too much here to read now.

       Hypnotists and college students  Checking out the  urlLink class assignment blogs , I ran across a  urlLink story  that was very familiar. Somewhere in the past (15-17 years ago)   I   was one of the college kids that climbed onto the stage at the urging of my friends, with the promise of being Hip-Mo-Tized.  We did the same 'acting stoned' bit, and the act like an animal bit (probably ducks, since they're funniest), and he left us with a post-hypnotic suggestion: when we were back at our tables and heard the sound of applause, we'd turn to the person on our left and give them a big, wet kiss. On my left was Lumpy. (You know a Lumpy, every group has one.)  When I went up anyway. My wonderful friend saved me by making Lumpy switch chairs with him, so I didn't have to kiss the Lump.  One of my favorite memories from college. One of my favorite kisses.

       It's official........Duck jokes are funnier  and that IS a "U" not an "I", smarty-pants   On  urlLink National Smile Day , the  urlLink official funniest joke  is revealed.  I always love the jokes where the punchline sticks with you, and like a running gag in the movie of your life, you say just the punch line and crack yourself (and hopefully others) up.  Like the classics: "and stop calling me Shirley", "if that's your elephant, YOU buy him a drink", and "if I could walk that way, I wouldn't need the talcum powder". One of my all-time personal favorites: "Out of the way, girls! I've gotta gargle!"

       Listening to:  Do you ever get an album stuck in your head, not just a song, but the whole album? And you have to listen to it over and over again? That's where my head is at right now with  urlLink Julian Lennon's  1998 album,  urlLink Photograph Smile . I think I got through it three times yesterday before the kids made me switch to something else ('80's Techno stuff, by the way, boy I'm glad they outgrew the Barney music!) I especially love "It's good to be lonely", that's a crank-it-up-and-sing-along song if I've ever heard one!

The new Bravenet counter I recently added, does, so...... I would like to join the ranks of Bloggers who post/boast how they were Googled, it's always funny.   Googles for the last half of September include:  Yahoo Chat Emote Hump Day Cartoon  and a few for  Q-Bees .

       Body in a Jar Update  Well, I started with food coloring, which didn't do much, but honestly, I didn't expect it to.  So I bought Rit dye and now the 'body' is in the jar with the dye. It appears that the plastic is starting to change color. I know it works on some kinds of plastic, I had seen plastic beads being dyed with fabric dye, and a friend experimented with that for me. But I know some kinds of plastic will change color and other kids won't. On the doll so far (only 10 minutes or so) it looks like the head is changing color, and the arms, but not sure about the body and legs, that's a different plastic. Well if her head turns out, I can live with the rest of it. Probably cover the body and maybe cover the legs, too, so it should work out.  Gotta get a good idea about the outfit.

       Paper or Plastic  OK, do they even  ASK  you anymore?? I usually have to inform them, as they are already starting to shove things into a plastic sack, "I prefer paper." Yes, I admit, I do prefer paper.  Why? Not specifically for recycling, as I re-use or recycle both. Why is because I have a theory: Even a horrible sacker has a better chance of not messing up my groceries if they use a paper sack. See, the bottom is flat, and that makes it easier to put things in first that are also flat, such as boxes and cans, leaving the more squishy not-flat stuff to go on the top. This also makes it naturally easier for the sacks to be fairly even in weight, as the heavy flat things are fairly spread out between the sacks. Well my slacker-sacker yesterday completely blew my theory out of the water. First, she put four two-litre bottles all in one sack (and she expected me to be able to carry that), then she shoved all the other stuff willy-nilly into two other sacks, neither ending up being even as heavy as  one  two litre bottle. When I got home I found that at the bottom of one sack was my fresh chicken breasts, not even double wrapped, (boy am I glad nothing poked through the saran wrap on that) and at the bottom of the other sack was a  bag  of cereal.  Sheesh! If this store wasn't giving out "Holiday Bucks" I probably wouldn't bother to go there at all. They don't even carry veggie breakfast sausages. OK. Rant Off.

       Talent  I wonder what is the gene that causes one to create?  I was talking with a couple other parents yesterday, with kids as old as mine and older. Big football game last night, and I noticed how easy it was for these parents to talk about their kids' sporting abilities. When the topic switched to our kids' artistic endevours, both other parents not only were in awe of their artistic child's talent, but both did one of those "I don't know where they got  that  talent, definately not from ME". Um, and all that sporting talent you were just talking about, you gave them all that? I believe that everyone of us has creative talent, in different measures and different types. Some of us have a naturally visible creativity, but often some of us don't (can't?) recoginze our own creativity. We need to explore our own talents, encourage each other's, and nurture them so they will grow, not bury them by not acknowledging them.

      A couple more really cool things.  This  urlLink program  can read your mind, or so it seems, when you guess a sit-com character or dictator. I tried to stump it, picking some very obscure sit-com characters, and it figured out Zelda from Dobie Gillis, Eddie from The Courtship of Eddie's Father, and Diahn Carrol from Julia. Wow, I'm impressed. If you stump it, let me know. And speaking of stumping,  urlLink this one  will stump you. It's a right brain/left brain trick. Exercise your brain, man.

       bug update:  Those lil' buggers are so resiliant, they've adapted to the shampoo meant to kill them. So today, after sleeping late, and then finding they weren't all gone, I gave two beautiful heads of red hair short buzz cuts. Oh, well, it'll grow out. My worst fear is catching them myself, as I really don't have anyone I could ask to dig bugs out of my hair.

        It's still Monday   because it's not tomorrow until  I  go to sleep  Unexpected late night tonight. Right at bedtime my oldest announces how itchy his head is. Hmmm. So I do the head check. Yup, the little nasties are crawling around. And on little brother too. Yuck. So I run down to the drugstore for the killing supplies, and follow all directions. Took a little over an hour for each one. We're definately sleeping in tomorrow.   And on the bright side   'cause I'm one of those people who  needs  to see the glass as half full  My boys do have awfully beautiful hair, and I don't get to play with it very often. Not like little me, having curlers put in after the mandatory Saturday night bath, and getting to watch Carol Burnett.  No, they're typical boys about their hair, and keep it relatively short, one with thick dark auburn and the other with fine 'Cheeto-orange' (or I would say strawberry blonde). Plenty of (non-redheaded) women have made some sort of envious remarks, or joked that such color was 'wasted' on a boy.  And tonight, I got to comb through all that beautiful hair. Every last freeking inch of it. I sure hope we killed them all.

      The last week-and-a-half has been a bit upsetting, blogwise. Starting with my template getting all screwed up, for (as far as I could tell)  no good reason!  Rumer has it perhaps Blogger was hacked on some level.  So I spent the better part of two days (and these were our vacation days, so I do mean two whole days!) trying to hook up a different Blogger template and modify it all over again.   Note to self: save a copy of template after modifications and extras added!  A couple things got in the way of that: first, all my 'fun' links and things were just gone, so I have to find them all again. A lot of the graphics were ones I had made myself, or saved, so I can recreate those, but then I have to find the others. And B) those first couple days I was trying to fix it, the same problem kept happening. (which was that my img=scr..... html was being reduced to only img) and 3rd, I really want to make my own CSS template. So why keep modifying the ones that are already here?? So I haven't blogged much this last week, partly due to frustration, and partly because my time has been being spent on my learning. I got a perfect 100% on HTML, and missed one on the XHTML quizzes, and I'm starting on the CSS. I have been living and breathing W3 Schools. They are the best! (and listening to Older Brother's Records while learning) Soon, Techinicolor Day will be back to it's beautiful self, and better than ever. Stay tuned!!  urlLink

       Cuddly and Brady  One gift I got is a small blanket, throw, shawl, I guess I don't know exactly what to call it. Too small to be a regular blanket. Perfect size for the lap, especially computing. And very thin, down filled. Very nice. Watching a bit o' the "Bunch" tonight.  I love how the old shows didn't pay any attention to consistency back then. I just watched the 'Silver Platters' episode (actually titled "Amatuer Night"),  where  urlLink Jan  misunderstood the price of ingraving and the kids sing on a show to raise the extra money. I loved the singing episodes. This show was actually from season 4, episode 92, but they don't even mention the record they cut the year before in episode 64, when  urlLink Peter's  voice cracked. No episode refered to any other episode in those days. Shows could never get away with that today, so to me, it's a bit of fun nastalgia.  I had to double check all this with a great  urlLink Episode Guide  I found.

       Ideas  I am an idea person. People who know me personally know that and often come to me when they need one. I'm always full of 'em. And some 'stick' and some don't. I've learned not to be discouraged when they don't stick. Because if you let yourself get discouraged when someone doesn't like one idea, you might not be as likely next time to bring up an idea. But that one might be the million dollar one. I had the opportunity this week to be in a meeting where one of my ideas was announced to the group and it met high approval. I had given the idea to the project head dude the week before, and he had loved it and ran with it. So when the idea was announced to the rest of the group, it didn't come from me. It really didn't matter that dude didn't say it was my idea. It wasn't the kind of situation where it mattered to me that I get all the credit.  It was just satisfying knowing it was mine, and it was good.

       Thursday Bit O' Beauty  I love to watch it snow. Especially from inside my car, the slant of the windshield makes a perfect canvas to check out all the differences of the flakes.   urlLink The Snowflake Man  wanted to share the beauty of snowflakes with everyone.

       Dial-Up from a Mart  When I gave my computer a labotomy the other day, I wiped out my dial-up software along with everything else. I have been using Bluelight from K-Mart since it was free, a year and a half or so? Something like that. Yes, I tried more expensive dial-ups, I had a free year of AOL when I bought my computer, that's when Bluelight was free, so I usually used that anyway. I reciently tried Earthlink, when the Star Trek.net came out. When I canceled that my reason was, having Majel's voice announce that I had mail wasn't worth a whole extra ten bucks a month, which was all I saw as the benifits over Bluelight. So when my computer was blank, I needed to put something back on. I thought I had a back-up disc for Bluelight, but it was too old. I did pick up a Wal*Mart Connect disc a while back, for 'justin case', so I tried it, with it's free month. It's sponcered by AOL, so that should tell you something right there. I hated it. I found the Bluelight website and downloaded the software and uninstalled the Connect that same night. Just an FYI for anyone who uses the 'budget' dial-ups by choice (around $10), I've seen the old Juno one and that didn't impress me, I have to admit I haven't seen the DZnet combo yet. But comparing Mart to Mart, shopping I'd definately pick the Wal, but for budget dail-up, it's gotta be the K.

       Blank Computer  A few weeks ago, I changed my OS to hopefully eliminate errors, and I was willing to lose all the junk on my C drive to do it. I saved everything I deemed worthy of saving, and that took a week (of free time) to get that done.  But it didn't take everything off. And I was kinda miffed about that.  I had worked hard to save everything, and it was still there! Plus, it didn't make any extra space on my computer.  So I would get nasty error messages these last few weeks, my C drive would fill up with 1/2 hour of surfing. Yesterday, I got fed up, and decided to try it again, to see if there was anything I could do differently. And luckily, I found it.  Instead of just 'load new OS' there also was a choice of 'erase C drive and load new OS'. So now, my C is clean! Yay.  Sure, I have to download or install things, but I saved all my artwork and pictures, and  it really feels good to start fresh!

      If you read TD back toward the end of October/beginning of November or so, you probably read about my problems with my template. I think there was a hack or something, dunno. Anyway, that really distracted me from all I've been trying to build. I was so pre-occupied with making my template presentable, that I didn't work much on  urlLink TD2-Just Writing , or my under construction  urlLink web site , or other surprises I'd been planning, or even post here as much as I wanted to.  I think I finally have my template in good order. (and yes, I'm going to save it just in case!) So now I can stop fiddling with it (for now, anyway) and really get to it.

       Painting with Coffee  Part Un   This morning's Bit O' Beauty has me inspired. I'm going to try painting with coffee. First, my brain goes off on a roll...if coffee works, so would teas, and there are lots of different kinds of teas, so there would be lots of different colors. And you could probably paint with all sorts of fruit and veggie juices, hmmm. You know, I really love that guy who paints with 'shocolates'. Food-art, Art-food??? OK, OK. One thing at a time. So anyway, I'm going to experiment with painting with coffee. First thing, I decided, is to get some containers ready to hold the different strengths/colors. I like to buy some foods in small jars sometimes, just for the jars. Usually, I want to buy the largest container of any given food product, to save money, but sometimes you just gotta buy the cute little jar. I cleaned out, or rather am in the process of cleaning out three small jars after dumping not-so-fresh-anymore food products out. I'm soaking them, and I'll probably add some bleach, or my coffee painting will smell like garlic, oregano, and 'fiesta' jalapeno peppers.  Maybe the next painting will incorporate smells. Hmmmm.

       LOUD  I know lots of folks have ranted about loud cars, but this one takes the cake: I live on a fairly busy, one-way street. Last night, I was sound asleep, awoken by a rhythmic odd noise.  (Single mother that I am, I always panic for the first 1.5 seconds when ever I wake up suddenly like that.)  I didn't even have to get out of bed to ascertain the noise, the kids were not awake, no one was breaking in, not the weather, nothing like that. It was a car passing with a stereo so loud, it went through their car (I'm presuming they had their windows rolled up, it was maybe 10 degrees out), through my closed house (and my bedroom isn't even on the side of the house by the street), and WOKE me from a sound sleep. I'd say those poor people in the car probably won't be hearing much today at all.

I was appreciating my first cup o' joe and pondering what art would present itself for today's B O' B, and searched 'coffee art'. Wow, these paintings are done completely in coffee. Ooo, I gotta try that.  altho........some of the coffee I've drank wouldn't work for paint, it would eat through the paper

       At the 1/2  Well, the game's pretty good, though rather one sided so far. But the commercials have been disappointing.  The one shining moment has been the Osborne/Osmond Pepsi Twist commercial.  Classic!!  This is usually the time that the Bud people bring out the great new commercials, but their best so far was the guy putting his dog on his head in order to get a beer. Nothing as big as the frogs, or even the lizards.

       urlLink  Vote   Whew! That took longer than I expected. Since there were some blogs I wasn't familiar with up for  urlLink Bloggie Awards,  I wanted to take the time to review the different nominees before voting. I've said before I'm still on  urlLink Dial-Up  because I appreciate the great savings. And I know that things sometimes take a bit longer, and I'm willing to put up with that. So to vote on a catagory, I'd open all 5-6 sites, go wash a few dishes, and come back to check out the blogs and vote. I think I added maybe 7 blogs I hadn't seen before to my  urlLink Blogrolling  (who was also up for a couple awards). Like:  urlLink Cooties ,  urlLink Little.Yellow.Different , and  urlLink DaveZilla . There's lots of good stuff out there!

       Sunday Morning  It's one of those mornings where things look fresher and brighter. I have a  urlLink book  of daily meditations on my bookshelf, that I'm not sure exactly where I got it, I know I didn't buy it, but I've got lots of books on my bookshelf that weren't bought or picked out by me. Anyway, I don't pick it up everyday, and the bookmark was stuck somewhere in November, so I obviously haven't picked it up for a while, but today I picked it up.  Today's entry reminded me to actually live life, and not to forget the humor, and to keep a balance in life.  I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad.                         --H. D. Thoreau

       urlLink  Wednesday Wonder   (I'll keep up, and go back to the couple I missed.) I started a self-portrait/collage a couple years ago in a group I was in. It was my turn to lead, so I lead with this project. I had us start with the grade-school art project of doing silhouette where one of us would stand between a light source and a wall and another would trace our shadow onto posterboard. Then we were to 'fill ourselves' with whatever was meaningful to us, with collage or any other medium. I still need to finish mine.  I think that will be my Wednesday project.

(again they were meaningful but only from memory.)

I've been thinking about the color questions all week, and have found myself thinking about the concept of  urlLink Michael's  being laid out by color, as  urlLink Shirl  wrote. Having an afternoon to myself, and all my  urlLink Clerks  cartoons watched, including commentary, I'm going to go to my local Michael's store, in search of color.

       Ignorance  Last night, on  urlLink King Of The Hill , LuAnn realized that she was ignorant. And, after she learned the  urlLink defintion  of the word, she was proud.  That's kind of how I feel about creativity, (or to  urlLink create ). I think people misunderstand the word, and thus, make assumptions.  It's no shame to say that you haven't learned something; are ignorant. Nor is it odd to say that you are capable of producing something, whatever it may be, just an idea, even.  Heck, anyone can  come up with an  idea   can't they????

       Links galore  If I haven't said it before, one thing I am very proud of as a newbie blogger, is that I have used all free things. I certainly know you sometimes get what you pay for, but I'm happy with the different free blogging tools I've been using.  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink BlogSpot  for the blogs. Not upgraded, so I do have ads, but I'm willing to suffer the ads to have a cheap blog.  urlLink Haloscan  for commenting here, and  urlLink Enetation  on the other. I definately love Haloscan, Enetation is nice, but doesn't seem to always stay up. They have an upgrade which promices to not go down, but I think they should stay up more, then I'd consider upgrading.  urlLink BlogRolling  is the absolute coolest!! I did upgrade that, not to specifically get the extra features, but because I just loved it so much. And now, I do love the extra features (more BlogRolls). Other things I've found and used for free:   urlLink W3 Schools  has taught me so much HTML and stuff, oh, and  urlLink Web Monkey  is great, and has a kid section, too. (Hmm, I need to add a link to them). That's a lot of links! (Hey Perry, here's all the links you need to make a completely FREE blog. Now you have even less excuses to make your own!) My point is, I like finding the free things. The newest free thing I've found is the  urlLink Zonk Board  (see previous entry). And I just have to say, I'm so impressed I had to upgrade my account right away.

       Back to the grind...or the bag  After all three of us getting stung by that nasty virus that's been going around, and just at the end of the holiday break (they bemoaned that being sick wasted the last part of their vacation!), it's nice, once again, to settle into the routine. And now I remember why we make New Year's Resolutions: because coming back to the routine after a break from it, helps us appreciate it, and makes us want to find ways to make it better. Friday, when I just started not feeling well, I didn't have my morning coffee, and just today drank a half/caff for the first time. But these last few days, I remembered how much I enjoy tea. I started an evening cup tonight before the kids fell asleep, and they were curious when they heard noises and 'smelt something', and when I told them I was making tea, they both exclaimed, 'ooo, will you save us some?' So I think tomorrow night, I'll start us each a cup. Maybe we can start a little tradition. Or at least some fun memories.

       Wednesday Wonder  A new meme from  urlLink Kathryn .  This week:  Paying Attention  What I find myself paying attention to after reading the words of inspiration at  urlLink Wednesday Wonder  are things close around me that I usually take for granted, close to my computer, in my purse, at work, most places I can think of, that we  all  have in these places: photographs.  A piece of paper with an image magically frozen in time upon it. Places I've been that I want to remember. People that are no longer in my life. A first breath. Hints of my children that I didn't get to see in person. Commemerations of all sorts of events. Times that will never be here again. All here with me, with little effort on my part. I find that half or more of my memories are drawn from photographs. I don't remember exactly what a scene from my life  looked  like. I remember the sounds, sents, and feelings. But the photograph helps me put a picture with those memories.  We all have cameras these days. It's no big deal to take photos of anything and everything in our lives. A friend reciently purchased an old 'amber type' photo where the photo is not on paper, but glass. It is a treasure. From a time where photos were very few and very far between. I can only imagine what having that kind of photo meant to folks in that age. And I can take for granted the ease of photography we have today. That is my Wonder for today.

Qualities I admire more than words can say.  I grew up with Mr. Rogers, and shared him with my children. I haven't gotten teary over the passing of a celebrity before, but he was more than that, he was like part of the family. Rest in Peace, Fred Rogers.

       Exercise  Getting through the stress the last few weeks, I have been so much reminded that we have to remember to exercise! Body and Mind! Some people remember to stretch the Body but forget to stretch the Mind.  My Creative Spirit reminded me by giving me creative dreams a couple times. I made sure to write down the ideas, and forced myself this week to pull out supplies to try one of the ideas. Wasn't perfect, but a good jumping off place. Hm. Next goal: set up the scanner again, so I can share.

       Class  I noticed a few weeks ago, that Googling my own name doesn't bring up Technicolor Day. So I added my name a couple times to the blog, and Googled this morning to see if TD would come up now.  I found that someone with my own name is teaching a couple  urlLink classes , including "BEADING ON PAPER (2 sessions)".  That's odd. That's one of the projects I'm working on myself. Instead of stamping and then beading, I'm beading then watercoloring. Wow, I need to get it finished, then maybe I can teach a class too, though not in Canada.

For all those of you who have already switched to  urlLink My Way , you may have already seen this in their  urlLink strange news . This artist "paints images of Christ on his own terms", and I like the liberties he's taking. What do you think?  urlLink a new and different image  of Christ? Or  urlLink Buddy Jesus ? Or both?

       War is not creative  When I started blogging a mere nine months ago, I decided for many reasons to give myself a theme. The theme of Technicolor Day is creativity. So I usually skip subjects that I don't feel fit the theme. (that's mostly why I created the  urlLink second blog  for the spillover stuff) Also, I'm not into blogging for the 'flaming' aspect, saying things trying to 'rile' folks up. So this post is a bit out of blogger-character. I cannot believe that the latest form of acceptable discrimination is against people who want peace. I cried when I read  urlLink this article  posted on  urlLink JCD . And not the sad-story-about-a-kitty cry, the scared-for-my-liberties cry. What happened to the first amendment? Arrested for refusing to take off his pro-peace t-shirt? I can not even imagine.  I have always been a (mostly) quiet dissenter. The 'means by which we arrive at that goal' in everyday life. Be peaceful, act peaceful, teach peace, live peace. But this pending war has given me the feeling that first amendment rights fly out the window in favor of pro-war activism.   I don't personally want this war. War is not healthy for children and other living things. But what  really  scares me is not feeling like it's ok to say that I don't want war. Afraid the mob mentality will aim their anger at me for wanting peace. That is how I feel right now, not safe in my own country, not free to voice my own opinions.  But this is America and I still do have the right to say how I feel. I believe in Peace.  There I said it. I hope some day you'll join us, and the world can live as one.

       Not the band  I got to go to a Positive Psychology presentation today (one of the perks of my job) and one of the interesting things I learned was about the  urlLink Vagus Nerve . Two different teams of scientists were working on theories about this nerve, one set being in the PP catagory, exploring how that 'warm' feeling we get when we see or experience something beautiful or touching simulates this nerve, and the other team, in the medical catagory, exploring how stimulation of this nerve can help make people feel better. (that's mucho paraphrasing, so don't quote me) I'm no scientist, I don't even play one on TV, but that's definately one more plug for more beauty in the world.

Also reminded me that I'd like to actually get an  urlLink Ocarina  one of these days.

       Merit Badge  I was never a girl scout, I was in 4-H instead, and if provoked I will regale you with the pros and cons of each. Bottom line: I loved  urlLink 4-H . But I did always have a desire to own a sash with collected patches. Well, maybe I still will. Artist  urlLink Mary Yaeger  makes some wonderful badges, the rites of passage for women and summer merit badges for kids. I think the  urlLink body image  ones are my favorite, I've always loved the  urlLink Venus of Willendorf  figure. Of course, any great figure deserves merchandising.

Also got some shots for Julianne's  urlLink site  that I'm working on. That site's still just getting started, I sure haven't done as much work on it as  urlLink the G  has on his cool  urlLink site . Couple other cool things: My brother collects  urlLink these  things. And just yesterday, we discovered  urlLink these , I just made a bumble bee and a locust.

       In the Dark  Now, I'm not advocating forgetting to pay your electricity bill.   :-)   But, if you have to go through a night with no electricity, this is a nice time of the year to do it. You don't need heat or AC (in our 'neck of the woods' anyway), and there's late enough and early enough sunlight to get most things done.  And, Adversity is not without comforts and hopes. --Bacon. Or in my own words, adversity can spark creativity and comradery. For example, we discovered last night, that  urlLink Munchkin  plays great by candle light. We got to laughing so hard at one point, I was almost afraid a 'gut' would actually 'bust'. So here's my gem of wisdom stuffed in a little bottle: Whatever it is, make the best of it.

       "Creation is Play"  I found this  urlLink article  on Creativity. And the 'reclaiming' of it. Good article. Not sure about 'reclaiming', as what I see is the biggest block to creativity, is feeling like you don't have any to 'reclaim'. (Which ISN'T true, we all have creativity!) But read the article, print it out even. Live your creativity.

       Project Creation  I've started a small group with a couple friends, which for now, I like to call Project Creation. I wanted to get this group together for two reasons: 1. To have us get together occasionally and do creative projects. and B) To have us share with each other the ideas/projects we are working on, have us keep each other motivated by sharing our progress or problems. First, I "made" them watch Fight Club. OK, yes, I'm weird, I envisioned giving them anonymous creative assignments, well, you never know, maybe I still will.... Now, tonight, we are having our first 'session'. We're meeting at a store where you can paint your own ceremic pieces, the store provides all the paint, and does the firing. You pay per hour and per piece, and pick it up in about a week.  This will be  FUN !! I'm planning on doing the funkiest, coolest, most colorful BIG coffee mug I can come up with. This will be for use at work. I like to have little things with me at work to remind me of my creative self.

I told the kids they can probalby stay up to see the  urlLink umbra  if the weather's nice.  There's a new one, didn't even know what an umbra was before now. Sounds like an abbreviation for umbrella, or an article of underware for women of questionable size. "When you're not sure if you need one or not, the UM?Bra. Card holders in the IBTC get a special discount."   Update    urlLink Here  is more useful information on the eclipse.   'Nuther Update   Whoops, the eclipse is tomorrow, Thursday.

But a good cry cleans out the tear ducts. So I guess my ducts are all clean now. ;-)

       Happy Mother's Day  For mother's day, I took my boys to the Omaha Zoo. We saw the new desert, and the nocturnal exhibit, but the best part was the aquarium. The colors of the fish and plant that live in the ocean are amazing. One shrimp was blue, and purple, green and orange, with pink and black on it's tail. Just fantastic. This  urlLink guy  looks like some sea plant floating around. It's actually very much like a sea horse. And the  urlLink Jelly Fish  are too cool. They have a hundred or so in a 5 ft diameter column, you can get so close to them, you can almost touch them. And of course, the  urlLink PENGUINS!  I could watch them for hours. They're so social, they'd come up and make friends with the zookeepers who came in to feed them. My kids are at a good age (10 & 12) where they are old enough to be fairly independent (no taking any little boy in the girls bathroom with me anymore) and a lot of fun to go places with, and still young enough to still be willing to be seen in public with me. A good mother's day at our house, I hope it was at yours, too.

       Bad Ad  I realize some people have TiVo, so they don't watch commercials anymore, but I've always enjoyed commercials. When they're good, that is. Like the monkeys talking on their banana phones. (huh-huh monkeys are funny) But I've been really  hating  that "where's your mother?" ad out there. You know the one? Dad's a dufus who can't help the kid-who's-really-old-enough-to-dress-himself-by-himself get dressed. Mom's absent from the home--and who knows where she is??? And the house-no make that world-will fall apart because Dad doesn't know how to parent. How insulting to fathers. So I was happy to discover that I'm not the only one out there hating it,  urlLink Beer Mary  and  urlLink The Passionate Ailurophile  have both posted about it, and provided a  urlLink link  to send your opinion to JC Penney.  Please feel free to pass the link along, and of course, send in your two cents if so inclined.

Just passed the one-year mark with the blog, I've figured out several cool things, but haven't learned as much as planned. More to learn!   P.S.

Now there's a goal to work on. Gotta find a few more cool blogs. And speaking of cool blogs (nice segue, huh?), I really like this  urlLink birthday girl's  take on being in  urlLink love .

       Road Trip  OK, I'm a bit of a freak, I know, but I like to play "Name that dead animal" while driving long distances.  Here's how it goes: When you see something on the road or along-side the road, something like a lump, or just some dark blob, and you realize it probably is some road kill of some sort, then you try to guess what it is while you're still pretty far away from it. The farther away from it that you can figure out what it is, the more points you get, or if you can get others in the car to play too, who ever can guess first gets more points.  (But like that British improv show that most Americans think Drew Carey invented, which also makes a great party game, the points don't really matter.) Mainly it's just another way to pass the time on a long car ride.  So this weekend, the road trip animal count was: 2 racoons 1 skunk 2 pheasants (one male, one female) 4 other birds (one dove under our tire) 0 bear &/or trashbag 3 unidentifiable and 1 deer. nice big doe. waste of meat. Don't normally get a deer. Never got a pheasant. Must be huntin' season. Somewhere.

       BBQ & BB4  Big Brother  urlLink 4  will start soon, I hope this one has  characters  contestents that I like. I didn't like BB2.  And I just saw this  urlLink grill  on tv and had to check it out. It even has a bottle opener! But the web page doesn't say how much it costs, which probably means it's expen$ive.

       That's not your retna  At work, we have some new security features, since we've sold part of our building to another comany. Kinda weird, having to have a key to your hallway, and a new special name badge complete with picture and scanner. Around the corner from me is a scanner secured door, so when ever I go to get coffee or lunch, I have to hold my scan card up to the scanner on the wall. (Then the door's way heavy, so it's tough to get through, especially with the coffee) So a lot of us wear the scan picture card as a pendent, around our neck, (me, I have a gorgeous hand made crystal beaded lariot), and I saw one guy come up to the scanner, and he didn't use his hands, he just stood close enough to make it beep and let him through. So I tried that. Except, being a woman of ample blessings, my card hangs just slightly too low, so when I go to the scanner, I have to arch my back a little, lift 'the gals' up a bit.  Now I laugh every time I go through there, 'cause it's like, "Present Chest!"  Good thing I crack me up.

OK, OK,   it's not really my new book, just practicing my writin' for the next  urlLink Bulwer-Lytton  fiction contest (where www means wretched writers welcome).

Creative Challenge:  Go get a cheap drawing toy and keep it on your coffee table or somewhere you might find yourself with extra time. The bathroom?? :P  The car? If you're thrifty (read: cheap) like me and use dial-up, put one by your computer for all that waiting time. Or a small one in your purse or backpack.  Having the tool available will help you use some of that spare (wasted) time exercising your creativity.

And a group of quilters, who realized they were sick of  urlLink Sue , made quilts of her in, um, let's say, not so flattering situations.

Today, looking for the  urlLink One Book  site, so I can join the fun, I found two more cool things about  urlLink Lincoln . One, my favorite coffee (Jamaican Me Crazy) is actually roasted right  urlLink here , and B), my favorite (and Nebraska's first and only) community  urlLink radio  has a live web link to listen to the station.

       Creative Improv  OK, first, you had to have seen  urlLink MAD TV  last night, and some of  urlLink Boy Meets Boy  for this to be funny.  (And an open-mind, but that should go without saying), but if you have/are, then please, read on... One sketch on Mad TV last night was a spoof of Boy Meets Boy, entitled Boy Meets Goy. Very funny. Especially  urlLink Michael McDonald  as 'the girlfriend' (re: Hag), bouncing around in pig-tails and fake droopy boobies (remember Carol Burnett's Nora-something character with the hangy-downies), shouting "this is bullsh*t".  So we laughed at the sketch, and 10 1/2 wanted to be funny and went to get pillows to put under his shirt to imitate Michael. But I headed him off at the pass (having a better idea) and said to him "go get a couple oranges", so he did. I met him with two nylon knee-hi's. I put an orange into each toe, and I tied them at the ends and we put them around his neck, hanging down like a Japanese scarf. Now it was the perfect Michael McDonald/Carol Burnett imitation. It was terribly funny. (The 'boobies' are in the fridge right now, in case we need them again)

       The corn is as high...  Some mornings in addition to taking my own kids to school, I take my friend's kid to school. This kid's school is a bit out of town, and we always cross these really cool train tracks in the middle of some fields. Every time I'd think, 'one of these days, I really should bring my camera and get some shots of these tracks.'  So today I did.  I got some great shots of the tracks and the crossing bars. I didn't know there was a little bridge around one corner, that was cool. Got pictures of actual spikes laying in the rocks, got the corn field, soybean field, and the ditchweed. I was almost back to the car when I heard in the distance a whistle. Could it be?? I had just stopped for pix of the tracks, I had not even hoped for an actual train! OMG, I couldn't believe my good luck, I almost creamed my jeans! I'll have to listen to some  urlLink Michelle Shocked  today! Sorry to be a tease, but I really can't post any until after I get some actual WORK done today.  Oh, ok, maybe just  urlLink one .

       Bagels and Rolls  As you can see, if you've made it here from the old site, which I hope you have, that I have changed the template again. Nice and clean. And still colorful.  One change, is how I use my  urlLink Blog Roll .  I have 59 blogs rolled. (Whoops, make that 58, now that  urlLink F*cked Weblogs  reports that The Reverse Cowgirl is f*cked.)  Anyway, I've got a few.  Some are friends, some are local folks, some inspiring, some creative, some just plain fun to read, or all of the above. But I don't want to clutter up this page with all of them. So the idea I had a while back was that since  urlLink Blog Rolling Gold  allows me to say how many links I want to show, I'd only put a few here on the blog, and make  urlLink The Big List  on a separate page.  I've heard the discussion before, how do you use your Roll? Is it like bookmarks for yourself,  or links you recommend to readers? For me the answer is both, so even though it meant creating a separate roll list, I think this is going to work nicely. Check out one of the blogs on the short list, or go check out the big list, which ever.   So how do you use your Roll/Links? And here's the other part of the Linking/Rolling question: Do you always reciprocate a link? I usually do, and just discovered I was rolled on  urlLink this  nice blog, so I added him to the roll.  I guess I have few enough readers that when I find out someone actually reads me, I want to make sure to read them, too.

        urlLink Vulgar   I figured I should watch this one in the daylight, and I was right. Very dark and a tad pretentious, but it actually had a 'happy ending' more or less. Oh, sorry if that was a spoiler.  There were a few very funny references to other View Askew flicks, and the special features included several rejection letters from Film Festivals and a short film in defense of  urlLink Dogma , which makes me want to watch that one again. Maybe tomorrow morning. But I'll never be able to look at that little clown the same again.  urlLink

       Must Be TV  I always like to check out the new fall shows. Try to guess, like with college freshman, which ones will stay, which ones will not show up next week. The show I've been expecting to be the don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it, too-much-hype-for-too-little-show show, is unfortunately,  urlLink Whoopi .  With the 'white girl that talks black' and the 'black guy who's real deep' and the 'hey-it's-a-new-ethnic-group Iranian guy', I'm afraid it just won't take off.  But now, searching for a link, I see that along with Whoopi herself, other Executive Producers include the folks that produced  urlLink 3rd Rock From The Sun . So maybe there's hope after all.

Blogger's new instructions make it even easier to understand-I was still going from the old instructions I had printed a while back) It was very simple actually to switch from Blog*Spot to my own space, once I figured out I had not filled in the PATH (DUH), and then last night, I was putting in my Blogger password, when I was supposed to be putting in the website password (DOUBLE-DUH!!). So now, all those beautifications that I have been putting off will start, like cooler colors, and groovy graphics, and I'll move the different linky stuff to the  urlLink Links  page, so the blog will load up quicker.  Please update your personal links &/or bookmarks, and if you find yourself arriving here (at Blog*Spot) from a link, please  urlLink let me know  so I can update those, too. Thanks.      Here is the new blog URL:       urlLink Technicolor Day!

       Sunday Linkage  A couple  urlLink creative   urlLink blogs . Found on  urlLink Blogwise . Even  urlLink Hulk  has a blog. Another cool-looking  urlLink blog  system.  Everybody Blog Now!  urlLink Pastel  color codes. And this  urlLink one's  post title reminds me of the neighbor girl that got mad at me and wrote "Shelly is dum" on our driveway in chalk. My brother and I still laugh about that one.

       More on "trash" as Art  There's a house here in town that used to have the coolest odd artwork all over the yard.  They had all sorts of sculpture just everywhere, and it appeared to be mostly made from used things. I remember bike parts and doll parts. Hubcaps, I think, and all sorts of plastic stuff, melted into different shapes. Short statues, stuff attached to the house, a couple pretty big things. Maybe even stuff hanging from the trees. I'll bet the inside of the house was all done up, too.  I thought it was very cool, but it was the kind of stuff that not everyone would be able to appreciate. All the art disappeared a while back, maybe a year ago? I don't know for sure.  I'm hoping the artist moved, and wasn't asked by neighbors or the city to take the art down.   When something is in public, who gets to decide just what is art and what is not?

       Art supplies or Trash?  I save things. Sometimes. When there's a good reason. Like creating art. Things like colored wire, store display items, old paints, outgrown toys, and sometimes, broken furnature.  The colored wire is staying, it's very useful and artistic. The rest of the stuff is on probation.   The huge console TV in the basement that if I removed all the guts and painted it funky colors, would be an awsome fish tank holder, bookcase (with a note of irony), or just a TV stand with the hole where the old TV used to be becoming storage for the DVD player, and game systems. Still sounds like a great idea. Will I ever get it done? I can't say. I hope so. Now the broken chair with no legs, I thought just the back and seat would make a cool-looking shelf. But it's sat on my kitchen floor for over a month, and I don't think it would really work as well as I thought as a shelf. Today being trash day, I was finally prompted to make a decision about the chair, the quadruple amputee. I have to admit, I kicked it to the curb with the rest of the trash. Though, on my way back into the house, I glanced at our little squirrel feeder on the tree, and thought maybe the chair could feed a whole family of squirrels. Hmmmm, that's a thought. I'd better go see if the trash was picked up yet. ;)

       Coffee and a Roll  Nothing quite as nice as wanting that good coffee shop cup of coffee and realizing you filled up your punch card, and you'll have this cup for free! And while enjoying a nice free cup o' Joe, I'm updating the BlogRoll. Deleting a couple (Do I really still have a blog on my roll that hasn't been updated for a year??), adding a few, updating links, and editing some names for space. One sad good-bye, goes to  urlLink Hestia , who was one of my first daily reads. But I've added her new  urlLink professional  blog, so we'll still get to read some things from her. I've also added in the last couple weeks, a few Blincoln Bloggers (as in Bloggers from Lincoln). Ahh, hometown goodness.   urlLink One  I found listening to  urlLink KZUM , the  urlLink other   urlLink two  found me. Very cool. And now that I've coined the phrase Blincoln Bloggers, it reminds me that I've always wanted to start a web-ring/blog-ring, maybe that's the one. A web ring for anyone from a town or city named Lincoln.  Hmm, I wonder how many Lincolns are out there.

       Monkey Babies  A long day, including a trip with the kids to the Omaha  urlLink Zoo . Great day all around, the highlight being in the nursery. A five month old orangutan and a two month old gorilla baby playin' together.

       Cherry Soda  According to  urlLink research  on the ever burning question of calling carbonated beverages "Pop" or "Soda" or "Coke", most of Nebraska uses the P word, with the bold exception of NE's largest county, Cherry, where they call it Soda.    Hmm. I always thought that was Hooker county. Hooker's just below Cherry.  Insert your own jokes here.

       Never Talk to Strangers  I'm usually not one of those people who start conversations with complete strangers in the check out line. I'm just not. (I guess I'm a little shy.) But for good reason, as illustrated by this story of my failed attempt at doing just that. This week, I ran to the store to pick up just a couple things, didn't even get a basket. I'm in the check out line, and the couple behind me are chatting about the headlines on the tabloids. I thought perhaps to make friendly, and shared a comment that should have proved to further enlighten them on the subject. (OK, they were talking about why the tiger attacked Roy, and I volunteered the part about how the hair-do lady had tried to pet the tiger) They made some reply, looked at each other, whispered something, and PROMPTLY MOVED TO ANOTHER LANE!  I can only imagine what they said, "let's get away from this crazy blonde" or "I can't believe she'd actually  talk  to us" or "she knows  way  too much about tiger petting!"  I will never talk to someone in the check out lane again!

       Daft Drafts  I've made the same dumb mistake a couple times this week. I've been writing a 'draft' post, and accidentally posted it before it was ready. Usually, I catch it right away and pull it off, so the only people who would have seen it were the ones who actually refreshed the blog at the exact time I had posted the mistake. Last night I couldn't get my computer to cooperate after I had posted the last post unfinished. I apologize to anyone who saw it, and hope you don't think I'm a dolt. Just pushing buttons at the wrong time.  :P

       Drive By  Did'ja ever just keep driving past where you're supposed to turn and not even realize it? That's what I did yesterday when going to pick up my friend's kid. I've been driving this route 2-3 days a week for 2 months, so it's not like I don't know where I'm going. I was daydreaming, and enjoying the wonderful warm fall weather, and all of a sudden, I kinda 'wake up'. It was really a 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore' kind of feeling when I didn't recognize the houses and farms and graveyard and school we were passing. Turns out I went almost five miles past the turn. D'oh! But, it turns out that the graveyard we had passed was a great place for a few pictures, and there's a  urlLink Worth  contest coming up on graveyards. So today, I drove past my turn on purpose, and got a few good shots.  So everything turns out for a reason, I guess.

       Movie Time  As a rule,  urlLink the G  and I don't go to a lot of 'regular priced' movies. There's a $2 theatre here in town, and DVDs are just the best thing in the world, if it's a movie you don't  need  to see on the big screen, because of all the special features and commentary.  But  urlLink Kill Bill  was the exception this weekend, it's definitely a 'big screen' movie, and we just couldn't wait until it got to the cheap theatre (though, we did go to a matinee- $2 off regular price, so that satisfied our frugal sides). If you like good fight scenes, don't miss this movie. I've heard that some women don't like violence so much, but I loved this movie! The violence is almost cartoonish in a way, though some sites, like  urlLink this one  say the violence is too much for an R rating.  I'd recommend not reading too many reviews (there are several  urlLink here ), if you don't want to spoil too many of the surprises. But if you want to know what movie references to be looking for (or which ones you missed),  urlLink this list  is exceptional. Here's one example, which some of you, I'm sure, already know:  urlLink The Yellow Jumpsuit  is just like one Bruce Lee wore in his final film. (Even my kids knew that)  I can't wait for Pt.2, and the promised video game!

Also  Another place I've recently submitted photos is  urlLink Board Game Geek , when I discovered that the  urlLink Scrabble offshoot game  I found at a thrift store, didn't yet have a photo listed in their database. I'm saving up for a cool avatar!   And  My fourth place prize winning photo over at  urlLink Worth  IS available for sale on various products. Need a t-shirt? Clock?

       The  Color  of Money  OK, I like money as much as the next guy, but there's a lot of hype, expensive hype I might add, about this new peach colored $20 and the commercials I have experienced aren't saying anything new. The three things they keep emphasizing in all the ads I've seen are:   *The watermark – the faint image similar to the large portrait, which is part of the paper itself and is visible from both sides when held up to the light. *The security thread – also visible from both sides when held up to the light, this vertical strip of plastic is embedded in the paper. “USA TWENTY” and a small flag are visible along the thread. *The color-shifting ink – the numeral “20” in the lower-right corner on the face of the note changes from copper to green when the note is tilted. The color shift is more dramatic and easier to see on the new-design notes.   All three of these things were new  the last time  we updated the look of the bills. Really, the only difference now is the peach color. And the fact that the other denominations will have other colors. So why all the cash being paid NOW to advertise??

       Again a Snob  When I changed templates a while back, there were a few things I let go of, for one reason or another, clutter or unreliable service mostly.  urlLink Blog Snob  was one of those. I loved the concept, loved how it worked, loved to play 'blog jumping' with it, but more and more found dead links at the other end.  Well, according to  urlLink The Weblog Review ,  urlLink Blog Snob  has a new owner as of this week. So I've added it back in to the mix here at the Day of Technicolor, renewed spirit all around.

       The Right Accessories  When I purchased my wonderful digital camera,   included in the package was a plain cloth drawstring bag.  . It was ok, but just not right.  So I found a cool zippered embroidered bag that my mom had given me.  This was very pretty, and fit well into my purse, but didn't offer the camera any protection, really.  So, a trip through the digital camera section, and I found a cute, inexpensive backpack case.   Very handy, kept the camera safe, easy to carry around by itself, but not easy to fit into the purse. I'd have to carry the camera back pack separately, so I'd often leave it behind. Last weekend I missed some great sunset shots and I decided I couldn't carry that backpack anymore!  So I went back to the digital camera section, and found something that will fit in my purse.   Now, I'm finally happy. It's a hard case, with or without a strap, unzips very wide, and is thin enough to fit in the purse, so the camera will never be left home again. And the colors of the case match the camera so, so well. (Forgive the giant long post, I wanted to put more pictures in. Also, I don't know why the color is off on the purple bag, the background was the same color as the other shots. More lessons for me to learn, I guess.)

       Weeds  More picture taking on the way home this afternoon from the  urlLink G 's. I saw lots of cool looking milk weed plants all puffy, going to seed, but the coolest ones were by the road where there is no sholder to pull over! When I did pull over later I did get some shots of corn, milk weeds, and other various plants and weeds. And again, like when I took the train pictures, there was tons of ditch weed out there. Sheesh. What's Nebraska's biggest crop again?

       Talkin' Turkey  Sunday I left  urlLink The Food Network  turned on in the background part of the afternoon. Ideas for Thanksgiving, and those wonderful sugar sculptures. I had to try melting sugar for myself, it was very interesting to watch it go from little granulars to clumps to lumpy almost-liquid to actual liquid. I did leave it on the heat a tad too long but it was just an experiment, so no big deal.  I played with what to do with it when it's hot, and I came up with a new candy sensation. I poured the liquid sugar over frozen cranberries, and now have some funny cranberry candies. I think this recipe can be perfected, but I probably won't play with sugar again until after Turkey Day. I'm hosting, so have a few things to do, decide exactly how to cook the turkey. One Food TV person put lemons inside the turkey, another put bacon on the turkey. Lots of ideas. One Thanksgiving weird favorite is one I heard on  urlLink NPR  several years ago. Try it-I dare you!.  urlLink Cranberry Relish

       Zoo Keeper  This little  urlLink game  is just like several games you've seen before, Gem something or Candy something, but this one is little animals. The biggest difference, is that you have to get a certain number of each animal 'rounded up' (I'm guessing what the Japanese says), to get to the next level. And when you've got all the animals but one, that one gets mad. It's funny.

       One More  OK, I'm embarrassed to have so many posts reciently about the boob tube, but one more necessary observation: Tonight's episode of  urlLink Judging Amy  is the big wedding scene, complete with guest apperance by long-lost  urlLink brother  (who since leaving the show has 'come out' on  urlLink Will and Grace ). I'm expecting a turn-around for this show, as it is dangerously close to jumping the shark, and I will be watching in anticipation of  urlLink Amy  sending  urlLink Stewart  packing.  It's probably a good sign, that in looking up these links, the actor playing Stewart isn't listed on the regular cast list.  OK, that's the last of the TV posts for a while, I promice. Now back to your regularly scheduled post.

       TV Tidbits  A few more observations from recent television. I didn't watch any of the  urlLink Joe Schmo  reality show, but I did flip past an interview this weekend where they were talking to the guy and asking him if he was ever suspicious. They showed scenes where the crew and actors were convinced that 'Joe' was on to them, but he was clue-less. Observation: If they made this show with a female contestant (Joelle Schmo?), she would have figured it out. That's all I'm saying. Tonight, I had been planning on checking out  urlLink Average Joe , the kids and I wanted to see if that girl really acts as much of a b*tch as she appears to on the commercial, AND because I love  urlLink Kathy Griffin ! But it turns out it was on later than I thought, (after the kids' TV time is over), and at the same time as  urlLink CSI:Miami , which is on my usually-watch list, so looks like that Joe will not be watched, either.  Miami is one show I would not have watched at all if I didn't already  love   urlLink CSI , because I really do NOT like  urlLink David Caruso .  I'm glad I gave Miami a chance, because I like the other characters so much they balance out the awful Caruso character. Especially  urlLink the   urlLink chicks .

       Neighborly Spirits  Halloween night, I walked around with the kids, but didn't want our house to be another unlit house not giving out candy, so I left my glow-in-the-dark candy bowl on the lit porch for a serve yourself treat. I was a little leery that everything would be taken, including the bowl, but I decided to do it as an experiment. Not only was the bowl still there, but it was still almost half full. So folks did take some candy & gifts, but no one was a jerk and took it all or stole the bowl. Very nice treat to have when we got home.

       Projects Update  Inspired by  urlLink ikastikos , her  urlLink own   urlLink art , and her  urlLink collected   urlLink links , I've been thinking about trash art lately. A while back I picked up (very cheap)  urlLink this craft pattern  (REALLY cheap, like it was almost more expensive to not buy it) when I bought a few other patterns. (I guess I'm justifying it because it's not something I normally would have bought) These bottle spinners were made by using an electric  urlLink wood burning tool  to burn designs in the soda bottles. I borrowed my dad's old wood burning thing (old as in he probably had it when he was a kid!) and tried it, but the newer bottles don't work as well, now that we use plastic labels that are glued on. So I put the wood burning thing away, and forgot about it.  Until, recently, along with thinking about trash art, I remembered burning through the plastic so easily with the wood burning thingy, and got a new inspiration: I'd burn out designs in colored shampoo/lotion/whatever bottles, and put those cut-outs together to make something.  First idea, a bunch of flowers, as I have tons of great colored wire. (Still love the electrician dude who came to my old job and replaced some wiring above my cubey and let me take home the extra wire!!) So last night, I got out the empty shampoo bottle and the wood burner thing, and did NOT create something wonderful, just a headache. I wasn't thinking about how much thicker the shampoo bottle plastic is. (it IS a 'recycle 2' as opposed to the soda bottle's 'recycle 1') It just didn't cut well, and stunk to high heaven, so won't be doing that one again. But still thinking of how to easily cut the heavier plastic...

       Projects  On my old  urlLink Blog Template , I had a small list of   Projects I'm working on:   which I had imagined would prompt me to write about my projects, and update the list, which didn't really happen.  I also thought that maybe my 'regular readers' (all three of you :)) might help keep me to task on the projects if I had them listed in plain sight. Again, didn't happen. Plus, I've found lately that my creative path, though it still seems to be the path I am to be walking on, seems a bit overgrown, and needs some weeds to be hacked out of it before I can stroll along it properly. Well, I do realize that  I  need to keep  myself  to task, so I have decided to let Blogger's  urlLink new features  help me with this. I've been saving my 'Tuesday Quotes' ahead of time ever since the new features came out. That way, I can use one afternoon to find enough good quotes for a month or two. Now I'm going to do that with my project updates, as well. So every Thursday, I'll have a   Project Update   post. And hopefully, none will end up empty.

       Entertainment Bits  The much-hyped movie  urlLink Stuck on You  starts tomorrow. Cute looking, but probably won't bother to see it at the theatre, maybe the $2 theatre. Looks better than  urlLink Dumb and Dumber  (or at least the  urlLink sequel ), plus it has  urlLink Cher .  (Shut up, I like Cher!)  But I'm probably not the only one to notice that one twin (the not-Matt one) looks about ten years older than the other. Not very believable that they're twins and not the same age, plus, aren't conjoined twins always fraternal? Better do some fact-checking. Turns out  urlLink Matt  was born October 8, 1970,  (and his middle name is  urlLink Paige ???) ,  urlLink Greg , on the other hand, was born June 17, 1963. That's quite a difference, and it really shows in their faces. And, yes,  urlLink monozygotic twins   urlLink ARE fraternal . There's your science lesson and new word for the day. You're welcome. So I'm hoping (but not expecting) that there's some joke in the movie about the age difference and the not-looking-identical difference.. Or does Baby-Boomer Greg (or who ever cast the roles) really think he looks as young as Gen-X Matt??  AND , I can't believe what they got away with on last night's  urlLink South Park !!! The ' urlLink raisins ' theme was funny enough, but the "Stan says you're a cont.....cont......continuous source of inspiration" that was just the most!

       No alarms  Well, the SNOW DAY happened after all, and like I thought, we didn't find out until early this morning. But my bladder woke me up earlier than the alarm, and I was able to shut off my alarm and the kids'. Nice treat to wake up on your own in the middle of the week. Today, after shoveling we'll be playing games, and making pretzels. Oh, and probably watching  urlLink this  over and over again.   "Precious is the Bling-Bling"

       And more on snow  It has snowed, literally, all day. I unburied the car once mid-afternoon, and there's another 1/2 foot grown over it again, and the snow hasn't stopped. But school's still on for tomorrow at this point. Now, I trust the folks whose job it is to decide if school is called off, after all, it's their job. But if we all have to wake up early tomorrow morning only to discover that they decided at 6:00 in the morning there will be no school, I'll be more than a little put out.  I don't want to have to scrape off the car, no doubt, but if you're gonna call off school, at least do it the night before so that the little buggers can stay up a little later than normal. I mean, there was another Trek on, and everything.  And the school system, and all the local news sources need to learn to use the net better, IMHO

       On snow  One kid was pretty disappointed that there wasn't a blanket of snow on the ground already when we got up today.  "Someone should go after them with a pitchfork."  Them being the weather people who had made incorrect predictions. But since the snow started coming down on the trip to school, he's better now, and we got to have a discussion on how weather is predicted. (He's still hoping for a snow day, but maybe tomorrow) The other kid got philosophical about the snow on his trip to school.  "How could there still be snow each year?"  I thought he was going on the global warming vein, but no, check this out:  "I mean, if every snowflake is different, won't we eventually run out of designs?  Hmm, interesting thought. We talked about random-ness the rest of the way to school. Pretty good for the first snowfall.

       No pink for me  I knew that Iowa wasn't going to air the scheduled  urlLink SNL   "last night"  because of equal time rules, but I thought we'd get to see it.  urlLink Nope.  I understand (kinda) why Iowa stations made their decision, and since the  urlLink Omaha NBC  station that I watch probably broadcasts across the river a little ways, I guess that's why they chose to go along with the i-WEE-juns.

       Fashions that kill  or at least make you sick   There are so many differences between elementary school and middle school, and since I've got one in each this year, I get to see the differences every day. One of the biggest, I think is how they dress. In grade school, there's no 'punk' or 'goth' fashions, or very little. K wore safety pins on his shirt yesterday and no one even noticed. So he just told me he'll wait to start dressing punk until middle school. In grade school, it's still mostly mom's call on outerwear, too. I'm pretty lenient about letting them make their own decisions about what to wear, but I still make them take a jacket. My rule of thumb is from October to March, always carry a jacket, you never know when the weather will change. Driving Z to school this morning, I see two girls walking to school, with light jackets and their hair pulled up on top of their heads.  My ears were safely hiding under my hair, and riding in a car, but they still shivered and wished I'd worn a hat when they saw those poor, cold, baby ears.  Do we get less tolerant of pain as we get older? Do they not feel the wind whipping through their ear canals? Their ear drums are beating SOS loud enough for a mother to hear. If they were in elementary school still, I'll bet they would have had a hat or hood, but now that they are trotting off to middle school, mom's opinions don't count, only looking good counts.  Come on folks, be true to your ears. Let's make hats fashionable again!!

       On the bookshelf:  Been reading  urlLink Bel Canto , slowly, the past month or longer. This is the book that all of Lincoln is (supposedly) reading together for the  urlLink One Book  promotion, though the only other person that I have heard is reading it is Z's 7th grade English teacher. It is a bit of a chore to read it, like being assigned a book in class. It's a very good book, don't get me wrong, it's just I sometimes take issue with being told what to read. (I have to admit I've never actually finished any Shakespeare, despite his plays have been assigned to me at least 4 times in classes. I just read the  urlLink Cliff's Notes ! But it's not that I won't read and enjoy what's assigned to me; I absolutely loved  urlLink Gatsby , for example, and wouldn't have even thought to read that if it hadn't been assigned.) Anyway, I digress. I ordered Bel Canto at the same time as  urlLink Why Girls Are Weird  and did read the first 'entry' in that, but I told myself I had to read my  assigned  book before I could read the  fun  one. (Even after the excitement of learning that the author is a friend of a friend-wow six degrees to  urlLink pammie !) This past week, I went off my assignment, and tonight I finished WGAW. Not to gush too much, but I think Anna K saved my life! Well, at least my sanity for a while. See, (huge personal junk coming--turn your head if you've a weak stomach) I get horrible cramps (and 'horrible' is not even close to being an adequate adjective), and lo-and-behold 'cramp day' (as I have affectionately named it) was mixed in with 'get all the rest of the Turkey Day sh*t done days'. And I almost lost it. But I took a little break and drew myself a hot bath and started in reading the book.  It made me laugh hard enough to get back to a good mood despite the pain. And in the last week, it made me laugh several more times, and cry a couple, too. And it helped evolve some of my ideas about having a public blog,  but more on that another time.  Highly recommended book, I think all  Weird  Girls, and all bloggers should read it. Sometime after the first of the year, my copy will be available for borrowing, but to support the artist, you could buy your own. And let me just say that all I want for Christmas is a Tiny Wooden Hand.

       Catching UP   Whew!  The last guests left last night, the last road trip to pick up the holiday-traveling-broken-down-car was this afternoon.  I don't want to say 'finally' because it was all fun, but Thanksgiving weekend is (finally) over.  And my server is all moved. There are a few things I need to clean up and had to change the log-in on Blogger, but all went well with that. Of course, things went on in the world, despite me not being there to blog about it, most notably in my corner of cyber space:  * urlLink GNE  has added more items and stats. (Still not up to full game potential, but it's coming along)  * urlLink BlogShares  has folded. Though, to be honest, I never really understood it, I kept thinking I should figure it out.  *The latest fun thing on the web (from  urlLink Dave ) is  urlLink Mr. Picassohead !

       Where?  This afternoon, I found myself in the grocery store searching for the mini rice cakes. It's one of the only things my younger son requested for Super Bowl snacks, and since he still can't eat very well, I didn't want to disappoint him. For some reason, they were hard to find, not with the chips...not with the crackers...where in the world were they??? Into my head popped  urlLink Joelle's  famous rice cake  urlLink rant , and I had to stop for a moment to chuckle (that's why I voted for her for weblog of the year, she always makes me laugh). Then I had to get two and a half store employees to help me find them. Why would rice cake crackers be in the dairy section??

I mixed up three strengths of coffee for three different shades, and experimented some with the painting. It worked ok, but I didn't get back to painting too soon, and the 'paint' got a nice topping of mold on top.  Documented in the  urlLink gallery .

       Snow Day Revisited  Like this story of heroic  urlLink mail  delivery, I was impressed with our postal service yesterday. But, you know, they shouldn't have to face, Rain, Sleet or Hail, just for JUNK MAIL! Yeserday, in the blizzard, I was delivered two things, one an ad I get occasionally because I'm a member of something else, and the other was an ad packet for the family before us, "or Current Resident," and we've been here over 4 years! Really, can't we let the poor mail carrier have a snow day if there's nothing important to deliver??

       Snow Day  And this time they made the decision early enough, I could let the kids stay up for  urlLink Home   urlLink Movies  and  urlLink Mission   urlLink Hill , and everyone got to sleep late.    Update:   Not more than 25 minutes since I posted this, less than an hour since I woke up, still not dressed, gonna go tackle that monster hella snow after a couple cups of coffee... Three young men show up at my door looking for work shoveling. Probably college students with the day off, who figured they'd see how much money they could raise swiveling, then buy a bunch of beer, and enjoy their day off.  Sure helped me out! Snow day helped me remember to be grateful for small blessings! I wasn't looking forward to breaking my bad back on that giant pile. Oh, that reminds me of my favorite old joke about snow: Why is sex like snow???

       Dollies  Don't know why, but felt like playing with paper dolls this morning. Found a good selection  urlLink here .  I guess partly, I'm looking for a web doll kind of thing to represent my gaming alter ego, but I'm trying to decide if I look more like  urlLink Madonna  or  urlLink Piggy.   ;)  Whoops,  urlLink Paul Bunyan,  with his long johns, and his bushy beard, and oh, those green eyes! he's got me all riled up, back to bed for me. Go make your own:  urlLink Link   urlLink Link   urlLink Link

       Games  Over the long weekend, we took turns playing or watching  urlLink Shadowbane , which is very addicting to some, but not something we can play at home currently. KG from  urlLink Wafer Thin Mint  told us about a free multiplayer online game,  urlLink  Tibia  , which we tried out as soon as we got home, and have been playing ever since. (I'm  urlLink Shelda Raspberry  there, too, and for some reason many people have asked me if I'm from Brazil based on my name. What's up with that??) And on the  urlLink Zombies!!!  group this week, someone posted a free paper and pencil game,  urlLink  Ghoulash  . We played it for 'Game Night' this week. Very nice little game. Try it!!

       Projects Update  This week, I mostly only did maintenance on Projects, and am still.  We've decided to re-instill 'Game Night' in our house, and also added 'Art Project Night'. I wanted to have a certain evening set aside, so I will get back into the habit of working on Projects again. When I've gone for a time without time set aside, I find myself not having time, but this is one of those things that you have to MAKE time for. And including the kids in my scheduling of time helps, they know that after supper, we'll all work on things together, like painting miniatures (they're into  urlLink CAVs ), and they know that I will be busy on my own projects later in the evening. I also reorganized my Poly Clay, as that is one thing I want to be working with more again. I have a 18 gal Rubbermaid container just filled with my clay and clay supplies (a separate one full of beads), and this week, I took some time and sorted through it, 'flung' some things I don't need anymore, now the lid will close again.  'Just maintenance' seems awful boring! But now my clay is all ready for next 'Project Night' and I have a better idea of what I'll start on next. Oh, and remember I promised pictures??? One of my computer projects right now is my new  urlLink GALLERY !! I've started with the 'Projects' album. Now you can see where the glow-in-the-dark glue-paint went.   EDIT:   I meant to add a disclaimer on this project! I was going for the glow-in-the-dark effect, it wasn't until I took flash pictures that I realized that it looked a little, well,  dirty  I wasn't going for that at all. It is definitely a work-in-progress, especially since some of the paint is peeling off (luckily, it's the most  offensive  part that's  peeling). The gallery is also a work-in-progress, I promise the plastic boobies won't be the opening image for long.

       How did I get HERE?  Did'ja ever find yourself on some cool site, and you don't have any idea how you got there? You know, you linked from one site to another, 'till you are somewhere wonderful, and you want to post it, but you want to give credit to where you found it, and you don't know who to link??  urlLink Here's  where I ended up. Here's how I got there: I usually read  urlLink LYD  weekly (at least), from there to  urlLink here , to  urlLink here , to  urlLink here , where I found the link to  urlLink this . Funny thing is, they found the link  urlLink here , another on my weekly-read list. So I could have found it quicker, but sometimes it's the journey, not the destination.

       Favorite Artist  of the moment   We saw the movie  urlLink Frida  finally this weekend. I won't start reviewing movies here, I promise, I'll just say this is what I'd call an artist flick. (Though that doesn't rhyme as well as chick flick, maybe I'll have to come up with a new phrase) Watching the movie only as creative inspiration, it is a masterpiece.  The story of  urlLink Frida's   urlLink life , and how her artistic self developed is beautiful. If she had never been in the bus accident, would her  urlLink art  have ever gone so far? I think probably not. So it has me thinking, what is my bus accident?

       Advertising Referrals?  Checking my stats this morning, coming in at #3 (behind my two Lincolnite blogging buddies,  urlLink Gopher  and  urlLink Algor ) is something called  urlLink StarProse .  urlLink This  page, specifically.  I've never heard of them, and so I'm wondering how/why am I getting so many hits from them? Reading on, I see there are many comments on their own site complaining that these referrals are just advertising.  Has anyone else seen this??

       Reflections  Since this year I will turn 40 (but not for 345 more days), I thought I'd write a little tid-bit for each of my decade years.  1964  Well, this was the year I was born, only 11 days before the year ended, so I don't have any personal memories. ;) I know from my parents' stories that I was a week late, born 'five days before Christmas' (which is how I would always answer as a child when asked when my birthday was), and on my first Christmas day, mom and I were still in the hospital, since these were the days of week-long stays after birth, dad came up during regular visiting hours only, but the hospital did give them a nice holiday meal, and my parents put me in a red velvet little dress.  1974  The year I turned 10. Ended 4th grade, started 5th. Started playing the piano, got glasses, and I think that was the year we got our dog. My (butt-head) little brother finally was old enough to be more fun, he started school that year. And this was the year of the Best Summer Of My Life!&trade; That was the year my dad's service group purchased an old long-abandoned camp, and since my dad had the summer off (teaching), we were the designated family to live there all summer. Two rows of camper cabins, a mess hall with library above, arts and crafts cabin, a frog-filled swamp of a swimming pool, a river AND sand pit, shower houses, an outdoor chapel which had mostly gone back to nature, and various other buildings to explore. The camp was surrounded by lots and lots of nothing, and if you walked north far enough through a couple fields, you could get to the Platte river. My brother and I had the MOST fun this summer. We collected skink tails, stole books from the library, dug clams in the river to use as bait to catch catfish in the sandpit, picked the tiniest, most flavorful grapes that mom made into the greatest jelly, and I dug up Indian beads.  Well, I thought they were Indian beads. I fancied myself an archeologist in my youth, and when I found the first bead in the dirt outside one cabin, I was in heaven. I kept digging, and over the summer found a whole butter dish full of multicolored seed beads. This was probably what started my lifelong love affair with beads. It wasn't until years later that I realized consciously that I was digging right outside the  craft cabin .   1984  My first year in college came to a close, my second year of college started, and in between, my first summer away from my parental home, I went to Europe. It was a very structured trip with my college choir, I was good and didn't stray from the approved activities, but managed to have fun anyway. I got my hair cut in Paris, went to the Rembrandt museum, made out plenty with a gorgeous Swiss guy, and sang in Notre Dame. Oh, and the flight from Chicago to Amsterdam was the first time I'd flown (not counting the flight when I was a baby that I don't remember). The rest of the summer I discovered I was a terrible waitress and dated a rock musician. When I went back to school, my second year of college ended up much better than the first. I changed my major, moved out of the dorm, and met memorial people including Mr. G, and the bad boyfriend who's name cannot be spoken aloud. Why I didn't just date G instead of hooking up with the bad guy, I still don't know.  Also, I turned 20 just 11 days before Nebraska raised the drinking age to 21, and was grandfathered. Life was good.  1994  This year stands out with more bad than the others, but it was still balanced. This was the year of the first actual house my little family got to live in, after all those apartments. Even being kinda slummy, it was good to actually have a house, and not have neighbors just a wall away.  My babies were just one and three, and were at a very fun age. My then-husband and I 'took turns' being the at-home parent with the kids, so part of this year, I got to be home with my two babies, plus took care of my 'third kid', my friend Mike's son. These three are as close as cousins, if not brothers, and this time of them being together was very bonding. This year, or right around this time, was also the first time I realized my marriage wasn't working. I remember long, weepy, middle of the night phone calls with my auntie. Looking back, I guess the realization itself was a good thing, so I could start to direct my life differently. But at the time, of course, it was hard.   2004  What's in store for 2004? (sorry, couldn't help myself) Well, there will always be good along with the bad, or bad along with the good, which ever way you want to look at it. I'm sure this will be a very Creative year overall, and hope to purchase something (maybe with my tax return) that I have been wanting for a couple years that will take me further on my road to my Creative goals. (Sorry, still don't want to say it 'out loud' I'm afraid of jinxing it, but soon, I promise.)  I hope this year will be good for all of you, and that your memories of year's past bring you happy thoughts.

       Resolutions  I don't really do New Year's Resolutions, I think they tend to set us up to fail. You wanna do something to change your life? You don't need any special day to do it. That being said, I do have two pseudo resolutions.   A)  I heard somebody on a talk show a while back, I don't remember who it was, and it was no where near New Year's, but the host was asking them about their odd resolutions. One thing this person did was to collect and save all the change he found during a year. So I decided this is more of an experiment than a resolution, and having a specific time frame for any experiment is good.  I'm going to try it, I wonder how much I'll find. I'm not going to count change found in my house or car, just change found in public places. I'm guessing less than $20.   2.   I will keep my Creativity caffeinated by daily reading/looking at/web searching things I find inspiring. This isn't a regular resolution, but since it's something I've found myself forgetting to do sometimes, and since it's the new year, I'll make it a resolution.  Here are a few of the things/places that inspire my creative juices:  * urlLink Bead and Button Magazine , I've got a big stack of these mags on the bookshelf next to my bed, so I can always browse through one before falling asleep. * urlLink Art for Housewives , I could just get lost here. There are always so many fantastic links, so many inspiring ideas. Don't let the name fool you, it's Art for everyone! Those are the big two. Also of interest: *I recently found these wonderful collages by  urlLink Jason Mercier  on  urlLink Everlasting Blort .  *I always have a  urlLink Mustard Museum  catalog handy. I love mustard, which is how I found this one, but I'm inspired by the story of how the museum got started.  The curator named his house mustard  urlLink Slimm & Nunne , because that was what a short-sighted banker told him his chances were of making a business out of selling only mustards. Ahh, the inspiring perseverence of mustard!  What are yours??

       Projects Update  I said a few weeks ago that I would post every week on the updates of my current projects. This is probably more for me than anyone else. If I am making sure to post about it, I will also be making sure to actually DO it! I did work on some projects over the holiday, though I didn't take the time to post them. 1. I made dice bags/card bags for the four nurd-boyz in my life. They are all the same material with different colored ties. No, not a super difficult project, but I did figure the best way to make the sash-holder top part myself, plus, this was the first time in over a year that I actually got out my sewing machine. It was so quick and fun. I forgot how much I love to sew. I have one 1/2 finished hat in line to work on next, and material and patterns waiting for several more things. B) I started a beaded soft sculpture. So far, it's a hand sewn (too small to bother getting out the machine for this one), and stuffed, ready for beads. I purposely made it pretty small (1" by 2 1/2" aprox-kind of a tear drop shape) so that it won't take too long to finish.  Other random projects included making homemade wrapping paper with the kids, dog photos, painting shelves, and a temporary chocolate 'painting' that was just delicious. On the table right now, an Idea that hit me somewhere between wake and sleep last night: I'm going to mix glitter glue with glow-in-the-dark liquid stuff (I thought it WAS glue when I bought it) and decorate something, probably plastic boobies. Oh, and I will work on getting projects photographed.

       Updates, Reflections, & Resolutions  So where have I gone? Sheesh. After a little bit of holiday vacation, it takes me a while to get back to the swing of things. I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season. And now, on to the new year.  Are you still writing "3" for the date?? As the title of this post implies, I will be filling in the empty spaces again. Since there may be more to say than just one sit-down, (or maybe even one day), I will write them seperately, and not necessarily in order. Tah.

       Projects Update  Updates from last week's cryptic list: Shadowbox and rocking horse still in process. The kids didn't like the alfalfa sprouts, so I'll have to eat them all, but still the sprouting was relaxing, in a way. The gold nuggets in experiment form, turned out cool, but I had to decide to put a few things on the back burner when I realized I had seven different projects on my table at one time. So the nuggets will be a later project. The door wall hanging is one of the first things I'm finishing. More on that later.

       An artist, a crafter, and painter walk into a bar...  Do you craft? Are you an artist?  Do you write? Are you a writer?  Or do you write poetry, so are you a poet?  Is it: A poet is a writer, but a writer is not necessarily a poet. Like a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not necessarily a square.  ? Or are "poet" and "writer" mutually exclusive? Like "artist" and "painter". Whoops, I guess that would be "painter" and "artist".  But is crafter the rectangle or the square? Then what is artist? A beader, a clayist, an abstract artist, a sculptor, a creative soul.  Ikes.  What the heck is in a name? Why do we get so uptight over names?   Or is it just me?

       Mad World  I try not to post too much about TV shows here, but I do have to mention that Judging Amy using the theme song from the movie Donnie Darko tonight was enough, by itself, to bring me to tears. The show often takes me there on it's own, but nothing in tonight's show was that terribly emotional. Then they used  The Song . It is the most hauntingly beautiful song ever.  And today is my older son's birthday. I am officially the parent of a teenager. Heaven help me. It really is a mad world after all.

       Pardon my Plug  I've been needing to get a couple containers, one for my colored pencils, one for the dremel and accessories. The pencils have outgrown the  urlLink spacemaker  container, and I'd been keeping the dremel in a disgusting old tackle box.  I've put off looking for the 'perfect container' because the plastic boxes that size usually $3+ to $5+, and sometimes don't hold up that well, and what if I can't find the right size. Just a hassle. But this time, I went down a different isle in the store, and discovered  urlLink Ziploc  containers in a new size, 9 1/2 cup. I got a package of two for under $3 and everything did fit, but it wouldn't have been a disaster if it hadn't.

       Lingo  This  urlLink Yankee  test,  link found  urlLink here  , tells you what percent Yankee you are based on what terms you use for things. I don't know if I agree with it's accuracy (most of my answers said my language is from the North, even specifically the Great Lakes region, but my score was only 45%-barely a Yankee), but it does tell you where each phrase is most common, that was very interesting.

       More Silly Painting  I took my cousins to  urlLink Paint Yourself Silly  tonight. Two girls, roughly the same ages as my two boys (and one thing I learned is that sisters do act a lot like brothers). We talked about lots of things while painting, including when to know that 'enough is enough' on an art project. I finished what I wanted to do on my mug, but since they were still painting, I was sooo tempted to keep going. But I knew if I added more, it would just be too much, or I would ruin it. We debated if there is such a thing as 'too much' and I was out voted. Everyone's projects turned out great, and I'll post pix when we pick them up. I know I've mentioned our local ceramics painting place before, but you really need to check it out! They've got tons of things to choose from, decorative to practical, in any price range. Friday night is 2-for-1 night on the hourly price, but that also makes it much busier, every table was packed last night. If you live close to Lincoln, check it out it's right by the Ivana Cone and close to the restaurant that my (butt-head) little brother chefs at. If you're reading from somewhere else, check  urlLink this list , there may be a paint-your-own-ceramics place in your neighborhood.

      I signed up at  urlLink Crafster  today. Lots of ideas, tons. First point of interest: what to do with those annoying discs you get in the mail, a  urlLink star , a  urlLink quilt ,  urlLink disco ball , or  urlLink painted   urlLink flowers . My idea now is a different kind of flower, with a disc for each petal. If I let it hang like a wind chime, would the reflection be too bright on the disc side?

       Quote Thoughts  Today's quote came from a search for quotes on 'imagination', as when I'm looking for quotes for this blog, I usually search for quotes on 'creativity' or 'imagination' or things like that. This quote popped up, and I wasn't sure how much I agree with it, so I thought I'd still post it to raise discussion. Is there such a thing as 'too much material' or just, perhaps, the wrong kind of material. For example, if I'm in a phase of watching a lot of junk TV, I'm 'inputting' a lot of material, and I do see it effecting my creative process. On the other hand, if I'm 'inputting' inspiring things, l don't feel like there is a 'too much' point.

       Projects Update  Let's see... I got some new glow-in-the-dark paint "pens" and re-did some of the  urlLink G-I-T-D boobies project . Took off some paint, put on different paint. And I took pictures of the face I mentioned last week:  urlLink     (sheesh, is that the face from mars?)  The process so far was: we used the gauze stuff that has some plaster stuff in it to make a mold of my face. Then poured plaster of paris into the mold. As I mentioned, that was a couple years ago, and the face has been on the shelf until I remembered it last week. I also bought sand paper this week, so I can get onto the next step! I'm embarrassed that I left it undone so long, but excited to be starting it again. And a little VD art. Dear readers: nothing big, but look for your valentine Saturday. Also more crocheting practice, but loaned the camera out, so no pix of that yet. Lastly, inspired by  urlLink these . Wondering if I could make some like them. Cloth, or hmmm, maybe when I get better with the crocheting, I could crochet cuffs onto purchased cleaning gloves. That could work.

( urlLink Flying -there I said it out loud) Computer projects were designing the funky new  urlLink front page  (by the way, I've only heard back from one reader about that picture, the links are hidden in the picture, is that too obscure??), and a new page, the  urlLink penguin  page.  Working on a secret web project right this minute, hopefully to be unveiled later this month.

       Knitting or Crocheting?  That is the  urlLink question . I'm partial to crochet, and teaching myself. Or working on it, anyway. I've been only partly sucessful, thinking there's something I'm not doing right, but I think I found the 'missing link' (LOL-I crack myself up) in  urlLink these   urlLink instructions .  One thing I really enjoy about knitting/crocheting is all the cool blogs, here's my two new favs:  urlLink Bron  and  urlLink Joe . But most of the knitting &/or crocheting blogs out there are listed as knitting blogs, there's several  urlLink rings  and  urlLink things . I'm wondering, are there just more knitters than crocheters out there? or do people who call themselves 'knitters' usually do both?

       Last One  I've been ranting about snow and football more lately than Creativity and the Artistic Process, and I mean to rectify that. But one more for now. I went out this morning to take the older son to school (younger has the head cold, too, and is staying home) and we got stuck getting out of the driveway. Not a huge problem, he caught a ride with my Aunt and cousins down the street while I got the car un-stuck. But here's the thing: I discovered that my nice-guy shoveler didn't do the whole job yesterday morning. So I had to finish scooping. Yuck.  Last time I'm going to pay for scooping, or at least the last time I'll give them the money first. And did I mention I'm sick? The last place this fever-burning gal needs to be is out in the snow, shoveling. OK, back to bed, bundled up for me.

       Super Wrap-Up  As far as the game itself, it took a long time to get going. As far as the commercials, none were too exciting. I guess my favorite was the bear faking the ID. As far as the Half-Time show...first I was thinking, Justin Timberlake is the surprise mystery guest? Whoopy-sh*t. But he sure raised the OMG level when he ripped off Janet Jackson's shirt. What the? And now, supposedly it was an  urlLink accident , but if so, what exactly was he trying to do? No one is going to remember  urlLink that Kiss  anymore, that's for sure. And for the one guy in the world that doesn't watch the Super Bowl, here's the  urlLink picture  (NOT safe!) And that's not a  urlLink pastie  I learned. Oh, and  urlLink Bionce  did a great job on the National Anthem. But no one will remember that, either.

       Second Verse...  Getting set to leave for my second official day. Came home dead-dog tired, worked on my Crafster swap, and off to bed. The munchkins are on spring break, and I dreamed they stayed awake all night talking, which is almost what it felt like. But my body is quickly getting used to the routine, I woke up before my alarm today. Orientation is a necessary evil, I know, but I have to admit I get freakishly excited when they pass out big packets of information. Today I think I actually get to meet the folks I'll be working with. If only for a moment. Then back to more classwork tomorrow and Thursday. Plus, today is my younger son's birthday. So now they're officially 13 and 11. Teen and Tween. No more 'children' in this house. Life is grand.

       Goal  OK, I'm ready to admit my creative goal to the world! I've been working up to unveiling this for a while, and am compelled to do it tonight, before my first day of my new job tomorrow.  So here it is: I am going to become a Certified  urlLink PMC  teacher, teach  urlLink PMC  classes and sell  urlLink PMC  jewelry. See goal page  urlLink here .  I don't know why this is so difficult to write about, I guess the fear of failing. A goal that is never admitted aloud can be forgotten about and no one would know. So I make this public, because I do not intend to let anything get in the way. Baby steps, of course, but it's gonna happen.

       The Lady or The Tiger  In an essay I wrote in college, I likened creativity to, among other things, "opening the door on the lady or the tiger." I've been thinking about that recently, and I've decided that not just creativity is the opening of the door, but all the decisions we make.  Some decisions are pretty obvious: running a red light would be much more the tiger, stopping would be the lady. Others aren't so telling: eating the leftovers that you don't remember how long they've been in the fridge. :P  Even though we don't think about the little decisions we make every day, all our decisions could go either way. There is excitement in the unknowing, and in the opening of the door itself.

       Someone's laughing  Car watching is just a normal thing in our family. My grandma likes PT Cruisers, and points them out on car trips or prizes on The Wheel. The kid's play 'slug bug' just like we all did when we were kids. I love Mustangs (and have been known to date boys for no other reason). I'm sure others watch for certain car types, right?  Well, I decided that someone at GM must have a very warped sense of humor in naming their giant jeep-things the same name as a sex act.  It was very difficult for me to keep a straight face recently, at lunch with my retired-and-roaming parents who've just returned from a three month trip of volunteer work and vacationing, and my mother said they "had eight Hummers" but she didn't remember if that was in one day or one week.

And went to the  urlLink University Place Art Center  to check out a work-in-progress collection by a friend of mine. In the main gallery there were some fantastically inspiring glass works, and I think I accidentally met the artist.

       The Door Project   I don't think my friend J has yet read my blog, so I'm safe posting this before she's recieved her gift, but J, if you actually are reading this, stop now or you'll spoil the surprise.  The story of the door: I was getting ready to paint a shadowbox shelf that I had bought like three years ago (as part of my DO-it-or-fling-it sorting out my project junk project), and I cut off the  urlLink top flap . Which looked just like a  urlLink door .  Hmmmm... So this turned into a door wall hanging project. And do you know what it needed? The Perfect Quote! I searched for 'quotes door' and found a great Joseph Campbell 'following your bliss'  urlLink quote , and I knew the project was meant for my friend J!  Trips to the store for drill bits for the Dremel, and tracing paper, and several experiments with lining up the word right, and it turned out  urlLink pretty nice .

       Stuck in the Windmill  Last night I woke up in the middle of the night, and had a hella hard time getting back to sleep. The issue is also why I haven't been updating chez blog very often (or well) lately: I've really been in my head so much. Between having a mild sore throat off and on for a couple weeks, and basically having no one to talk to, I end up just swimming around and around in my own thoughts. I hope both my readers  ;)  will forgive my lack of posting and will accept my pledge to 'get off the pot' soon.

       Disgusting and Disturbing  OK, I'll admit, I was warned not to watch The Swan. But I flipped past and it was like a train wreck that I couldn't turn away from. Completely horrifying. I won't even start on how they're glorifying 'perfection' and cookie-cuttering these women. And I won't comment on how the doctors are nothing special to look at themselves (meaning they haven't had all sorts of surgeries done on  themselves  but they're willing to do all sorts of unnecessary surgeries on these people. And I won't finish by saying how pathetic it is that everyone made such a big deal about how beautiful these women are NOW, completely diminishing the beauty they already had to begin with. I won't even start. I will go off on a different tangent, though.  I can not get into MaryKate and Ashley being grown-up hotties. I just can't see it. Yes, they've grown up just beautifully, but every time I look at them, I still see that little curly-headed baby, all smiley, as the 'uncle' and 'best friend' try changing diapers for the first time, and one says to 'dad' my favorite punch-line-turned-personal-catch-phrase-that-year (say it with me!): "Your baby's a  pig ."

Like photos of paintings or sculptures from the arts page, ads for things I might like to buy or make something similar (read: better), or headlines with words I might be able to string together in a ransom note or something  ;p .  Basic collage fodder.  So tonight I remembered that I have a bunch of extra newspapers from a year and a half ago, when my family reunion picture, and Grandparents' anniversary picture was in the paper, and all my friends at work brought me their copies to send to out-of-town relatives. I didn't know that my Auntie had ordered extra copies and all the our-of-towners were taken care of. So I have several extras.  Hmmmm, I could make a few cool collages for my Aunties and Mom with those extra paper clippings. Now the idea machine is working overtime. We'll see what squirts out.

       Growing Pains  My oldest is going on his first non-family trip tomorrow. All the way to  urlLink Worlds of Fun ! It's with his choir, and there are plenty of chaperones, but still.  I'm excited for him to get to go have a fun day sans-parental-unit but still a little nervous.  So my weekend will be spent focusing on the 'excited for him' part, making little brother's day fun since he doesn't get to go, and working again on my crocheting. This time, I hope to actually make a square instead of a triangle.  Did anyone see that stitch I dropped???

       Daydream Believer  OK, so my big 'job/career' goal includes having a stable, fairly easy-going day job, and working toward the artistic goals in the evenings. That's the plan. I am actually glad to have a 'leave-it-at-the-office' kind of job, so I can devote more energy to the art.  At work, we have these  urlLink newsletters  we pass around at work, full of helpful hints, success stories, and good ideas for folks in most any business. Of course, I read the articles thinking about how it could help me in my job, but some of the ideas can be applied to the creative process as well.  Case in point: Daydreaming.  The shortened version of  urlLink this article  (written by  urlLink her ) in our little newsletter said, among other things, to have a daydreaming 'session' that is planned. Now, some folks might think that's too rigid, but really, it's a good idea. Set aside a time, or place even, that's good for mind wandering. Driving is a good one for me. The shower, too, I often write a post in my head while showering. Before falling asleep is perfect, as often the daydreaming blends into the actual dreaming, and great ideas come from the sleeping mind.  So where do you daydream?

       Vampira Scare  I've decided that my digital camera is a Vampira. She sucks the life out of all batteries she even looks at. Luckily, with recursively, I can keep her pretty well fed, but I have decided that when not in use, I have to take out the batteries.  So I'm finally working on some pictures I've been promising to do, and she's making a strange error noise. IKES! This is the last piece of new technology I have, and she's already almost a year old. And I know I won't be able to get anything new (computer, better TV, TiVo) for a long while, so I don't want anything to happen to her.  Luckily, I found 'return to defaults' and she's back to her battery-sucking-goodness.   OK, that was a boring story, but I'd be lost without my camera

       Cool?  My stats show someone found me by Googling  *    urlLink "cool things in lincoln."  And strangely enough, I was the only site to pop up in that search. While I'm certainly flattered, I certainly do not deserve that honor. Really, the site to see for "cool things in Lincoln" is  urlLink Womats anyone? , he's got some great local links down there under Odd Links, including web cams from all over town. Plus, he put together a list of  urlLink Lincoln Area Bloggers , which is  very  cool.     *   OK, it was actually Yahoo!, but don't you use Kleenix and Band-Aids and Q-Tips instead of tissues and bandages and swabs?

       Lazy Day  Still getting used to being in a new schedule, and this is the first kid-free weekend for me since starting the new job. That means: nekkid blogging, laying in bed reading, maybe a bath (reading again), fresh asparagus for supper (but I need to figure out how to cook it), some photo sessions including  urlLink Crafster  pix (I promise) and maybe another  urlLink Worth  entry (but I only have 14 hours), an afternoon of 15's (my improvised  urlLink Flylady  "you can do anything for 15 minutes" trick: I do 15 minutes of chores, then 15 minutes of fun, back and forth for a few hours), playing with all the pets, hopefully more Deep Space 9---shoot, they should have run it all weekend, but it's not starting again 'till late afternoon, another nap, generous self-love, and all around relaxation.  Edit:  Also forgot to add: Margaritas, movies, and grocery shopping. But since the movie I had decided to rent (The Whole 9 Yards--since the next one is coming to theatres soon) is actually on television tonight, I have nothing prodding me to get out of the house, so I'll put off the shopping. YAY!

If anyone has suggestions on the disclaimer part, please let me know. My goal is to not infringe on anyone's art, while using it in my own way. I think linking back to the site I found it is a good way to give them their credit, don't you? I have named this new art form Blage, as in Web-Collage. I will be working on more soon. Anyone have an idea for the next subject matter?

       Finally Friday  I found myself, unexpectedly, with free time tonight, due to plans changing at the proverbial last minute (and I was pretty good about being flexible with it), so I used this time to finally finish a couple things.  Specifically, I got my t-shirt design entered at  urlLink Designs on the White House , which I had finished a couple weeks ago, just hadn't gotten it entered (my design is simple, and is based on the actual previous voting of my sweetie).  And I finished the afore-mentioned  urlLink collage !! The booby prize  (@)(@)  goes to Perry, for at least guessing!  Also finally, one of my absolute favorite blogs,  urlLink Art for Housewives  is back, YAY!!

       Creative Training  Do you remember in one of Steve Martin's early monologues he had a bit about teaching your kid the wrong words for things?  I'm wondering if people do that in real life.  Like when training the new girl, maybe tell her to do things a little, well, wrong. Maybe like when someone asks new girl to order more 'xyz' forms, tell her to order, say 20 million more than she really should order. And just maybe, tell new girl to put all 20 million forms in the mailbox of the person who asked for them. And when the person who ordered them bites new girl's head off because they really only needed maybe 50 forms, not 20 million, just smile quietly to yourself at your little joke. It would be really funny if it was a prank. Really. But if it's just being mean, it's just plain not nice. And speaking as a bonifide new girl, I know not nice.

       and The Mother of all Quotes   Paraphrasing from an early Roseanne episode:   DJ: Mom, was I an accident?  Roseanne: No DJ, you were a surprise.  DJ: What's the difference?  Roseanne: An accident is something that if you had to do it all over again, you wouldn't do, but a surprise is something you didn't even know you wanted until you got it.  I was thinking recently about how this is true with lots of parts of life, and the creative process.  How many times do you have an idea of what the painting, photo, poem,  collage or whatever is going to be, only to be surprised by what it actually is?  Embrace the surprise. That's what art's all about.

       Can't sleep, flower is watching me...  A surprise flower came delivered to my door this afternoon. Two guys with a flat full of little potted flowers, and they just rang the bell and handed it to me, saying  Happy Mother's Day . I was surprised by the gesture, and read the attached card as I walked in, "Because we C.A.R.E. The such-and-such Seventh Day Adventist Church" which surprised me even more, since they didn't tell me who they were at the door, or try to talk to me about their religion. I have to say I was impressed by the act, the just doing it part, without the proselytizing part.  Of course, my cynical side is wondering if there are ulterior motives to delivering the flower. Like, they'll be back in a week all ready to proselytize, and try to make me let them in since they gave me the flower. Or they hid a camera in the flower pot to catch me 'sinning'. I also wonder why care is an acronym. That could be scary or weird, like: "Crustation (eaters) Are Roasting Eternally"

       Busy Weekend  Wow, busy weekend around Lincoln town. Friday and Saturday,  urlLink Celebrate Lincoln , an ethnic festival, was down town. Pretty nice, and mostly free (sans food stuffs of course), needed more 'do things' booths  for older kids and grownups (so maybe I need to volunteer to help with that next year), we did get our names written in Chinese, which was cool. We planned our trip around the music of  urlLink Kusi Taki  (that's the best picture I could find, they need a web site). I really enjoy their music, the pan pipe playing is phenomenal.  Also this weekend, the Lincoln Marathon was/is this morning. They always go right by my house, but so early (for a Sunday morning) that I don't really see much of it. It's always odd to wake up to random applause and voices of runners. This afternoon, Open House at  Lincoln General   urlLink Bryan LGH West , and tonight the Lincoln Boy's Choir spring performance.  And those are only the events I personally know about, there's always more.

      Oh, and for those of you keeping track, the winners were announced over at  urlLink Designs On The White House  last week.  I was happy to be one of eight semi-finalists, and ecstatic to be one of four finalists in my category, and I'm pleased to say that my favorite entry (not my own) was the winner. Seriously, it's not one of those 'it was an honor to just be nominated' spoken through clenched teeth. I really did not expect to get as far as I did, and am very happy that I overcame my procrastination tendencies and entered the contest. The folks at DOTWH said us finalists could sell our designs in our own Cafe Press store, and they'd link to us. They haven't put up the link yet, but here's my store, if you want to check it out:  urlLink  Technicolor Junk to Buy

      Talking with cousins this weekend at our Grandmother's funeral, it was interesting to hear what we each remembered. A lot of our memories were very similar, but it's always amazing to me to see what different perspectives we have on events, and what specific things are important enough to us to store in our memory banks. Like my cousins didn't remember that I had sat on a nail during a rousing game of follow-the-leader through the goat pen. I however, remembered it very well, probably due to the resulting tetanus shot. On the other hand, one cousin was scared of bats flying into her hair for years, because I had told her once that they would, which I don't remember at all. (I'm sure I really believed it, too, didn't we all learn that old wive's tale when we were growing up?) We also talked about how events can build in our memories, things can grow into tall tales without us even realizing it. These cousins raised goats, mostly for milk, but I remember so well the barbecue pit that was dug to roast a kid, and the wonderful picnic we had that year. I thought this was an annual event at their house, only I hadn't been there every year, but my Aunt let me know that they hadn't done that more than twice ever, and the time I remember was a special occasion when cousins from the west coast were visiting.  So we talked about how much that one event meant to me as a child, so much that I built it into much more than it was. That made us think of the memories we're giving to our children, and we reminded ourselves that good memories can be made even from one little event.  The last few weeks I've been hungry for a childhood recipe, and I made it for my kids last night. I don't remember how often we made it when I was a kid, it could have only been once, but it brings back good memories. And my kids loved it, and hopefully will have good memories associated with it.  And in case you'd like to share my  memories, or if you're just looking for a simple desert to make, here it is:   E-Z PEACH COBBLER  from mom's church cookbook   1 2lb can peaches with juice 1 butter brickle cake mix  (I don't think they make that kind anymore, works just as well with yellow cake mix)  1 c margarine or butter 1/4 c water Pour peaches and juice into 9x13 pan. Sprinkle dry cake mix over peaches. Drizzle melted butter and water over cake mix. Bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes or until bubbly and slightly browned. Let cool for 10 minutes or so before serving.

       HeyDay  Went to the  urlLink Haymarket Heydays  Saturday. Not as big a deal as in years gone by, but still cool. Farmer's market, local artisans displaying their wares, and live music.  Of interest:  urlLink this  self-taught local artist,  urlLink Blue Plate Specials  where you can make your own mosaics, and my new favorite  urlLink candles .(and LIPGLOSS!)

       Here I am  Due to my spotty posting history (and Blogger's wonderful change the time and date feature), you may not have even noticed I was gone. But  I  sure did! I got home last weekend to find that my computer wouldn't start, and hmm, let's see, there had been storms here while I was gone. So my computer's been in the body shop all week. Luckily, I have it back just in time to send in my bio and full-strength design that  urlLink DSOWH  asked for last Friday. Finished a cool beaded wind-sock/mobile kind of thing this week, just need to figure out how to make it hang right. Oh, and  urlLink Raspberry OneDollarBars (scroll down) are the absolute best things in the world! I wonder where I can find them locally, or do I have to have a fund raiser to get more???

I am humbled to be in such great company, and soo glad they extended the origional deadline, or my design wouldn't have made it in at all. Check out all the  urlLink finalists . Good luck to all!

       Designs  At  urlLink Designs On The White House  preliminary voting is finished, on to round two! My entry actually made it to round two, and isn't doing too bad in the voting. And it looks like I'm the only finalist from the great state of Nebraska (at least I'm the only one who  admitted  it).   AND   I am soo creaming my jeans thinking that the  urlLink famous judges  might actually be looking at something  I  made. Especially two of my chick-heros:  urlLink Margaret Cho  and  urlLink Janeane Garofalo !!

      I lost a couple days this week due to catching a strange virus, still feel like I'm playing 'catch-up'.  Luckily, only fever and body aches, and sleeping (and hot garlic soup) knocked it out. Strangest fever I've ever had, and I had one once that actually produced hallucinations, this one came upon me so suddenly, I thought I was starting hot flashes or something. And I had a milder case than some at work. What ever you do, don't catch this nasty virus.

      This  urlLink hat  project sounded very fitting for me, as the weekend goal is to get the work area table ready for the sewing machine. A flowered hat is next on my list of finishing.  There are many interesting and inspiring things at   urlLink Comfort Queen , including a personal journal to help keep you on track.  urlLink This  reminds me of my  urlLink Project Creation  idea. And a whole collection of  urlLink Vagina Art .

      It's been a week of doing rather than writing. A lot of three-generation fun going on. Game night (the older generation has surely missed some of the newer pop culture trivia), the local  urlLink Zoo , getting my brakes fixed (thanks, Dad!), and going to Fiddler On The Roof at the  urlLink Pinewood Bowl .  Watching a nice rendition of one of my all-time favorite musicals under the stars sitting between my parents and my children.  I  AM   a rich (wo)man.

      This summer I'm working on finishing projects, or just realizing I'm never going to finish something and getting rid of it (more on that later). So far, I've been doing pretty well finishing some old things, just finished one project that was inspired and started probably 5 years ago. (Pictures soon) But all this finishing has lit the start fire, too. And I've got two projects in the hopper, in the thinking about stage, that I hope to finish this summer also.  A colored pencil/watercolor still life, subject still undecided, and a beaded pin or pendant made with beaded embrodery and fringe, design also still undecided. Now that I've been inspired with the medium, I'm just working on the subject matter/designs.  Busy checking any/all inspiration and trying to  urlLink 'break my eye open' .

      Long weekend without the kids. Well, the really big, cuddly kid was here, but that's different.   ;)   Always hard to get back into the swing of things, and the kids actually had almost a whole week vacation, so even harder for them to get back into things. Question for today: When you take a vacation from work, even for a long weekend, do you take a 'vacation' from your creative hobbies, too?

      You can tell that it's been a nice, wet spring when... you  finally  need to get out the hose to water the flowers, and discover that it's woven into the ground cover and you have to hack through to get it free.  :)  Some of this year's flowers are now showing in the  urlLink gallery .

      So today's pay day, and I'm feeling like my budget is closer to 'in line' than 'out of control' now, so I treated the kids to Popeyes for supper, then ran off to Hobby Lobby to pick up those on sale patterns. I was very diciplined at HL, and only spent $10. OK, it was $10.11, but close enough. I bought two hat patterns, which was what I went for, browsed the fabric, and of course, bought a few beads.  I'm looking for earring inspiration, but didn't find any. I only bought the beads that I really loved, and they are started on a project already. But the funniest thing tonight was part of the adventure. I had to get to HL in a round about way because of different road construction projects, and I'm going up a road I don't normally travel, so seeing new things. I drive past a house that has a 'sold' sign, a class C-type camper for sale, and a portable basketball hoop, also for sale. (is 'portable' the right word?) Anyway, I've looked into getting one of these for my boys, I know the price can range from $75 or so up to at least $150, and as I drive by, I see the sign says  FOR SALE $25 . Cool, I'm thinking. I can afford that! I can't take it home right now in this car, but I could ask my friend to pick it up in his painting van, he'd do that. I don't have the cash on me, but I could offer a check, or offer to go to an ATM to get the cash.  So yup, I turned the car around and pulled up in their driveway. Something told me to double check the sign before ringing their bell. I go to check, and the notebook page that was the 'for sale' sign was kinda wrapped around the pole, and it actually read  FOR SALE $125 . Whoops. I got right back in my car and headed out. There were two adorible little girls at the glass screen door as I started to pull away. They had heard the car and come to see what was up. I waved, and they seemed dissapointed that I wasn't coming to the door. Oh, well.

      At work, we have a little customize-your-wallpaper program, and since today happened to be I'm-tired-of-the-wallpaper-I-have day, I checked the list for something new. I found  urlLink Eskimo Nebula , and remembered how much I love nebula pictures.  We went to the SAC museum a few years ago when there was a Hubble display with pictures of nebulas and information about the Hubble itself. It was awe-some and then-some. Here's a few more cool nebula pix I found:  urlLink  M2-9: Wings of a Butterfly Nebula  ,  urlLink  An Orion of a Different Color  ,  urlLink  Orion's Horsehead Nebula  ,  urlLink  Orion Nebula: The 2MASS View ,  urlLink  Orion: The Big Picture   I found these on  urlLink a site  that since June 16, 1995, has posted cool space pictures everyday. It is now a perminent fixture on my  urlLink BlogRoll . Oh, and here's a place you can send nebula  urlLink e-cards .

      I haven't had time to read very much of  urlLink this  yet, but it looks interesting. Love, love, love  urlLink mosaics , can't wait to do some of my own.  urlLink McCall  patterns are on sale at  urlLink Hobby Lobby  this week, and I need another hat pattern. Trying to decide between  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one .  And  urlLink secrets from Grandma . My own include not giving a knife as a gift, so as not to 'cut' the friendship (it is ok to 'sell' the knife to a friend for a nickle), and putting a penny above the front door to promote wealth in the household.
