O yeah, my hand 'accidentally' clenched up into a fist in business studies and hit alex a 'couple' of times on his arm, such a watse of energy, i could of just thumped him in the face, and he would of shut up. Well i had a nice kip on the bus this mornin, i'll also explain another time, anyways must dash, its off to bed, ok to play on my ps2 or maybe sleep, i dunno which yet

      *stresses* if you hate quick time player, then thats alright, because i fucking hate it. I mean, why the fuck can i not open my .mpeg files?, just necause i changed the fil name doesnt mean i cant open it, how come windows media player, lets me play them, stupid quicktime, the quicker that they let me play my movie, the better, because then i can actually start editing them, but grrrr quicktime, joiin me in destroying the company, unless it lets me play my movies.

      GHOSTBUSTERS, such a good song i suggest that you all go and download it now because  "if theres an invisilble man sleeping in your bed, who you gonna call? ghostbusters" or me if your eally want, but  "if theres something strange in your neighbour hood, who you gonna call? ghostbusters", now time for some reflection: this week we say thanks to Alice who has been able to help me out with a little problem that i have, lets hope the solution works ;) We also say thanks to Vic, who has been vic, which is good, because i can talk a lot about random things, so lets give them both a round of applause *claps* anyway to round of this fine staurday evening, i will say "GHOSTBUSTERS" good night and thank you all *bows*

        Just adding a bit of colour to your "book of thoughts." Hey, you know it's not a book don't you? Oh good, you do. Well it's a little different writing in someone else's blog. Like I have to actually write something which makes sense.  =S  Of couse, that's not good and I'm not sure it's gonna happen either. I feel like I shouldn't be here. Like it's your little space and no-one elses. But I don't mind other people going into mine. Oh well. Apparently I'm a dumbass. So, I think I should leave now. The Book - Now Free of Dumbasses. Bye byes... can you make dumbass into a plural? Hm..

        Heh. I found Alex very amusing. He didn't say anything exactly funny, just the way he thinks...it's a lil warped. OK, I know what it was, I was laughing  at  him. =D In the nicest possible way of course. He caught me in a good mood. He's lucky. Then again, have you ever seen me in a bad mood? Well, noticed it? Yeah it's pretty likely that you have..hmmm SLEEP. Goddamn.

I say dear too much! I call everyone dear. I called Smee dear, I called Naylor dear  that  freaked Trudie out. "Did you just call Naylor dear?!" Hee hee hee. Naylor with his damned camera, Vic get in the photo "Um, no thankyou dear" .....Trudie, Trudie, Trudie, aw bloody hell - that's just great, I just took a picture of my shirt. Hmmm, I just felt like writing. And I don't really know what to write. And heyyy, you said you were coming back at 9. Well mister, it's 9.53 now. I think you LIED. *gasp* hehehe. I did my FTT, for now anyway. They'll probably give me it back again, they always do..was going to say something then...then I remembered something. I'll carry on in mine.

        I'd like you to carry on my "piece of descriptive writing" please? We had to do it in English, only the introduction though. We had about 5mins. Finish the rest? Then I can use it in my exam or something. Thank you dear. Here's the start for you...  Alone and forgotten beside the stairs of a disused library, the war memorial stands. A ghost of the past, the only object to remind us of the deaths of our proud men. They thought that they were fighting for the good of humanity, but no one visits anymore. They are all too busy living their own lives; lives which are only possible as a result of the brave actions of these men. But one, just one man still comes back here. He hasn’t forgotten, he feels at one with the statue. Old and lonely, yet strangely content. Sitting by the side of the statue, not moving, only thinking. Just as no one cares about the statue, no one cares about him. He's a skeleton of a man, a life gone wrong. An empty shell in a human form....    There you go dear, I'd be so grateful if you would finish it for me. Hey, it'll only take you a few hours. This is what I did in around 5 minutes. I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did. =) For some strange reason I'm thinking that you wont do it..  P.S. It doesn't need to be interesting, it's just a nice place to keep your thoughts.  P.P.S. My picture does work. You're just jealous coz you can't do it. =P

      Riding in my clapped out astra Trying to buy her some pasta I saw a strange lady, she made me smile She had her nail file upon a tile So she shouted:  “and I come from across the river   where there is some grass & I always shiver can you not hear, not hear my screams? you’d better run, before it deafens streams”  Parking my astra in my spot It was a squeeze with that big cot I said, “do you see that damage?” She just laughed and kicked me in my haemorrhage I screamed:   “and you come from across the river   where there is some grass & you always shiver can I not hear, not hear your screams? you’d better run, before it deafens streams”  Running down the main road With my shady lady thumping Alex in his abode  She said “how’s life?” I said “you’re my wife” We screamed:  “and we come from across the river   where there is some grass & we always shiver can you not hear, not hear our screams? you’d better run, before it deafens streams”

      ooo i love this song, men at work - down under, such a classic song i think i might put the lyrics in this wee box here   Men At Work - Down Under   Travelling in a fried-out Kombi On a hippie trail, head full of zombie I met a strange lady, she made me nervous She took me in and gave me breakfast And she said,  "Do you come from a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder You better run, you better take cover."  Buying bread from a man in Brussels He was six foot four and full of muscle I said, "Do you speak-a my language?" He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich And he said,  "I come from a land down under Where beer does flow and men chunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder You better run, you better take cover."  Lying in a den in Bombay With a slack jaw, and not much to say I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me Because I come from the land of plenty?" And he said,  "Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah) Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder You better run, you better take cover."  such a class song dont you think, i mean the lyrcis are just so great, so random which makes them great

Awwww computers are evil and mean and mean and evil. W00t, firewall is back. Hey Mark does anyone read your blog? Do they see what I write to you? =/ Mwahaha.. you deleted your username, you should have blamed it on the hackers, said that they did it.. I could have sent you some of your stuff back to you.. but just the other day I put everything onto zip disk - which meant I deleted a lot of videos and pictures etc. I still have some of your stuff.. hehe I kept it. =/ Don't know why. I hoarde things a lot.. hoarde = spelt wrong and basically collect a lot of stuff... you fixed your computer now though... right?? hehehe you're bored... awwwww. *hands over another play toy* seem to have gotten bored of the last one. I'd play hide and seek with you. But hey you're in Manchester. Why is everyone who is nice to me live away!? No fair. *stamps feet like a little child* hahaha I stole that offa you. No seriously anyone who's nice to me lives away from me. Hey maybe that's ...well.... telling me something. You're around me for more than a few weeks and you just end up hating/disliking me... ah well... ummm.... I wrote enough... byebyes.

About love that you haven't told someone about, about the love you've left for some obscure reason... WHERE'D IT COME FROM? I DEMAND ANSWERS! Mwahahaha, I'm nice really. =)   *sighs* I'm not sure I'll get the answers I'm looking for, I don't even know what I'm looking for... lalalallaalalala - rambling.. *consciously makes an effort to stop*...*STOPS*

        ..that's your fault Mark! Well.. yours and Rowan's and Claire's.. I text you more than the others... ooo until this morning. I didn't sleep all night.. gahh you're away! I should start a little countdown.. but quite frankly I can't work anything out at all.. my head's fucked... hehe. SLEEP. Need sleep. I slept for about 2 hours in the garden.. it's been really hot up here.. haven't been able to appreciate it coz I just feel icky.. y'know when you've not slept for... LONG time? Like that.. sick and eughk.. no matter how many showers you have you still feel like you need more. Then again you're a guy. Guy sleepovers [if they even have them! most of them don't, I know] .. well anyway.. from what I've heard from guys about sleepovers... they sit and play on the playstation, or whatever other gaming platform thing is out.. X-box, whatever.. eat.. pass a lot of wind and laugh about it, and every now and again ask each other "so, who do you like then?" ... then the other one answers and it's like "oh, cool.." ...or... "eughk.. alright then"... but of course this is only guys in my old school. w00t! OLD school. =D YeY.. awwww you're away. I said I'd keep it updated, though I'm not sure what you want in here.. so I'll have my ramblings in here.. and in my own.. I'll keep crazy rants to my blog =D it's best that way. Oh, I better post this before my internet cuts off.. I'll just have to keep editing the stuff..   2nd edit: Oh go me! I just got it published and it cut me off... go me, I'm so clever. Maybe my brain is working after all.. and now I go write in my blog about.. oooo, offer of a nice place to sleeeeeeps! hehehe.

      The day of agony is near, when the devil will come and unleash his fear. The fear of love. The love, which blinds you from the real truth of lust. The lust you have which the devil hates. Your only saviour that solitary dove the one which symbolises your never ending love.  The day of pleasure is upon us, the only saviour i know now, is the one which lives high above us, the one that may not even be real, the one we can choose to belive in, the lord who has a never ending love for everyone, no matter what they have done in their lifetime, he has a never ending love for us. The day has begun, the gates swing open, but do i want them to be open, do i want to be here, or do i want to go back to my old life,the life where i seemed to be nobody, yet i had a vision, a vision whcih ultimately killed me, the vision of the world living in harmony, at peace with each other, no wars nothing, what will happen now?

      The Angel Of Darkness has arisen from the tombs of the damned. The time is near. A time for us to join as one and fight our way to freedom. The freedom given to us by our founding fathers, who fought so valiently for us. The Angel Of Darkness is here. What shall we do?, run like the cowards we are? or draw our swords and prove once and for all that we are the brave ones and the Angel Of Darkness is nothing more than fear itself. We can defeat the Angel Of Darkness and destroy our fear of that one special thing in our life. The thing we hold so close to us, yet fear as no man has feared before. Yes the Angel Of Darkness is our fear of love. don't let the Angel Of Darkness win, destroy her and reap the rewards!

      The darkness of the night was slowly beginning to take its toll on the fragile old almost lifeless form of a human who had been held capative in the old dusty house for almost a year. With barely any food and water, she looked older than she should of done for a once beautiful twenty four year old woman who had long blonde hair, hair which was now beginning to turn white with the dust from the house. Her capatives had not actually been mean to her, they had taken her hostage to prove a point to the world and to her father, but no one had seemed to listen to them or even care, what was the world coming to when no one cared about a beautiful young woman beginning missing for almost a year.

      Life, what is our purpose on this planet? why were we put on here? Don't worry i'm not going to bore you with this topic today i just felt like writing that down for no apparent reason, what i really want to talk about today is dreams. Dreams are brillant, i mean why do we have dreams? personally i believe that we have dreams because of something inside our brain that wants us to be happy at night time but mroe on this subject later on

      Well i'm quite pleased with my results, which is a funny thing because to be honest with you i couldnt care less what i got, i've discovered that life is mroe that just tests and more tests. In some ways a job interview is just like a test, i mean you have to go and explain stuff about yourself to the people at the interview, same on an application form, so pleh i cant be bothered going to get a job at this moment in time, hehehe i'm writing this without even looking at the keyboard, *feels proud* :D  Back to the present day, at the moment i've just come back from doing a paper round, my so called job, but hey £15 a week cant be bad for round 3hrs work can it now? i mean my sister got paid £3 something an hour for working longer hours at Kwik Save, its the same at most supermarkets, young people looking for a job are cheap labour in their eyes, if you get what i mean, i mean you can hire round 2 young people part time for the price of one older person fulltime, so i guess it makes more sense for them to hire young people these days, but then thinking about it you dont exactly get really good customer service now do you? this is one of the reasons why i prefer local independent shops, i mean you can go into a local shop and they'll say 'hi' or 'good morning/afternoon' its that bit of customer service which makes me feel happy and which is why i prefer local independent shops much more than your big supermarket. [end of rant, got to finish paper round off, so i'll continue this little rant later on when i get back around 5.30ish]

      ok i'm aware that this may cause a bit of an outcry from various members of the public, but seriously and honestly its just a film about blondes fighting back a bit like 'legally blonde' i suppose, not that i've seen it, which is true, but pleh i think the trailer looks good, and it'll be a great film to make, its guarnteed to make people laugh and make people scared (some of the scenes may be disturbing due to one or two images involivng umm yeah people know who i mean, [hint: after prom party photos, well before brods and i left anyway] but this is going to be my second film, realse date januray 2004, legally bloated will be my first, when i've made a script for it and kind of completed making the actual film, gordon bennet its going to laste flippin ages, pleh i'll let people look at it on kazaa ;) should get a few people downloading it off there ;) anyways i'll type some mroe in here later on if i remember, though i have a curfew of 11.30 during the holidays on my computer, or should i say my sisters computer, seen as shes bought it off me now, and i have to wait till the end of this week, beginning of next week for my lovely new computer, wahoo computer coming soon :D anyways i'm going to make a legally bloated site eventually, so umm yeah bye for now

Awwww noooo =( *hugs you lots*   " Its true, she said it'd never work, i mean shes from a 'upper class' part of society i'm form 'middle class' part of society " - bullshit, she doesn't deserve you dear, nono *shakes head* she acted like she liked you.. she does like you.. awww *hugs you again*  aww and I told you to tell her... aw no =( I'm sorry, I really thought she liked you.. SHE DOES like you. *confused now* She's gone all old fashioned on you with the "classes" thingie.. =S And btw, to me you're not a burden... not that it matters really. And don't change, stay as you are, it's great that you're nice sweetheart, really great, there's not many people like you around...  "Love" is complicated like that, but it's not your fault, you've been nothing but nce to her, it's her who's overreacted and stopped talking "next day nothing" - I know the feeling. Pssst it's spelt níave.. I think? I tried to spell it the other day, heh. Don't move to Poland! *yells and is selfish here* What about meeeeeee, who'll I talk toooo? And what about all those other people that know you in person, the ones that likes you. Don't go sit alone =( It'll only get you down, try make Danny go with you too.. Danny's mad =P clinically insane, he'll cheer you up, sure he will. "stayed being anti-alice" =P well you know what I think about that.. awwww *another hug*   This isn't helping I'm sure but.. hmm dunno why I wrote anything.. hmm.. nevermind, ignore me, but don't change, nonononono NO ! You're Mark, Mark can't change.. *hugs*

      meh tis all dodgy, one day we were getting on just fine, next day nothing, i guess it was expected though, i mean what was i supposed to expect?! *shakes head* nonono would of never worked, like she said, hmm might as well just stay a good friend, tis easier that way, i;m sure i'll find someone when i'm older and wiser, but meh *shrugs shoulders* why did i ahve a feeling my grandpa was trying to tell me something last night in that very weird dream i had, it was as though he was saying "...go get her...." its dodgy, ah well life goes on, places to see, pacts to keep, friends to talk to, new friends to make, i'm sure i'll meet the right person one of these days. I suppose you could say that i'm too young or too neieve (is that how you spell it?) might as well concentrate on producing 'legalkly bloated' i'm sure that it will pass the time, it will probabaly take my mind off the whole matter, i should of kept quiet, i should of just stuck to dannys lvoe life, i should never of fallen off my bike because now my hand is hurting :( maybe i should just move to poland, it would be better for all off us, might go for a walk round poynton pool tomorrow after i've done my papers, or i might go on firday, yes i'll go on firday its easier that way, it can give me inspiration, a nice time to just sit and think, its a rather good place for doing that, midn you thats all i did in school, sit and think, meh if it was time for college i'd at least have my mind taken off everything thats gone on in my life. I just don't know what to do anymore :(. Its true, she said it'd never work, i mean shes from a 'upper class' part of society i'm form 'middle class' part of society, it would never work out, no point in evn trying, wasno point in telling aneesah when she asked me, might as well just have a think, might a well go back to my old self, might as well go back in time and wish this whole sorry affair had never been given a chance to get out, its my own fault, i should never off gotten so 'big headed' about it, i should never of told danny, though to be fair to him he hasnt told anyone, that i know off, maybe i should just go back to writing pointless stories and producing pointless films, i'll go back to my old slef, if i can or should i do what my grandpa told me to do in that weird dream? i dont know anymore, tis is the time when i need my grandpa, he always knew what to do, shame hes dead :'( not really told anyone about how i feel about that, meh no-one would be interested anyway, i just usually listen to other peoples problems, no-one really thinks i have a problem, not that i do, i just bottle all my emotions up and it all ends like this  :( maybe i shouldt be so kind to people, maybe i should never of got messenger, then none of this would of ever happened, i just dont know :( what should i do? i've helped many a people with their problems, i've helped alice with all her problems and worries, maybe i shouldnt of, maybe i should of never added her to my contacts, i should of just stayed being anti-alice, i should never of added her, tis my own fault, like half of the problems i cause, tis my own fault, i guess i was more of a burden for various people and a good friend to various other people, i dont know, poland seems like a good place to go to clear my head, wish i could go there now, someone take me away to poland, failing that i'll go to poynton pool or up to higher poynton, lovely tranquil place, might drag danny there on friday or might go on my own, i shouldnt be so nice to people, maybe this is a good time to go to bed, i dont know anything anymore :(

      The night was closing in fast, the birds had long since stopped making their cheerful clatter of a noise, instead all you could hear was the long slow moans of the grasshoppers, hoping from one piece of grass to another, it was rather soothing to listen to them, all alone in the dead of the night.  “For God’s sake mark will you open this fucking door up!” came the loud angry shout from the human we call Danny, “Its going down tonight, we need you there, now open up this fucking God damn door!” “Alright, alright, calm down you’ll wake the neighbours” the quiet voice of Mark could be heard saying “What fucking neighbours?” Danny shouted as he continued banging his fists on the door, “you live in the fucking countryside!”

      It seems that i ahvent actually wrote anything 'useful' in here for a little while, so here i go, i'll attempt to explain what useful stuff has been going on in my life......  College: college is great, i took 4 subjects economics, geography, Vocational ICT (whcih  does  count as an A-level if you finsih the 2year course, and last but by no means least i also took Pyschology, whcih is a great subject we actually started some pyschology work yesterday, it wa great then we had a break at umm 9.55 for 10mins, then came back and watched a video about OCD's "Obsesive Compulsive Disorders" it really hit home the fact that pyschology is such a varied subject, its great and the teacher umm i forget her name is great.  Nothing else interesting has happened really, been talking to Danny for a bit and i'm off out tongiht to Philip's party for his good results, though its kinda a joint party with his brother Neil for his good A-level results, ah well means i get out of the hosue, think i'll take my camera as well, shoudl be able to get some good photos/videos dannys going to be there as well so yeah. Anyways, i'm going to go for a bit now, i'm bored and got ntohign to do :( and i cant think of anything to write :( i might update it later so bye for now *waves*

      So why wait until you decide i'll be right for you, why make the suffering longer than it needs to be?  Why are you always in my mind? my joyful thoughts surrounding the love of my life, but to no avail it appears that you no longer need me so this is the end, the end of my world. i'll move on and find someone else, but remember you'll always be deep within my heart, a small place forever belonging to the one i loved the most. How i'll miss these joyful times whcih you gave to me, i'll love you forever within my heart and my mind, you'll always be running through my mind, no matter what, i'll always be there for you

      The wise old man said to me one day, that this was how to enjoy the true beauty of life itself.....  "Look deep within that place we call a heart, a place where love is stored, tell them what you feel before the time is too late"  The true beauty of life itself was rather simple when all i really need to do now is proclaim my never ending love.....  "Before you tell the one ou love them, consider this....."  The wise old man said to me  "Will it effect your friendship? for realtionships are based on more than a friendship. If the one you lvoe is right for you, you will know about it, you will have a love so strong that only god himself can break it. so bear this in mind next time..... Love is never ending but life itself is!"

      Time, why you punish me? Like a wave bashing into the shore You wash away my dreams.  Time, why you walk away? Like a friend with somewhere to go You left me crying  Can you teach me about tommorrow And all the pain and sorrow Running free? Cause tomorrow's just another day And I don't believe in time  Time, I don't understand Children killing in the street Dying for the color of red Time, hey there red and blue Wash them in the ocean, make them clean, Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight  Can you teach me about tomorrow All the pain and sorrow Running free? But tomorrow's just another day And I don't believe in...  chorus:  Time is wasting Time is walking You ain't no friend of mine I don't know where i'm goin' I think I'm out of my mind Thinking about time  And if I die tomorrow, yeah Just lay me down in sleep  (chorus)  Time, you left me standing there Like a tree growing all alone The wind just stripped me bare, stripped me bare Time, the past has come and gone The future's far away Now only lasts for one second, one second Can you teach me about tomorrow And all the pain and sorrow Running free? 'Cause tomorrow's just another day And I don't believe in time  (chorus)  Time, why you punish me?

      You know all this free time which i have now a days, well its got me thinking about life and time itself and stuff. I mean what actually is time? its just something which man made up to help him. And life, as strange as this may seem, but from the day that we ourselves are born, we are actually dying, its a bugger isnt it! but enough of the negative stuff, might as well go back to the positive me the me which people always seem to prefer to the negative me, *shrugs shoulders* meh its a bugger isnt it

      She sits alone by a lamppost trying to find a thought that's just came to mind She says Dad's (?there's) the one I love the most his time's not far behind  She never lets me in only tell me where?s she?s been when she?s had too much to drink I say that I don?t care I just run my hands through her dark hair then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away  And just? Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?let her be.  This morning I woke up alone found a note standing by the phone saying baby, maybe I?ll be back some day I wanted to look for you You walked in I didn?t know just what I should do so I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself.  Saying... Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?let her be.  Ah.....ah.....oh...oh... No..no..no..no...  Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?Ah-ah...  Last night I tried to leave cried so much  I could not believe she was the same girl I fell in love with long ago She went in the back to get high I sat down on my couch and cried yelling oh mama please help me won?t you hold my hand.  And... Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?  Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be...oh...let her be.

      I'm offically Confused *confused look* i really should do more at weekends, but no-one seems to do what i want to do, wheres the harm in just going for a walk or a bike ride or just getting the bus to some place, walking around then coming back? Theres no harm in it at all, hmm might get the bus into manchester on monday if i can persuade my mum to buy me some new trousers, hmmm maybe i should of gone to Oldham with them today, damn me being in bed being all lazy!, and damn my bloody knee for hurting *hits knee* damn that just made it worse *angry look* i've decided that delivering my papers in the dark is much better than delivering them whilst its light, when its dark you can have fun trying to find the letterbox etc and make peoples lights come on, hehehe its always amusing when your wlaking down the road and all these lights are on because you've just delievered a paper there, hmm i'm rambling on now.....

        Something to add to your time piece.. but really it's all in how you percieve time. Time is the same for everyone, the seconds don't just get longer for one person, the minutes turn into hours.. it's how you view time, how you fill time. Really, we're all just alike - some people make more of it than others.    Edit: Haha I don't make sense

Well it went something like this the dream that is: [mark falls asleep and tosses and turns as usual, ending up in a 'ball', dream starts] I was in my house, well not this house but my future house, with my wife. We were on the bed, don't ask what we were doing, i';ll let you decided that ;), then we moved and well is aw her face and she was very very very nice, then it went to a couple of moths later on and we had, had about two or three kids. [dream ends] Damn me waking up at that point, i was enjoying the dream as well!! I know its a dodgy dream but hey its  my  dream what do you expect!

      If love were what the rose is; And I were the leaf, Our lives would grow together In sad or singing weather Blown fields or flowerful closes, Green pleasure or grey grief If love were what the rose is; And I were the leaf  If I were what the words are,   And love were like the tune,           With double sound and single   Delight our lips would mingle,   With kisses glad as birds are   That get sweet rain at noon;   If I were what the words are,         And love were like the tune.      If you were life, my darling,   And I your love were death,   We’d shine and snow together   Ere March made sweet the weather         With daffodil and starling   And hours of fruitful breath;   If you were life, my darling,   And I your love were death.      If you were thrall to sorrow,           And I were page to joy,   We’d play for lives and seasons   With loving looks and treasons   And tears of night and morrow   And laughs of maid and boy;           If you were thrall to sorrow,   And I were page to joy.      If you were April’s lady,   And I were lord in May,   We’d throw with leaves for hours    And draw for days with flowers,   Till day like night were shady   And night were bright like day;   If you were April’s lady,   And I were lord in May.             If you were queen of pleasure,   And I were king of pain,   We’d hunt down love together,   Pluck out his flying-feather,   And teach his feet a measure,           And find his mouth a rein;   If you were queen of pleasure,   And I were king of pain.   Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909)

      Love not, Love not! The thing you love may change, The rosy lip may cease to smile on you; The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true

        Hmn.. I don't see anything wrong with that.. but I think that people NEED something to do.. in case they end up having nothing to talk about.. in case they bore each other - they have something fun to do to make it seem not so bad.   I'm thinking you should have gone to Oldham today though.. they'll eventually stop asking you to go places.. I know because that's what we did to a few friends, we got sick of hearing "no" or some lame ass excuses. Go next time! You might find that wherever you go is fun.. at least you'll be with people. Hermit. =P   Pssst, the harm in going for a walk is that it's exercise ! =P *hugs you lots*  Edit: I'm thinking you should have gone to Oldham today though... I meant yesterday..

      “Last orders folks” shouted Mick, the owner of the Swan & Goose pub in the town, “come on now folks, last orders” “Keep yer ‘air on Mick will ya” Kerry shouted at Mick as she downed her pint in one, watched with looks of shock on the lads faces sitting at the table with her, equally matched with looks of horror from the girls sitting in between the lads on the table, “wot?” “Bloody ‘ell Kerry” Danny shouted as he drank his espresso in a few sips, “ah that’s the stuff to keep you going!” “Kerry, ‘ow the fuck can you down a pint like that?” Aneesah said as Danny jumped out of his seat in one quick jump and started jogging up and down on the spot, “you feelin’ alright Dan?” “Well, its quite simple really Ness” Kerry said as she put her fag out in the over flowing ash tray in the centre of the table, “all you do is pick up the pint glass, Dan will you stop fucking jogging on the spot” “Cccaaann’tt” Danny stuttered as he clutched his groin area with a look of agony on his face, “what the hell did Mick, put in that bloody espresso?” “Bleugh” Mike shouted as he spat out the bits of the drink he had just drunk, “That’s no shot of brandy that isn’t” “Dan, will you just go to the bloody bog” Kerry shouted as she tapped Dan on his arm and pointed out the toilets to him, “your starting to make me want it” “I’m not going to the bog, not after what Mike did in there when he came” Dan said in a high pitched as his face began to become flustered “Hahaha” Duncan said as he picked up his fag and began smoking it whilst sipping his pint at the same time, “you’re a plonker Dan, use the women’s bog then” “I wouldn’t advise that” Ness said as she picked up a bottle of WKD and began drinking it, “Joan’s ‘aving it off with some bloke in there”

      Today i was in Manchester for ummm around about 3/4 hours. I arranged to meet Danny at the end of the road, like we do during term time, but instead he came and called on me, stuuupid boy, mwhahahahaha i made him wait, then we watched "bottom" on DVD for a bit, then we set off for the bus stop. We got on the bus round umm 12.25 according to my dayrider ticket, so yeah we go to Manchester about 1.20ish. Then we set of to get the reason we went there in the first place  out of the way, to go to the tourist office to do some research for the company. We did that, got the research. Then we went and wandered around Manchetser for a bit. Then we went to Afflecks Palace for a bit, Danny got 10 badge thingies for £4, he was  very  pleased about that. Then we went ot Piccadially train station so Danny could look in the HMV up there for this album he wanted. He found it in that one, but it was the same price as in the other HMV store. Then we went and got the bus home. And hey presto we got off in Hazerl Grove to go see Lucy but she had already finished work. Anyways enough for now.

      I find it hard to speak I find it hard to sleep I find her all alone I find her crying into her hands  Crying about a lost love A love she once had The long eye-lashes drenced in tears Thinking about her one true love  She sits on her own In the old arm chair Waiting for her love For her love to save her from her hell  Crying about a lost love A love she once had The long eye-lashes drenched in tears Thinking about her one true love

      Well today was interesting. Got the bus at 11.40, got to college round 12.05, went to geography, Pat wasn't in, on a course or something, so we didnt really have a lesson, then i went and waited for Philip at the main entrance, like usual, then we went and got our dinner, then we wandered round college for a bit, then we saw Andre so we went and talked to him for  abit, then we went to our lessons, i had psychology, phil had a subject review interview, then he could go home after that. So off i trotted to psychology, got there, hardly anyone was in, another psychology teacher came in, he told us that Janet was at a funeral for the day, he set the work then said that as long as we got the work done we could go home. So off i trotted to find Danny, i found Danny sitting down outside, we trotted off to the shops then came back, went in the LRC for a bit, Wendy found us in the LRC, we talked to Wendy for a bit, then Danny and Wendy both had subject review interviews, so off they trotted to where they had them, i though what the hell i'd go as well, seen as it was nearly the end of the day, 10mins to go in fact, we waited with Wendy for a bit, then we went over to the economics room for Dannys interview, i waited outside, saw Mike, so went and talked to him for a bit, Danny came out we all talked for a bit, then Danny and I went to the Young Enterprise meeting, that finished round 5.20ish. Danny got a call from his parents saying that his new place of work wanted him to work that night, so we waited for a bus, Danny got on the 192, i waited for the 191, which came 5mins later. Then hey presto i came home. Didn't get on the 192 partly because it was full up and partly because the 191 means i don't have to walk as far, espically in this darkness.

      i always wondered why Kaite walked out of the young enterprise meeting as fast as a cheetah on speed, i've found out why:  "I'm severely pissed off. Half term, I spend most of my time doing loads of research for our Toung Enterprise company on our final product and then in last week's meeting it came to being put into little teams working on developing things - the first being a digital jigsaw for the Christmas Trade Fair, the second being fundraising ideas and the third being a tourist guide for Stockport. I was asked if I'd like to be in charge of the mini-team I said yes. The Company Secretary wrote it down in the minutes and then ten minutes later the whole company was asked who wanted to be in charge. I said I would again, but Mark said in a louder voice that he would do it. Guess who gets their name scribbled out? I spent my half term doing loads of work when I could have been having fun - they don't like my research. *fumes*"  i don't exactly call asking 10 people a lot of research now do you?!

"Who was it?" shouted his wife from the kitchen. "Wrong number, darling," he replied, "It was some berk wanting to know if the coast was clear"

      Always Look on the Bright Side of Life  Some things in life are bad, They can really make you mad, Other things just make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle Don't grumble, give a whistle. And this'll help things turn out for the best.  And....   Always look on the bright side of life, (whistle) Always look on the bright side of life, (whistle) If life seems jolly rotten,  There's something you've forgotten, And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps, Don't be silly chumps. Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing.   And...   Always look on the bright side of life. (whistle) Come on... Always look on the bright side of life...   For life is quite absurd, And death's the final word, You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your sin,  Give the audience a grin, Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.   So always look on the bright side of death, Just before you draw your terminal breath, Life's a piece of shit, When you look at it, Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true. You'll see it's all a show, Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you.   And always look on the bright side of life, Always look on the right side of life,   Come on guys, cheer up.   Always look on the bright side of life.   Worse things happen at sea, you know.   Always look on the bright side of life.   I mean - what have you got to lose? You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing. What have you lost? Nothing!   (fade...)

       Hmn, *rubs chin* interesting, veeerry interesting.. hmn...  I smile at random people all the time, I get scowls back.. or sometimes a smile.. the scowls suck, and you gotta pick carefully who you smile at.. some people think that you're laughing at them and they want to start an argument. Anypoo..  If I look at the world, it means I'll look at life and the whole.. "what's the point".. and frankly I'll come up with nothing. All we're here for is to maybe make somebody else happy. Even that's fleeting.. meh oh well =) I liked reading your entries, hehe.

      You know the world today has no time for the old people in society, they may be stuck in their old ways, but they are happy in their way of life. And then look at what some people do to them, basically destroy them by conning them into parting with their hard earned money, this really bugs me and pisses me off, why do that to an old person, one who played their part in the war, so you could live in the world like it is today, they played their part for the country and look at what happens to them, they are seen as easy targets because they are old and frail, that may be so, but next time you see an old person, flash them a smile, you never know that smile could warm their day up for them, just be one little smile you could be making that old persons day, or even stopping to talk to them, you never know what it can do. Smiling at anyone, no matter what they are like, can bring benifts not only to that person but also to yourself, smile and you'll feel happy, and also make that other person ahppy as well, so just smile and be friendly, what is the point in wasting life in being angry and annoyed, look at yourself deep down and think to yourself "i am happy with the way i am" trust me, you'll feel better for it

      Ever just stopped and looked at the world as you see it, next time your out just look through your eyes, i meant just stop and look, really look through your eyes and look at what you see, rubbish strewn across floors, chewing gum trampled into the ground, people begging, homeless people. Ever just stopped and wondered what has caused our world to go like this? Back in the 1950's there was a sense of community spirit, people enjoyed doing what they were doing, be it at college, at school, driving a bus, or working in a factory, they enjoyed it and made the most of it, why can't our world be like that today in this day and age, we may of moved on but surely if we look we can still find that sense of community spirit, surely we must be able to, if we can't then there is something severly wrong with the world today. Just stop and look. Look at what you see all around you and then think what can you do about it

      Soundtrack = 'Turin Brakes - Pain Killer'  Video = 2 blokes riding round in their electric wheel chairs, one on the pavement and one on the road, the one on the road always causes big vehicles to slam their brakes on etc, tries to run down the pedrestrains crossing the road hes on, the other one is on the pavement, speeding, knocking into phone boxes, where Danny happens to be stuck in one again, he goes flying when the wheelchair knocks that phone box over, the police are runnign afetr him, but always fall down pot holes, grids etc Then at the end it has the two wheelchairs chrashing into each other with the occupants going flying into each other, it fades out at this point..  ^rather pointless as well

      this may seem like a very crazy idea for a video, but it'll be great if i can pull it off ;)  Soundtrack = 'The Mock Turtles - Can You Dig It' (fatboy slim & simon thornton 2003 remix) the one used in the vodafone TV advert  Video =  as the song starts you see myself and a few other people just hanging around on a street corner, with someone trapped in a phone box, namely Danny or someone, tapping on the glass to be let out, and myself and associates laughing at him, then we all move to this garden place thing, where we start digging (as the chorus comes on), then the camera zooms round all of us and its then that we realise that we were meant to be with our 'girlfriends' talking, so the camera then moves onto them who are all sitting along in an upmarket cafe, tutting etc looking at watches etc, then the camera moves back to us lot (blokes) and we're running with our shovles for some reason to the cafe, then wheneve the chorus comes on we start digging and in the end we dig Danny out of the phone box and the girls all start nattering  ^very pointless really

      Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again, Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping, And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence.  In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone, 'Neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence.  And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening, People writing songs that voices never share And no one dared Disturb the sound of silence.  "Fools" said I, "You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you." But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming. And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls." And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

      Eight-Stage Timeline  Stage 1- Time heals everything: It's normal to have low self-esteem when someone you love leaves you. But remember, you're still the same person that she/he once fell in love with. The only difference is that you are no longer together. Believe me, you'll find someone else in time. As for your broken heart, the old saying time heals everything cannot be more true.  Stage 2- You are vulnerable: Anyone can take advantage of you when you are feeling vulnerable. You must therefore be extra careful not to look to quick fixes, such as dating old flings.  Stage 3- Feelings of denial: At this stage, you will probably call your ex many times to question whether the relationship is truly over, or whether there is still a chance that your relationship can be salvaged.  Stage 4- Feelings of bitterness: Remember, the relationship is over, so don't express feelings of sadness and bitterness to your ex. If you do, you'll be letting her/him know that you are unable to handle her decision, which makes you look immature. Instead, channel those feelings into positive energy by improving the skills at the activities you love and doing things to bring back a sense of balance and joy in your life.  Stage 5- Take time off: A lot of people try to rebuild their new broken fragile ego by dating again too soon after a breakup. Stop! You'll only end up damaging yourself even more, as well as the person you are dating. If you date someone just to fill a gap, that's the way you'll end up treating that person. Stay away from people who'll prey on your fragile emotional state, and take advantage of your vulnerability. This will only give you a false sense of trust. Take time off and get involved in things you never had the time to do before.  Stage 6- Socialize: Meet a lot of new people. Use this time to improve relations with old friends, network, and make new friends. A well-balanced life will lessen the impact of a breakup, because you will still have the other aspects of your life intact, and improved.  Stage 7- Fall in love: Eventually, as time passes, you will fall in love again. Make sure to let yourself fall in love, and take the time to really let your partner in your life. There is nothing better than a new flame to make you forget an old one (once you have had the time to heal, of course).  Stage 8- Don't set yourself up: Don't get carried away with this new found flame, remember nothing lasts forever and even this new relationship may not weather the test of time. Don't make this person the sole focus of your life, because if it doesn't workout, you'll find yourself right back at Stage 1.

       The mighty arms of Atlas hold the Heavens from the Earth says:  Your resolve is insanely strong - genuine integrity, and all that... It makes me want to punch you at times, but only because I am corrupted filth You're sociable, of course, and unlike Danny, don't seem to ever try finding a niche to inhabit... Things just work for you It's almost funny, that aspect... In my opinion Well, and the range of people you'll get on with You're a hard one to fathom And Polish I think that's quite a deciding factor  So in other words from what i gather and i'll admit i don't understand a few of the words hes basically saying that me finding a solution or a course of action to something is very strong, he also says, if i'm right, that i never fail to find a solution or that i ahve strong moral principlas and i'll end up doing it and that i get on with a wide range of people, i'm hard to understand and i don't like finding a place to stay for all of my time.

When i fell asleep again, whcih was literally afetr i sent a text back to him i had a dream about me and alex being on a bus into Bolton (but twasn't bolton at all :S) so yeah anyway we were at this shopping centre place, so we got a bus just for the fun of it, which said the destination as "Bridgemont" (which is a little village next door to Furness Vale:S Anyways we were on it, then we saw Lucy on it at the end of the journey, when we went through this field with car sales place in it!:S so we all got off, then Lucy said she'd moved to where ever we were because of something to dow tih her old house, that was weird, so then we got back on the bus, then my sister woek me up:@ grrr. Then my final weird dream of the morning was me playing football and being in net!:S so yeah anyway twas muddy and i was diving about the whole place. Then it cut to this advert for Loylds TSB bank loans! (what the fuck?!) so then anyways i shouted "move" at the top of my voice (in my dream) and the dream went to me wandering down the A6 talking to Danny Bulley about how he was going to pizza hut to watch this Italian cup final game, so i said "why don't you just go to t'other Danny's you can watch it for free there" search me how we ended up in pizza hut in the dream but we did, and twas this dodgy TV which we were watching, then i woke up:S What the hell?!

      *waves* ello!  Its a long story about the trust issue. But the basic jist of it is, i wrote this stuuupid letter *kicks self* which i should of never given to clare, but well when i wrote it, i was pretty ill, (wasn't in college, which isn't exactly like me) so clare read it, then showed it heather, that bit i can understand, but from what i've been told by various people heather then went and showed this letter to various people at my college, this is the bit i can't understand, because well it basically had nothing to do with those other people, as far as i'm concerned twas between clare and myself... Thats where the trust bit comes in, i thought i could trust heather, but well after that i doubt i can for a while, i mean what i don't understand is why show it to people whom it doesn't concern? ...its as though she doesn't care about what anyone else thinks. So thats the basic jist of it, i'll tell you a more detailed version some time, but for now i've got another thing on my mind as well, namely the fact that the upper bit of my left arm hurts for no reason at all, can't even break chocolate with my left arm cause it hurts :( oh wells, i'll just go to the doc and find out what it is, seen as its been like this for a few weeks :(  Anyways enough of me moaning!

      Sweetie! Welcome back! I'm sorry to hear about this trust issue thing you got going on.. I hope it all works out okay for you. But remember, just because someone does something bad once, it doesn't mean that you can't ever trust them again - I don't know the whole story but they may have just made a mistake...  Think long and hard about where you want your friendship to go with these people before you do anything silly. :P  *hands you a bucket of love* wuv yoo

      Well, don't really know where to start, so much has happened, some good, some bad, some things that piss me off alot ('cuse my language) and some things well that i just can't be bothered with.  Today i went to Manchester with phil, alice & danny. We met clare and heather there when we got there. Well it was interesting. I didn't really say that much, mainly because i've been doing a lot of thinking at the minute and would just rather not share some of my thoughts with people.   Theres a few people i don't trust, and i've got good reason not to trust them, and i don't think i'll ever trust them again.....its just the way i am, if someone i think i can trust, turns out to be someone i can't trust, then i just don't think i'd ever be able to trust them again. However there are a few select people that i trust a lot, people who've been there for me when i've needed them.  [will update later on when not so pissed off]
