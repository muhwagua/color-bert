      Enetation (the comments provider) is sucking granny's balls again, so there's nothing to it, I just have to write a full-scale epic update instead of a quick break from work with a quickie in the comments.   Actually, it may be the internet's fault this time, nothing seems to be working properly today. I was trying to check my bank account earlier (since the shopping spree on Saturday... uh... £80 to a comic book store. Among other things), since I have to do some more shopping before my lovely little business trip on 16th. I'm sure I brushed on the subject before; shopping for clothes is a bloody nightmare. Having to go in and out of countless of shirts which all look equally horrible on me, if they fit on at all. Depressing, sweaty business.   Anyway , that's beside the point. I'll have to dress up all nicey, and -  gasp  -  talk  to people!   On the other hand, I  will  get my flights reimbursed by the company, plus I'm taking the Friday off and spend the whole weekend in Finland. I haven't decided if it'll be friends or family weekend, though.  As for cigarettes, I didn't have any. My colleague Valkyria had. :P    LinktoComments('commenting')    urlLink Comment

      Yet again I was short on points yesterday. I can't believe how many points I'm allowed and as I've never been a big eater (  just eaten the wrong stuff  ) it seems to me that I'm eating huge amounts of food.  You're allowed to save up to four points a day. But you can't take last weeks points to the following one. Opposite to Laura I can easily eat points during the weekend. That's my time to live a little. But during the week... that's a different matter. Why? Probably 'cos I'm running around like a headless chicken 'cos the kids, whereas on the weekends I've got my hubby running around with me. Besides I like eating nice stuff on weekends, sort of keeps me going on this diet.   I suppose I should start having a bowl of cereal or some toast before going to bed to make up for the missing points. Previously when I did the same diet I made up the points with bags of crisps and chocolate, which sounds tempting, but hey if it would've been the right thing to do would I be writing here today..no, I'd be one of those skinny bitches Laura keeps going on about. But at least you can eat the nice stuff on this diet, provided you're prepared to make sacrifices other times.   As for that cigarette in the train, Laura!!! Tut, tut. How come you has some on you? And the bag of popcorn, not too bad. I sounds to me you do need something... lots of it. It's got three letters and start with s and ends in x!

      I'm just about to cave in and go buy a Coke. Yesterday I had a cigarette in the train on my way home,  and  I ate a whole bag of pop corn in the evening... If I didn't know better, I'd say I'm pregnant! I just want... Something. Lots of it.  Arrrrrrrrrrgh.    Points for 29.9.:  26.5/24   LinktoComments('morecravings')    urlLink Comment

      Last week was my first week with counting points. I tried just  eating less for 3 weeks, but on the third week I lost nothing and I couldn't understand it, so started points a week ago. So today, after a hectic schoolrun (well, got up late, Livi coughing like she had croup, which had to be checked by a doc, feeding the kids, sorting livi's hair out, getting dressed and dressing kids, ect.)I finally got to the scales which are tucked well underneath the dresser in our bedroom. To my surprise I've lost 3 pounds!!! Yippee!  I went out with the girls on Saturday night and even after the (uncountable) slices of pepperoni pizza and yummy garlic bread I managed to lose weight. Brill.  Still, I've got more to lose than Laura, so I've got a long way to go. But this is how it'll start, pound by pound.

      Weekends are so hard for eating full points. Even now I'm just craving a cigarette, and I quit smoking months ago, not having really craved for them since. Yesterday I craved for a pot of vanilla ice cream. I've eaten breakfast, and a bag of sweets today; there's some chicken ready on the pan, but I don't feel like eating.

          Weight today:  90.3 kg   Gain/loss:  - 1300 grams  Gain/loss total:  - 2.5 kg      Weight today:  199.08 lbs   Gain/loss:  - 2.87 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 5.51 lbs      Well, shit on me! I've lost as much this week as in the past three. Yay! That can be put down to stress and working from home.  And  I crossed the fated 200 lbs mark, too!  I was wearing a pair of trousers yesterday - as you do - and I noticed they're hanging ever so slightly loose around my thighs and I thought  "Surely not the diet...?"  I mean, what kind of a dietist loses off the thighs or ass, and not fro the belly?  Oh well, I'm bound to lose this particular high in a couple of hours - I'm being sent on a business trip (my first ever) to Finland in a couple of weeks, and I must buy suitable clothes. Urgh. Garment-shopping is always as depressing, especially if I'm having to look for things that are, well,  presentable.   I exceeded my points yesterday, but I did it on purpose because I wanted to use up some of the points I didn't eat earlier this week.

      Thanks to  urlLink Robin  for  urlLink this link . Mine was actually accurate with  Physical: You feel tired and drained. Avoid exerting yourself.

Your brain is in stand-by mode.    Now I'm curious, so I'll have to start to keep an eye on this to see if it stays accurate of it that was just a lucky guess. Heh heh.

      I think I've fallen into a dietary void again. It's all boring, boring, boring. More specifically, it's all rice cakes, bread, different forms of chicken, pasta and cucumber, which makes my mouth itch something silly. I'm bored. And suddenly I'm not enjoying our quite-frequent cooking or restaurant-eating nights, because I'm hawkeyeing the points, and invariably feeling guilty afterwards. And right now, I've half a point to spare for tonight and I really, really fancy that bag of Turkish Pepper I hid on the bookshelf.  Weighting day tomorrow.

      Twelve hours straight at the computer and counting - and that was just my working hours today. It's not even a very comfortable chair. I was not inspired to eat much today, until at dinner time, by when I was ravenous! I indulged in basmati rice (yum yum) and chicken breast, which I'd left in marinade at around noon today. Very nice.  *belch*   Points for 23.9.:  20/24   LinktoComments('ass')    urlLink Comment

      Today the cafeteria, amazingly, had nothing to offer to me I am not allergic to. Oh, they had bread, but only the kind with seeds in that makes me gag. I bought two slices anyway and they're currently staring at me in an offensively offhand manner from the floppy paper plate; "Can't handle seeds, eh? Loser."   I am not  bird.  Bravely, I tried eating some (dryand uninteresting) salad which I was allergic to, but I soon found out I'm not a bunny either. In the end, I ate a bg of sweets and a bottle of Coke and pretended it was what I really wanted to do all along. Today is just really not my day, but happily, I've made my excuses and will shortly go and work from home.   Points for 21.2.:   24.5/24   LinktoComments('picky')    urlLink Comment

      I've have gorged on those famous oven potatoes and chicken breast and Hollandaise-sauce. I had one portion, which would have been quite enough, but then I still had half of everything left on the cooker, and well, you know... It's not going to be any good tomorrow. So I loosened the belt and ate the rest of it. Oh-my-god. Good thing I ate little anything else today.   Points for 20.9.:  23/24   LinktoComments('stuffed')    urlLink Comment

      Errr... Since my trusty sister didn't get back to me yet with ideas for pancake points, I just decided on 5 pts all by myself, based on nothing but pure fancy.   Which puts me in the following position for Thursday:   Points for 18.9.:  36 (20 of which spent at the restaurant!)  Total allowed:  24  Friday, happily, saw me lunching at the cafeteria since I've so far failed to do grocery shopping five days in a row. It was scheduled again for today, but I was busy shopping for other things over at the city centre, and got home at 4:45 PM. Fifteen minutes to dash to the grocery store & back? Forget it, matey. I sat down and ate a bag of sweets instead. Of course, this means that I'll have to be rather creative on Sunday, when the shops are closed in the land of the happy (er, Denmark). But never mind, eh? There's always Monday, unfortunately.   Points for 19.9.:  22.5  Total allowed:  24   PS:  I finally got my work mail to work, and my sister estimated the pancakes at 5 points too.  Shibby!

      I knowingly exceeded my points and ate sweets last night. And they were SO GOOD. I wasn't home from work until around 8 PM, way too tired for cooking or any other high intelligence activity - so I ate some  hapankorppu  (like crispbread, but thinner and harder) for dinner and sweets for dessert. What's the point of getting a perfect (hah!!) body, if you can't enjoy any bad habits?    Points for 17.9.:  28  Total allowed:  24    LinktoComments('diditagain')    urlLink Comment

      Those who are as disgusted as I am about people whining about their weight and looks, just skip the update. I'm indulging myself.  I'm feeling the fucking weight of the world today - no wait, it's just me. I wish I was one of those people who can't gain weight no matter how they try. I could instead obsess about things such as not having enough boobs or the size and shape of my ass, and at age 30 (in about 6 years) I could suddenly get the shock of my life and for the first time in my life find that I actually may have to put some effort into maintaining that size 10 waist, or whatever. Hah! On the other hand, even when I was in  urlLink this shape  I used to think I was the fattest and ugliest person in the world. Live and learn, eh?  I also indulged myself yesterday by eating whole 8 points worth of sweets. Bad me. Bad.   Points for 16.9.:  25.5  Total allowed:  24   LinktoComments('badme')    urlLink Comment

      I realised last night that I've doubled up the points for wafer thin chicken (which probably 80% of my diet consists of, ah hah) recently. Oh well, no matter. I'm probably filtering fat off the air for the amount I didn't eat anyway (judging by how I'm always gaining weight), so I won't bother going back and recalculating pointies.   I re-found a rather old box of  knackebröd ,  näkkileipä , crispbread, whatever you want to call it. Ryvita? Anyway, the Scandinavian specialty. You eat it like bread but only gain half a point per piece, so it's well worth the money. I also harangued to eat some cucumber on top of it (and on the second helpings, too) for which I suffered miserably. I found that eating antihistamine to counter the effect makes the itching and swelling less long-lived, though, so maybe I'll stock up on them pills and eat some veggies, just for fun.   Meanwhile, I had a chat with a friend of mine; she has seen a special kind of a doctor about migraines, and the doctor cured her, so now my friend swears by her name. She thinks I should go get checked with the doctor, in case my weight gain is more hormonal than (what I think) my lazy ass and bad eating habits. I must admit I'm curious at the same time I'm extremely sceptical. Saying that "I'm gaining weight because my hormonal balance is off-skewer, not because I'm a lazy git" just seems like a bit of a cheat to me. You know, unless it's actually true. Anyway, I'm waiting for some translations from the doctor's book, and we'll see if I'm enticed to go check it out.   Mainly I'm worried I'll be suggested to start the same kind of diet my friend is on - no refined sugar. No sweets, and bake my own bread?? I don't think I'm quite ready to live like a diabetic just yet.

      Having a hard time eating enough this weekend, since I didn't have the foresight to buy any sweets. Ate some strawberries and I suffered the consequences (allergy, again), won't be doing that again in a hurry.

      Damn, Sis informed me that the quantity of Bailey's I drank the other night is worth ten  more  points than I originally thought, so I've updated the points for that day.  Sigh!  Tomorrow is a weighing day and somehow I doubt I'll get very good results, especially as I've pigged out twice in the past week.   I also need to figure out something to eat between breakfast and lunch, which is when I'm always starving. I haven't seen Uncle Ben's rice crackers in Denmark, only the SnackAJack (?) ones, which taste (more?) like styrofoam cups with industrial flavouring. So far, I can't say that the diet has changed my diet much. I think the quantity has gone down a little, and I suppose this means I'll be eating much less rice and such in the near future. Will the diet actually make me lose 20-30 kg (or 60-70 lbs)? Doubtful. Unless, maybe, if we are talking about a timeframe of about ten years. I may have to give some thought to exercise, eventually. Oh, the horror!   As directly quoted from the  urlLink other blog :  Meanwhile, here's a really good dinner suggestion for you as tested by moi. Season chicken breast to your liking. Chop up baby potatoes, stick them in a bag; Throw in max 1 tbs of olive oil, some red paprika powder, ground pepper, salt; Garlic to taste; Shake well. Chop up red and yellow peppers and red onion, don't season. Stick the veggies and the potatoes on a tin foil, and the chicken next to the foil - make sure excess oil from chicken gets to drain someplace. Stick this into the oven for an hour at 150 degrees. Voilá! It's delicious, easy and virtually fat-free. Of course, adding a sauce sort of spoils the diet thing, but if you insist, may I suggest a Hollandaise sauce - requires milk and about 100 grams of butter, but it's worth going to high cholesterol hell for.

      Diet-wise, yesterday was pretty much a disaster. I'm waiting for my sister to get back to me with some points, but as far as I got, it doesn't look too good either (as you can see below). But what a dinner! We had oven roasted potatoes, peppers, onion and chicken breast with light seasoning, with a Hollandaise sauce and with a nice white wine.  Mmm- mmm !  Of course, on top of that we emptied that bottle of Bailey's and I'm still waiting for results on that... Nevertheless, it was a lovely, lovely evening, and not too hung over today.

      Dieting is dangerous for me. The feeling of hunger wakes up this mad desire in me to see how long I can go without eating - a leftover from my days of being (near?) anorexic. I only ever did a bit over 24 hours at best (no,  worst ) but I know how it goes. First you're really hungry, then you get ill. After a while you switch between nausea and hunger, but it's not that long after you don't even need to eat anymore.  Speaking of which, I better eat my lunch now.

      Do Cheerios (not the honey-nut variety) get more points than regular salt-of-the-earth corn flakes?    Updated:  Okay, all cereal get same points. Even the ones with chocolate. That makes sense too, right?

      So yesterday I didn't get my full pointies, and today it looks like I'm going way over the limit. Becky kindly used her superior mathematical brain to guesstimate the answer to my mince/rice problem, by the way. I'm well impressed.  I'm starving. In fact, I feel like I'm constantly hungry when I'm doing too much points, and when I'm underachieving (I'm talking about the points! Shaddup!) I don't feel like eating anything at all. I figured that next time I'm doing the rice/mince thing, I might as well keep them separate before I ladle them out in the lunch containers. That way I at least know how much of which there is... Live and learn.  As replacement activity I cleaned up most of my flat yesterday and rearranged the lounge and the bedroom, I hung some new pictures and lights in new places and rearranged my books, and arranged my DVDs alphabetically. The question is, what am I going to do when there's nothing more left to arrange, clean up or read in the house?   Points for 7.9.:  17-ish  Points allowed:  24

      I have encountered another mystery. If you cook 500 g of turkey mince (no oil added), this adds up to 10.5 points. Then I mix that with lots of rice (4 tbs = 3 pts), so that the mince to rice ratio is about 1:5. Now if I eat twelve table-spoonfuls of this stuff, what kind of points am I eating?  Pffft!   And here's another teaser: Fruits are 0 points. Diet drinks are 0 points. But pure apple/orange juice is half a point per dl. I know there must be a perfectly good explanation for this.  Right.

      Sticking to the given points is easy during the weekend when I can eat when I want, and I only have to - metaphorically speaking - reach out and grab something from the fridge. I can see next week being a general pain in the butt, because it'll take some  planning  to get my points right.   Let me tell you how I feel about having to plan carefully ahead what I eat.  I'm a multi-allergic person, which basically means (since I'm used to it) that I'm a right pain in the neck when anyone else invites me for a dinner, or when choosing restaurant for a night out. Not only am I unable to eat veggies, fish, fruit and what have you, I also don't, as a rule, eat red meat. And no,  pork is not white meat for me . This is not a problem to me except when I actually have to think about what I eat. If your diet generally consists of different variations of potato, rice, pasta, chicken, turkey and white bread, what you really don't want to do is think too carefully on it. For one, it's unbelievably boring.  And I love chicken.    Not too long ago I was also given a warning from my doctor about my blood pressure, which bordered on hypertension. Hmmm. Let's see then... What do we have in the "Bad Food Group For High Blood Pressure"? Yep; potato, pasta, rice, white bread, salt.  I hope you see my dilemma.   Now a more organised mind would probably rise to the challenge and design food charts complete with calories and carbohydrate information. A mind like mine gaped for a while, screamed in frustration and retreated into the darker recesses of my brain to sulk for a week or so, muttering things like  "won't eat anything then, ye bastards!"   I hate all this hassle. It would be so much easier to lose all the weight with proper training and exercise, which is how I gained it in the first place. I mean by quitting exercise. I have gone, in chronological order, from chronic gym-goer to anorexic to obsessive martial arts and roller-skating practitioner (with periods of equally obsessive non-eating periods) ... to a resident of West Scotland, where I did nothing much but turn muscle into fat for two years.   Oh well. Here's my results, or thereabouts, for yesterday.   Points eaten for 6.9.:   24  Total points allowed:  24

      [the internet was down for the whole Saturday, which is when this was written]  Well, the second day of dieting is remarkably easy so far - I slept until 3 pm and have been watching films ever since. I even painted a picture - all with just rice cakes and tea. I have plenty of points to eat tonight.  Shibby!   Actually yesterday was a bit of a disaster when it comes to points. I ate normally until lunch time, which was when I received the list of points per food. I had already spent mine by that time. Bugger! So, I resolved to eat away anything evil just so I wouldn't have to throw it away. Goodbye, my favourite Finnish cheese. Goodbye, sweets!  I just received an email from my dieting sister with a list of points for sweets and... most of them are just  half a point per 10 grams . Wohooo! Life seems suddenly ever so slightly better. I stopped smoking, I hardly ever drink, I don't eat pastries or cheese (that stuff in the fridge was remains from my holidays!), ice cream or junk food - but life without sweets? Just shoot me in the head,  please!   If only someone could tell me how much points Baileys has... That unopened bottle is calling my name.    total points for 5.9.:  52   Total allowed:  24

      By chance I clicked on the "blogs of note" on the  urlLink Blogger  home page, and found another  urlLink two sisters on a diet . They start off slightly (ahem) less heavy than I am, but have the same-ish target. I may keep an eye on them.

      Oookay... I'm still working on the details, such as the template, but this is where my stupid bloody effort to lose weight goes public. Go on, laugh at me. Laugh, you cretin!  For the record, my starting weight is  92,8 kg , which for those that don't know, is way too much. The rules set up for the diet are... I will check my weight every Friday morning, and at no other time. I will update it here. I won't list everything I eat, but I will list my daily points, at least when I'm not busy cutting my wrists because of a banana split temptation.   I started this attempt with my sister, who is slightly older and a mother of two, and I'll be damned if she'll lose weight better than I will!   Also, before you ask, I don't actually expect anyone to be interested in reading this blog. This is just for myself. There's also my other web log, though it's mainly me bitching about all the other things. You can read it  urlLink here .

      Well, not the biggest, but the eldest. Just wanted to say welcome as well. I know Terhi hasn't quite started her diet yet, but she will, won't she?  *looks at Terhi and pokes her*    This is all a bit of fun, but at the same time keeps it all real. And there's no point telling lies here as you'd just be cheating yourself. It's all about peer pressure and doing what others are doing. Terhi, join us...join us... *doing hypnotic gestures with hands* ...join us.

      I finally have my house and my life back to myself. It was great to have houseguests and mates for Olivia, but even the most self efficiant guests are more work than being on your own. And as it was half term for Livi I didn't have to be too accurate about her bedtime, until I discovered that even if they stayed up late, they would all still wake up before 7am. Great. You just imagine three little girls sleeping in the same room. In the end we had to take them to bed one by one and make sure the first one was asleep before the next one was taken up.  Anyway, I haven't been too bad this week. Well, if we don't count the pizza hut pepperoni pizza we had Thursday night... I only managed two slices and two slices of garlic bread, oh yeah and few potato wegdes with sour cream and chives dip. So, quite a lot actually. But I did pay for it; I woke up at 2 am needing to take Gaviscon heartburn medicine and go to the loo. No good. We've had an opened bag of  mini  chocolates, 'cos Halloween, so everytime I've passed the bag I've helped myself into one... or two. Thank goddness there's only Snickers left, can't stand them.

      Forgot to weigh myself this morning. I was too busy feeling sorry for myself for having to get up to come to work. Got bellyache and been dreaming about work again all night. Life really sucks at the moment.

      Terhi is the third (and last) sister in the family  [or first, depending how you look at it chronologically]  and has been converted to a blogger by  me ! I was going to write a longer post  about the lard family  on welcoming Terhi to the Bad Attitude Diet but my stomach is screaming at me and the canteen is about to be closed.  Chow!

      Here I am. I want to  start dieting, but I can't.  Every morning, when I wake up, I wish I have lost weight at least 20 kilos! But that will never happen. Why is this so hard?!!!? I love food and white bread and sweets and.... And today I'm already 33 years! It should start now or never...

      Served my own brekfast in bed this morning; I forgot to buy something nice from the store yesterday (though I got a new baking tray, mixer (for the cake), serviettes and lots and lots of food. I forgot the wine, too) so it was just bread and tea and a handful of winegums - yes, I'm being bad since morning.   I forgot to eat dinner yesterday, and didn't realise it until it was way too late to start cooking up, so I made it up by eating my second bag of sweets... Uhhh.

      I am  constantly  hungry when at work, it's really doing my head in! I'm also eating white bread for breakfast/lunch/afternoon snack again, which roll up an impressive amount of points. So I left both margarin and sausage out and am eating dry bread. Urgh! (Not so dry, really. I baked them this morning.) Food is boring. Need more food. Hungry.  I'm bizarrely tired as well, I could just sleep all days and all nights (and yet I only get my usual 7-8 hours or so) and I'm nodding away at work unless I'm really concentrating hard on staying all awake. I think I need some vitamins or something, or possibly a brain surgery.   Points for 27.10.:  27.5 / 24

          Weight Friday:  90.5 kg   Gain/loss:  + 700 grams  Gain/loss total:  - 2.3 kg      Weight Friday:  199.52 lbs   Gain/loss:  + 1.54 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 5.07 lbs       Happy Birthday big sis!  Heh... I've been a bit lazy regarding blog updates the last few days, but there hasn't really been much going on, other than work. I did weigh myself on Friday and it was no big surprise that I've gone up - first trip to Finland and then really not being good for the second week again. This week I  will  be better. Um. Well. Heh. At least until my birthday; I've invited Cat Eyes and Valkyria in for a dinner (any food suggestions welcome) and I intent  not  to strive to be good.   I haven't been counting my points as conscientiously as I did before, so I'm doing a bit of guesswork as to what I've eaten… not that there's much variety to it! Friday was pay day so Cat Eyes and I decided to go eat out - we opted for a Chinese Restaurant. It was nice enough but everything that was served to me had peas and spring beans (?), so I had to separate what I could and couldn't eat while I was stuffing myself. We also shared a bottle of wine and afterwards Cat Eyes convinced me to go for "one" in the nearby (the) Scottish Pub... We all know what "one" drink means, don't we? I actually lost count, but it was OK because they had a live duo in the Scottish Pub, and since I was drinking Smirnoff Ice  [my regular drink in Scotland]  I felt like playing pool. So we ended up going to a  sports bar ! Me!! It wasn't so bad really, because you got almost all ages and types in there. We ended up not playing pool after all though; we arrived at 10 PM and got our table reserved from midnite on.   Typically enough, we both got tired and left for home ten to twelve. Via a takeaway. Evil!  I haven't been eating that much during the weekend again, but I haven't counted points yet - I'm probably in for yet another nasty surprise!  ...  Hmmm - not too bad, not counting Friday, because I have no idea... Ran out of count on the drinks!   Points for   23.10.:  24 / 24  24.10.:  haha! Lots :-)  25.10.:  20 / 24

      Oh mine, I've had one of those weeks that will definitely look bad on my diet. I've come to the conclusion that I will NOT weigh myself tomorrow morning.   Livi was being a little shite at the beginning of the week, which was the continuation of the Sunday. I later found out from Annie, that Richard had let her stay up late on Saturday night... oh well. Anything she did or say that was slightly annoying, it just rubbed me the wrong way. The reason for that was later explained... I came on with my period. Hey, that's the first proper one after Ben, and just in time for my birthday!  Elin came from Norway on Thursday, bringing some Finnish Marianne sweets... two boxes... oh great. As if it wasn't bad enough to have the sweets in the hallway. I did sort that one thou, I took stock, which means I can't have a sneaky one and as I emailed the stock intake for my parter of sweetshop it would be obvious I'd had some. I should've done that in a first place. .. Elin .. Right, after few compulsory sweets we had shared  couple of bottles of wine.. as you do! After all I hadn't seen her for 8 weeks.  Then Friday was my birthday. After a sensible birthday breakfast (my usual cereal) if went haywire... We went for a bit of shopping in town, obviously had a cappucino and couple  ( well, all right,  three ) of jaffa cakes. We got home and picked Livi from nursery and then Annie, Yoko, Elin and Sabina came for lunch. We fed the kids their penguin (!!!) pizza, yogurts and jam donuts and then it was our turn. We had lovely cheese and onion bread bought frest this morning in town with all trimmings; ham, mayo, cucumber, tomatoes etc. That was ok until the pudding. It was aThorton's chocolate and toffee birthday cake. I thought: "Sod it , it's my birthday!". And I had a nice piece and oh my, it was yummy.   In the evening after I got Ben to bed and Richard was happy with the girls, Elin and I walked to town. I had two pints of cider while waiting for the others... When Annie, Anna and Anna's mate... Tracey? came we had another cider and this is just the first pub.   There was this bloke (not nice) who was staring at me fairly obviously. He was leaning onto his hand and just staring... When he walked past he did a tacky "wink". That's not the worst, he did a double wink and a raise of the eyebrows when he got back to the table... eeewww!  Anyway, we moved on to the next pub. I think I had another pint, did I ?! Then we did what we said we weren't gonna do... We went to the club Embassy again. Oh dear, I can't believe we paid 6 quit to get in there. It was like 18-30 club and when you're closer to 30 than 18, you feel ancient. We had a brilliant time dancing around and had another pint, but I think most of mine went on the floor instead of my mouth.  There was this guy who must have been way over 2 metres tall. He came over in the beginning, saying hi and something wishing me happy birthday and came me a peck on the lips. Anyway, got back into dancing with the girls... When we were leaving he pulled me to the side and asked "Going home already? Did I make your night?"! You know what it felt like? It was like "poor little fat girl with her skinny gorgeous mates, bet she never gets off with anyone and never gets any attention from blokes, so here I go". Doh, we weren't after any attention, nor would I have gone off with anyone (well if Enrique Iglesias would've asked then yeah), I was there with the girls having fun. Actually, the club is like a meatmarket, and we were vegetarians.  We danced all night. It was supposed to be 80's night, but it obviosly wasn't. When they did play some older stuff we just went mad and everyone else went to buy a drink and looked at as thinking "my god, they must me old dancing to this"!! Did we care, no. I had another drink, bacardi this time.   Took a cab home and I was dead to the world.   OOhhh... my head. (popped couple of parasitamols at 7am and back into bed). I didn't feel horrible, but not that shiny either. We took a little walk to the park with the kids and then over to Annie's. She looked rough. She did have a sore throat, but didn't look like she was feeling brilliant from the night before either.   Lazy day, until Richard and I went out for a meal in the best restaurant in 20 km radius. I booked the table 2 weeks ago and it was fully booked, we got a table on the pub side first, but then were upgraded to the restaurant side on the evening. I ate all the wrong things, but it was my treat night. I had chicken satay with peanut sauce to start of with. Some form of chicken main, it was yummy. ( I tasted Richard's ostrich steak, but it was too beefy for my liking.) And for pudding I had strawberry and passion fruit brulee with cappuccino. I only had 1 glass of wine, so alcohol didn't play part in the huge points galore.  I feel fine now. We had an extra hour in bed as the clocks went back and while I've been writing this, I've eated 4 mariannes. Oh well. So , I ' L L    S K I P    W E I G H I N G     T O M  O R R O W ! !

      I've invited sister T to join the dieting effort, as she was complaining about weight in her own sarcastic way while I was over... Go on, dare her to join the league of darkness!!   Oh, wait.   Oops, I have mixed up my speaker notes. There is  no  league of darkness, and if there were, it would most definitely  not  aspire to conquer the whole world. Just innocent dieters here.   So anyway! I've started drinking milk again by the carton (about a litre per day!) and I expect this will show in the points soon too... The points for the beginning of the week are way over the top again and I fear tomorrow's result will be more than a little depressing.   *counting points*   Points for   20.10.:  35 / 24  [rice pies - my downfall]   21.10.:  24 / 24  [that was an accident!]   22.10.:  28 / 24   [yeah OK, so the bag of sweets tipped it over again]

      I've started counting points again as of Monday, but I'm at a loss regarding mom's chicken pie (she always makes that special for me when she knows I'm coming over) and chicken meat balls. Otherwise being back stinks, and I'm simply not having good days lately. It's also hard to find the motivation for dieting again, especially as it seemed last week (of point-counting) that it doesn't matter what I ate, I was always hungry, and always exceeding the points anyway. Blah. Finland was, as usual, a feast of all my favourite foods. This time, though, I was good and didn't overeat...  Very tired this week, both physically and emotionally. I really don't want to deal with life just now.

      Wow, what a weekend!! Well, Saturday to be exact. Diet didn't play a very big part on the day, but hey, nor did it in yours.  I met up with Sabina on our trainstation at 9.30am. We took the train to London Bridge. Gossip, gossip on the train, as you do. Went for a nice cappuccino at Hay's Gallery and the on to see David Blaine, who was in a box for 44 days eating nothing, just drinking water. On across Tower Bridge, onto a bus to Oxford Circus. A bit of shopping and then... da da daa...  Lunch at Harrods! I was quite sensible and chose a salmon dish. Then, upstairs for a manicure. That was lovely. Then, I don't know how, Sabina spoke me into having a pedicure. And trust me, I do not like me feet touched. Even if Olivia tickles me for a bit fun, I get cross. But Sabina said she'd pay for it, so what the heck. But we had to spend an hour before next available appointments.  But that wasn't difficult at all. We went to Harrods food court.. oh boy, was that a mistake or what?! Straight away we ended up in the chocolate, truffles, cakes and pastries section. I have to say, I was good... I did buy a box of chocolates, but they were all 'no added sugar' variety. Sabina's been on Atkins diet and lost over 50 lbs and that's something she's allowed to eat. It was funny to see the warning: "Excessive consumption may have laxative effect. Not suitable for calorie controlled diet.". Hmmm,...  Anyway, after my lovely (slightly ticklish) pedicure we headed for Leicester Square. We had the worst ever Italian dinner. I thought of not giving a shit about the diet and ordered a salami pizza. What a disappointment. It was shite. I tasted worse that shop's own brand frozen pizza. Horrible. What a waste of points! To make ourselves feel better we went to this French coffee house and had a lovely cup of coffee and cake. I did have fruit with mine, but surely all that went with the strawberries sort of counterbalanced the goodness of them.  We were good and had no sweets nor nothing else, not even on the interval of the musical Mamma Mia. So maybe the day wasn't as bad as I think it was...  Sunday wasn't much better. Livi was horrid to me all day and the sweets on the hallway got a digging in. I had couple of Dumle lollies and couple of Liquiroise sticks. Pub lunch didn't probably help, but I did give most of my rice to Richard out of my Chilli Con Carne portion.  Feeling rubbish today.

      And I have been   so bad!!    I'm trying to talk Terhi into joining the diet/blog effort and she didn't seem totally terrified at the thought. Had a good trip, and I've been eating so much! Hung over today, was drinking up at the airport until midnight with an American guy who was on the same flight with me.    Must         get              some                       sleep.

      I'll be in Finland on my weighing day - in fact from tomorrow evening until Sunday, so no weighing this week. And just as well! I pigged out again this weekend, mainly with *sigh* ice cream. I don't even  know  how many points that pot had (Cat Eyes had a plateful too, ok?!), but I'm willing to be it's something like three zillion gabillion. Plus a bottle of wine. Plus Tandoori Chicken ( mm- mmm!  ). Plus sweeties. Plus pop corn.   Did I mention I'm losing my voice? I'm supposed to be in the meeting in Finland on Thursday and talk for about half an hour straight. Should be interesting. I'm going back home on Friday for a nice wee weekend; but it looks like it'll be paid by my new friend, American Express (because my Visa is still smouldering since the weekend use!). The weekend was nice - I got birthday pressies shopped (I hope you'll like yours) and a nice "proper" shirt for the meeting plus some bits and bobs for the house again.    Points for three sinful days: 11.10.:  29.5 + ice cream / 24  12.10.:  27 + ice cream / 24  13.10.:  29.5 / 24

      Oh mine, if only you could see the boxes in my hallway! They're full on sweets and other yummy Finnish stuff. Why, oh why did I agree on being the sweetieshop keeper at Livi's Finnish School?! Now, the temptation is bad. But at least if I do eat anything, I'll have to pay a fairly high price. Oh well, I suppose this is another test for me.

      I haven't had one of those since... A very long time ago. But today Cat Eyes and I met up for some shopping, and ended up watching a couple of films, accompanied by wine, ice cream, face masks, hair dye, new lip gloss and nail polish. Girl things.  I must report that Cat Eyes  liked   Shrek  and can thus be accepted into the inner circle -- actually I've only met one person who didn't like Shrek, and I must admit that she never quite convinced me of her commitment to the cause. (The other film was Miss Congeniality)   "That'll do, donkey. That'll do."   Dietwise today has once again wrecked havoc on the points - We had lunch/dinner at Hard Rock Cafe, which actually would've been fine if it weren't for the ice cream and pop corn we accompanied the films with.  Damn!    Points for 10.10.:   26/24  [no contest - that glass of wine tipped it over]

      I've had one on the most hectic weeks ever. I have left the house by 8.30 and not getting back until after Livi's school. And the afternoons are just mad. It doesn't help Ben's teething, which makes him a grumpy young boy. I have to admit Livi's been pretty good this week.   As for my diet... I had to bake another applecake the other day... well, I had guests coming over. I have been pretty good. I think I've had three slices in total. I'm definitely boredom eater. Last night Richard was staying out late, so I was alone after kids were in bed. I had something to watch on telly at 9pm, but the time between 7.30 and that I was bored and went straight into kitchen.... I was good and only had satsumas, whereas it would've previously been cake, biscuits, ice cream.   It's all in a head and how you view your food and about your willpower, which I have always been lacking. I've always been a Monday starter and normally by Wednesday it's all over. But I have to say I've been doing this now since beginning of September and properly for nearly 3 weeks now... so far so good. But already I can see boredom signs.  But I do have a bigger goal; I'm going to New York, NY for my 30th birthday, which is a year away, and I'd love to buy some nice clothes there. I know I won't ever be a UK size 12, but I'd be happy to walk into any store and find something of the track instead of always going for the specialist 'big girl' shops.  There is another reason for trying extra hard this time. Olivia's starting school next September and I know how gruel other kids can be. I was teased at school about my size, so I'd hate Livi being bullied 'cos of me. I know all the health reasons why I should lose weight, but when it's a emotional reason, I think it might be a bigger motivator.  Hey, you had a  brilliant weight loss. Very healthy loss. And you've been eating sweets as well, so you're not missing out on anything you couldn't live without.

      I've been living solely on  makaronilaatikko  for 2 days now and  damn  it's good! It has been breakfast, lunch  and  dinner. There's one more bit left when I go home today (and I intent to leave work at a proper hour today) and then it's all gone. Things at work have been bloody awful lately, but today has thankfully been a pretty quiet day. Just as well, because I woke up this morning, bathing in sweat (as opposed to being frozen half dead) and I was feeling so ill I was sure I had a high fever. Of course, I  never  get a fever so I had to crawl to work anyway. So I'm down with another flu, again. I'm convinced it's because my flat is so drafty and cold.  I've been trying to sort out my corporate American Express card today, and it'll be a close call whether it'll actually arrive prior to my trip or during it. I fail to understand how the mailing time can possibly be  8 days  within Copenhagen. It's as bloody mysterious as  BT  in UK - it took two days for the bill to arrive (from registering), but I had to wait for my contract (which was what I needed to get online) for almost two weeks. They were mailed at the same time. Anyway, turns out I don't have to pay for the flights myself, just the expenses over in Finland.  There's a team meeting on in about 20 minutes, I'm hoping it'll stretch for a while so I can head home directly afterwards.   Now the problem is that I've been sitting all day with my coat on so I have nothing to  add on  when I go outside.  Brrrrrrr.    Points for 7.10.:  20/24

      Surprisingly enough, my home-made  makaronilaatikko  isn't a complete failure, as it's actually edible and rather nice... But I think I went a bit overboard with white pepper! Call the fire department. I have no idea what kind of points to give for this stuff. Any ideas? I didn't use any egg, but there's 500g macaroni, 500g chicken mince and a liter of skimmed milk. Yum.

      On menu today: Crisps. Pizza. Coke.  It was nice, but spending a Sunday working on a work-related presentation just isn't my idea of a relaxing weekend.   Totally stressed out for no particular reason. Any more evilness at work and I swear I will fall over and faint and scream and foam in the mouth all at the same time.  Have to get back on track of the bloody diet this week. Good luck for the weighting day!    Points for 3.10.:  20/24   Points for 4.10.:  26/24   Points for 5.10.:  35.5/24

      Weekends are full of temptation for me. Livi's allowed sweets on weekends and not at any other time. SO you can imagine how many sweeties there are in the house. My hand just wanders into to bags of yummy soft Haribo style sweeties. You know the kind, eh?!  It didn't help matters that we went to kid's birthday party today with chocolate cake and chocolate biscuits on offer. I was very good and only had a cheese and tomato sandwich and one chocolate digestive. But Livi did get a party bag full of sweets and as she's a sharing kind I couldn't refuse a sweet or two.  Arg, I'm slightly dreading the weighing in tomorrow.

      Yesterday was definitely better day that Wednesday. But I did bake another cake, this time for National Childbirth Trust's cake stall... and this time there was more dough left, so funny enough that disappeared pretty quick. I should've been stronger and just put it in the sink, fill with water and leave it, but hey it was yummy and I made all my points yesterday.  I had a brilliant end to Wednesday evenining. A woman from Livi's Finnish School called me regarding the cakes and we just got into chatting. We were on the phone for an hour and 10 mins!! And I have no idea who this woman is. We just hit it off. We mainly laughed at Finnish people, not anyone in general, but just over all. The biggest laughing hysteria was caused by the chat about 'tuulipuku' phenomena. You can just spot the same family member 'whizzing' together in their colour co-ordinated windbreaker outfit. It still makes me smile.   We were also discussing the lack of something in Finns. She had lived in Germany, Norway, Finland and now here and she said she's never go back to Finland to live. People are just so close-minded and aarrgg... can't think of a proper word. Example, you meet your neighbour here, you small talk about nothing (well, weather probably). In Finland you meet your neighbour from upstairs, say hello in the lift and they just look at you and quickly disappear from the lift... what's that all about?!  I think I've made up my mind about moving back to Finland. I've asked Richard to make up his before Xmas, so we'll know the score.   Oh, Ben's waking up.

          Weight today:  90.3 kg   Gain/loss:  - 0 grams  Gain/loss total:  - 2.5 kg      Weight today:  199.08 lbs   Gain/loss:  - 0 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 5.51 lbs      Well, that was (not) a big surprise. It was less 90.3 than it was last week, because last week it only went to 90.3 after I took the shirt off; this time it dipped to 90.2 but settled, sadly, on 90.3. So I guess it's not a total  loss  non-loss.

      So yesterday was a bad day for both of us - although I figured that being as angry as I was, I probably sizzled away at least 3 pounds of fat from my body. I remedied this later with sweets and pop corn at the cinema.  Pirates of the Caribbean , I loved the film; it was funny and entertaining, and it never hurts to have Orlando or Johnny on the screen.   *wiping drool*  Diet-wise the day went a little haywire; work-wise -- let's not even go there; I  will  start being serious about getting a new job... I was already practising a goodbye speech to Fucking Ilkka -- Otherwise; there's talk about a skiing trip to Italy or France in February... Maybe I will skip Xmas (I have no vacation days left anyway) and do that with the girls.   Points for 1.10.:  33/24  [counted them wrong before; it was a diet Coke at the cinema!]

      I had one of those shitty days. After dropping Livi of at school I went to pick up the car from garage. 313 quit!!! Fuck. Ben fell asleep in the car on the way back. Fine. Picked Livi up. Fine. Grumpy, hungry, etc. But not yet an indication of what was coming.  After ballet it all went downhill. She couldn't do her seatbelt and as I stared to help her, she got pissed off and walloped me on my face. I don't think she meant to smack me, but as an automatic reaction, I gave her a slap. I felt just awful. There's no excuses for it and it should never have happened. She apologized to me and I apologized to her, so we were ok.  At home I played with her for a long while on the computer. But then Ben started to get tired, grumpy and hungry so I had to pay attention to him. I said she was OK to carry on on the computer, but I wasn't gonna be able to help her. She kept asking and I kept telling her, no, darling, I can't help you right now. She obviously got pissed off and started shouting at me... guess what, we had a nice shouting match. With my great dictaror authority I send her off onto the stairs when she said, "I don't like you any more". Gosh.  Then at dinner table we had even more messing about. She wouldn't eat her chicken. She wouldn't drink her milk. And on top of it all, Ben decided to scream his head off at about that time and he would only calm down after I picked her up. My nice and quiet pizza dinner went out of the window and I ended up struggling it with holding Ben and arguing with Livi. Children, who'd have them?! At least there's one good thing about my children. They go to bed when it's time to go to bed, without arguing. So tonight, they were both in bed at 7pm. Heaven. Richard then walks thru the door, "football, football". Fuck, that's last thing I need today.  It's now 8.30. I think it's a little too early to go to bed, but I can't be fucked to listen to that football, nor my husband's swearing at the little men running around a field after a tiny ball. Fuck that.  Let's hope tomorrow's better.

      I'm in a midst of baking...why oh why do I have to agree on baking yummy cakes when I know I can't eat any?! I'm baking a marble cake  (tiikerikakku)  for Olivia's Finnish School's cake sale. That's my good deed for the PA (Parent's association).   At least one good thing about it was that I should make my points today...not 'cos I'd be eating the cake, but I did scrape the containers with left-over dough. Nice. Yet again I was well short of the points!   Laura, Mum'd be pleased if you popped into Lappeenranta to see her. Does she know you're due to go to Finland? You can always surprise her... unless of course they'll be at the cottage.   As for clothes, obviously black (?!). Have you got that nice black proper shirt you used to have... and long black skirt? Surely you don't need to buy new clothes?! But then again, it's a nice excuse to buy some.  Cake's ready ( or should be) and I need to go and get Livi soon. We've got ballet this afternoon.

      Yurgh. Yesterday wasn't a good day, morale and self-esteem crawling at the bottom, and digging downwards. I felt fat and ugly and stupid and I wanted to get away from people so they wouldn't look at me. Then I went home and painted a  urlLink picture , and I felt better.  Then  I found that MSN Messenger no longer works with my mac, and I need to get the new OS before it will... What with the berating I got for the hours I'd spent on the company internet access from home (errrr... +120 hours in a month?) , using the laptop is out of the question. I  can not  be separated from internet. I  will not  survive. Somebody report animal abuse!     Waaaaaaaaaahhhh!    I'm starving. Must go grocery shopping today - I'm down to, er, nothing at all in the fridge, really. Some apple juice, and a few eggs. Today's lunch will be fresh bread and no butter (ran out). I took some cucumber slices with me though, but I'm so allergic to them I have to drink a Coke to wash them down... It's a kind of an antiseptic. I'd rather have a shot of vodka, but what can you do - none such thing in the vending machine. Bollocks, and blergh. Can't I go home already?   Points for 30.9.:  27.5/24

      No, seriously. I went to see Matrix 3 with mates from work yesterday, and though I had no time for dinner, I'm sure that  giant  pot of pop corn (shared with the three of us, fair enow) and over 250g sweeties more than made up for it. Ergo - no telling what points I ate yesterday.   I'm down with a tummy bug or something. Unfortunately not throwing up - that'd be a great way to lose a lot of weight fast! hehe. Just getting waves of nausea and then feeling fine in the middle. I left work early to work from home instead and luckily wasn't sick on the way - it wasn't far, though.  Ick.  Making another pot of macaroni casserole today. It's good eating, and not too much points.    Points for 19.11.:  21 / 22   * "There is no spoon" [ Neo, the Matrix ]

I thought I had been pretty well all week considering... Oh yes, I've had a hell week. Ben's been ill with conjunctuvices, eye infection. And Olivia decided to throw up on Thursday night when I was out. Thank goodness, 'cos I wouldn't have been able to cope with sick that evening. I just can't cope with sick. I kept her off school Friday and she was just bouncing off the walls, so I took her to a party. That night she puked up again. I obviously couldn't take her to the Finnish school after she threw up again on the sofa Saturday morning. Great. At least I got two hours to myself. I was very busy and didn't have a change to eat any sweets.  Sunday went to another party and I was pretty good. Had couple of sweets and cashew nuts, but nothing excessive. But we did have Burrito dinner Sunday night thou and that's never good just before the weighing. I suppose I need to start counting points more accurately again.

      Says my stomach.  I'm constantly hungry. I mean all the damn time. And i  know  it's not because my stomach is empty, because I eat. I had a sinfully big bowl of pasta and chicken mince today, and let me tell you - it didn't taste half as good as it did in my mind. How odd.  I've been a little bit creative with my points - at least it feels like it - because I've actually been using the extra points I didn't eat earlier. That feels like cheating. Anyway; the pizza was nice yesterday.  Catch me if you can  was OK too, if you don't count the bloody long jazzy beginning titles. I mean, seriously. It was that bad.   My new obsession is for Diet Fanta. Mmm mmm ! I love that stuff. So much better than Diet Coke.

      I've stopped using butter on my bread, which makes it easier to eat less points per day, because unless I'm cooking, white bread is my main source of nourishment. Today I did a wee brisk walk motivated by sweets - I walked over to the 7/11 and went by a video rental to pick up a couple of DVDs for the evening. Yeah, I ate sweets. But as you can see from below, I'm still maintaining my line; no extra points.   Called home today for a little chat with dad (father's day), he sounded really pleased with their trip. He also sounds like he's in dire need of quitting smoking. He sounds just like his dad used to sound.   Anyway, I'm on my way to bed (yes, before 9 PM), because I'm sad and I'm already stressed about going to work. Things are really not going well at work, and I feel like I'm suffocating and that I can't handle it. Of course I  can , I've managed it this far; but that's how I feel anyway.

       what a hell days I've had!!!     Tuesday . Ben desided to throw the breakfast bowl on my clean clothes, great. Went to pick Livi up. Her mate cancelled lunch, I got a shitty behaviour all day. It got so bad I send her off to sleep in her room. Ben then desided to puke on me after lunch, lovely.  Afternoon, the mood continued. It didn't help matters that her afternoon tea buddy forgot, she was coming here. You can cope with rejection once a day, but twice???!!! It was hell.   Wednesday . Ben didn't drink his milk and turned his nose up his breakfast. Fine, be hungry then. Ben grumpy as hell all morning. Picked Livi up from school, better mood, thank goodness. Took her to ballet. Ben then threw up all over me, right outside ballet. Luckily my neighbour was there with her daugher and I managed to get home to clean up. Went to Annie's in the afternoon and Ben threw up again after two spoonfuls of potato. Nice.   Thursday . Ben hasn't eaten anything but biscuits and had some milk. At least he's been sleeping well. Livi's still a grumpy camel. Feel like sending her to sleep again, but she seemed to have calmed down with Peter Pan.   But hey, it can only get better, right?!  At least my eating has improved in last few days.  No probs with diet really, I have had few Mariannes today thou.

      OK, I'm on strict no-nonsense line now, and keeping tabs with every damn mouthful. Half the time I'm starving though! It's not because I'm eating too little, but I'm eating too rarely - I just can't divide my snacks into smaller portions. Anyway, I made another macaroni casserole (ie.  makaronilaatikko ) yesterday and I think we agreed on about 30 points for the whole lot... Which is fine, because that's easy to divide into 5-point dinners. The only problem is that it's so damn good that you don't want to stop at the first plateful!   Anyway, had a day off yesterday and I was supposed to do a ton of stuff; only it turns out that the parcel that was supposed to be delivered wasn't, so I was sitting at home from 9 to 5 pm for nothing. I called  urlLink IWOOT  again today to see when they will actually deliver. So, hopefully I'm getting my goodies on Monday, because I changed the delivery to my work address.   Only - I just realised - we are moving office (again!) on Monday, so I will be in the other building. Damn! I'll have to have a word with the reception before weekend.   See, this is me for the last few weeks; I can't concentrate on any damn thing I'm doing and I keep making these silly screw-ups with absolutely everything... I don't know what I should do, aside from a good long holiday.    Points for 5.11.:  19 / 24

      I weighted myself: 87 kilos!!!!!!!!! And my waist was 1,14 meters!!!!!!!!!! I feel very sick when thinking about those numbers. And yesterday I went to the dentist: one very big hole in my tooth. I'm wondering only that what it's gonna cost! So tell me, is it easy to stop eating sweets....

      Again - I didn't even put an effort into that this time. Only had breadrolls today - DRY - but ended up having dinner at bloody Ikea. Meatballs and fries!! Fucking hell - I will never eat anything again.    This is just not my bloody week!!!!     points for 4.11.:  28 / 24

      I did finish off those chocolates left over from Hallowe'en. Oh well. At least there's no more temptation, unless you take into count two more bags of mini chocs, but as they haven't been opened, I should be able to avoid the temptation.

Tomorrow is fucking Monday again, I wish I was dead, or at least excused from having to go to work, etc. I've nearly undone all loss from the previous 8 weeks in the last two or three. It's soooooo easy... I'm going back to bed.

      Livi had Finnish School yesterday and you know what that means... sweets and more sweets. I was very good at school and on the way back had only two liquiroice sticks, that's 2 points. But last night was the problem. I was purely bored watching telly and as I had only had a poor dinner of Weight Watcher's Lasagne, I ended up having few chocolates. Not just plain chocs, but mini bags of chocolate buttons... three of them. I need to check points on those... Sweets are so much better for you then chocolate, but if there's some chocs available, it's just so bad for me.  And today we've got kids birthday party to go to... oh dear. Need to be good, weighing in tomorrow morning.

And to top it off  I've even gone over the 10 pound marker. Wow... All this without counting points or fussing about what I eat. Is that spooky or what?  I totally forgot to weigh myself on Friday, and actually only remembered the whole thing yesterday evening, so the weigh is actually from this morning.   Honestly though, I've eaten a fair amount of junk and such, but not much real food; and I've stressed myself silly at work during the last week.   Christmas, I'm sure, will soon fix this little glitch though. It won't be ham or turkey and masses of mom's cooking though, but sweets and crisps and all things nice and easy. I checked for flights to Finland but there were none available for before Xmas, so here I am... Me and the fishies. Could be worse, I suppose.

      Not  the  Danish pastries as such. I mean the new decadent evil Cat Eyes introduced me to, something that's called Æbleskivor, "apple slices". The name is typically Danishly misleading, as they're balls made of pancake dough (nice and yummy and fluffy all the way through), no slices and no apple involved at all. You eat them like pancakes, with sugar or jam or cream... I  love  them. I bought some yesterday, and since I have my newest toy now (the miniature digicam) I can show you a picture.   Now please excuse me while I go wipe drool.   Ear infection eh? I'm convinced all my infections came from wandering around Oli's school. Evil... I tell ya, evil. Still have an eye infection in both eyes, but at least it's not too bad, and my throat is almost healed.

      I've been rather absent from here for a bit now. Sorry. My last week was absolutely manic, but I did weigh myself on Sunday morning. I think that'll be my weighing day from now on.       Imperial   Gain/loss:  -2 lbs  Gain/loss total:  -10 lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  -900 g  Gain/loss total:  -4.7 kg  S    So actually I lost the pound I gained last week and an extra pound. I suppose that's good. But this time of the year is just so deadly. All those parties, cookies, cakes, chocolates, did I mention chocolates?! I'll try and be better and I can only apologize for my hectic life at the moment. PS. I was really nice having you here!! I think it was the best visit ever. Thanks for being my sister. Love you lots. OH by the way, the weird ear ache I had... infection!!

      This is going to do wonders for my points tomorrow - I hope. I'll be very surprised indeed if they're not down pretty heavily. My throat is so sore I can't eat or drink anything right now (though I make valiant attempts with tea every once in a while) - and you'll see if you pop over to the Green Boogers side that the Secretary From Hell has already diagnosed me - she said because it's just a virus and I've no fever, I don't need to see a doctor for at least a week (!!!).  Got an appointment for tomorrow, though.

      So I'm bored. I've stolen below quotes off  urlLink this  site. It's about fat women.  "I believe that my decision to remain unfit at the age of thirty-four will serve me well in the future, as I never have to endure the hushed observation that I've 'really let myself go' "  - Janeane Garofalo, Feel This Book   "Food is the primal symbol of social worth.  Whom a society values, it feeds well.  The piled plate, the choicest cut, say: We think you're worth this much of the tribe's resources."  - Naomi Wolf, The Beauty Myth   "Kathy Smith is a fitness guru, who took it upon herself to write about my acceptance speech at the Emmy Awards in a newspaper column headlined 'If Fat Becomes Hip, We Are In Extreme Trouble.'  Really?  How so?  What kind of trouble?  I'm just trying to figure out what kind of chaos the world would be thrown into if fat became hip and hips became fat.  Would there be chocolate rationing?  Would Wall Street buckle under heavier brokers?  Would all the pork in the federal budget actually be appropriated for pork?  It's hard to imagine exactly what this 'extreme trouble' might be"  - Camryn Manheim, Wake Up, I'm Fat!   "No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body."  - Margaret Sanger   "According to diet lore, 'indulging' or 'giving in to temptation' is a 'sin.'  Strangling a few people is a sin.  Invading East Timor is a sin. Ethnic cleansing is a sin.  Testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific is a sin.  I'm sorry, but eating doesn't quite make the grade"  -Kaz Cooke, Real Gorgeous   "Many of the most virulent stereotypes about women in general have not been discarded but merely transferred, so that negative qualities once attributed to all women are now considered the sole province of fat women"  - W. Charisse Goodman, The Invisible Woman   "In many cultures and historical periods women have been proud to be large--being fat was a sign of fertility, of prosperity, of the ability to survive.  Many of us are convinced that making women afraid to be fat is a form of social control. Fear of fat keeps women preoccupied, robs us of our pride and energy, keeps us from taking up space."  -Our Bodies, Ourselves       Disclaimer : I just copied them here. It doesn't mean I believe in them.

      The fundamental failure in my diet is that the only way I'm actually losing weight is by leaving out everything except bread and butter. I am capable of doing this for a long time if I want to, but not indefinitely. Even I realise that total abstinence is not the answer.   There's no other way but to start exercising. I'll have to face it eventually, stuff all my flabby bits into sportswear and, yes, emerge from my cocoon in all my glory and start jogging or walking or something. Going to a gym is absolutely out of the question. I did get a copy of Winsor Pilates cd from my friends, but as it turns out, my back's so screwed up I can't do the techniques because any amount of laying down on my back totally deletes my ability to move. My doctor would be thrilled...  Even if I said earlier that dieting is not a punishment, it is really. It's just the smaller evil from having to spend rest of my life hating my body.

      I've been shopping for new clothes today against my own will  [I think clothes-shopping will be my new  punishment  everytime I stray off the healthy eating] ; I needed trousers for the skiing trip in a few weeks.  As I looked in the mirror at the H&M cubicle, I was thinking:  "Hmm. Didn't these things used to make you look  thinner ?"    Horrible sight. But I'm skiing pants  and  new jogging pants richer. So to speak.

      Well, I've done it. I sat here on my own (Rich out with the lads), watching a film. I started off well by eating Weigh Watcher's meal (nice, little small, but nice), but then boredom set in.... and I demolished a 250g Marabou chocolate bar.... Oh well. I step forward, two steps back... or was it supposed to be other way around?

      Well, I'm back. It's taken me this long to get my arse into gear and the extra weight off that I managed to pile on at holiday period. So, I'll try again. I've decided to weigh myself on Fridays as the weekends are always my sinfullest time. And I discovered that weighing myself in the bathroom keeps the scales lower than in the bedroom, so the new home for the scales are in the bathroom, under the sink. Xmas was uncontrolable. At least when it came to eating. I ate anything and everything I fancied and still not getting the grip with eating. My problem is the food in the house, which you're not supposed to eat. One way out of it is to eat it all, so it won't tempt you, and that's exactly what I've done. So, here were go again.       Imperial   Gain/loss:  -/+ 0 lbs  Gain/loss total:  -10 lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  -/+0 g  Gain/loss total:  -4.7 kg  S

       [as posted at  urlLink Green Boogers ]   In the last couple of days I've come to realise that I've put my life on hold for a reason that is completely ludicrous, and at the same time, horribly sad. I don't know how to say it so that it doesn't sound theatrical, so I'll just come right out and say it: I've stopped living my life because I'm too fat. By "not living" I mean that I don't like to meet new people; I don't like to shop for clothes; I'm hesitant to join sport-related outings; I'm not willing to look for a new job because I don't want to go to an interview as a fat person.   It's easy to give up on diets and exercise regimes and say  "who cares if I'm fat; it's my body and my life, and I want to enjoy it"  - but sadly the answer to the rhetorical question is that  I care . I  do  care. I don't care what other people think about my lifestyle, my clothes, my hair or my personality, I don't even care if they think I'm overweight - but in a my logic, I think that people see me as I see me, and I know I don't like what I see; why would anyone else? No amount of opposing evidence is likely to change my mind.  I don't think being fat makes you a bad person. But as always special rules have always been in effect for me, so I think that being fat makes  me  a bad person.   Having realised, or admitting to - I really can't tell - the facts doesn't mean that I've actually changed in any way, or that I ever will; great dramatic scenes only have entertainment value and have little to do with my actual motivation. I've learned that I don't actually mind embarrassing myself nor eating my words, as it were, in public. However, at the moment I feel that I'm ready to move on and get a hold on my life again. I can't fix how I feel about myself  [that's probably a lifelong job for a really good shrink] , but I can try to change myself from the outside. Building up from the human wreck I am now  will  be unpleasant, discouraging and slow, and I can't promise that I will stick to it... In case of failure, I will eventually try again, and again. A lot of people spend their whole lives doing this, I hope I'm not one of them.  Damn, I don't mean to be dramatic.  It's just new to me to have energy to even think about improving my life and feeling like I need to get on top of things - who would have known? Leaving work at normal hours, not logging on to work from home and not doing overtime has actually paid off.

      I hate it  I hate it I hate it I hate it  I hate it when everything I eat is always the same. There's only so many ways to spice up a chicken or pasta, and I'm hardly ever eating rice anymore, I'm sick to death of eating anything at all really and I can't be arsed to cook! I hate myself. I don't feel sexy in any good way at all (ie. I feel I'm shaped like a fertility symbol), and it really doesn't help that I've no new clothes and I don't even want to buy any.   I got a link to  urlLink this  dieting website today with recommendations - it's in Finnish - but I haven't checked it yet much.

      Had dinner in Pizza Hut yesterday, but for the record, it wasn't very nice. Except for the garlic bread... Mmm... Cheese. Cheese is my weakness: I don't buy any at home, so when i have a chance to eat garlic bread or nachos with wonderful, fatty cheese, there's just no stopping me.   I'm not having a good day, or a good week, self-esteem-wise. Losing such small amount of weight seems insignificant, and it seems i'm just not getting anywhere.   Got my yearly bonus yesterday, wandered around shops wishing I could buy something for myself; but no such luck. There's two stores (more, if you count H&M's with their BiB chain - most of which looks godawful on me, isn't my style and makes me feel like i'm dressed in a tent. Even if it's too tight.) that I've found which are for large girls...  1) the clothes are nothing like my style (bearing in mind I only wear black, so the variety I'd even consider is even smaller) 2) My goddamn boobs didn't fit into a single one of their coats!   Am I trying to make a point? No.  Am I whining for no particular reason? Yep. Am I ashamed of myself? Uh, yes. Sorry.

I've been feeling so fat and ugly this week that I was sure it'd reflect directly on my actual weight. I'm feeling a bit guilty for staying indoors all weekend (so far), but on the other hand, at least I've got some actual progress on my website. I ran out of energy for actual exercise long ago (that'd be three days long now), so I'm feeling even more guilty about that.   I can't help it. I just can't be arsed. I'm thinking  "what's the point of doing exercise during the weekend, when during the week I'll lapse out of it anyway?"  The underlying reason probably just is that I'm lazy, and I bloody hate doing calisthenics, and even more than that, I really hate going for "walks" and "jogging".  I'm probably expecting a miracle.

      Did I ever mention how much I hate my job? It's always even more obvious how  bad  it is for me to work here after I come back from holiday. I don't know how it happens, but after sitting at the computer doing stupid things for 8 hours (if I'm lucky), by the time I get home I'm not interested even to open TV, much less to cook, or go for a walk, or think about anything.   And the cravings are so bad. I want sweets when I'm bored. I also want them when I'm feeling bad. I also want them when I'm too tired to feel anything at all.   I've been trying to eat "right" since I came back - a proper breakfast (and those Cheerios had better be as full of fibre as they claim to be!) and a proper lunch; less white bread; and a real dinner instead of munchies or more white bread. I already blew it yesterday though, because I bought a big bag of sweets for compensation for a crap day at work, and by the time I was feeling like cooking, it turned out to be an omelette with pasta. Healthy!!   I need about four-five hours of off-time after work before I want to do anything at all. Unfortunately four-five hours after work is too close to bedtime for it to make sense to go out a walk or jog, even if by that time I'd have the energy to do so. That would push my bedtime too late, I'd be fucking awful in the morning and the whole next day would be ruined.  On to plan B...

      At first I thought my sister has been abducted by aliens, but as it turns out (mind like a sieve) she's apparently on the face of the earth still, although only marginally. Yes, Finland really is like that.

          Weight today:  88.9 kg   Gain/loss:  - 0.4 kg  Gain/loss total:  - 3.8 kg      Weight today: 195.99  lbs   Gain/loss:  - 0.88 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 8.38 lbs      I'm so not happy to be back! But at least the weigh is nominally down, which is nice. I can't say I was being particularly good food-wise on the trip; we were eating out every day for lunch (with the ski-school group), and I mainly stuck with pizzas; also, we had our very own cook with us who made wonderful, wonderful dinner for us every evening! On a positive note, I never even  thought  about craving for sweets and I ski'd at least 4 hours every day,  and  trekked up and down the valley in them heavy skiing boots and carrying the bloody skis.   I also beat one of the guys in snow fight. Hah! Something good came out of martial arts, after all.

      I'm tired of chicken. I'm fed up with white bread. I can barely eat pasta anymore. That's like 80% of the things I  can  eat. I've started eating red meat again in small quantities out of sheer desperation; salami on bread and an occasional steak in a restaurant (though I wouldn't cook it at home). I've replaced white bread at home almost entirely with crispbread ( hapankorppu ). And I'm so bloody bored!  I probably never really talked about it, but when I was at my skinniest a few years ago, I was also sick in my head about eating. I would have a couple of crackerbread ( näkkileipä ) for breakfast, a couple for lunch (sometimes with cheese). I'd eat a bowl of instant noodles before training to make sure I had enough energy, but I felt constantly guilty about eating. I was constantly suffering from nausea and headaches. I trained up to six times a week plus minimum of two-three hours of skating every day, and I  still  felt fat and ugly.   Why do I bring this up now? Because now that I'm fat and ugly for  real  I can feel the desire to stop enjoying food lurking just around the corner. My  head  knows that by eating less food my body would burn less fat, but the part of me that's a little insane can see the logic behind it, and it's driving force is the desire to punish the body by taking away the food. I'm not about to stop eating, but I wish that just once, I could feel normal about myself and see myself for what I really am. Whatever that is.

I hardly ate at the beginning of the week and that obviously slowed down my metabolism right down. I did eat more carbs that I meant to, but I was poorly and that's when diets don't really apply. A bit disappointed, but at the same time, it's a loss, so can't complain.

There's only two words I can say: What...ever. Slow and steady, I'm approaching my starting weight. It's odd, since I do more exercise. I do eat more, but I eat less of white bread and more pasta and chicken and crispbread, and my new addition...  Salami . Yep. The red meat variety. I suppose the added salt to the diet is tying up all the liquid I consume, making me gain weight? Who knows. Who cares. If exercise doesn't make it go down, then I might as well admit defeat.  Speaking of which, I finally had my induction to the gym on Saturday, and it was  great . I really enjoyed it, and finally worked up a proper sweat. I reckon I can push it a bit harder tomorrow,  i want to feel the pain!!  Added weights to the program but no problems still with soreness, except for my back. But my back is always hurting, so that doesn't really count. I'm looking forward to going to back to the gym tomorrow again... Gives life some meaning!

      No idea how I've done this week. I haven't felt hungry, but I've gone off eating cooked dinners so salad with sausage and cheese will do me fine. I'll get bored with that thou, before long. THen I have to think of something else.  I've been good with temptation, even today Livi offered me one of her Haribos and I had to recline. Not bad, eh?!  Our family has been attacted with tummybug, so I've got shits now, so that'll probably help a little bit with the weight loss. We'll see in the morning. Oh it's Mothers day here, so I'm expecting about having a lie-in.

      Can't keep me eyes open anymore. Thank god for toffee. Gym yesterday wasn't so good, I don't know if I'm coming down with a cold (or maybe just allergy/pollen) or if yesterday was just a bad day (well, i  know  it was a bad day, but maybe it extented to my ability to perform physically). I'll get the official induction on Saturday, I can't wait to get to work out with weights and inflict some  real  damage on me!   Wohoo.   What else? I've trimmed my nails so short my fingertips are sore, and still I manage to make myself bleed. Damn this rash! I'll say it in Japanese: Watashi wa kayui desu * !  I want to move to Japan. Mmmm.

      I can't wait to get off work and go to the gym. I don't feel it's actually doing much good, since I'm  not  half dead or even hurting when I get home. That can't be right! I also feel I'm not working hard enough since I only go three times a week... If only the gym was closer, I'm sure I could get up earlier and do  45 minutes on a treadmill or something before coming to work...  My old training buddy wrote me a letter, she's now training for the brown belt.  Brown belt!!  I'm so envious and bitter and jealous that I could just cry. I want my martial arts back.

      It's 11 AM and my stomach is growling.   My new plan is to work with a metabolism-increasing eating; I don't know if this is a myth or a fact, but I learned at some point that by eating a small or no breakfast means your body adjusts to the feeling of hunger and doesn't burn much fat. Eating a large breakfast should then by logic increase metabolism, and so far it seems to be working for  any  meal - The more i eat, the hungrier I am!  Somehow I think there's a hole somewhere in the logic of this.

      I got lucky-ish with the shopping, H&M had the usual crappy collection of BiB stuff, but I settled for a couple of standard T-shirts and a non-flattering pair of trousers. Also, it's once again been proven I'm of a non-size - Size X is too loose, and size X- invariably so tight it doesn't zip up.  It's  so  bloody hard to diet with allergies! We ate out again, and I was trying to opt for something "light"... Which did NOT work out since I can't eat the salads. It was nachos with cheese all the way.    *grumble*   No matter. Cat Eyes left her keys at work so she was sleeping over, we made up for the aggravation by ice cream and Animal Planet on the telly.  I  am  looking forward to getting to the gym today, though!

      I'm doing fine. I had my first test last night. Went out to Annie's for a girlie night in, doing make-up and hair (I know, were a little sad). There, on offer, was crisps, dips, alcohol and CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS!!!! I was extremely good and only nibbled on cucumber and pepper pieces dips in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Really nice actually.  I'm amazed how easy this all seems. I'll know Sunday morning if this works or not.

       [as posted in  urlLink Green Boogers :]   There's no helping it. It was bound to happen sooner or later, but finally, there's no getting away from it... I must buy new clothes. My 2 T-shirt, 3-trouser system no longer works when I have to have separate clothes for going to the gym as well (at least until I've lost enough weight to use my old clothes again), and aside the fact that it's damn near impossible to find clothes to fit my size and shape, I completely object to the fashion content of today.   What was so bloody good about 80's that it had to be brought back? It had the worst fashion statements of the century; and what do I see when I dare exit the relative safety of my house? Pointy shoes, variety of 80's hairstyles back on the street (even Cat Eyes fell victim to her hairdresser's erring sense of style - don't worry, her hair is all better now), those horrible clothes that hang from all the wrong places and only fit skinny 6'6'' model-types, oh my god, the  colours ! Not only primary reds, blues and yellows are back, but bright green, for gods' sake, and the worst of all;  neon colours.   Wasn't it bad enough the first time 'round? No, seriously.   70's, yeah, I can live with that. That's the kind of bad taste that looks kind of cool in a nerdy way. 90's - yeah, bring it on - at least I can buy a decent pair of shoes again. But 80's was just plain fake, and fake 80's style is... well, it's even faker.   Please. Spare me. I feel tempted to start dressing up in the style that's appropriate for Taliban women - it'd be all black, and I definitely wouldn't have to worry about hair or make up.    Other things:     Prior to spell-checking  urlLink this  post, I never knew "acquittance" is spelled like that, I've always spelled it "acquitance". Live and learn. It also bugged the hell out of me I used that word twice in the aforementioned post. I'm obsessed about things like that.    There's a man in my morning train who always has terrible trouble deciding which seat to take.    I stand corrected about the gym separation. The gym we went to had special area for ladies training, and it could also be used by fat people and the elderly. Fair enough, I suppose    I found that I'm in a horribly bad state. My BMI is 39 (or so) and my heart rate rocketed sky high just for walking on the treadmill for a minute or two. I don't  feel  bad, but all the numbers seem to be telling me that I'm risking my life just by walking up the stairs to work. Funny, that. Good thing I don't know what my blood pressure is.    Going to the gym was  great . It's totally de-stressing (except for all the machines telling me to slow down), but I want to push harder and work harder, all this sissy-walking to keep the heart rate down was just frustrating me. We (Valkyria and I) only managed to get a proper induction/program thingy for the 20th, so the next couple of weeks we'll be sticking to things we know, i.e. treadmill, bike, sit-ups and push-ups.    I was ever so glad about the separate changing rooms for fat people. It was one of the most depressing things I've done for a long time to have to change in and out of training clothes in the middle of perfect-bodied naked women. Hmmm. That'll bring some interesting hits on my site, no doubt.

      New diet... hopefully this one will work. And just looking at my entry from 30th Jan... Well, I'm not doing Atkins, but something similar. It's called Somersizing. Check it out on  urlLink www.suzannesomers.com . It's about limiting your carbs and only eating whole grain stuff. And a big no no, SUGAR. I'll let you know how we (I say we as Richard started as well) go.  Last night we both had a headache, which was probably caused by not eating carbs at all yesterday and not having any caffeine.  Oh weighing is happening Sunday mornings.

Whatever.  On a positive note, Valkyria & I have agreed to start going to the gym together. It's bloody expensive - about £40 per month  with  company discount - but they have special areas for  fat and ugly  obese and elderly people. Even our own changing rooms, isn't that nice? We'll be calling them today and the plan is we start tomorrow.

      More and more depressed and discouraged on my inability to make a change in lifestyle.

      I forgot to weigh myself again before having breakfast and getting dressed - I stood at 91.2 kg so it looks like I'm not losing or gaining much. I'll be stuck at this weight forever.  OH MY GOD  I saw a documentary last night about breast reductions - I didn't realise that breasts could get even larger by age and after having children! Urrrgh.    "The patient with very large breasts may suffer from a variety of symptoms. The weight of the breast tissue itself would cause problems; but the woman with large breasts finds that the position of this weight causes back strain and discomfort. The bra ultimately becomes an instrument of pain as the bra straps cut into the shoulders. The pull of gravity is now transferred to the shoulders and neck muscle resulting in more pain and muscle spasm. It is not uncommon in the most severe cases to see permanent grooves in the shoulders where the bra straps have exerted their pull. Some patients may even have scars in this area. Even with the best of bra support there may be some overlap and contact between the breast skin and the lower chest wall skin. Especially in the warmer climates this can create a chronic skin irritation called intertriginous dermatitis.  Patients have often been quite self conscious about their breast size and may have suffered from a variety of unwanted attention. This type of suffering is difficult to quantify but it is present to some degree in many patients with enlarged breasts. Breast size often interferes with the woman's ability to exercise. There is often direct interference with arm motion in certain sports, and there is the pain many of these women experience during jogging or running inspite of the support of the best bras available." [ urlLink link ]   They forgot to mention poor posture...

So that obviously meant baking and icing two more cakes as well as still eating some of the Easter chocolates. I'm happy.  New York got confirmed as well. We're definitely going. I think it's gonna be just me and Elin, but I'm pretty pleased about that. It's not gonna be November like we first planned but probably second week in October. Really looking forward to that now.  I've bought next size down on trousers, but I can't do them up, I can get them on, but that's the furthest, no where near doing them up yet. I'll take them to Finland in the summer and I'll wear them there. I promise. Oh, on the typically British note, the weather is absolutely gorgeous. Yesterday it was +20C in the shade and of course sunny. I managed to get a little red on my back, but it'll turn into tan soon.

I think the loss would've been greater if it wasn't for all those few sins I had over the weekend. And it's only Sunday morning.  Friday we went out with the girls and oh boy did I drink?! I actually thought I might be even more pissed as I haven't touched alcohol for 8 weeks, but I don't think I made a fool of myself. Vodka and diet coke definitely is the drink for me. And Saturday I took Livi to see Sleeping Beauty on ice and completely without thinking I ate a KitKat fing... oh well. That's not all. I made another cake for Livi and Ben party... I licked the bowl of the cake mix and the butter-icing bowl... Naughty. But still a loss.

At least, not until I've checked the status of my bank account.   Had great hols, it was really good to get away for a bit and see some nice people and family! Thanks!

      I feel great. I've been shopping today as I desperately needed a bra. I have gone down two bra sizes but kept the cup size, excellent. And I bought myself some trousers to wear in couple of months time as they're two sizes smaller than my old size. I got home and tried them on; they fit me now!!! How excellent do I feel right now?! TOP OF THE WORLD.

      Well, the party went well and I only had little bit of the cake and a sip of white wine. Weighed myself on Sunday and wasn't too happy. As you can see.       Imperial   Gain/loss:  +1/2 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 18 1/2 lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  - 230g  Gain/loss total:  - 8.2 kg      I suppose it's only half a pound. And it could've been just water retention. Who knows. A bit annoying that Richard's doing so very well. He's lost another 2 pounds. No really, good for him. I've already gone down a dress size so I shouldn't really complain.   Went to Burger King today and had a chicken whopper burger. I was very good and just left the bap. It was very nice indeed. Next time I might try double cheese burger, it's got twice the meat and cheese and leaving the bap won't feel that horrible.  It's also nice to have Laura here. A bit jealous, when she was eating sweets at cinema. And mashed potato and chips..., oh well.

      It's been horrible today. I've been baking cakes all day long. It's Livi's party tomorrow and it's been hell today. I've had couple of nibbles and buttercream is just divine. Pity it's got sugar in it.  Laura coming tomorrow morning, nice.  Bloody hell. Richard's just given Livi a piece of her birthday cake...  It's for tomorrow's party, for f**k's sake...  aarrgghhh.

      Moogie says that three times a week at the gym won't be enough to shift any weight (and based on empirical evidence, he's right) - but I'm thinking  surely  stepping up exercise and dropping out fatty stuff should make at least a  little  difference? Or is life really that unfair?

      I forgot to weigh myself and at the same time I fear the worst. I have been rather naughty. I ate a fair bit of chocolate yesterday. Nice and healthy-ish lunch with quiche and salad and salami, but then the pudding blew me away. Either strawberries or marshmallows dipped into chocolate. Oh my gosh, they were well morish. I was well hooked. I was bad. Very bad. I cracked in the evening as well; I had chocolate whilst watching telly. Very bad me. I've been very good today thou and will weigh myself in the morning.

      I had to rearrange my closets today, so I ended up sorting through all the clothes that are now too small for me.  Way  too small! I can't believe I used to fit into these things less than four years ago - found some of my favourite clothes and now I can't help but wonder...   Is it time for me to face the facts and realise that I will never again be twenty, in spirit nor in size?  Will I ever fit into my favourite shirt?    ...or this skirt?    or these?

Pity it's not any more, but I have been cheating a little again. I try and be good, but it's getting harder. I've walked every day week, so I'm hoping for a bigger loss on Sunday, but then I haven't been very good with food. Need to find my motivation again. Sorry I've been absent, but I'm here now. There's been football on everynight and I can't be arsed to sit here while the footie's on and I've just been very very busy. But I'm here now.

      So I finally cracked. I barely lasted a week! But how could have I resisted a bag of Panda liquorice? The queue was stuck with me right next to a whole pile of them... Torture!   I didn't eat the whole bag, though. And I  am  going to the gym today. Besides, I figured that I deserve to eat some every once in a while. As long as I don't make a habit of it. That way, I reason, every mouthful is an even bigger pleasure.  Back to the gym today.

      Well, I still haven't bought any sweets. I did make pancakes though... I used my old recipe, which is the same as the new one, except I use water instead of milk. The taste is definitely different, but the downside of using milk is that they tend to stick to my crappy frying pan, and water makes them oh, so much crispier.  Mmmmm.    I seem to be accommodating for the lack of sweets. I bought fat-free meringues, and seven new DVDs, instead. (I did get 5 films for about £25 so it's not as bad as it sounds.)  Haven't been to the gym this week, except on Tuesday, and maybe tomorrow... I got my new EU-coloured passport - the photo isn't as bad as I remembered it so I guess I won't die having to display that to airport officials - and this week the crown prince of Denmark married an Aussie commoner. Wohoo. Terhi would've enjoyed that; it's almost better than the Charles/Diana thing she was hooked on. I started a new project -  urlLink Dare You To Write  - and I intent to recruit as many guest columnists as possible. Go on. I dare you.

      Back to gym today - I meant to go at least once this weekend, but... No. I cannot leave the house, unless absolutely necessary. In fact, I got nothing done all weekend. This meant I had to do laundry yesterday after work, which meant that my gym clothes for today were still damp this morning. They're now sitting in a bag behind me, and I can only hope they won't stink when I take them out at the gym later today.   I also managed to resist temptation yesterday - no sweets from the grocery store. My gut reaction to this denial was that of an addict or a small child (or both, possibly): I pouted and swore and felt miserable - how am I supposed to be happy if the only thing I  enjoy  is taken away?!  Huff!!  I love sweets. I simply cannot bear to live without them, and yet... I'm forcing myself down that path anyway. All I'm saying is that I'm not enjoying it. And I'm not losing weight either.   I feel as though everything I put into my mouth is glued to my hips, arms, belly, back, legs and thighs - there's no such thing as a healthy meal (for me), there's no time or energy for one and  forever , I'm completely and utterly spiteful of my body. Hate it, hate it,  hate it.   I'm tempted to "stop eating" - not completely, that is, but "stop eating properly" is hardly accurate either (I can't claim to be eating properly as it is). And then, I just want to gobble up like a pig. The meaning of food has ceased to be pleasure or sustenance, it's a source of aggravation or guilt. Perfect. I've slipped down the mental slopes again. Hello, bottom.

      I never got a chance to ask how Terhi reacted to the photo we "edited" - I know she's busy with school and work experience and all that, but I haven't heard from her since sometime around Easter so I was wondering if she's maybe pissed off.

      Wow. First time since forever I exercised self-restraint and didn't shop for sweets or crisps. Admittedly, I still bought a large pot of ice cream, but it's the yoghurt-type and (I think) not as unhealthy as the cream-based stuff. Anyway, I need to have  some  vices.

      I'm pretty high at the  moment. I had a day out to myself, so obviously I went shopping. I decided to try on UK size 18 and it fit me! I actually bought a skirt from a normal shop, nice denim one and it looks good. It helped it was on sale. But I actually tried on some jeans of size 18 as well. I managed to do them up and they looked ok, but I would've been conscious of the 'flap' at the waistline. But I did do them up and they would've been ok with longer top. I'm so happy. That's three UK dress sizes down! On a sadder note. Richard had decided to give up this way of living. He's back on the bread, potatoes and beer diet. I wondered how long he'd last. Oh well, now it's all up to me to show how it's done.

      The changes in my weight are marginal at best, so I'm not recording it until I can see some changes - I'm sitting tight at 90 kg. We skipped gym on Sunday, but going today instead so I guess that's not so bad. My new plan is to go every day from Mon - Thu and have the rest of the week off. Let's see if that works any better... I just can  not  get out of the house during weekends!

      oh what a good girl I was... well nearly. We had Peter's 30th birthday surprise party at Harvester. Surprise worked out really well and then it was time to order some food. I skipped starter as there was salad table where I had couple of visits. I had some beetroot.. am I allowed, not sure, but it was good. I also had a glass of red wine, just a glass. For mainmeal I had a mixed grill. It came with chips, but I left them on the plate. Arent I good?! The main downfall was the cake Mimi had organised. It was a chocolate cake with fresh cream and fruit inside and chocolate coating with white chocolate decorations on top. I couldn't resist, but instead of having a piece to myself I shared one with Livi and Ben. It was soooo good. I don't think I've ever had a cake so yummy. I was slightly dreading the weighing this morning, but I felt better after a walk in the evening. So, here's this week's weighing.      Imperial   Gain/loss:  -2 lbs  Gain/loss total:  - 25 1/2 lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  - 908 g  Gain/loss total:  - 11.6 kg

       juhannuspäivä  according to Finnish calendar – midsummer's day. I weighed myself this morning instead of tomorrow, as I know I'll be naughty tonight. I'm going out with a Finnish friend to celebrate Finnish style, so I know there's gonna be  lonkero  involved and that's a big no-no with all the sugar contents of it. I'm feeling greater about many things. I feel there's light at the end of the tunnel, but still not sure if it involves me living with Rich or not. Only time will tell. So here's this weeks weigh-in.      Imperial   Gain/loss:  - 1 lb  Gain/loss total:  - 30 ½ lbs       Metric   Gain/loss:  - 454g  Gain/loss total:  - 13.8 kg

      My weight is staying exactly the same, and I've not been going to the gym for a long time. The only difference between now and then is  in the stairs I have to climb to get to the office; and even that is very slight. This just speaks volumes of the pros and cons of exercise...  I have an interview  in  Rotterdam sometime during my holiday - they'll fly me over for it. Should be interesting... if only I had anything to wear.

      I haven't been on the scales since a couple of weeks ago, which showed no change. I haven't been to the gym since, er, two days before the last time I checked my weight. It's not going to happen this week either, and then I'm off to Finland for three weeks.   I hope the weather's going to be nice.  My plan is to stay at the cottage for a couple of weeks, at least if the weather permits. Then, if I feel better about the world in general, I might emerge and go to Helsinki and face all my friends.   I have a job interview today for a job in Rotterdam. It's basically the same job as this one, for another company... And I think I'm a complete idiot for even applying. Is  any  change good? Or should it be for the better?

I've eaten even if I haven't been hungry, as I thought that I don't wanna start skipping meals as your metabolism slows down when you don't eat. I've been able to resist comfort eating, which has always been my downfall. Maybe I'm now starting to realise that I am stronger than I thought and my will power has increased in the last few months. I think overall I've become stronger as person.  For those who are not in a know; I'm about to go through a separation with my husband. I've decided I'll be stronger and happier without the conflict and arguments of everyday life. The situation is obviously delicate as we have children to think about. I'm stronger day by day, and we'll all be fine. Anyway, I'm happy with this week's weight loss.

Another night out in town with a girlfriend the night before the weigh-in. I'm getting back on track, but unfortunately my life's been thrown up-side-down at the moment, so I can't comment on anything else now. Will explain myself when I feel ready. I'll try and keep up with the new eating plan. But like Laura I'm an emotional eater, but hopefully I can get through this crisis without falling into the trap of food.

      I'm definitely an emotional eater. Especially when I'm depressed - it's the same old fun circle: I'm depressed because I'm fat, I'm fat because I eat, I eat because I'm depressed. Just resisting the tempation at work takes more energy than the work itself - not that it shows! Going to the gym is barely even happening at the moment; might go today. (On the other hand, today sucks as well.)   As obvious as it is, I have to say I have  no  motivation for any type of weight-loss programs, exercise or dieting. It's bloody hard, if not impossible, to maintain an enthusiasm for the gym - which I don't particularly enjoy anyway - when I don't get any bloody results.   At the end of the day, what's the point? In order to lose weight I have to train like mad and eat like a bird (the amount, not the proportion) - a lifestyle I cannot maintain. As soon as I slip, I'm punished with extra kilos. Hello? Why do I even bother?

      I've been absent I know, sorry. I had my third month trials I had to go thru on my own. I think I'm OK now. I found my motivation again, it was hiding on www.expedia.co.uk website. I found it as I was looking at the hotel we're staying at in October. It also didn't help that Livi had a half-term, i.e. no school. Been a bit busy. Anyway, I weighted myself this morning. There had been weight gain in last couple of week, but now I'm back on track, I hope.

      Let me say that again:  Laura is a fat bastard.   I got up this morning and was completely unable to find any manner of clothing that doesn't dig into my skin and make me most uncomfortable. God damn it, I suppose I have to start some sort of home excercises again - going to the gym is just too much to bear after a day at work. I hate myself.

      It seems to me that Denmark is full of pregnant women at this time of the year. It's simply unbelievable - they're everywhere. Could it be, I wonder, that Danes are so law-abiding, such good citizens that when the government tells them to have more children in order to get more workers and tax payers into the country, they really go and baby-boom?  I've been to the zoo earlier today, and naturally the place is literally swarming with the little people. Buggies, double-buggies and kiddie-carts trample the unvigilant zoo-visitor, and if one doesn't keep a sharp eye out at knee-height, sticky hands and faces can, and will, leave sugary mementoes of the trip for the next laundry visit.   My experiences with children are largely composed of the occasional enthusiastic encounters with my nieces and nephews, and I'm convinced that they are all insane. A two-hour visit into my sister's house is simply the best contraceptive in the world. From what I've learned, children are easy to entertain, if you have enough energy; the tickle-torture will always get them coming back for more, and hanging them upside down and shaking always seems to be a hit.   I did the game called  Aunt Laura Practises Ju Jitsu Throws On Children  only once, since one of the little angels ran out and invited all the children from the yard to join the queue.   Funnily enough, my sisters both have multiple children, in spite of the fact that they both called me from the hospital after giving birth and said:  "Laura!  Never. Have. Children! "   I guess that explains a lot about the strength of the primal instincts to reproduce.  I used to be a magnet for all kinds of weirdoes - perhaps I'll share a story or two another time - but these days, it seems, I'm only attracting little sticky persons. I'm certain I don't encourage them. Just in the last two or three weeks, two little girls grasped my hand in absolute trust, and I had an almost-perilous encounter with a chocolate coated little Danish boy. I was in the front of the queue at the grocery store, when suddenly I realised that in the narrow space between the counters, a dreamy little devil ambled mindlessly towards me. He was between me and the till, and there was nowhere to run.  "If he touches me,"  I thought in growing terror,  "I will surely die."   Luckily a sharp command from the mother turned him from my path and I could reach towards the till safe from chocolatey horrors.   I won't swear I'll never have children, but I do feel I lack some kind of maternal supplement. Tiny helpless babies - at least, the human kind - don't make me go all gooey inside and I certainly have no enthusiasm for passing my defective genes on to some poor little bastard. Too many graphic descriptions of painful childbirths, things ripping up where they shouldn't be ripping, swollen body parts, milk-squirting, peeing when you sneeze, sleep-deprivation, depression, pains, aches, poop and other bodily fluids have been passed on to me in the past years.   Majority of my friends is starting to settle down now and even the most dedicated baby-hater is starting to long for a little hairless bundle to care for. It's strange, to say the least, but I suppose that's what long-term relationships do to women. I don't mind kids running around, in general, but I also like the option to exit stage left when the decibel levels get too much. I'm never surprised when stay-at-home-mums go a little wonky after a while.  They say that having a child changes your life completely, and it is the ‘best thing they never knew they always wanted'. I've no doubt that these statements are true, but for now, I prefer to stay as irresponsible and selfish as it suits me; children, at large, are beyond my comprehension. But I'm not unduly worried: there are about 6.5 billion people in the world doing their part in filling the earth; surely my contribution won't be missed.   * * *   Although otherwise common as muck,  Laura  claims the title of the Queen of Procrastination. She's also an expatriate Finn who spends most of the time inside her own head - out of which the words overflow on their own accord. Any resemblance to coherence is purely coincidental.

      "Getting out there" is a phrase I often use when asked "what would you be doing right now if you could". It means being away from so much urban chaos, and taking huge gulps of fresh clean air.  "Getting out there" is walking till my brain feels clear, my thoughts are free and unstilted, and my heart beats free of stress and daily struggle.  "Getting out there" is standing on Gara Rock, and taking in the broad sweep of the ocean and a glorious blue cloudless sky.  "Getting out there" is  pottering about the Salcombe estuary in mid-summer.   "Getting out there" is knowing what that bird call is, and waiting patiently for the little beauty to come into view.  "Getting out there" is lying in a hammock, forgeing dreams from clouds.  "Getting out there" is gasping at meteor showers in August.  "Getting out there" is sharing Larmer Tree with good friends  "Getting out there" is living.   * * *    Ian  is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority. He would secretly like to wear a cardigan and slippers. He thinks writing is the new black.

      It's happened to all of us. You meet someone, you hit it off, straight away. And then, you discover that this other person is already in a relationship.   It doesn't have to be a problem. After all, you've just met this person, you've managed well enough so far without knowing this person; chance encounters are all very nice, but you can do just as well without them, right?   Besides, that would be the "nice" thing to do. Anything else would be just interfering in something you have no business in, wouldn't it?  Recently, I discovered that someone I know has broken up with her boyfriend of several years. The reason? A friend she's gotten to know recently. I remember her telling about how he was in fact, just a friend, and that her boyfriend was okay with their hanging out.   So, apparently, not all of us try to be "nice", nor should we. After all, one, maybe selfish, reason I've had for "being nice" in the past, was that, if I were to meet someone, and be the reason for their break-up, it probably wouldn't benefit me. For one, the dumped party would recognize my part in what happened, with all the consequences thereof. For another, who says that this person would then choose for me? Her breaking up would all be great, of course, but if it's only because I'd created a sense of doubt, well, that wouldn't help me any further.  Someone else I know had a stable relationship with her boyfriend for years. And then she met someone else. They were just friends, at first. But feelings grew, fast, and the little seed of doubt grew quickly in the fertile soil of uncertainty. She ended up with neither of the two.  Does this then mean that it's okay to see if you can get a foothold? To continue to hang out with this person, and let things run?  Why not? After all, there's two sides to this equation. If you're hanging out with someone, there's either someone else, or you've got a second personality. And this other person is just as capable of ending the contact as you are, and would obviously have their reasons if they did.  After all, who likes to be in the situation of having to choose between two people? I wouldn't. Then again, I don't like choosing, period; I have trouble choosing which ice cream cone to get. But when choosing between two people, you're bound to hurt someone, whereas the ice cream just doesn't care.  So why do people put themselves in such situations? They don't choose to. It just happens. 'Letting it happen is a choice, too,' you might say. It is, if you know it's coming. Do you?   But that is pointing fingers. Which, after the fact, won't help anyone. And, when it comes down to it, is this situation not just the very essence of humanity? Always looking for the better deal.   * * *    Ivo  is a Dutchman, hoping to one day start writing and stop producing sorry attempts at it. In the meantime, he's a university student.

      A tiny corner of The Net's a-ruffle this week with the departure (again) of Peter at  urlLink Naked Blog .  I've done it myself so often now that I've actually lost count. It's a scary thing, this blogging. You start off as just another anonymous website. Post and forget. Then you get your first comment. A rush of excitement...  I have a reader! . You go into overdrive. You get more comments. You start to feel important. Somebody likes your stuff enough to come back for more. You're  validated .  You become obsessed with your stats.  Look at that! Another three regular readers this week!   You're convinced that what you're saying is seriously earth-shattering stuff. Why else would people come back, time and time again?  You really count!   After a while you start to get irritated. You pour an hour or more's effort into a witty and well-reasoned post. And nobody says anything. You do it again. Nothing.   You write a throwaway two-liner about your hoover blowing up, and your comment box fills up.   You begin to suspect that your readers are vacuous fools.  You start writing snotty stuff, to provoke a reaction. No comments, but your stats start to drop away.  You begin to seethe. The words  fuck it  occur with alarming frequency as you fire up Blogger to have a rant.  Then one day you think  enough's enough . You delete everything. You post a parting soapbox rant, and walk away. You spend a day or two checking your regulars for sorrowful postings about your inexplicable demise.   The liberation is amazing. No more playing to an audience. No more worries about stats. No more  I could blog that  thoughts are you're wandering round Sainsburys, or crossing the street, or stuck in a traffic jam.  After a week or two you begin to miss it. You wonder what on Earth posessed you to storm off like that. You feel like a pillock. You start to wish you hadn't jacked it in. But you made such a fuss of going that you can't just pile back in with a silly grin and expect people to carry on reading you. After all, you've probably just insulted half of them.  You resume blogging after another couple of weeks. Slink quietly back onto the stage, lurking in the wings. You don't announce anything. That would be too arrogant. You feel very very silly. But it's nice to be back.  Yeah, blogging does strange things to people.

      Some people like to talk about their health problems. It's like talking about the weather; something for your mouth to do while your brain goes on a holiday. I hate to gloat about mine; there is a certain type of person you never want to be associated with. If I do bemoan and bitch about my pains or discomforts, it means I really am in pain. In fact, I experience pain a lot. Most of it, I'm sure, is caused by  her.    "I have to leave early because of this stomach ache,"  she announces,  "My periods just ended yesterday!"     "I thought PMS happens before periods?"  Another colleague comments, and is cheerfully ignored.   She  is a colleague. Exotic and rare diseases, as well as common colds and aches, aren't a mere discomfort to her; they're her ticket to get a monthly salary for staying at home for most of the time. We don't mind... No, really. It's okay to lift her workload to get a few moments of silence in the office.     My frequent headaches must be caused by all that grinding of teeth.   "I have a terrible, terrible headache,"  she whines.      "Here, have a Paracetamol,"  I say.      "No, I really must go home. You don't mind, do you?"      Of course not.  My knees, back and stomach hurt. I suspect I'm getting an ulcer, and sometimes there's a pain in my chest which could either be heartburn or a prominent heart problem. The only thing I can think of is:  This shouldn't be happening! I haven’t even turned twenty-five yet!     "If I've been a little cranky the last two weeks,"  she confides in the early hours, while the office is still empty,  "I haven't been to the toilet for two weeks."     "Uh, been there,"  I mumble. Later on she excuses herself early to go home.      "The medication started working!"  She calls out as she rushes towards the parking lot.     I block out the uncalled-for images by drawing little hanged men to decorate the invoice I'm working on.   I'm very hard to cater for, because of my multiple allergies, but that's only one of the reasons why I tend to bring my own lunch to work.   "I have a yeast infection  down there, "  she says at the lunch table.  "So please understand if I'm a little annoyed."      I start to hum a little tune and stare fixedly out of the window.    As genetic heritage goes, I can look out for several types of cancer - cancer in the bone, in the breast, in the glands, in the lungs… No testicular cancer in my family, though. Go figure - it's the only one I  can't  get.   "I have a urine infection,"  she explains breathlessly,  "So I can't come in."      Two weeks pass.   There's adult diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, obesity, sleep apnea, asthma, depression. Rheumatism in at least two generations in my direct maternal line.      It can't be helped, I tell myself - I've been built out of scrap parts.    "It's a very rare neural infection,"  she explains as she detaches herself from any responsibility.  "It takes up to three or six months to heal!"      It's OK. I suffered from insomnia anyway so I fixed all problems with her accounts. Again.   My experiences with doctors simply discourage me to burst into the office of my GP and demand a proper examination.      My doctor in Finland had the reputation - and he certainly did this to me every time - of asking all female patients to remove their shirts regardless of the anatomical context of the examination; my doctor in Scotland diagnosed eczema as scabies and prescribed me with a head lice shampoo; the nutritional therapist I saw because of all the things I can’t eat advised me to "eat variably" - to mention but a few.      Besides, who knows what a full medical examination would find?   "Iieeawww,"  she intones with her nasal voice,  "I'm so bloated! Do you think I've gained weight?!"      I glance at her 100-pound figure and shrug non-committally.      "I'm going on a diet!!"   My current doctor has got a bona fide miracle cure - it's simply too wonderful for words. Depressed? Is your back hurting so that you've taken to sleeping on the floor? Have any problems with skin, eyes, blood pressure, stress? Are you a multiallergic trying to diet? Do you continuously fail to lose weight?    No problem,  my doctor says with confidence borne of never-had-to- diet-in-my-whole-life,  Lose weight!     "I have to leave early on Friday,"  she warns me when she returns from another sick day.      "Really."     "Yeah, I have a dentist’s appointment. The thingy ogg magg dooghd iggh e’e egg ogg, see? It’s really gross!"  She wipes her finger on the back of the chair.     I smile and nod. Only two more days and she’s changing jobs. I can feel that ulcer starting to heal already.

      It's very difficult to decide what to do with one's life. I mean, once one has figured out in general what one wants to do. The filling-in of blanks is so hard, takes such precision and thought. I despair of managing it, really, sometimes.   There was a time when I was young and had all kinds of ideas about how I could help others change the world. This period spanned from high school until about a year into my first marriage, and then the weight of an unhappy pairing, plus the general weight of my own depression, pulled me apart. I've come to see that period of time when I was busy pulling myself together, and then holding myself togther, as if it were a kind of temporary diversion from the real trajectory of my life.   But what that real trajectory is, I'm not really sure. I know that it has something to do with politics, though I am torn inside between direct action and something more arcane, something articulated in my writing.  I was telling my girlfriend tonight that I imagine myself writing a few works of philosophy, including one of moral philosophy and one of political philosophy. But I wonder what good such writing can really do? Within one's lifetime, very little, I am certain. And in a span of time longer than that, I am just as dubious.    After all, my ideas are nothing new, as of right now. Most expats would agree with me that the current American Administration is insane, for example. They'd laugh and note that the number of people who agree with Bush is, in proportion to the world, very small indeed.   But then again, for me the culture war of Right vs. Left has always seemed somewhat of a distraction from a far more crucial war that needs to be waged in the modern world (or is it postmodern now, or something else yet again?) is the war to pry apart business and state interests. Whomever I mention this to usually recieves it with a little surprise, but not at the idea itself; it's an obvious idea, really. The shock they express is at the size of the project. My girlfriend looked at me with wide eyes and asked me how I planned to bring that about. I told her frankly I had no idea beyond writing about it, and at this stage of the game, that so few people were consciously aware of the problem that it might be most important at this stage to be writing about it.  But will that make any difference? Who can know.   So then what is the point of writing about it? I suppose it's just that this is one thing I know I can do, one thing I can do well, and it's something I feel I need to do. Perhaps gut instinct is merely the purveyor of arrogance. But perhaps, as with a few instances in the past, my gut instinct is actually right this time.   And so I suppose I shall follow it, and write on all of this... provided I can get blogging out of my system and settle down to do some real work.   Or is this, what I have just written, part of that real work, too? Hmmm.    * * *    Gord Sellar  is a Canadian expatriate living and working in South Korea.

      I used to be incredibly anal about other people being late. I was always the one who was not only on time, but actually  early , and without fail, everyone else would aim for "ish". I remember one particular birthday where I sat alone in my reserved table in the pub for half an hour before anyone else showed up!   In the past, a lot of my friends have been from Latin countries - and we all know what their timekeeping culture is like - so I pretty much grew used to waiting. And waiting. And waiting... Also, as a rule, absolutely everyone has a larger social network than I do; so for them, if someone cancels on a plan, it isn't a big deal, because they can always call someone else. Whereas for me, making a plan with someone is always a special occasion, because, let's face it, I spend a whole lot of quality time in my own company.  Living in a given country as a foreigner gives an additional twist to this. It means that you're entering a society that's in its own way already complete. What I mean by that, is that the people, locals, that you will meet and make friends with already have a social circle around them, while you, the foreigner, actually start from a completely empty calendar. As a matter fact, I've learned that in Denmark they have a concept for a 'half-agreement,' which means that something can be agreed on, but - and I don't know the rules for this - it's not an  actual  agreement. You can probably see how this could cause some misunderstandings.  These days, I've improved drastically. I'm now so used to people cancelling on me that it doesn't bother at all anymore. In fact, I don't plan on plans at all. Plans are something that  may  happen, not an absolute inevitability. I've realised that it doesn't actually matter if the planned event doesn't happen today, because hey - it's not like I have any plans for any other day either. The biggest step towards being a relaxed person for me came from the realisation that I can actually arrive at the cinema  after  the pre-feature advertisements have begun, and  I'm not even stressed!  Whatever social arrangements I attend, I'm usually fashionably late. I hold absolutely no expectations on possible future events. I live a carefree life - if a friend cancels out on me, it doesn't mean that I'm losing out on something. Nope; I'm saving it up for later.

      I’m a hoarder, I admit it. I find it hard to throw stuff away. Junk that hasn’t done anything except gather dust for years is kept because “it might come in handy one day”. Tomorrow I will finally be getting rid of an old PC case – giving it to a mate. I’ve had it since 1997, and it hasn’t seen regular use for at least the last couple of years. But I couldn’t throw it away. Even when my mate said “have you got an old PC case that you don’t want any more?” I had to think long and hard before reluctantly answering “well, yes, as it happens, I have”.  Of course, I gutted it. I’m keeping the motherboard, poxy old graphics card, microscopic amount of memory (on SIMMs that are incompatible with everything made for at least the last five years). Even the floppy disk drive.  That’s only the tip of the iceberg.  I have a room full of old computers (“could come in handy”). The house is filled with  books (“I might read it again one day”). The shed is crammed to the rafters with old tins of paint (“just in case”). The kitchen cupboards are collapsing under the weight of old mugs and jars of seldom-used herbs & spices. The footwear in the cupboard under the stairs would put Imelda Marcos’ collection to shame. I still have an Inspiral Carpets teeshirt from the “Beast Inside” tour (1991).  And it’s best not to mention the contents of the attic.  But at least I’m not as sad as the weaving pillock who was texting himself on the way in to work today. How do I know he was texting himself? Because he had TWO PHONES. One in each hand. There he was, sauntering along, eyes flitting from one screen to the other, thumbs-a-flurry. One phone would beep away  da-da-da-daaa-daaa-da-da-da , then the other. Is this how people think, these days? I just witter away to myself in my head. Am I old fashioned?

      I was thinking about escapism today, and the various forms it manifests in. Personally, I spend a lot of time inside the world in my head, but I figure most people do. Where else would the unshakable optimism of the human race come from; the people who say "it'll turn out all right in the end" and actually believe that? Even if you're not one of these people, you still believe in abstract ideas such as justice and mercy, in hope, even. The truth is that bad things happen to good people. Bad things happen to bad people. Occasionally, good things happen to all kinds of people, whether they deserve it or not. In fact, shit happens.  People who  are  religious, might disagree with the above statement, and I won’t claim that they're wrong. I tend to create imaginary things around myself; compare the office block I work in to the Mount Doom in 'Lord of the Rings', for example, or have firm belief that if you walk to an opposing wind long enough, you will eventually push through to another dimension. Instead of the popular belief - 'God Created Man' - I believe in 'Man Created God'. I believe in mankind's need to believe in things; it's a comfort on dark, cold nights and allows you to have a Plexiglas of faith between yourself and the world.   Suppose you don't have to believe in justice and mercy and hope if you believe in God; after all, he encompasses all these things in a handy All-In-One package. At any rate, the effect is the same: there's something there for you to take the sting out of the world.   I don't have much faith; in God, in gods, or in other things. I  hope  like hell there's Justice, and that the people who are busy killing, murdering, torturing and raping will get what they deserve. I hope this is true no matter which church or mosque they go to. I hope there's a suitable end for people who sue fast food chains for making them obese, cigarette companies for giving them cancer and doctors for not prescribing penicillin. I especially hope that hypocrites who claim to follow the benevolent one and true and only god but are busy discriminating against different sex, sexuality, colour or religion  will  one day meet their god. And find that he's displeased.  In fact, I don't think you need a big, bearded man in the sky (or a foxy blue guy in a luscious garden, for that matter) in order to live a good life. I'm far from perfect, but I try live by a simple set of ideals. Whether I have a life after death or not I'm leaving up to providence.   The   Ten   Four   Commandments   Ideals of   Atheist   Agnostic   A Pretty Average Person   1) Don't hurt people, animals, nature or tourists 2) Know when to stop 3) Show respect 4) Say thank you

      It's unoriginal to write about writing. Hence, I'm not going to go on about the therapeutic qualities of writing (plentiful) or my reasons for writing things down (various). My problem is, aside from the lack of sparkling talent, obviously, that compared to the writers I read and admire in the blogging world - I'm talking about the mostly non-published hidden gems whose daily prose keeps me coming back to their online journals - I don't seem to have any experiences to draw from. In effect, I intent not to write so much about writing as I intent to write about life.   It's strange, really. You'd think that I, after leaving home at tender age of fifteen, and having changed country twice before I turned twenty-three, would have more anecdotes to draw from. I seem to be cursed with a level head - figuratively speaking - and a cautious approach to life which has condemned me to live my life like there was a tomorrow with consequences.   Unfortunately, this approach hasn't seemed to catch up with my finances (or lack thereof), nor has it ever cured me of procrastination. But then again, I never forget my keys, I never lose my wallet (except that one time when the gnomes hid it behind the sofa pillows) and it's frankly astonishing how I never, ever fall asleep on the train and end up in Sweden, where I get shanghaied on a cargo ship bound for Far East to smuggle Bengal Tigers to the private zoos of wealthy but mysterious Arabs. So I guess it can't all be bad.  When I was a teenager I constantly worried about ending up being the one who keeps her head in a crisis and ends up mother-goosing intoxicated friends out of potentially harmful situations. Instead, I turned out to become the one who manages to drink vast amounts of vodka and still smirk at the drunken stupor of everyone else from the sidelines and go home early.   An intellectual writer would then create prose based on the social behaviour of her friends; make cunning arguments over the sociological and biological aspects of alcohol in context of mating instincts. A bold writer would even take a political stand with sharp observation and go on a downright spittle-flecked rant about the state of the toilets. A true writer would have stayed in the party, made a complete arse of herself, gone home with some dubious character and written a sarcastic description of the consequences, including a graphic description of the hangover.  Truly brilliant writers, of course, don't have to go to parties at all; they make perfectly normal things sound exciting and give everyday life a whole new meaning. For instance; my life is wonderful (I wonder what I'm doing here), my job unbelievable (it's hard to believe I'm really doing this shit) and the pay fantastic (I fantasize about a pay rise). I suppose the conclusion is that with a little imagination and a way with words one doesn't, in fact, need to have a life at all. I feel so much better now.

      It's the middle of May. My nose is already beginning to do that strange twitching thing when I step outside. In another couple of weeks it'll start taking the law into its own hands. If I'm not attentive with the hanky it'll just sneeze whenever it wants. And then I'll know it's the Summer.  Don't get me wrong. I love the Summer nowadays, thanks to the miracle of Benadryl. But once upon a time it was just another reason for me to be grumpy.  Cricket is the invention of The Devil.  At my school it was a compulsory sport during the Summer months. Sport? Hah! What's sporting about standing in a newly-mown patch of grass, sneezing your tits off, rubbing your itchy eyes until they puff up to three times their normal size? What's fun about being stuck out as far away from the action (Action? What action?) as possible, because they know "he's the snotty one, better keep him out of the way". What's even remotely entertaining about seeing a cricket ball arcing towards your head while you're in mid-blow? Being hit by a spherical brick might raise a laugh or two from the opposite team, but does it provoke sympathy from your supposed team mates?   'Oi! Pogo! Leave your nose alone and catch the pigging ball next time, will you?'  Mutter mutter mutter. Did I pigging ask to be stuck in the pigging field in the first pigging place? Do I look even the remotest bit interested in this so-called "game"? No? Funny, that.  So anyway. Positive things about Summer. Blimey. Too many to mention, these days. Benadryl – already said that. Camping. Yeah – camping. The season's almost upon us. Break out the tent and the paracetamols, it's time to sit in a field and let the kids go ape while I drink far too much. Brilliant fun. Then there's the stargazing and satellite-spotting when it gets dark, to say nothing of the odd bit of nearly-outdoors-rumpo.  And of course, it's Festival season! Glastonbury! V! Reading! T! Might even make the effort to do Ashton Court again this year. Anticipated highlights of the season: Pixies reunion, Muse headlining, being somewhere else when Paul McCartney does his slot. Beer. Gear. Fun. Sun.   Can't wait!   * * *    Pogo (aka Goopy) is continually told to shut up by his long-suffering mates down the pub. Always opinionated yet rarely correct, he can't help sticking his oar in no matter what the subject. He has even been known to offer up opinions on football, about which he is supremely unqualified to speak.

      I've come to realise that leaving your home country for an extended period of time makes a kind of a patriot out of the best of us. I was born in Finland some twenty-five years ago and have been out of the country only a little over three. It seems that the first stage of expatriating is denial; distancing yourself from your home country and having as little to do with it as possible and cringing with shame if someone recognises your nationality, especially if it's someone who shares it with you. There are only a few things you pack with you and have your friends send over at every opportunity... Salmiakki (or salted liquorice). Proper bread. Cracker-bread or crispbread. Coffee.   After a little while, you start paying a little closer attention to the little differences, and grudgingly admit that, actually, it is pretty stupid to have two separate taps for hot and cold water, or to have to pay your bills by mailing actual checks - something that's not even an acceptable method of payment in Finland anymore. Online banking is actually an excellent idea, or failing that, machines, which are similar to ATMs, but are meant for  paying bills.  Smart!   Some time after than, you start looking into the ancient history of Finland; the bits that weren't taught to you in school. The old Finland has faded away so much that these days, no one can tell what the Finnish word  Suomi , for Finland, actually  means.  The modern history of Finland is uninteresting at best. Personally, I think the Finnish sense of nationality was stripped away in the last thousand years or so, when nothing interesting happened historically; the spit of land switched ownership between Sweden and Russia several times - something that simply doesn't give you a defined sense of nationality - and the only thing that makes you feel any kind of patriotism was the bit where Finland was called the 'bloody shield of Sweden', to be used in the war against the mighty Russia. Since the declaration of independence in 1917, Finland has remained carefully diplomatic towards any bigger and stronger countries - i.e. everyone else - and is quietly taking pride in that fact. But not too loudly, you understand.  The bits they don't teach in schools you learn from such suspicious authors as Robert Nelson, who wrote a book called 'Finnish Magic'. It's a great book for inflaming a sense of patriotic pride, but alas, it's also wildly inaccurate. It sticks to your mind, however. Finns have always been considered a little odd - quiet, short-worded, incredibly trusting, honest, drink-happy - so Nelson's claim that Finns were taken aboard Viking ships because they were believed to have magical powers; or that Finnish warriors were used as bodyguards as far as in the Byzantine empire... simply makes you feels as though there's something to being a Finn, after all. You realise that although a Christian country, Finns still remained pagan on the inside. All of this might be a load of pish-posh, but if it gives you a sense of pride on your roots - which by the way have never been really traced to their origins - then what's the harm?  The last stage of expatriating is when you become actively involved in the local Finnish society; you're on the mailing lists, attend the Finnish church at Christmas, Finnish bonfires at Midsummer and the Finnish First of May celebrations; go to the Finnish market, hang around with other Finns so you can speak the language and ditch the locals until your face turns blue. Personally, I haven't reached this stage yet, and by Ukko, I hope I never will.   Still; I don't want to move back to Finland, no matter how highly I may speak of it or how good a country it is for raising innocent, blue-eyed children. I know that after a few weeks, a month at best, I would remember the bad things: Finns are rude; they have a primitive alcohol culture; no manners of any description; no appreciation for other cultures; a highest suicide rate in the world and no wonder. No... I prefer to see the Finland as a nostalgic picture in my mind, portrayed like it is in the national hymn; a pure, blue and white country of untainted nature and a thousand bright blue lakes.   OK, I'm all finnished now.

      I need to learn to keep my big mouth shut... Or at least think before I open it... I mean, look where it landed me this time, writing on the bloody web! *sigh*  So, what does one write about? Life? Work? Footie? Men? Or just utter nonsense? I think I'll go for the latter; I'm not the Queen on Nonsense for nothing. I take great pride, I'll have you know, in being able to start a conversation out of complete nonsense. My philosophy is that you should never dismiss any information you get, you never know when it might come in handy. Or who you can use it on...   For example, did you know that the humble  Cashew nut is an impostor ?   Well, did you?  He is in fact a  seed  (wait, maybe it was a pip...?), not a nut. This fact has brought sheer joy to my sister, who suffers from nut allergy, and can now eat nuts. Sort of, anyway.   Elbows  - It is impossible to lick your own elbow. Trust me on this one, it has been tried and tested with and without alcohol intake. On numerous occasion in fact.   Spiders  - This one I found out myself, by accident. When a spider, drowns in a hot bath (read: gets boiled alive), he poops out his webbing. Not literately, of course, but that's what it looks like. How weird is that?!  Hey, this might actually be a good thing! This writing stuff I mean. I can go on and on about whatever takes my fancy and it doesn't matter whether it's making sense or not, I can jump from subject to subject; in fact,  I CAN SAY WHAT I LIKE  because there is nobody to interrupt me or tell me to shut up! Mwahaha mwahahaaaa...  There's a thought actually. It might be good for my friends and colleagues at least, this writing malarkey, but maybe not for the plants as they might now die due to lack of stories. Unless the cats get to them first.   Why is that, anyway? Why do cats go for the nicest houseplant that you have in the house? They totally demolish it and then puke it up. Doesn't matter where you put it, they damn right find it. They don't go for the one that's already half dead, oh no, it needs to be the one that was bought new in the shop that day. I love my two cats dearly but I wish they could leave the plants alone. I spend more money on plants than I do on them! Will have to invest in Cacti soon. And don't tell me just to give up on the plants, because I won't. I was brought up in a household surrounded by plants and it always gave the house a nice and homely feel.  You know, I even bought some cat grass to grow... Figured that with the grass they would leave the plants alone.  Did they heck!  They didn't go anywhere near the bloody grass. Gave it one wee sniff and that was that. Choosy wee Buggers...   * * *     Micki  is the aforementioned lady who got Laura to start this project in the first place.

      I guess I should start from the beginning. I got introduced to online chatrooms (remember The Park?) when I was an art student, and I simply haven't looked back ever since. I was one of the first people I knew who had an e-mail address. Then I had a personal website at Geocities (remember Geocities?). At that time, the addresses were something like  http://www.freewebsites.com/members/Area51/784326473/~kewlcyberhome/index.html , which is probably why personal websites remained largely just that – personal. It was only a matter of time to graduate into to a Napster (remember Napster?), ICQ, AIM, MSN and Yahoo messenger user.   As with most people, I got introduced to blogging by a friend. Since then, I'm writing or participating in no less than  five  weblogs and barely a thought passes my mind without it being subjected to the blogger's scrutiny:  Is it interesting? Is it funny? Can it be published in my next post? Can I build a whole post around this thought?  I've even attempted blogging via my mobile phone – and with the new e-mail blogging feature it's actually a feasible project – and I in turn have introduced most people I know to web logs, although not that pick the habit themselves.  These days, I've toned down the excessive usage – I only have a couple of e-mail addresses and mainly use MSN messenger to keep in touch with friends and family – except when it comes to updating my blogs. I don't have much going for me in the career department, and earlier today I was on the subject to one of my friends, who's convinced that I have literary talent and something to say; she suggested that I should start writing a column for a newspaper. My reaction was that of immediate denial, but because I'm, of course, tickled by the idea that someone thinks my ramblings are worth reading, and because I actually enjoy writing and have wondered whether I could withstand the pressure of so-called serious writing – I could go on – I decided that I will take up the challenge.  "Tell you what, I'll start a new blog as an experiment to see if I can write a regular 500+ words in column format," I said. "Yeah, why not!" "And then I'll recruit you as a guest columnist." "Erm..."  I used to work with the lady, and in the office we used to joke that she's not allowed to speak at home because at work you simply cannot get a word in when she gets up to speed on a subject. I dare say she will have a thing or two to say.  So, this web log isn't really a blog in the sense that I understand the word. It's a project, an experiment, and it's my twisted little plot to try and get more of my friends on the web. My ambitious plan is not only to test my own capacity, but also have guest columns from friends and family who wouldn't normally write things. I think it's a great idea. I admit that I lured you in with false advertisement; I have no intention to quit or cut down on blogging – I want to spread the love!  Come on. Write a column. Go on.  I dare you.

      My daughter was telling me last night about how she thinks the world is a bad place. She thinks there are too many "silly rules". She doesn't like seeing stories on the news about people being killed. She thinks people are cruel to animals.  Having just arrived back from Glastonbury I found myself in the unusual position of telling her that, in my opinion, it's not such a bad place after all. That's not something I'd normally be heard to say. I agree with her on all points - our Government is interfering too much in our lives, the world's only superpower has embarked on an empire-building drive citing morals as justificaion, and McFood is busy torturefarming and slavedriving.  But...  Spend a weekend in a muddy part of Somerset and you see a totally different side to humanity. The fun side. The alive side. The side that - temporarily, at least - escapes from The System and gets in touch with the other 80% of the brain. The subconscious. The bit that tells you what's really right and wrong.  Three days of watching people do something they love, joining in, jumping up and down with the sheer bloody joy of it all. Singing along with sixty thousand others to the words of a song you didn't even know you knew. Smiling in spite of it all. Helpless with happiness.  Moments like those are priceless. If you've never experienced one -  do so at least once in your life . Otherwise you won't know what it is to be really  alive .

      I was coming home from work earlier this week when a boy sat next to me in the bus; he was dressed in a neat white collar shirt and straight black trousers; I think I knew what he was even before he started talking. Earlier in life I would have been intimidated by someone who wanted to talk about something very personal to me, but this boy radiated such innocence and calm that I was intrigued to continue the conversation.  I was almost sorry when I had to get off at my stop.   He asked me a set of questions - do I believe in God? What is the purpose of life? Have I ever seeked a meaning to my existence or looked for God? Have I ever tried talking to God? Spirituality or faith are nobody else's business, so I regretted that we were in a crowded bus instead of somewhere more appropriate for such a conversation.   I told him that for now, I've settled for 'quiet disbelief' and he repeated the words after me, seemed to be amused or amazed at the thought - maybe just the choice of words.   My problem with God, gods, faith, or spirituality is not the actual ideas, but with the institutionalising of them. When things get written down they become inflexible – in the hearts and minds of men they start to represent an absolute truth; something solid and unchangeable. In my heart I know this is  not  what religion should be about.  And yet, don't get me wrong; religion can be the saviour the church would have you believe it is – my own step-brother was what you could call a lost soul before he found God. He's now a priest, and happily married; I haven't spoken to him for a long time, but I have the feeling that he is happy and at peace with the world and that can only be a good thing.  While I was talking to this golden-haired, befreckled boy in the bus, I felt that he was indeed a 'child at heart' in the sense the Bible teaches, and it was truly a beautiful thing.   And yet I couldn't help but wonder if his faith was coming from the heart; or whether he was just living by a book, taught to him by his church and his family. Did he come to this faith by truly finding a god, or merely by external initiation? What made him leave home to come to Denmark to share the message of his Lord, Jesus Christ the Saviour?  These days people tend to forget how important it is to have a dialogue with representatives of different ideologies; people who have their heart open for a discussion without trying to sell their ideals to you; people who believe in what they feel is true, even when it is completely different to what you believe. The key to peace is not in agreement, but in understanding.   I'm not sure if the encounter with the missionary was a random one; it set me thinking about spirituality and the things I actually do believe in. In a way, his mission was successful, even if my conclusion wasn't the one he was hoping for.  Do I believe in God? No.  I don't believe that there is a conscious entity of divine proportions out there who has capacity for love and judgement.   My own spirituality – though still fragile – is based on what my own heart has experienced. I would say I believe in the capacity of the common person to live in harmony with their surroundings and accomplish happiness not through achievements but through personal evolution. But those are just fancy words for saying  'I believe in life.'    * * *   Although otherwise common as muck,  Laura  claims the title of the Queen of Procrastination. She's also an expatriate Finn who spends most of the time inside her own head - out of which the words overflow on their own accord. Any resemblance to coherence is therefore purely coincidental.

      "We were driving to the beach yesterday ( sunday ) , I had a terrible hangover, L was suffering a gall-bladder attack, I was pissed off because I had smashed the side of the car the day before, a road was cut off so we had to take the motorway past the airport,  there was a huge traffic backlog towards the sea and I was gagging for a beer and some food. D was crying in the back seat and the world seemed a pretty horrible place.  It was then, just as I felt really sorry for myself, that an ambulance and two police motorbikes sped past and L and I looked at each other in a quite ashamed way as we had been griping and moaning about our bad day. By time we reached the site of the accident it became apparent that things were grim. Several motorbikes and a van were involved and i saw at least one person who hadn´t survived.   I cried quietly beneath my sunglasses as L distracted E to look through the other side window.  When I reached the sea and greeted my friends I spent a few minutes with my can of Amstel in hand remembering that age old wisdom - someone somewhere is always having a worse day than you.  Is that sad, or reassuring? I don´t know, I suppose it depends on the space you are in when you think about it. But it is , for sure, an eternal and universal truth."   * * *    Ian is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority.

      Life in California was good. We had a small and happy group of friends. Pete and Alice in particular were an interesting couple; and we spent a lot of time with them.  Pete was a Vietnam veteran, and had a law firm. Rhona and I helped out here and there. The offices were situated just adjacent to the Transamerica building; and boasted English phone-boxes and Penny Farthings on the walls. Pete could often be seen roaring around the city on his vintage English motorcycle.  Alice was a writer, and knew all the city faces. She invited us to lots of parties at her apartment on Nob Hill. She'd written several articles and a book on the effects of advertising and celebrity culture on young women; and was in demand with the tv and radio companies.  Rhona and I would often spend the weekend away with them, happily cruising along the coast in Pete's boat. The California coast is quite stunning in places, and I still remember it with clarity.  One weekend in May we had a phone call from Pete; incoherently trying to explain that someone had died. He was drunk, and it was 11 in the morning. We rushed round to his office, to find him asleep in a lounger on the sun-roof. We managed to drag him to the shower and drenched him in cool water. He began to rouse and very quickly was a sobbing, heaving mess. He told us in between huge intakes of breath that Alice was dead. She'd been found in her apartment. Alice had been brutally murdered.  In the following weeks, Pete withdrew from life. His business almost collapsed; and survived because friends and colleagues across the city helped out while he imploded. Pete became an "almost" person, secluded in his apartment over at Candlestick Park. His hair grew, he lost interest in his life-long pursuits.  Eventually a man was arrested. The court case followed. The man was bailed. 3 weeks later the man was found shot dead at his front door.With no other evidence and no other suspect, the case was wound down.  Those of us who knew Alice began to grieve again; was there to be no justice for the snuffing out of such a gifted and special life?  Pete gradually began to venture out from his isolation.He sold his apartment and bought a house in Sausalito, by the bay.We were happy to be invited there for dinner; and sat late into the night reminiscing about Alice, and all that she'd meant to us.  At the end of the evening, we hugged and kissed as we said goodbye. I told Pete I was looking forward to roaring down Route 1 on the bikes with him again.He smiled and said faintly "I think i'll be giving up the bike soon..getting a tad old for that".  A few months went by. We saw Pete less and less; and he seemed to almost be avoiding our company.Friends told us that they too had seen little of him, and rarely had he returned calls.  The following Spring, I heard that Pete had sold the business and his house.He'd moved across the country to a village in New York State.We wrote and rang a few times, with no reply. We heard from a mutual acquaintance that Pete was now living alone in the sticks, growing his own food and living off savings.   In late September I received a call from the Sullivan County Police Department. Pete had walked into the department and confessed to the shooting of Alice's killer.   Pete had followed this coke-dealing murderer home one night; and shot him once in the head and once in the chest.  Now, Pete is in prison. He writes to me here in England, and says I must come out to New York when I can.I plan to be there when he's released.   Meanwhile, I'm searching New York State for vintage English motorcycles.

      All this teary-eyed snuffling over Bonzo's recent exit-stage-right got me thinking about those heady days.  I can look back and laugh about it now.   When I was a spotty schoolkid back in the late 70s/early 80s I was convinced I'd be dead by the year 2000. Most of us were. It seemed that barely a week could go by without a mushroom cloud appearing on the telly or in the papers. They were everywhere. One of the icons of the era. By 1980 the Government was showing a series of films on the telly -  Protect And Survive .   How we laughed. In horror. The very idea of unscrewing your doors and leaning them up against a wall to build yourself a makeshift fallout shelter seemed ludicrous. Painting your windows white would keep out the beta rays. Marvellous. But what about those gamma rays? The ones that slowly fry you from inside? All us schoolkids knew gamma rays could worm their way through several feet of concrete. Ghouls, we were.  Looking back at it, there was little the Government could do to reassure us. We lived 40-odd miles away from the Sellafield nuclear plant (a.k.a. "Windscales"). We all knew that the stuff they produced there was weapons grade - sure, as a by-product they were hooked into the National Grid and they provided electricity. But the plant was there to make weapons material. It'd be a direct target. We were probably doomed.  Ronald Regan became US President. We were definitely doomed. Within seconds he was over here, lecturing us about an "Evil Empire".  Luckily we had a bit of light relief from all this nuclear doom and gloom. A good old fashioned conventional war down in the South Atlantic. Stirring images of good old British Tommies yomping over mountains filled the screens. Daily reports from the first Embedded Reporter, Brian Hanrahan, crowed out of telly speakers. "I counted them all out, and I counted them all back again". Maggie told us to "Rejoice".   Then I went to college. By the time I'd sobered up the USSR had gone through a couple of new Chairmen in quick succession and suddenly we had this nice mild-mannered  smiling  bloke in charge, talking about "restructuring" and "openness". I liked him. Reagan started doing silly instead of scary things. He inspired The Ramones to write  Bonzo Goes To Bitburg , so surely things were looking up. My fears evaporated.   So last night it was quite moving to see Mikhail Gorbachev paying his last respects. His face, paradoxically, reminds me of a time when the world was starting to look like a nice place.   What happened?   * * *    Pogo is continually told to shut up by his long-suffering mates down the pub.

      I'm teetering at a brink of a big white scary  something.  I know there's a change underway, one of those big fat ones that change your life around from inside out. I'm increasingly aware of it as time goes by; it's almost like watching a continent move - you're not sure it moves at all, but when you look back in a few million years, it's suddenly all different.  Suddenly I'm tired of analysing everything to death.   My priorities are changing.   I'm still frustrated with my life and my job, but there's a shade of a difference; instead of falling into despair and utter hopelessness, I'm realising that I can't see beyond the choices I make daily at work. I've been so caught up in the emotion that I haven't noticed how I've been making my problems bigger and meaner than they are in reality.   I tend to preach to others of the power of  letting go,  but am myself afraid of doing just that. Fear of failure as well as stupidly holding on to pride has been my downfall so far. It's time for me to learn something about humility, and as my perspectives are sliding into a whole new angle, it doesn't seem like such a horrible deal.   A friend of mine quoted a French saying to me recently; she said that you have to hit the bottom first so that you can push with your feet to get back to the surface. I've hit that bottom now and it's pretty solid under my feet: I'm ready to move with a purpose.   I have, in the simplest of terms, had enough.   There are plans to be drawn, arms to take, worlds to conquer. It's also come the time to enjoy the summer and do myself a favour or two: take time to sit in the sun; sleep with my window open; eat strawberries with ice cream; laugh for no particular reason; invite friends over for pancakes. Most importantly, it's time to take care of myself and to live a little.  What's the worst that could happen?   * * *   Although otherwise common as muck,  Laura  claims the title of the Queen of Procrastination.

      So here I am, at Salisbury train station on a miserable Sunday afternoon. Should be home by 6pm..  Ksssshhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! We regret to inform you that the 3.27 from platform 2 will terminate at Andover....from there a coach service will be provided to transport you to Basingstoke where you will transfer to kssssshhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! another coach on to Woking where normal ksssssshhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! will be resumed.  Oh god bless me and save me from another Sunday afternoon, courtesy of our wonderful rail services.  Andover welcomes us with a sarcastic crack of thunder, and the heavens drench us again as we disembark into the gloomy, drizzly and windswept carpark.Two coaches await, and there is fairly polite jostling for position in the queue.  Foolishly, I'm heartened by the good humour of my fellow victims. Then we see him; the driver. Certainly of pensionable age, large of gut, red of face and possessed of an unnerving squint. Someone asks him : "How long 'til we arrive at Basingstoke?",.. he smiles crookedly and shouts "Well we ain't even left yet 'ave we love?!" .. We; the ticket purchasing public are not impressed by this, and shuffle uncertainly but uncomplaining onto the coach.  We eventually weave our way through the industrial nether regions of the town and find our way onto the A303 North, and I'm a little concerned that the driver seems heavy on the brakes at times.  I have fond memories of the old A303, strangely enough. It's the main route north and south out of my home town , and reminds me of all the favourite journeys I've made in my 42 years.  I trudged up here on the way to a school friends farm, so that we could nick his dads shotgun and blow the living daylights out of innocent furry creatures. We raced bastardised motorbikes in the field which ran alongside; hoping to beat the posers in their souped up Ford Capri's, and the lorry drivers who grinned and flicked the V's. I hitched to Heathrow along here when I first left the country, and screamed the guts out of my Honda 90 (oh god, how embarrassing) on my way to see my first proper girlfriend; a wonderful young lady who with verve and gusto relieved me of my innocence - startling a new-born foal in the paddock behind the garden shed.   So here I am, sitting at the front of the coach - not asleep, but enjoying these memories when there's a jolt. I look up and can see the back of the drivers head in front of me. He appears to be peering around a corner, only I can't see it because the front windscreen is completely steamed up! I realise that he's fallen asleep, and the coach is veering towards the ditch to our left.I scream and bash the back of his seat, he sits bolt upright and slams his foot on the brakes and we all lurch forward like it's a nightmare big dipper.The coach skids and slides along the slick road surface and once again my life flashes (much quicker this time) before me. We come to a dead stop, and for a moment there is complete silence. There is mumbling and shuffling, and retrieving of belongings from the floor of the coach and other people's laps. The driver coughs and standing up says " I'm very sorry about that folks, terrible conditions out there", and restarts the engine.  Not one person speaks but one old lady who says quietly from the back "I'm going to write to my MP about this".  It is 8.30 pm by the time I arrive at my local station, and my marvellous wife picks me up.   Have I since complained to South West Trains? Guess..    * * *     Ian  is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority. He would secretly like to wear a cardigan and slippers.

      Last weekend I managed to ruin my very nice and very expensive pair of suede Campers.  I absolutely hate cleaning shoes. I guess this goes back to the Sunday evening ritual my parents enforced; whereby we had to ensure that all our school kit was clean and ready for Monday morning. Deep joy.  Anyway - suffice to say that all week I've been wearing substitute shoes that should have been donated to charity during the great shoe famine of 1912. Alternatively, they'd have made a very nice home for a family of disenfranchised voles, or something.  Now my right little toe is forcing me to adopt the gait of a 90 year old Sherpa, and something of the grimace frequently worn by those brave (but foolish) heroes seen in Sunday supplement pictures.   I'm expecting Chris Bonnington to make me an offer I can't refuse.   * * *     Ian  is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority.

      With the Euro elections fast approaching Auntie Beeb's been trying to draw attention to the fact by showing "special reports". They've been following the party leaders round the country. This apparently is to give each of them a chance to deliver their message... well, the only message I've picked up so far is that nobody is very interested in any of it.  Small wonder. None of the parties really seem to have a message in the first place. The Tory leader just looks smug, the LibDem looks a bit out of it, and The Liar himself is just looking for more opportunities to flash his famous plastic smile.   Political messages? None whatsoever.  Voter interest? Ditto.  A few people have attempted to call the politicians in on Iraq but they've been brushed off by platitudes issued as the politician strides away. Call that campaigning? Call that "taking the message to the people"? If the message is "we don't want to talk about embarrassing stuff" then they're doing a good job.  Don't any of our politicans know how to  debate  any more? With real people? Don't they know how to deal with an unpredictable agenda? If not, they shouldn't be in the job...  In the meantime we have  huge  billboards all over the place from the UK Independence Party:  Say No To European Union .  Indeed? And why should we do that, then? What's so bad about being part of a larger Eurostate? The UK can't survive on its own any more (arguably, it never did - it just exploited a subservient Empire).   The alternative is tacit annexation by the USA.   George Bush, for all the "monkey" jibes hurled his way, has skillfully manipulated the UK into pissing off the majority of our natural ideological allies. We have far more in common historically with the nations of the EU than we have with the USA - the USA was built on the premise of "freedom for the individual" (ie "sink or swim"), whereas Europe has a strong socialist tendency. Our loyalties should lie within Europe.  A European superstate is the only viable way of exerting influence on the USA - a superpower that has begun to lose its way, and dangerously so.   We need Europe as much as it needs us.     * * *    Pogo  is continually told to shut up by his long-suffering mates down the pub.

      It's 4.30am. Why the bloody hell am I sitting at this machine, when I could be in lovely duvet land?  At 4am my eyes opened, and I was wide awake. Awake as an awake person who's really quite awake.  S and I spent the last 3 days in Sussex; and I slept for England. V nice just to lie around reading and snoozing, and having the occasional stroll on the beach.  It would be ok if there was something significant on my mind. Instead, these are some of the thoughts which forced me out of bed and into this chair:  "Black or blue shirt today?"   "I wonder how many lamp posts there are in our street"  "Think I'll only buy a packet of ten ciggies today".   So you can see what an interesting and dynamic life I've been living this week can't you? I mean, how could you possibly get a good nights kip with issues of such magnitude on your mind?  Must be off now, got to weigh the fluff in the tumble dryer...   * * *    Ian  is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority.

      Don't EVER make plans... not even for fun. You'll never win! I know - NEVER is a tough word to use... not supposed to use the word, without touching wood, clapping a bald guy, pulling a red haired girls hair and so on, but it is said so...  Even if you pinpoint your plan down to minutes, hours, milliseconds... give it up! SOMEONE or SOMETHING, will always find its way into your nicely structured little plan and screw it up... I've been killing myself lately, with this self-study thing and it means that I have no teacher and no classes to attend to. 'Aha', most people would think. 'how nice', 'It means you have loads of time to structure your studying'. Bullshit (sorry I'm infesting this nice blog with swearing)!  I've been making a foolproof timetable, with what time to read, what time to study the text closely, what time and minute to do my notes, and when to finish it all... Juuuust didn't count in, that:   - I live 5 meters from a kindergarten: Noiselevel = HUGE - I live 10 meters from a school: Noiselevel = TREMENDOUS - I live next to an Enrique Iglesias-loving old hag, who's 60 and thinks and acts like she's 16 (or maybe she's trying to hint out something to my Spanish BF???): Noiselevel = Abnormally high (the whole block can hear Enrique 'Bailar') - I live 2 floors UNDER and opposite a neighbour who feels like oh, lets say, just for FUN to polish his wooden floors with a huge ACME 3000-machine. Noiselevel = Annoyingly high - I live RIGHT BELOW an insanely demented woman and her immensely retarded boyfriend (There's so much negative stuff about this couple that I have to make a separate blog to these... they are just so unbelievable), that all the cotton in the world wouldn't make up for the sound they're producing. Oh, no, it's not that 10 sec. Lovemaking sounds... it's the bloody CLAMPETYCLAMP sound coming from they 500 kilo bodies, and they're neanderthalway of walking... Never have I heard people walk so LOUD, the loud vibrations penetrates our floor and goes straight into my little ears... they walk with their heels. Most strange thing is, they keep this going for HOURS, in a 58 Sqm flat! Do they have the closet to Narnia?? Some strange extension to another flat I haven't heard of??? Are they on straight Caffeine??? Who walks for 2-3 hours straight every night in a 58 Sqm flat?? (I'm so baffled about this, that I have to ask again!) I know I sound winy, but I have been putting up with this for 4 years - have been taking action - no reaction!... (definitely HAVE to make that extra blog about them)  Noiselevel = Outrageously, clampetyclampstabbingly, earpenetrating, cardiovascularmeltdownmenacingly LOUD! - I suffer from sudden sleep disorder... Suddenly I get sleepy! What to do? Can't just skip my plan because I'm sleepy - I also suffer from Sudden hunger disorder: Suddenly I get hungry - and outside my timetable...! Doesn't fit with the from "12.15-12.50: read" plan... doesn't give a damn... when my stomach is hungry - it's REALLY hungry - and food is the only thing which calms it... just like a baby. How does one plan this?  My nerves are suffering from this, I'm definitely not made for shutting in my opinion and anger... I'm Latin... where's my temper when I need it??? That temper that makes you forget who you are, where and what you're doing (and are wearing) and just speak up your mind. (Who cloned me and removed my precious Temperament??)  I shake every time I just THINK about going up there and yelling, like I'm demanding my freedom back... (Oh, definitely HAVE to make a blog about this)  Starting to get hear murmurs, and I've beginning to hear a small voice lately, not sure where it comes from? Is that stress?? From anger? And I looove structure, and make it well... just not plans... not my plan, and I hate Forrest Gump for his 'Life is like a box of Chocolate... yadidadida'... just like plans; You never know what you're going to get!  Maybe Life's trying to tell me to be more spontaneous... well, I am... more than one needs to be... (don't mix it with Temper)... but I so desperately want my plan to work. I can't include every single variable. No can't do. No-one can!  So conclude this: Plans are like statistics and economical analysis: BULL!!

       Yesterday...  All my troubles seemed so far away...  Now it looks as if they're  Here to stay...     Just over three weeks ago I caught myself singing along to this. Which was surprising, considering I've never had a copy of it on tape, CD, LP, EP, single, or MP3 (did I miss any other formats?).    A few days later my boss told me he had skin cancer. The jury was still out (it still is, come to think of it) on whether or not it was malignant. He wasn't worried - outwardly. I don't know him anything like well enough to be able to tell whether or not he's quietly fretting away to himself.     Sure as shit, if it were me, I'd be bricking it.    But it isn't. All I have to worry about is a slightly snotty nose today. Nothing else merits the label "worry" - well, let's face it, a snotty nose isn't something to worry about either, is it?    These are the moments to cherish.     You never know if today is going to be tomorrow's "yesterday"...        Pogo is continually told to shut up by his long-suffering mates down the pub. Always opinionated yet rarely correct, he can't help sticking his oar in no matter what the subject. He has even been known to offer up opinions on Time, about which he is supremely unqualified to speak.

      One late night - or early morning, before sunrise - I lay awake in bed in the summer house and listened. It was silent both inside and outside the house, except for the scraping inside the wall which must have been a mouse. Outside, only the trees were rustling a little in the wind, and water was dripping from the drainpipe. It was probably just sleep creeping up on me, but I felt a strange sense of peace descend.    As I woke up with the birds again at sunrise - which happens at around four in the morning – burying my head under a pillow to block out the persistent bird-song, I was reminded of one Christmas holiday at the summer house. In winter-time, there are barely any sounds, except that which you bring with you. The creaking of the snow under your foot. Swish and rustle of your winter-wear. Sound of your breath and the inevitable sniffing of runny nose. Nature is asleep, except for the ice, which cracks and creaks as it expands in the cold.     (My sister’s husband, a Londoner, used to be scared of the absence of sound in the depths of the Finnish winter. Even in the quiet parts of London, there’s always a hum of traffic in the background.)    When I came back to the city after my couple of weeks at the summer house, I missed the silence dearly. In the quietude of nature, other sounds become pronounced, and they leave a long-lasting imprint into your mind.    Swan-calls echoing around the lake, giant wings beating the water and air to get airborne;     Fire crackling in the fire-pit, a hiss as the charred wood-pile collapses into glowing embers; grill-sausage sizzling on the metal grate; the  eeeeeeeeeeeee  of the mosquito which bypasses brain entirely and goes directly to the primal instincts and promotes terror;    Water lapping against the pier; pen whispering against the paper; shrill whistle of sparrows hunting insects; indistinct sound of my mother talking on top of the hill;    Trees rustling in the wind; sound of wood-chopping from across the lake; cows mooing on a distant farm in the evening; dog barking; Formula-1 sound of a beetle flying past your ear;    Startled birds escaping the vegetable patch in the pre-dawn glow, protesting loudly at the early outhouse-seeker; father coughing in his sleep inside the house; flies buzzing at the compost heap;    Creak of the rocking chair (significantly louder since the grandchildren broke one of the legs); rain drumming the roof; clatter of dishes; melancholy Finnish tango on the radio.     Sigh.     As I'm writing this in the office, I can see the forest outside, but I can't hear it. There are machines and trucks outside making a lot of noise. Somewhere, a plane is taking off. In the background, people are talking. The sound of typing is prominent in the small room. I turn the radio on louder, kick off my sandals, lean back and dig my toes into the carpet, imagining a field of grass. Inevitably, the taste of past holidays lose potency like the four-leaf clover I saved between the pages of a thick book. But, for the moment, it lingers.          Although otherwise common as muck,   Laura   claims the title of the Queen of Procrastination. She's also an expatriate Finn who spends most of the time inside her own head - out of which the words overflow on their own accord. Any resemblance to coherence is therefore purely coincidental.

      My home town is growing at an alarming rate.   This place was once a peaceful village; a mile and a quarter from Stonehenge, and just at the eastern end of the Woodford valley.  As children, we would disappear into the fields for hours, exploring old buildings,especially the closed railway station, and sit at the end of Boscombe Down airforce runway, shrieking as giant transporter planes roared a hundred feet overhead. I remember spending hours watching Vulcan bombers fill the sky with noise and their giant foreboding shape. The walk home across the fields was beautiful at sunset; owls swooping silent and low over the corn, and deer dashing off as we rounded the edge of the field and made our way through the coppice on the brow of the hill.  The village would erupt into colour each spring; the woods and riverside absolutely teeming with wildlife. We would spend hours down there, hunting for crayfish and seeing who could spot the big Pike lurking under the bridge at Ham Hatches. It was said that a boy was once pulled under by this fearsome fish; which was  "at least a hundred years old".   My grandfather, bless him, was in his 70's and still cycling around the village, tending gardens and stopping off at The Greyhound for his pint of ale on his way home. He'd meet his friends on Sunday mornings,and sit watching the world go by on the solitary bench by the post office. They'd swap stories; some true, some like the story of a certain large fish.  I remember when the new 'A' road was carved through here. To me at nine years of age, the hulking Caterpillar diggers and loaders were awesome: bright yellow monsters hauling tons of Wiltshire chalk and clay out of the ground, and grumbling along the tracks with their massive wheels. One rainy afternoon,I had to be pulled from deep mud on the site, having tempted my friend J there to see the behemothic engines.  One of my favourite views in the world is the sight from the top of the Beacon Hill, as I look down and see the village surrounded by green fields and ancient woodland, burial mounds, and trackways used for thousands of years.  Now villagers, conservationists and heritage types are battling it out over the merits of routeing this road through a tunnel to protect the five thousand year old monument.Huge retail and trade parks are springing up and scarring the landscape. The village is now a bustling town; populated by forces families, business park workers and a small number of people who still work on the land and surrounding country estates.  The flea-pit has gone. Grandpa's bench is no longer.    "Progress",  they say.  As for the Pike, he still lives on; being at least one hundred and thirty years of age by now. I still pass by the bridge; and peer down amongst the reeds, hoping to catch a glimpse as he lurks there.   ***    Ian is of a certain age when dealing with ear-hair can seem too much of a priority. He would secretly like to wear a cardigan and slippers. He thinks writing is the new black.

      I just got semi-spammed.  Spammed , as in it's unsolicited email containing an offer I can easily refuse.  Semi  as in the culprit was Apple Computer, and I probably didn't tick the little  don't spam me  box when I ordered something from their online store recently.  The untempting offer, in exquisite HTML with glinting graphics customary of all things Apple, was entitled £15* Off Your Next Order   over £149* or more.    That little  *  was the killer. Searching the uberglossy I eventually found it hidden away in a tiny font with matching camouflage colouring:  * Price and saving are exclusive of VAT and exclusive 			of delivery of charge.   Dodgy grammar notwithstanding, the * was enough to make me reach for the DELETE button.  Things marked with little stars are Not Worth The Effort. Occasionally, the cynic in me needs a breather and it lets my optimistic side take control, but it's always given a thorough  I told you so! -ing pretty soon afterwards. At these moments I am usually left wondering  does anyone actually bother with these "offers"?   We recently went through all the palaver of re-mortgaging the house. The usual world-weariness crept over me as Tuther first mentioned the idea.  It won't be worth the effort in the end, you'll see  was the only thing I could think of, but, for the sake of a quiet life I simply nodded half-heartedly and mumbled something about "well, see what you can find then". One financial adviser and several rounds of paperwork and kitchen conversations which included the phrase "hmmm, how can they justify that charge?" later, we're with The Woolwich. Temporarily. Our supposed saving of £50 a month has been whittled away to about half that. Funnily enough, once the paperwork was all but done, we were told that we would need to take out a new insurance policy. With the Woolwich, of course. Then they tried to take two payments from us at once. And of course there was the admin fee. And the cancellation charge. And the We're-Totally-Taking-The-Piss charge. And so on...    I've decided what I'll have inscribed on my headstone:   Here Lies Pogo. He lived life to the full*.  ---     Pogo is continually told to shut up by his long-suffering mates down the pub. Always opinionated yet rarely correct, he can't help sticking his oar in no matter what the subject. He has even been known to offer up opinions on The Small Print, about which he is supremely unqualified to speak.

      I finally came to an actual decision about my future plans. They now include saving a lot of money during the winter, taking some extra courses, and going to university next year.  I'm actually really looking forward to being a student again, in spite of the fact I'll be penniless after years of being able to pay for my own living, and will probably have to share a flat with a 16-year old who's moved out of home for the first time in her life.  I'll not have to sit in an office doing the same monkey-job for eight hours a day anymore. No more customer service, no more having to make excuses for other people's incompetence. In fact, I will be free to do whatever I want with my hair again, including all shades of the rainbow and an undercut, if the fancy takes me that way. I won't have to subconsciously worry whether my bag or shoes are too childish, because, hell, students are supposed to be a little weird.  No more managers, conference calls, invoice disputes or pissy customers. I dare say that this time ‘round, I'll have a whole another outlook on studying, because, unlike the last time when  I  was the fresh-out-of-home sixteen year old, I actually now know what's out there. Having worked a job I loathe for four years suddenly puts the whole thing into a new perspective.  It's always worrying to leave steady income and familiar things, but then again, not everyone's able to start afresh.  All I have to do, now, is get through another nine or ten months of gruelling boredom and, of course, the bureaucratic nightmare of choosing and applying to universities. I think I'll apply to at least two or three different countries just to make sure I have half a chance of getting accepted somewhere.  How's  your  day in the office?   * * *
