      I left Chicago today. Which was not easy. When I walked out of work on my last day yesterday, it felt pretty natural. It didn't feel so much like I was leaving the job as it did that I was just leaving at the end of a day. But leaving the city was different. I guess part of that is because I rarely leave the city these days and when I do, I'm flying somewhere which never seems real. Spending the entire day in a daze while trying (and failing) to pack and relying on your friends to pack for you, then leaving Chicago in a mini van loaded down with stuff I'm imagining will be waiting for me when (if) I return, as well as the three bags that contain everything I'm bringing for the next two years, well, it just kind of hits you. Seeing the Sears Tower fade behind you really drives it home.  I spent most of the last week saying good bye to my friends in Chicago and seeing them for the last time in a while. The nice part was that I didn't have to pay for dinner at all. The bad part is that it took me until then to realize the friends that I had there. Not that they now magically disappear but it will be different. I've spent the last two years living with Adam (found any typos in this post yet?) and most of the last year and a half with Mychela (if you've actually decided to continue reading this) and it wasn't fun leaving all that today. But, in the end this experience is worth it. I guess. The cap on the whole day didn't arrive until around 8 EDT. Which is when I finally hit Plainwell. Nothing tells you that you've left Chicago quite like arriving in Plainwell. And I have definitely arrived in Plainwell. But, I'm all unpacked (not the travel pack, though, Mychela. Don't worry. That stays strapped until I arrive in Cameroon) and once again stuck using dial-up. What's worse is that I'll probably be wishing for the speed of this dial-up connection in a week's time. Anyway, tomorrow's the open house when all the friends and family show up so wish me luck. Knowing my family, it promises to be full of hyjinks. -ALK

      This will, of course, be updated once I get my real address. But, for the time being, you can try emailing me (although there is a possibility I won't have internet during training) or you can write me at: Allen Krause, Peace Corps Trainee Corps de la Paix B.P. 215 Yaoundé, Cameroon The Peace Corps recommends that you write "Airmail" and "Par Avion" on anything you might send and that you number your letters for tracking purposes. Other sources say you might want to include religious symbols on the envelope or package to keep out those who might go hunting through it and I've also heard that indicating the contents on the outside of a package (i.e. shoes and socks) is a good idea. Since I've never been to Africa before, I wouldn't know. I'm planning on getting a cell phone once I get there and once I have that number, I'll plan on posting it out here as well. Just remember, there is a time difference so don't go calling me at eight P.M. your time, not realizing it's five or so hours later in Cameroon. And that goes double for those of you living on the west coast. -ALK

      I have not packed anything yet. And when I say nothing, I mean not only the stuff I need to take with me to Africa but also the things I'll be moving back to my parents in, well, two days. So, I'm a little behind. I did put a couple things on the table we have in our dining room last night so I can at least see how much room I won't have in my bags. Hey, if anyone is thinking of visiting Africa in the next couple months will you let me know so I can maybe send a few things with you? Anyway, basically this means that my next two nights will be devoted to packing, which, although it sounds like fun, really isn't as exciting as it sounds. On the other hand, I have to admit that I am a pretty decent packer. Is that even a word? Whatever. It's not like I really have any choice except for success. -ALK

      Today marks the one-week-until-I-leave point. Well, leave for Philadelphia at least. That's the part I'm really looking forward to. I mean, who doesn't enjoy getting multiple vaccinations and finding out all about the wonderful diseases they can get despite the injections? At least I should get a chance to finally have a cheese-steak.  I've also decided that I'm only sending the link for this blog to friends which means you should get the uncensored account. I'll spend the extra time to re-create my experiences for the parents and grandparents since they aren't going to be all that interested in the sordid details of my life in Africa (and they'd probably disown me anyway). So, if you're reading this, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. Or unlucky. I guess it's all a matter of perspective. -ALK

      At this point, you may be wondering why exactly I decided to apply to the Peace Corps. Basically, there were four catalysts. First of all was my job and the realization that it really had nothing to do with anything I wanted to do. In addition, the company decided to change their policy on how their reimbursements for grad school work, meaning that I would have no choice but to remain with the company for two years following the completion of the grad program. The way I figured it, that put me at about 30 years old and really didn't appeal to me.  The second catalyst came from a weird place. In October I bought the movie Office Space, which I had seen before, but it now hit really close to home. I mean, I had three different bosses and if I messed up anything, I heard about it from all three. And you know how he always gets an electric shock when walking through the door in the movie. Ditto here. But for me, instead of stealing a bunch of money, I though it might be better to just find something new. Soon after this, I took a short vacation to Costa Rica with a friend and being there and experiencing a different culture and hearing the different languages made me realize how much I missed that. The six months I had spent studying abroad in France during college had really changed my outlook on life and I felt that same jolt while I was in Costa Rica and knew I had to do something about it. In fact, when I told my mom that I was thinking about joining the Peace Corps and asked her if I was crazy for doing so, she told me she was surprised I hadn't done something like that sooner.  The final push came from a book I was reading at the time, The Razor's Edge, by Somerset Maugham. In the book, one of the characters is just back from the war and he realizes that he doesn't want to do the corporate America thing. He really doesn't want to work at all. So, instead, he travels the world and experiences everything, doing only what he wants. I felt that I was in a similar position, where I could either continue on the whole corporate path or try to find something I really wanted to do. Obviously, I chose the latter. So, that's what lead me to where I am now. From other people, I've heard that my application process went very quickly. Basically, it was six months from the time that I applied to the time that I left. I guess it's closer to a year for most people. And it may seem kind of crazy, leaving a job with one of the four best companies to work for in the country. But I don't think it really comes as a surprise to anyone who knows me. So, in less than two weeks, Somerset Maugham, Mike Judge, Fannie Mae and the country of Costa Rica will have all conspired to get me to Cameroon. -ALK

      I think it's funny that I'm being sent to Africa. I don't know why that amuses me so much but it does. The first thing I thought of when I heard where I would be posted was Apocalypse Now due to its relation to Heart of Darkness. In fact, the title of this blog is taken from a quote in Heart of Darkness so I've made it even more obvious. Of course, Cameroon is quite a bit more developed than the mythical villages of either of those pieces so I don't envision hunting or becoming Mr. Kurtz, but you never know.

      Fourteen days until I leave. And if that goes as quickly as the three months since I found out where I was going and when I was leaving, it promises to be over before I know it.  I'm hoping to use this as a log of my time in the Peace Corps so family and friends can stay updated. We'll see how well that works, though. I've never really been one for writing and keeping in touch. Maybe the anonymous, generic format of blogging will change that, though. Maybe. Of course, since I'll be in Africa it probably depends more on my finding access to a computer with an internet connection. That's the tricky part. But hopefully you'll bare with me and I'll come up with something that justifies your effort. -ALK

      At this point, I thought you might like to know a little bit about the other people who are here with me. The first thing I can say is that I was surprised at how little there was in the way of granolas. I mean, when I think Peace Corps, I think dirty hippies trying to save the world because they were tired of saving trees and whales. But it's just not like that. In fact, we even have a few Republicans here with us and before I came I would have said that a Republican Peace Corps volunteer was an oxymoron of the highest degree. But it turns out that it's changed a lot in the past forty years. Anyway, as far as the people here with me, I figure it makes more sense if I just tell you about the people I hang out with. So here goes. The first person I met was Pat Cline who grew up in Pittsburg but lived the past few years in the south east. Technically, we met while waiting in line to register (everything is based on bureaucracy in the PC) but it wasn't until I finally made my way into the room where we were doing our pre-departure stuff and saw him hanging out at the back that we really talked. For those of you who think I'm bitter and jaded, you'd have to meet Pat to really understand what that's all about. In the end, we're quite a bit alike in that we play that character but really care about things. With that introduction came the beginning of what we call the core. As in any social group, things naturally break down into cliques and the PC is no exception. Luckily, I found the right people and it's making life here much more bearable. The next person to be added to the core was Jen Bosich who comes from somewhere in the east. Most people have their money on her and Pat to be the first to hook up with each other and I have to admit that I'm part of that crowd as well. Then we have Allen Banick who spent several years living in Marseille and is an OM fan along with me. He is by far the strongest French speaker in our group and it's the two if us in the highest level French class. Well, there's actually one other person. Stan Levine. Stan happens to be 79 years old and quite a bit deaf and quite a bit blind. But he studied at the Sorbonne back after the war and is by far the ladies man of the whole group. Stan is in the education side and really isn't part of any group here. However, even at 8 decades, “Satin” is far more smooth than most people could ever hope to be at any point in their life. The final member of our little group is April Scoggan who actually left her job as a VP at some Wall Street firm to join the PC. Seriously. She told us that her bonus this past year was 70 g's. That's twice as much as my salary and Fannie certainly wasn't paying me no bonuses. But, we're both in Africa now so who's the smarter one in the end? The other person I hang out with is Tina Watanabe who grew up on military bases in Japan and Germany because her dad is a DoD employee. She's actually the person I'm tutoring which is why we hang out but she's also become one of my best friends here even though she isn't part of that little clique. She also holds the distinction of being the shortest person in our group at 4’ 11”. I've always found it good to have friends in different circles, anyway, so it works out all right. Now, as far as my life goes, not much has happened recently. Well, I guess I was on the radio in Mbalmayo yesterday along with Allen to talk a little bit about what the Peace Corps is doing here and in Cameroon in general. Of course, I was nervous and ended up butchering my French but what can you do? My French is getting better on a daily basis though and I find it easier and easier to speak and understand. By the end of two years, I shouldn't have any problems at all. However, my English keeps getting worse and worse.  Other than that, I still watch lots of soccer since the Euro 2004 is going on but I have no idea what's happening in the rest of the world. It really doesn't bother me that much, though, and I even find myself getting used to the cold showers. I started running the other day and that's made me feel much better as well. Saturday afternoon we're planning on playing soccer and I'm really looking forward to that, even though I know I'll make a fool of myself. Oh, I did hear that the Pistons beat the Lakers in five games which made me happy. However, I have no idea what’s been going with the Cubs or the Tigers. Well, that's really about it for right now. I hope everyone is doing well and writing letters since email is, as explained, impossibly slow here. -ALK P.S. Happy birthday to Guy and Angela. Enjoy 25 and 19 respectively.

      It might be awhile before I get another chance to update everyone so hopefully this can hold you over until then. Things are still very warm in Cameroon although this is the winter so I can only imagine how hot it's going to get. I don't sweat quite as much as I did for the first couple weeks but it's still more than is socially acceptable (Cameroonians don't sweat). On a side note, everyone I invited to come visit has been officially and very cordially dis-invited. It's not because I don't like you. In fact, it's because I do like you. Imagine the most awful country you've ever visited. Then picture more starvation, more bugs, more heat, more disease and less ways to take care of any of these things and you can start to imagine Cameroon. And it's one of the better countries in Africa. Honestly, if there is a hell, it will very closely resemble Cameroon. Things are good, though. Actually, Guy, you can still visit since living in Ecuador might have kind of prepared you. However, there's another guy with me who has also lived in Ecuador and was using that standard to apply to Cameroon and concluded that it's so much worse here. So, you might want to just save your money and we can meet somewhere nice (like Vietnam) after I'm done. However, I haven't heard about what happened with Jeff so if you want to write me or give me a call at 011.237.930.15.10 and fill me in, that'd be great. By the way, that is my new phone number. The flight here was 20 hours of nonstop fun. Luckily, it was on Air France so we had good food and I was able to get my miles but other than that, twenty hours on a plane is twenty hours too much. However, upon landing at Yaounde-Nsimalen International   Airport (about the same size as Kalamazoo International Airport), which appears to have been built in the middle of a rice paddy, it was pretty apparent that we weren't in Kansas anymore.\par Since then, I've moved in with the host family and watched a lot of soccer on TV. We have cable which is interesting when juxtaposed with the fact that we are lucky to have an INDOOR cold shower and do all our laundry by hand. Actually, I'm very lucky since most of my friends have pit latrines and take bucket baths in their homestays. One of the fun parts of doing laundry by hand is that, after it's finished drying on the line, you either have to iron it or let it sit for three days because of the mango fly eggs deposited in the clothes while they're on the line. If you don't do either one of these things, you run the risk of the larva hatching and burrowing under your skin where you can then see them moving around. This hasn't happened to me but I know volunteers who have enjoyed the experience. Honestly, I've only been here two weeks but time has already lost any sense of meaning. It could have been two years for all I know. I wake up in the morning and go to class. When I'm done with courses for the day, I tutor one of the novice level trainees in French before going home to eat dinner and watch television with my family. Then, I shower and go to bed. I'm on autopilot. And things just start to become normal. I no longer notice the ants and flies that constantly swarm everything in the kitchen. When the power goes out, I find my flashlight and move on with whatever I'm doing. If the water's out, I find a bucket of water and use that to flush the toilet. It's amazing how quickly you adapt and I can only imagine what it'll be like at the end of two years. In the end, I experience weird highs and lows every day and they arrive of their own accord. And, since the internet here in Mbalmayo is so slow, I might not be writing any more entries while I'm here. But, as I promised before I left, if you write me by regular post, I'll write back. So, keep those letters rolling. Oh, and if you want to send me a package, here are some suggestions: gum and candy in blister packs (100% humidity ruins most other things, although I'll eat it anyway; it's better than fish heads); catalogs (J. Crew, etc., for examples of clothes I can have made) and magazines; snack size packs of other foods; Listerine; and things that are light, won't cost much to ship and won't cost me too much to pick up from the post office (there's a tax on any packages you receive). Anyway, enough about my needs. You wouldn't even believe how the people here live. So, I won't even try to explain. A bientot. -ALK

      ...because this will probably be short and full of typos. I'm using a French keyboard which means everything is in a different place. Good times. Well, I've moved in with my host family now and they are really nice. I've been told that I'm part of the family and that seems to be working. The house is nice for here but by US standards, well, think of someone living in Kentucky who has a decent size house but not much money for it. In fact, it's impossible to explain. Suffice to say that after one week, it's very obvious that I'm not in Kansas anymore. My time is almost out so I have to run. I'm not going to have ,uch internet access so this won't be updated too often these days. But, I'll do what I can when I can. A bientot. -ALK

      I'll have to update this more later but I figured I could at least put down a little before I leave this afternoon for Mbalmayo where we'll be doing our training and living with our host families. First of all, there are three Allen's in my one little group of trainees. And all of us are doing small enterprise development (SED). One of us spells it wrong (Allan) but considering I've only known two or three other Allens in my life, this is pretty weird. The hardest part is that if someone says "Allen," I'm going to answer since I've always been the only one. I imagine nicknames will come soon enough. Oh, here's something. I buzzed my head the other day. Like short. Like shorter than I've had it since I was seven years old and my mom used the razor for my haircuts. It's much more comfortable and even though I was washing my hair, it was still getting pretty nasty. And it wasn't going to get any better.  So, things are going well so far although I have been sick for the last day or so. Good times. Don't worry, though, mom. It's nothing serious. Just adjusting. -ALK

      In about forty five minutes, I leave for Kalamazoo International (yes, International) Airport. It's only to go to Philly at this point but it's definitely the beginning. I slept surprisingly well last night which was nice but then I also was woken up up about ten after one by the phone (no worries, Frank). So, pretty soon this whole thing begins in earnest and hopefully I'll have some sort of real stories to tell. Granted, I have no idea what that means but I'll let you know once I find out. -ALK

      I actually lost the entire entry that I typed up last week. Although, if you want to get the sense of it, I'll try to sum it up in a paragraph. So, here goes. Basically, Cameroon (or maybe it's the PC) has turned me into an emotional yo-yo. I feel completely bipolar to the extent that I go from being on top of the world during lunch to almost crying in the class after lunch (for no specific reason, mind you). But, despite all of that, there are things here that make it worthwhile. Like last Wednesday when a group of us (me and the five people I told you about in the last entry) went to get drinks and braised fish for Pat's 31st birthday. It was a great time and eating fish with our hands in a little bar felt pretty normal. Even funnier, the group breaks down into three couples and people have even begun to identify some of us that way. I have to admit that I am one who is so identified and I actually went on a date a couple weeks ago. It was a weird experience but really fun at the same time. Just in case you're wondering, that was with Tina and things there are going....well, as well as they possibly can in a third world country with no privacy while being involved in a emotionally torturous training process. Considering all that, it’s going quite well. Basically, we both realize that nothing can really happen while we're here so we enjoy hanging out together and we're just going to go with that. In the end, I'm happy with the situation since most of the time I tend to live in these types of gray zones where nothing is completely defined. For some reason, it just suits me. Anyway, since last week, two big things have happened. The first was our Fourth of July party, which went really well. Ok, I did breathe in way too much smoke while cooking over an open fire and felt sick for the next two days but that's all right. The party was fun, everyone seemed to enjoy it and the second half of the day was cancelled on Monday so I was able to recover a little. That meant that I spent almost the entire afternoon with Tina and, of course, that made it better. Anyway... The second thing is that we received our posts on Wednesday. The process ended up being a bittersweet turn of events because one of the posts turned out to be Bafoussam, in the West Province, where our trainers, Fran and Ted Kambour, are posted. Due to some recent sickness in their family back in the States, they thought it would be best if they ET (Early Termination) and they will be leaving soon after we swear in. They really are mentors to us and it's going to be tough to lose them. Allen and Pat ended up being tapped to replace them and I'm going to be in a university town called Dschang forty minutes or so outside of there. Actually, most of my good friends are within reasonable amounts of distance from me. April is a ways south of me and Jen is posted in the center province along with Tina and they’re about four hours from me. So far, the most difficult part about this is that everyone keeps telling me what a wonderful post I have which really isn't helping my whole "no expectations" game plan. What I know about Dcshang so far is that it’s in the mountains so the weather is a little cooler but basically around seventy all the time. I’m hoping it’s less humid as well but we’ll see about that. There’s a place there called the Centre Climatique, which has a pool and German beer on tap. I guess it’s a little expensive but every once in a while it should be nice. The other nice thing is that there’s supposed to be a big library that shows films sometimes, as well as an Alliance Française. However, there’s still four more weeks of training so plenty can change. Here’s something interesting. Every night my family gathers around the TV to watch their two favorite shows, The Bold and the Beautiful (called Top Models here) and Air America, starring Lorenzo Lamas. The scariest part about this is that it means that he is still getting royalties since the show is still being aired. What kind of world do we live in where Lorenzo Lamas still has a career? In other news, my battery charger died the first time I used it so I’m kind of out of luck in that department since all I brought was rechargeable batteries. However, if you’d like to support the “Allen in Africa Fund,” a new charger (Energizer, from Target) and maybe a higher quality voltage converter might be helpful. You know, if you’re so inclined. And, on a side note, if you’re interested in sending me packages, the best bet is to use a padded envelope which can be shipped regular mail. I’ve heard stories about some packages taking half a year to arrive and that’s just no good. Also, if you’re interested in hearing about the experience from any other sides, there are a couple other people that are keeping online journals while they’re here. On Blogspot, you can check out Pete_in_Cameroon, which really helped me before I left, and allenincameroon, which is written by my friend Allen who I mentioned last week. Another friend, Scott, has a LiveJournal called Scott in Africa and you can also check out www.adamfgreen.com, which is updated by a current education volunteer and trainer. Finally, I just started Pidgin classes today so I should be at least conversational in jive by the time I get back. Walka fine. –ALK P.S. I received my first letters and my first package this week so props go out to my mom and Mychela for being the first. I’ve already finished the first letter and I’ll do the second this weekend so hopefully they’ll be on their way soon. Of course, this is Cameroon so who knows. Mais, merci pour les letters et soyez libre d’envoyer des autres. P.P.S. If there’s anyone reading this who would like to donate a laptop computer, this would be a great addition as well. It can be made as a donation to the Peace Corps and, after using for the next couple years, I would then donate it to the microfinance institution where I’ll be working. Supposedly delivery can be made through the diplomatic pouch but I’d prefer to know if there’s even any possibility of a computer being available before arranging the whole thing. If you have any info or any questions, you can hit the comment button below this post and it’ll be sent to my email. Thanks in advance. P.P.P.S Et pour les gens entre vous qui parlent le français, je vais essayer à chaque fois de mettre quelque chose en français pour vous. D’habitude, ça va être quelque chose de petite (comme cela-ici) mais dans l’avenir, j’espère aussi de raconter des histoires.

      After one month in Cameroon, I can begin to say that I'm adapting. That means a lot of different things, though. I've already mentioned that the cold showers and bugs crawling all over my food seem natural but now it comes down to things like ignoring the people staring at you and knowing when a cab driver is trying to rip you off. The other night I showed my host family pictures of my family and friends back in the States and then they showed me some of their pictures. I don't know what I was expecting from the whole experience but it seemed pretty anticlimactic. My father was excited to get the picture I gave him of my family back home and he decided that he's going to write them a letter. Since I still haven't received any letters, I still haven't written any. Like Tupac and Bruce Hornsby say, that's just the way it is. One of the weirdest things I've been experiencing lately is what I affectionately call bi-polarity. All day long I'll go from feeling excited and optimistic to feeling depressed and wondering when it will end. Usually I can talk myself out of these things but they're completely irrational here and that approach just doesn't work. I've talked to other people, even those who have been here for the past year, and they say it doesn't change. Eventually, the swings just become normal. However, for me, sitting in class and trying to keep myself from crying is really weird. Especially when there really is no reason. The littlest thing can set things off and that's true on both the good and bad side.  Honestly, it's really weird getting email as well because, for all of you, nothing has really changed. I've been gone for a few weeks but it's not like any of your routines have changed or any major changes have taken place in your lives. Life goes on. But here, even though it's only been four weeks, it feels like a lifetime. I can't even explain what life is like here and if I tried, you wouldn't understand and wouldn't care. I imagine that my return will be like coming back from study abroad where everyone asks you how it was and you have so much to say but eventually you realize that your stories don't really mean anything to anyone else and you turn to the stock answer, "It was good." I'm not saying this to be judgemental. It's just how life works.  From what I've been saying you'd probably think I was in a bad place mentally but that's not exactly true. There are moments here that are incredible. Last night one of my friends, Pat, turned 31 so a group of us went out for his birthday. Actually, it was me and the five people I talked about last time and we had a great time. We had too much to drink and ordered this really good braised fish which we then ate with our hands. And that's normality for me.  It's interesting because this little group breaks down into three guys and three girls but the only ones who really have anything going on are Pat and Jen. In fact, April has them down as the most likely to get married by the time this all over and I really don't think that's too far-fetched. As for me, I actually went on a date with Tina the other night. Which was again weird. First of all, going on a date is weird to begin with, much less in the Peace Corps in a third world country. Surprisingly, though, things went well. The thing is, we both joined the PC for selfish reasons. Me, I wanted to get away from the US and the shell of a life I had in Chicago. (No offense to any of my friends there but you all know how unhappy I was with the way my life seemed to be headed.) Tina, on the other hand, has been in nonstop relationships for the past seven years and really wants to use this time to prove that she can survive without one. And that's something I really respect, especially since it was something she decided before coming and she's only 23 even though it means that nothing can or will happen between us. So, we talked about things and that's how they stand. Despite everything, though, she really has become my best friend here and that's comforting. Along the same lines, one of the hardest parts about life here is the complete lack of intimacy. And I mean that in every sense of the word. We've all known each other for a month now but you can't really achieve any sort of emotional intimacy in that amount of time. Granted, there's an aspect of emotional intimacy that comes from the trauma of the experience but true intimacy takes time. Mental intimacy fits into the same category. However, then you have physical intimacy. The first problem there is that it's always hot so you're always sweaty and the last thing you would want is someone laying beside you. At the same time, at no point in my life has a simple hug ever been as important as it is now. Sometimes, it's really the only thing that can pull you back towards sanity. And that's after four weeks where we spend every day with our support system of friends and trainers. In another four weeks, they're going to be sending us out to our posts and we get to start this whole process over again. You can't understand it but any sort of intimacy will be worth its weight in gold during the next two years.  Again, I don't mean to paint this experience as some sort of horrible torture. Honestly, I can already feel myself changing and I expect that to continue over the next couple years. And I'm sorry if I end up boring you with those stories. Those of you who know me know that I tend to talk things out to deal with them and this is my way of doing it here. Ultimately, I hope to have some idea of what I want to do with my life by the time this is finished or at least have a next step. And already, from the time I've spent with the people I'm closest to here, I know I have a whole new group of incredibly close friends, and, even if I don't see them for ten years afterwards, that won't change anything. So, one month is down which means I have only 26 to go. By the way, my battery charger blew out the other day which means I'm kinda' screwed on that front so if anyone's looking to send an early birthday or Christmas present, that would be a great idea. It was Energizer if that makes any difference. I hope you are all well and the years (well, one month but it sure feels like years) are treating you well. –ALK P.S.

      So, you would think I would be a little more sad at this point, knowing that in three hours I'm leaving for the West province and probably won't see my best friends for another two months. And I guess to a certain extent I am sad. But I know that I will see them and if I really need to get away and do something, the option always exists. The last few days I've been lucky enough to get to spend quite a bit of time with Tina and that's been good for me mentally. If you actually made it all the way through that last post, you know that things aren't quite the same between us. But, she's still my best friend here and has become one of my best friends anywhere. The second to last night in Mbalmayo we were out at the bar until late and she ended up sleeping back at my place. It was nice. And last night at the Case de Passage (the Peace Corps rest house in Yaoundé, we ended up in the same bed because there wasn't enough room. Again, it's just nice waking up next to a friend. And the point to all of this is that because of the time we've had together, even though we'll be apart for awhile, we'll see each other again. And that makes it all right. At this point, I'm beginning my second full day as a volunteer. I really can't think of any point in my life where I thought that it would be cool if I was a PCV. In fact, I can think of lots of times when I thought about how cool it wouldn't be. But, de toute façon, here I am. And here I go. I ran into a grad student from Harvard yesterday (while having drinks during happy hour at the Hilton; I am so not Peace Corps) and she is staying with a family in Dschang (where I'm headed) and she told me that it's absolutely beautiful there. Not one person has said anything about that place. It's actually beginning to worry me because they must be hiding something incredibly evil there. That's all I can think. But maybe it actually is some mountain paradise and I'll never want to come back. Well, here's the point where I say good bye until I get to post. It's kind of comforting knowing that I'm going to be there for two years. There's a constancy that eases the mind a little. I don't know what else to say at this point. It's all a little overwhelming. But I do hoope you are all doing well and continuing to write. I'll let you know once I have a new address but you can always send them to the Yaoundé address and be sure that I'll get them. In fact, if you're sending packages, please use only the Yaoundé PC address. A bientôt.  -ALK

      22 July 2004 So, I guess the best place to begin is where I left off last time. And that was with my posting to a town called Dschang. Well, that's already changed. I'm now going to a smaller town just outside of Dschang called Doumbuo but the micro-finance institution there is supposed to be one of the best run in the country. The best part about that is that it means I should have time to work on secondary projects. Who knows? Maybe I'll start a branch of TAG in Cameroon. On the other hand, it's kind of hard to get people to think about organizing any sort of artist's collective when they're starving. But, who knows. I found out about this shift the morning we were leaving on site visit, which really plays no role in anything I'm about to say but I figured I'd add it in since it might serve as a transition into.... Site visit. Funny, that. So, site visit used to be an opportunity for volunteers to visit their posts but this year for the SED program, they decided to send us out to visit three different volunteers at their posts. Personally, I think the change was a good idea and I feel pretty good about heading to post now. We saw the extremes of what a volunteer can do or be and that really helped.  The first volunteer we visited was Kelly in Bafia. The thing we all noticed is that instead of serving as a consultant, she is really more of an employee in her bank. For me, the idea of being an employee in that sort of position in Africa is the worst sort of hell I can imagine. And then she had the nerve to lecture us about propriety and cross-cultural understanding. Suffice to say that I was ready to kill her by the end of the first two hours we spent with her. Luckily, since she has done nothing with her house, we had to stay in a hotel. Well, somewhat luckily. We ended up getting two rooms, one for the girls and one for me. Of course, mine was the one without air conditioning or television. I didn't really sleep. I guess I should talk about the people I was traveling with as well. I was the team leader because of my French level and because I'm male (you'd have to be here to understand the amount of sexism and the necessity of this). Next was Annie, who I might have talked about before. Basically, she's one of the most annoying people I've met here and the prospect of spending that much time with her was already setting me edge before we left. However, the last person was Tina and that was probably what kept me sane. The first night in Bafia, she came over to my room to talk and I decided to at least make an effort to be nice during the trip. In the end, it ended up working out and no one killed each other. Good times. At the same time, Tina and I were both using this as another opportunity to test where we are. The plan was that we would hate each other by the end and then not have to worry about this any more. No dice. Not only do we travel frighteningly well together and get along really well, we also ended up sharing a bed a couple nights during the trip. Nothing major happened there but once you've gotten traveling, the abortion discussion and sleeping in the same bed out of the way and things are still good, it gets harder to ignore what's going on. Not that we're ignoring it. I guess it's more that we're accepting it but realizing that things will inevitably change when we go to post in two weeks. I guess I should get back to the trip, though. Our next stop was Akonolinga (pronounced uh-kun-uh-ling-uh), which led to many infantile jokes. Eating out in Akonolinga. It’s moist there. I was amused. But then again, I’m easily amused. Anyway, we only had twelve or so hours to spend there but we packed a lot into that amount of time. We went out in the bush (in Akonolinga. Ha.) and drank palm wine. We visited a small community bank, had drinks with the volunteer in that city, Carolyn’s, counterpart and co-workers. We also ate a local river fish, Konga, for dinner. This fish is one ugly looking fish but it tastes really good. Kind of fatty because it eats other fish (and people who fall into the river) but tasty nonetheless. After dinner, we headed back to Carolyn’s to figure out sleeping arrangements and that turned out to be pretty easy because Annie took the extra mattress, threw it on the living room floor and sprawled out across the middle of it before passing out. Since Carolyn has her own bed that left the other bed in the other room for Tina and myself. So, we took it. And that’s all you get there. The next morning, after some pineapple and beans and beignets, we took to the road again, this time heading for Ebolowa. But, since we weren’t faced with the time crunch this time, we stopped over in Yaoundé so Annie could visit the PCMO and we could all get cheeseburgers. Yes, cheeseburgers. There’s a hotel right next to PC HQ that makes decent burgers and it was a nice break from the usual food we have here. But, we had to keep moving so about five that afternoon, we arrived in Ebolowa and Shannon picked us up at the agence de voyage. That night was pretty uneventful, although we did have our first sachets (little plastic pouches with individual shots of either gin or whiskey in them). The alcohol isn’t good but when you’re on PC budget, good doesn’t matter. Anyway, that night I had to sleep on a small bamboo bed with a paper-thin foam mattress on it. Needless to say, sleep didn’t actually enter into it. I fell asleep at midnight, woke up at three and then tossed and turned until eight in the morning.  As soon as we got up that morning, I decided that I needed to get a decent night of sleep so I told Shannon that I would need to find a hotel. Annie was happy staying at Shannon’s again. Pas de problème. So, we ate crèpes for breakfast and then left to visit counterparts (again), see a water project completed by another volunteer and (of course) get drinks in town with both groups. But, since Tina wasn’t feeling well, she and I headed back to Shannon’s place so she could lie down for a little while before dinner. Luckily, on her way back, Shannon made a reservation for me for that night at the hotel. But, it turns out that it was going to be me and Tina staying there, not that I was really that upset.  Tina had a fever during the afternoon but was feeling a little better by the time we started making pizza that night. Yes. Pizza. A VSO volunteer, a Brit named Chloë, joined us for dinner and, since Annie was already drunk, she, Shannon and Jean-Christophe, another PCV, decided to head to the club after dropping Tina and I off at the hotel. Let me stop for a second to tell you about the hotel. Rooms at the Super 8 are nicer than the room we had but it didn’t matter. We had air conditioning and a hot shower and that was more than enough. I actually felt clean for the first time since leaving Philadelphia and you can’t even imagine how wonderful that is. However, once again, I feel no need to say anything about the rest of the night. Tina and I showed up at Shannon’s around 11:30 the next day to find a very hung over Shannon and Annie. Turns out the three of them (Jean-Christophe had been out with them) had split a bottle of whiskey at the club and that might have been directly responsible for Shannon’s neighbor coming by her place at four in the morning to ask if it was possible for her to stop playing guitar and singing Blowin’ in the Wind. Good times in Cameroon. After lunch that day, we had to head back to Mbalmayo and that was kind of bittersweet. Well, more bitter actually. But, what can you do?  The best part of the trip, like I said before, was that we saw the two extremes of what a volunteer can do. The water project outside of Ebolowa shows how much a volunteer can accomplish. Because of the work done there, nearly 100 villagers now have a clean source of water and the amount of sickness has dropped dramatically. More than that, the villagers were incredibly grateful and it’s good to see. In the end, I’m happy with where things are right now. I’m aware that everything will change dramatically in two weeks when we go to post but I’m feeling good about it. Honestly, the hardest part is wondering what will happen as far as Tina and I go but if anything is meant to work out, it will. I wasn’t expecting anything coming here and the fact that I already have a really good friend to show for this experience is something to hold on to. Well, I don’t know what else to add. I’m exhausted after the trip since I really didn’t sleep at all but I’m really excited to get to post and actually start my work. Hope all is well with everyone. Keep writing. –ALK  25 July 2004 I’m adding a little bit more before this actually gets posted. It’s a couple days since I wrote the rest of the entry but not much has changed. Well, I guess I did get to start another medication yesterday, Notezine, which is for Filaria and Loa-Loa. This one, at least, is not mandatory but the thought of seeing (yes, literally seeing) worms float across my eyes doesn’t really appeal to me. Supposedly the side effects are similar to those of Mefloquine (mandatory anti-malarial) and from the dreams I had last night, I’m thinking they’re right. I woke up around 2:30 after stabbing some guy in the forehead with a dull knife and, since it didn’t kill him, then having to shove it through his throat. There’s a reason they tell you not to do drugs. Anyway, Filaria is another one of those diseases endemic to the area of Cameroon where I’ll be posted. Actually, I guess they use the term hyper-endemic which means that you’re going to get it. Like Malaria. I already have it. It’s just that the prophylaxis keeps it in check so I don’t die. That’s a comforting thought when you’re lying in bed at night. On the bright side, I now have a legitimate reason for not giving blood. “Gee, I would but I just spent the last two years in Africa and I wouldn’t want someone to get my malaria.”  In other news, my little brothers and sister at my homestay have started making fun of me. I’m not sure exactly why this is but they seem to get a kick out of it. They’re also getting a bit bolder about asking to borrow stuff. Luckily, I’ve also become a bit bolder about saying no. Basically, the way that a Cameroonian operates is that they figure they might as well ask because the worst that can happen is that you say no. And what have you really lost at that point? This is not limited to just money, either. They will ask for your shoes, your pants, whatever they might want because you never know. What if the white man says yes? Good times. I was supposed to be taken out to dinner tomorrow evening (yes, by Tina) but I was pre-empted by a chicken killing spectacle. Yep. You read that right. Another trainee, Scott, is going to be killing, plucking and cooking a chicken with his family tomorrow. Since I obviously can’t compete with that, I just gave up. Eh. What can you do? Here’s something. One of my brothers was chasing the other one with a knife last night. The knives here are pretty dull so it would have taken some doing and (I’m assuming) it was all in fun. However, I almost took it head on as I was walking through a door. Not to worry, though. I have a PC medical kit and that can take care of anything. On a side note, if anyone plans on sending me anything in the next little while, bath sponges would be nice. You know, the ones that make the soap lather up and all that. Basically I need some way to scrape the dirt off of my body from the dust that collects all day long. And if anyone has Scott Masson’s new CD, that would be great as well. We don’t get much in the way of new music or anything over here. In fact, I just heard that John Edwards is Kerry’s running mate. How long ago did that happen? And since I’m already off on a tangent, I’ll continue. Why would you pick a running mate more charismatic than yourself? That just doesn’t seem intelligent. But what do I know? I’m spending the next two years in Africa so it’s obvious I’m a few fries short of a Happy Meal as well. I almost forgot. While on site visit last week, Tina had hedgehog for lunch one day. It wasn’t bad. Other friends have had porcupine, ant-eater and viper. Basically, if it moves, a Cameroonian will eat it. No, seriously. They will. Anyway, hopefully this dose of cynicism and sarcasm didn’t push my last few remaining readers away. At least it’s a little better than me in real life. You can always close the web page. It’s a lot harder to get me to leave if I’m over for dinner or drinks. And just imagine what it’ll be like when I get back. “So, Allen. How was Africa?” “Well, the food was weird, you wouldn’t believe how it came out of me and there are a lot of black people. Pretty much what I expected.”  That leads me to another point. Racism. Which is so much different here. We talk about blacks and whites all the time here and that’s even with Cameroonians. No one really cares. One of the funnier things I heard was a friend whose host family has decided that all white people like chicken and watermelon. Did I already tell this story? Whatever. I’m in Africa. I can do whatever I want. –ALK  2 August 2004 Three more days until swearing in. And how things have changed. We had counterpart workshop last week and that was interesting. Well, not really. Actually it was kind of boring and I get the distinct feeling that my counterpart is not all that excited that I'm coming to be at his bank. However, since the head of the NGO that audits all the banks in my network was the one who requested my switch to this bank, I have a feeling that there's a little more going on with that. Don't worry. I'll keep you updated on that.  Spending a couple days in the capitol was nice, especially since it meant hot water for showers. We also stopped by the Hilton on Sunday afternoon and, although it's not very Peace Corps, it was nice. After an afternoon at the pool (we ended up getting kicked out. Dommage) we headed up to the panoramic bar on the 11th floor. AC, happy hour, billiards and all that. Good times. But, all good things come to an end and we headed back to our hotel for the night. Which ended up interesting again since I had my roommate traded. Originally, I was rooming with this guy named Scott but he decided to trade positions with Tina so we were then in the same room. Not that I was complaining. It was very Dick Van Dyke show with two single beds but things work out. Well, kind of. Yesterday things stopped working out. Somehow Tina has decided she is no longer attracted to me. And honestly, there was nothing I could have done about it. She said that it happened at the bar after the homestay appreciation dinner (good food, boring nonetheless) when I didn't get a chair for her when we walked in. It wouldn't have mattered. If I would have gotten the chair, that would have been the reason. She expected me to get the chair because that would be a boyfriend thing to do. But if I would have gotten it, she would have been upset because that would have been a boyfriend thing to do. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. So, I accept it. I can't do anything else. Supposedly we'll still be friends and I have no problem with that since that's all we were to begin with. But I wonder how things will actually turn out. It was hard enough seeing friends in Chicago that lived ten minutes away from me by el. When it's a five hour bush taxi ride, I think it becomes even less likely. But, we'll see. Here's the thing. I don't think she's actually become not attracted to me. I think the situation was becoming (at least in her mind) what she didn't want in coming here, a relationship. And in order to give herself an out, she created a situation in her mind with an inevitable result. Because I don't believe that it just changed like that. Logic and experience both tell me that it's impossible and I have nothing else to go on. But, like I said, there's nothing I can really do so I just accept it and enjoy the fact that I have a good friend in Africa. In family news (both African and American) things are somewhat depressing. Honestly, I'm looking forward to getting out of my homestay. I really get along well with my host dad but he's been gone all the time lately and I get the distinct impression that the others don't like me so much. Not that I blame them but it gets old. They also like to chase each other around with knives and that’s fun. Especially when you happen to be walking through the door as they’re running through. Anyway…In the American family, my dad just lost his job and the chances of someone else hiring a 54 year old blue collar worker don't seem that high in my mind. I'm supposed to hear from them tonight so hopefully something's changed in the past week. Some of you may know that I took the Foreign Service Exam in April and it turns out that I passed the written section. I got an email with a letter attached and now comes the hard part. If I want to take the oral, I have until May of next year to do it. One of our trainers here, Fran, had a father who was a foreign service officer and she suggested that I take it and try to get in because it's an even better Peace Corps type experience and if it's what I want to do, there's no point in waiting. But most likely I would have to go back to the States to take it which would mean taking vacation at some point and having to buy a round trip ticket. I'm going to try and talk to the Embassy and see if there's some way to delay or anything but it's definitely a tough call. In the end, I'm still happy to be here, still looking forward to getting to post and still wishing that I'd actually hear something from my friends. Where did you all go? I did hear from Devin (thanks buddy) and I also heard that Adam still hasn't found a new roommate (sorry about that buddy). Supposedly I'm moving into a three bedroom house with water and electricity located in a hospital compound in my village. And it's about 100 m from my bank. However, if I had to count all the things I've been told here so far that didn't turn out like I was told, well, I'd very quickly run out of fingers and toes. I hope everyone is well. Happy August.  -ALK
