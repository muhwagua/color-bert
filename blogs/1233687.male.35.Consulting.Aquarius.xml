      News Items for the day  urlLink UN gets 'last chance' on Iraq  The US playing bully boy again.  No doubt it'll start throw its toys out of the pram soon.  Its a pity that its toys consist of missiles, tanks and guns.   urlLink Fewer plan to pay off card debts  Classic quote from this article: 'But Morgan Stanley spokesman, Tyrrell Schmidt, insisted there was nothing to worry about.'  Well  he would, wouldn't he!   urlLink London Congestion  Interesting article on how London's new Congeston Charging scheme is in breach of the Data Protection Act.   urlLink GeForce FX 'blagging it'  Strange things happening with the GeForce FX, and it seems that it most cases it is SLOWER thent the older Radeon 9700.

      Well, spent most of the day reinstalling all my of my applications.  Had a bit of a scare earlier.  I ghosted my computer onto the 80gb drive that I got for Sams machine.  Hooked it up to my PC this morning and it didn't detect.  Since it was an IBM deskstar I naturally assumed the thing had fucked up.  The bloody thing had all my data on too!  Hooked it up to Sam's machine and it was fine.  Thats the second 'funny' I've had with this board, as it refused to work with ECC ram yesterday.  Bit of a family feud going on today.  Darren & Mandy (thats my older brother and his wife) came up today.  Darren's is not going to Mom & Micks 20th Aniversary party in April.  He just doesn't feel that 20 years since Mom and Dad split was something he wanted to celebrate.  I can see his point of view.  I'm going to go though.. Its all water under the bridge.  Apparently there was a bit of a family row brewing about it as Lynn had been straight on the phone to Vicky & Mick stiring it a little, which was why they popped over.  Teeth are better today.. Swelling has gone done.  Mouth feels like a sewer sometimes though.. Don't know how Sam puts up with it.

      Just reinstalling Windows XP after my motherboard upgrade.  I went from a Abit KR7-Raid to an Epox 8RDA with nForce 2 on board.  I still kept all the other bits though.  This board should be able to take one of the new Athlons with Barton core.  So, aiming to buy one of those with some PC3200 memory (probably Corsair) in the summer sometime.  Good job I cloned my HD yesterday.  My orginal install wouldn't even boot with this board, so rather then faffing around trying to get it working, I formatted the bugger and started afresh.  Only down side is I'll spend the next week attached to Windows Update!  I wouldn't normally be up this late.. I'm waiting for Sam to come back after practicing his unicorn dance.  Ahh.. the things we do for love :)

      Well, I've had a day doing bugger all.. didn't goto work today as I had my two rear wisdom teeth out.  I was sedated while they did it so I was as high as a kite.. All I kept hearing was 'Wider, Mr. Bailey.'  Oh, Heaven!  I should have gone back upto Manchester to the GMP, but my check was all puffed out and it hurt like hell, so I didn't bother.  It looking like I will have to goto Reading next Thursday / Friday to do a 9iAS install.  Not to chuffed about that as I will be missing Kaye's leaving piss up in Manchester.  Bugger :/

      Went to see the old man tonight, to get my form signd off so I get my car cheaper.  Find it quite hard to talk to him sometimes as we don't have that much in common.  He asked me how my 'friend' was... :)  Only 3 weeks until the car comes now !! Can't wait.

      Rebuilding Bobo back to a normal linux server, rather then using Mandrake Security as a router.  Tried installing RedHat 8 but the install fell over with a 'gnome-canvas--def' something or other error.  Tried the text install but that didn't detect the HD's properly and it failed to format them.  Gonna try Mandrake 9 instead.

      Well, its been a few days since the last post.  I've been up in Mancester working at the  urlLink Greater Manchester Police  doing an Oracle 11i upgrade.  I didn't take my laptop and for some reason the Blogger post wouldn't work.  Never mind.  I quite like Manchester.  If I was looking to move up north, I'd definately consider Manchester.  Canal Street is certainly much better then Brum's Gay Village.  Will be finishing there though next week.  Bit pissed about it because Kaye's leaving pissup is next Thursday and I am going to miss it because I am stuck in Reading.  Not pleased about that at all.  Teeth were better at the beginning of the week, but they went downhill yesterday.  So much so that I had to come back today for an emergency appointment.  The cavity got flushed out and dressed and I got a course of antibiotics.

      THE FRIDGE FUCKED UP TODAY.  Gutted.  I am especially gutted since I went shopping on Friday Night and spent £115 on food for the next couple of weeks.  Gotta go back up to Manchester tomorrow to work at the GMP.  I keep forgetting this and thinking that I've got a Sunday off.  I could really do with it but work is work.  Went back to the car dealers today to check out the situation on the interior trim.  Apprently you don't get it as standard.  Wanted it adding to the order but their system was so slow they couldn't do it  I'll have to phone him tomorrow and check out whether he managed to get it on.  He keeps mentioning the delivery date going into April and the new price list coming into operation.  Funnily enough, they don't know what they are.  I have a sneaking suspusion that he is wanting to get it done before April because the price is dropping.

          Went to bed  yesterday without creating an entry, was really tired after this week.&nbsp; We  didn't the payroll at CBS, still got a few lose ends to tie up.&nbsp; Hopefully  we'll run it on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; I was still making changes to the payroll  setup yesterday, which is a hard thing to do seeing that the payroll has been  processed for 14 people.&nbsp; I think I will be using CBS as an example of how  NOT to implement Payroll.&nbsp; Came up with the timesheet FF, which I'm quite  pleased with, and got the BEE catch all element sorted.&nbsp; The Payroll users  at CBS are quite excited about the new payroll system... makes quite  a&nbsp;change!         &nbsp;     We are having a  consultancy weekend on the 18th/19th June,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to that but  Vicky's party is on the 19th so need to juggle things around a  bit.         &nbsp;     Finally got the car  back... TFFT!&nbsp; It really does need a bit of a clean after last weeks outing  to the beach.&nbsp; BBQ is still on for tomorrow, which is good, even though the  weather isn't.         &nbsp;     Diet is just not  happening... what I'm I going to do?&nbsp; I need to get my ass into gear and  stick to the point and exercise...         &nbsp;     Right...

      Still didn't get bloody car back.  The part didn't come in,  its only a bloody pipe FFS! They gave me a courtesy car but I had to insure it myself.  Sams car is also playing up, seems to be over revving whenever he accelerates.  He is not too happy about that, especially since he has to goto work on the train tomorrow.    Got a lot to do tomorrow at CBS.  They want to run the payroll tommorrow but we are not really ready gonna be interesting tomorrow I think.

          Didn't get bloody  car back today... the parts didn't come.. oh how we've heard that one before...  shall I call Watchdog?&nbsp; Therefore I didn't go into CBS today. David wasn't  best pleased.&nbsp; Alison was still off sick too.&nbsp; Oh Dear :)&nbsp; Car  should be back tomorrow hopefully. Good job that I didn't go into CBS as still  had some crap to finish off on BAA.&nbsp;          &nbsp;     Had a bit of a scare  earlier when i mailed the Sysao geezer the stuff I'd done on BAA and he came  back and said it was blank.. Almost bricked myself when I saw that the copy I'd  been working on for a few days had gone to be replaced by a empty copy...  Searched all over the lappy and didn't find anything.&nbsp; Finally I decided  that I had no option other then to start the fooker again.&nbsp; Went to webmail  to grab a new copy, tried to save it off and up came this little box saying the  document already existed.&nbsp; Turned out I'd been working on a copy stashed  away in my Internet Temporary Cache.&nbsp; Good thing I never clear the cache  down!         &nbsp;     Went to B&amp;Q  bought some weedkiller for the garden... just been out and nuked the  bastards.&nbsp; Slowly gettingt the garden straight.&nbsp;Doesn't look like  weather will be too good for Sunday's BBQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh  well

      At CBS yesterday... Foudn that the recommend a friend is a lot harder then what I thought... Ali also keep giving me welcome interuptions on FTE budgets and the spreadsheet upload.  We went to Sams Parents for dinner last night, for it was Kim's Chinese birthday.  Its nice to have TWO birthdays in a year!  The food was rather nice, and I love the way her noodles taste.  Sam wasn't very well yesterday, he seemed a little bit drained.  He never takes anything, and so is intent on just sitting/lieing and suffering.  I have requested a final price TWICE now for the server I won on ebay but still haven't received anything back... I'm not going to pay anything until I get a final price, including VAT and carridge.  Patched the XML Publisher into my PROD box last night.  Patches were;  3125496	HR/TCA Merge 2563148	AOL / FNDLOAD Rollup E 3325651	Pasta 3.0.4.0 3412795	XDO Adsplice files 3554613	XML Publisher 4.5 3623558	Documentation Patch   News Items...   urlLink Two Clicks patent to net Microsoft Cash  How stupid can patents get?   urlLink Big problems hit Intel Prescott based notebooks  Fry's Your Sausage!  Later On...........  Did you know I did practically bugger all work on Friday? 20 mins concall, looked at a few MetaLink notes and thats about it.  Spent 2 hours sorting out my mail server... A couple of hours looking at my PROD box (I suppose that  could be counted as work)  Sam didn't goto work but he did drop by to pick up something or other.

      Back at CBS.  The payroll run and finished in 90mins :)  There are several things that are not quite right, including maternity, SSP and child care.  Found a bug in my child care code that returned payment when they shouldn't have... whoops.  Also completely forgot recommend a friend!  So, still got OSP, SAP and SPP to do.  Maternity should be fine once Oracle deliver the seed data.    Also heard that we have won Yorkshire Building Society, and that CBS want to begin Phase 2 in September.  Its gonna be a busy month... I'm at bit torn between payroll at YBS and Phase 2 at CBS.  I get sent wherever I suppose.  The seat belt covers came today... I was so excited that I vacuumed the car :)  Pics Soon...  The water kit and new dvd drive also came today.. get them fitted in tomorrow :)  Just got back from seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban.. its rather good.

      BBQ Day!  Did a bit more running around to get food and what not done.  Moved the house around and lucky the weather held off all evening.  Nic and Ira both turned up too :)  Everyone had a good time and really enjoyed it.  Had a problem getting the new coals going until Mick did an emergency run up to the petrol station and came back with the bag coals... They are spanking but don't last very long unfortuneately.  We'll always use those in the future I think.  As always I'd bought too much food.  We took some pictures of the event and Vic was going through the back pics and found the one of Sam's showing his ass off on the bed :)

      Bit of a running around day really.  Got up at 12'ish... did shopping for BBQ tomorrow, Sam did some housework (!)  Spent 2 hours cleaning up and mowing the garden and taking it all to the tip.  Garden looks much better now... pics soon :)  Went to  urlLink Pride  in the evening.  There were SHIT loads of people.  The queue to get into the gale was humongous!  We ended up in the fountain outside the darkroom which all the coming and goings ;)    urlLink Here  are some pic from Pride 2004 on the BBC website.

      Right... Haven't posted for quite a few days!  So here's an update :)  Monday : Work Tuesday : Work Wednesday : Work Had to go to Bullring in the evening to buy some trousers.  Was most put out to find that only a 44" fitting, and even those were tight.  Also bought some Ben Sherman stuff.  Met Sam and we went to the Fountain in the evening.  He really does like it in there :)  Thursday : Work Drove down to Gatwick in the evening ready for the BAA presentation at Gatwick Airport Friday morning.  Had a nice journey down which only took 2 hours :)  However had a couple of drinks in the bar, and watched these obnoxious straight wankers trying to chat these women up. One of them said to them, your the fittish bird I've ever seen and I could fuck you senseless.  Needless to say, I don't think she was interested!  Didn't sleep AT ALL well.  Kept waking up to make sure I wasn't late for the meeting.  Friday : Some Work, mostly bugger all :) The BAA meeting mostly went OK.  They were asking some questions about upgrade experience of HR/Payroll and of course we haven't got any.  Finally met Gordon Halley, who didn't look at all as I imagined! Started the drive back at 10:30am and got home at 1:10pm with a little stop over to have some executive relief at Oxford Services! Didn't do much in the afternoon, but slept from 4-8, which severely fucked me up in the night, for I didn't sleep until 4.30am ish.  Sam fixed his new lights to his car.. which do look quite look :)  I'll upload a pick soon!  He's quite proud of his car... I hope it lasts him for a while.  Sam went out with his uni mates and got back at about 3am, so couldn't sleep until he got back.  Saturday : Slightly productive day! We did the housework which had been pissing me off! I finally got around to paying for that server.  In fact, at first LloydsTsb refused the payment, and 10 seconds after PayPal told me that it had been refused, the phone went and it was some automated call asking me to confirm the last few transctions on the car as some of them looked suspicious.  I was most impressed. Darren and Mandy came up tonight... They are deffo going on holiday !! :) Mandy's dreading the flight over though, bless her. Weight dropped from 21st 5lbs to 21st 1lb :) pleased at that !

      Spent yesterday doing bugger all really... not sure were all my time went!  However I  HAVE  to go out today and visit Halfords to get some distilled water, Sam needs to drop by Argos to return his Snooper that doesn't really work.  Sam worked last night and I spent the evening watching Alien Ressurection and getting some data prepped to go into my PROD box.  What an exciting life I lead :)  Got up this mornming and just heard that Ronald Reagan has died.  I was just reading a tributes page on the BBC website and some of the comments make him out to be some sort of gentle statemans who bought down the iron curtain, ended the cold war.  Well excuse me but I thought it was Mikhail Gorbachev that was the catalyst for that, RR didn't have much to do with it, other then calling Russia the Evil Empire in 84.  I also seem to rememebr Iran-Contra, the bombing of Tripoli, Invasion of Granada, arming of Saddam, etc.  Look at some of the comments...  President Reagan was not only visionary and courageous leader but also a gifted actor. May he rest in peace.  He ranks with Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt as one of the finest men ever to hold the office. A success as a radio broadcaster, actor, union leader, governor and President. He won election after election; he is still the man for whom the largest ever number of votes were cast in any Presidential election.  Results prove Reagan was a great president. He released hundreds of millions of people from behind the iron curtain without firing a shot.  A great American, a great president, a very decent human being. Thank you Mr President for making this world a better place. Rest in peace.  The People of Afghanistan and I will never forget you; for what you did to send the former Soviet Union packing out of Afghanistan! thank you & we'll Miss you!  What a great man he was. The greatest of them all. God bless him.  If it wasn't for Reagan, I might be speaking Russian now.  Seesshhh......!!!!  And to balance it up here are some ones that see the truth...  He was one of the most irresponsible presidents that we ever had. It is a tribute to America, that we survived his term in office.  To credit Ronald Reagan with the ending of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union is rather silly. Ronald Reagan was quite a normal president, with a regular-guy-charm just as current president Bush has. This helped cover over the fact that he knew very little of foreign affairs, or politics as a whole, and that he was really a president a lot like president Bush is today.  Reagan did everything that was possible to bring the world to war but luckily it didn't happen. He also set the US back 20 years in environmental policy. How is it possible to remember a political leader who cut spending on everything except the military kindly? He was a warmonger.  The most overrated president in American history has passed away. His contribution to the downfall of the Soviet empire was not much. Gorbachev and the Russians themselves were the instigators of that downfall.  I was always told never to speak ill of the dead. I'll just let Grenada, Iran-Contra, his "joke" about unleashing nuclear war on the then Soviet Union and the rest of his record speak for itself.  It's difficult to remember anything good about the Reagan/Thatcher axis of power except that it is now consigned to history. Perhaps he can rest in the peace which he so assiduously denied to others during his years of office.  Ronald Reagan as president understood, exemplified and encouraged the ideal of "America the good." He was popular because he told Americans what they wanted to hear; they were the chosen people of the 20th and 21st century: chosen by history, chosen by the forces of capitalism and chosen by God to be leaders of the free world. How you feel about Reagan's legacy, and how you feel about the current president, is marked by how you feel about the idea of "America the good."
