 So I'm wondering if anybody is reading this actually, so will anybody that has a second or two please email my new addy:  falcion@gmail.com  Yea, I'm just curious to what all is being read on here.  I haven't posted too much lately, and I am sorry for that, not that there is a mass amount reading here so yea, hehe. I will try to catch back up on this!  O, before I forget about this again, I make art, yea, you heard that right. I make art, well GIFs and alter images like the 4 down there at the bottom of this post. So if anybody wants anything done I can try and do it for them cause yea, it is fun, and I'm practicing at the skills for it all.  Women are evil, evil, creatures... They know they have what us males need and flaunt it. Evil little girls, hehe. Not sure about them though, not that trustworthy... Cannot trust them! Well maybe, I don't know.  Wow, my printer just flipped off! How very special. Speaking of Printers, anybody know how to get an  ALARIS WeeCam  webcamera working? Mine is dead and all and it hates me and won't work right!  That is a good post for right now, I'll think of some more like my Decades project or something to talk about later on.

 I've got a new email address!!! YAY! Well not really a new one cause I didn't change email addies but I've added another one to my list of email addies!!! Yea, this new Gmail from Google, I'm testing it out and sofar the only thing I don't like is that process of having to delete email, but because you have so much archive room [1 GB].  Anyhow, I'd say my email but those SPAMer have programs that run the net looking for mailtos

 Shifting ideas and thoughts. I've been wondering about how my life is going and where it is going too. And to tell the truth, I have no clue. As of right now let me tell you how I stand, from the eyes of somebody that were to look at me on paper:      What is on the Paper:  What this means to people:    6'3”:  Damn, he is tall    Junior in High School  Old enough to have a job but why should we give him a job that takes more brains than 'Would you like to biggie size that?' ?    Computer Trained and Learned  Wow, a nerd. Maybe he could work as the assistant burger flipper even!     Single  Yup, plenty of time to work as burger flipper, and confirms nerd.     Heard the 'But I want to still be friends' line once too many times  Ahh! So he has had a girlfriend before! Well damn, maybe not a full on nerd then!    Wouldn't mind a simple walk in the forest or minute alone to enjoy simplicity.  Where the hell did this guy come from?!     Borne in Walnut Creek, California. Lived 2 years in Concord, California. Moved to GP, Oregon at age 2 and living there until present date due to asthma  Holy crap.... Not only does he sound like a nerd but he has a damn disease too! And he lives in Oregon... That explains a lot too....       Well there is me on paper... and in the eyes of the reader... I think I'll do some more of those, they are kind of fun... and I get to make fun of things, mainly myself, but hell at least I get it said because, WAIT!, it is probably all true!

   I miss your arms around me,   Even in the last of hugs. I miss your touch as we walked,   Hand in hand. I miss the lips,   Pressed along mine. I miss the way you looked,   The way you smiled. I knew it was a mistake,   And now I've lost a friend,     But lesson learned,   And yet I still miss.

 Life sucks and then you die. Damn that is so wrong! If life sucked then at least there'd be some freaking pleasure!!! At the moment life is shit and then you die, that works better.... As you can tell, still not over my ex.. Won't be for some while ~if~ I ever do get over her, which I'm starting to doubt.  Let me go on about my 'day' though...  Late start this morning, so didn't have to get to school till 8:58, made it there about 20 minutes early to do Math homework, which I didn't do..[not sure it is hard to guess what my mind was on?]. Then at 9 am this morning the Test from hell was unleashed in Math class and I was told I had two periods to finish it, damn I hate math... [yet I signed up for not one, BUT two AP math classes for next year..]. On with the day though. I go through the test, nothing too hard really but a waste of trees and graphite from my pencil [mechanical of course].  Off to 3rd period at the bell, to Medieval History [yes, that is how it is spelled damn it, ME-DIE-VAL, which means Middle in Latin or something but yea]. Watched another part of 'A lion in Winter'. What a tear jerker...I listened to music instead.  Onward to Spanish!!! This was possibly the high part of the day. Other than the singing in Spanish it wasn't that bad because we danced the La Bomba, and the highest part was that I had two women, [girls if you must call them that], as partners, and I can say, wow, they are not bad looking and not the dumb blonde types which makes it so much better.  Well the damn bell rings, and even though it is 30 seconds late every period, and is not even a DAMN BELL [a tone is what it is]. Off to lunch, Felt like crap as I went too, had to walk by my ex like 4 times... That shot up any good memory for a good part of the day feeling sad for myself... Will need that to go away -soon-. At lunch I did work for 6th period [TOKA-yearbook] and that way I'd be free to do nothing in TOKA.  Ding Ding. *loads a gun, unloads shells into the crappy server that holds the tone maker*. Into TOKA, scanned a picture for a friend in there, they all looked like dead people with 20 pounds of make-up, which, by the way to all women and some men I guess that are reading this is JUST WRONG! Well later in class burnt up some paper [with electricity and heat from a lamp, on acxy, I swear!]. Helped a guy make his senior project too.  Off to 7th period, where I was late to but was excused because I helped the guy with his project. Current Events, did you know that some guy up in Portland tortures his kid every day with protein diets and Aikilo [I think?] exercise??? Yea, we did current events which took me a whole 3 minutes. Then I coloured some CD's and listened to Weezer the rest the period.  Last and least of all was English class. 8th period... Had a person from the office come in to 'explain' [*cough*NAZI*cough*] what to do and what was changing with school next year and what we were to do to sign up for next years classes [SENIOR YEAR BABY!]. We are losing a bunch of classes and teachers due to cuts and also we may be going to block form, and we will be losing 2 periods and daily late start, though you can take an early bird in the morning so that you start at normal time and are able to take an extra class, which I have to do...  So here is my schedule as of right now: First Semester: AP Statistics AP Calculus 1 Intro to Web Design [Yea, I should be in like AP AP web design...] Activities [a fancy name for PE] Creative Writing [a fancy name for sit the hell down and write what comes to mind, kind of like this Blog so yea it works.] LUNCH Senior C.E. [economics in other words] ~Alternative class: Comp Programming I [another form of programming for comps]  Second Semester: AP Stat AP Calculus Advanced Web design ['bout time] Senior Project [I am praying that this class goes goodbye! I don't want to do a senior project] LUNCH Comp Programming I or activities and another Senior economics thingy ~Alternate is AP Comp programming  My AP Statistics class is the early bird because that is the only time to take anything then so I free up a space for my other classes.  So far that has been my day really. I came home and played a game with a good Friend [played BOLO, old Mac game we used to play and re-found for Windows [called WinBolo] ].  Talking to friends about Hating my life right now and trying to tell them not to worry and to not try and give me as much advice and not to tell me everything gets better because they are just lying and they know it too. So this is when I came here to write some. I think this is good for a day? Also, anybody that actually reads this can go to my site,  urlLink THIS SITE , and I will have a chatroom there, and I will have a forum soon I hope so you can get a hold of me. I also am adding today my Online status for Yahoo messenger for those that have it.  I'm off for the day Blog. Don't let the worms and bugs bite, and stop humping my damn keyboard!

 Have you ever had that deep in the pit of your stomach ache feeling? Well I can explain it to you... It feels like you haven't ate in weeks, and you feel like your body is cramping. I guess that would be an improvement of what I feel like right now though...  I really need to do something though, this is a bad way to start of this blog.... Two bad blogs in a row about being dumped... Need something possitive....

 As a note to any that read this, today would of been my 3 month anniversary with my girlfriend, well ex now. Though it seems I was being too much, or something. Just a note to self, do not rely on your girlfriend to be a friend and expect her friends to accept that YOU ARE DATING their friend and that they should be understanding of that atleast. Anyhow, I'm done with [**insert female dog here**]ing about that so enough of that. I am finishing up a writing and to the readers of my blog here is the website it will be off of:  urlLink  My homepage (www.geocities.com/blhcorp/ )   It will be in the Writings section of that, and I believe that I will make a post of the writings here too, but you never know with me.

  I don’t understand why you can buy eggs for seven cents apiece in Malta and sell them for five cents.   I do it to make a profit.   But how can you make a profit? You lose two cents an egg.   But I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don’t make the profit. The syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.   And the people you sell the eggs to at four and a quarter cents apiece make a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when they sell them back to you at seven cents apiece. Is that right? Why don’t you sell the eggs directly to you and eliminate the people you buy them from?   Because I’m the people I buy them from; I make a profit of three and a quarter cents apiece when I sell them to me and a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when I buy them back from me. That’s a total profit of six cents and egg. I lose only two cents apiece, and that’s how I can make a profit buying eggs for seven cents apiece and selling them for five cents apiece. I pay only one cent apiece at the hen when I buy them in Sicily.   In Malta, you buy your eggs in Malta, not Sicily.   I don’t buy eggs in Malta. I buy them in Sicily for one cent apiece and transfer them to Malta secretly at four and a half cents apiece when people come to Malta looking for them.   If you could follow that, then you may be just as crazy as Milo and Yossarian. Yossarian is the main character of Catch 22. For those that have never heard the saying ‘Catch-22’, it is like a paradox. An example of Catch-22 is:  You have to be crazy to be grounded from flying more missions. Officers are supposed to ground crazy people when they ask to be grounded. You are no longer crazy if you asked to be crazy because you would have to be crazy not to ask to be grounded from flying the combat missions.   Catch-22 the book takes place during World War II. This book is banned in many schools because of crude and sexual points. This may have been the best book that I have ever read before though. This book keeps your attention from title to the last words.

 	 The meaning of ‘Dust Bowl’ comes from the extreme climate of the prairie lands in the Mid-United States. At times there were long periods of droughts and then instantly it may change to strong blizzards and then to flash floods thawipeded away crops (those which could make it through the first two extremes). Tornados and dust storms also plagued thprairieses and made the land desolate and near useless. The Dust Bowl has many other names though, like ‘The Dirty Thirties’, ‘The Dust Bowl Days’, ‘Black Blizzard’, or ‘Black Roller’; all of which give their own little insight into opinions of the 1930s and the harsh life styles of the time. 	 The 1930s did not start off like many would expect for how poorly they ended. The Oklahoma Panhandle and top region of Texas had been threceivingnd reciving praise for the massive amounts of wheat crops that were produced. Though as the decade ran on, the crops began to ‘dry up’ and become smaller and weaker, the soil becoming drained and useless from over farming and not using crop rotations.   The harsh weather was mainly focused around Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and other states from ranging between Nevada and Arkansas. People from these states were gidisrespectfuldisrispectful nicknames from those that lived in states that were not as affected by the Dust Bowl, like ‘Okies’, ‘Arkies’, and other names.  	Books have been written about the Dust bowl, like ‘The Grapes Steinbeck’ by John Stienbeck, ‘Out of the Dust’ written by Karen Hesse. Each of the stories tell how the rough life during dust storms, the loss of lives, reclaimsoyed crops, reposesed lands, and pains.  	Many died from trying to get away from the Dust Bowl after the banks reclaimed the lands which the sharecroppers were on, using a tractor which could plow and take the place of many single men working on farms, making the chance for output of the farms higher. This meant that there were many homeless farmers that were forced off their lands that generations had lived on.  	The droinhts began in 1930, in the East, and then by 1934 the Mid-West had been turned into a huge desert,  Though the droughts had been common in patterns in average of 25 years apart, this was one of the worse cases. Though dust was not the only thing that the Dust Bowl brought along; phemonia, suffocation, dehydration, hunger, and many other kinds of deseases plagued lives in the 1930s.  	The main route that was taken to escape the barren lands was Route 66 which ran from East Coast to West Coast. Used car sales took off as familpossessionsost or all possesions so that they would have enough money to buy a car and to make the trip, though many times the cars broke down and they did not have the money to repair them, or they ran out of gas too far from a gas station. Highways were littpossessionsjunk cars, possesions, and bodies/graves of those that did not make it the rest of the way out of the Dust Bowl.  	If and when the families made it away from the Dust Bowl there was the problem of work. Children as young as sevelderked along side eldery, men, and women alike. Many took any job that was available from picking fruit or cotton to the lowest and most demeaning of jobs. Though children ages 14 and below were not allowed to work in factories because of child labor laws, they still agricultureo work in agricolture.   	The Dust Bowl swept around the US, and by 1934 had covered around 75% of the United States and wasseverelying 27 states severly.  On April 14 Black Sunday. The worst "black blizzard" of the Dust Bowl occurs, causing extensive damage. Named after Black Tuesday, when the stock market crashed.  	The ending of the Dust Bowl came in the Fall of 1939, when the rains became normal again, and the grofertilegan to become furtile. During the next few years, World War Two began for the United States, and the country was pulled out of the Depression and the plaifertile again become furtile and productive to the United States.

 1930s  Hot bristled grains of blowing sand, beating cruelly against one and all. Burying life and infecting milk. Down deep, covered, the economy writhes. Up springs his buildings, his dams, his bridges. Not enough though, to save him, buried in a landslide. 100 days, New Deal, a turn around, blowing away some dust. Foreign attacks, battles, murder, camps. Britain, France, USSR. Germany Italy, Japan. Civil war just to their south, with depression in the west. Silent we stay, away from problems because of our own already. And so we struggle to maintain life, here in the 1930s, in the US.  ~Brian H.

 Imagine that you are laying in a hospital bed, after a car crash which the other driver was drunk and now you lay in the Emergency Room, the doctors searching hectically for a liver because your liver began bleeding and is unable to be stopped, a result of the car accident.  The doctors can try and rush to find a liver but you might not live long enough to have a transplant and even less of a chance to have a donor liver available. The chance of survival is slim but cloning can make those chances much better. With the ability to culture and raise organs and body parts there could be a quick match to your liver and the transplant could be a success, with possibly an even better acceptance from your body to the new organ.  Cloning is a subject that most feel strongly for or strongly against. Those again cloning claim that it is unlawful, unethical, and may even halt human evolution. Though those for cloning see it as a possibility for a huge leap in medical fields, in better economy, and even a way to have a loved one that was take by infant death or by premature death from a car crash, a disease, or other misfortunes.  There are more than one form of cloning, which some do not understand. Some people tend to think that cloning is sending a person through some kind of tunnel and they come out as two different people or that they get shot with some special ‘clone gun’ and they are duplicated. Well those are true, it takes a lot for a cloning. There are types of cloning, like organ clones, human clones, animal clones, and even cloning and extinct animal. There is currently groups of scientist which are in the Siberian Tundra searching for remains of Woolly Mammoth which could produce the needed DNA for the cloning of the extinct beast. As I had said earlier there is also organ cloning.  There is also another opinion of cloning which I stand behind. This form of cloning is the same as the others, but –no- human cloning. Most religious humans feel that cloning a human is too close to ‘playing God’.  Cloning is believe that it will halt human evolution because it may deprive all diversity in DNA. This is not necessarily true because if cloning is used to create ‘ideal’ animals, excluding humans, then diseases that effect humans like Mad Cow Disease, Scrapie, Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis, and Creuzfeld-Jacob Disease. These diseases affect animals which in turn effect humans because of the meat is eaten of the animal, milk is drank by the animal, or the genes are passed on and the disease will spread costing more resources and putting more humans at risk.  If animals like cows or pigs were cloned and then used for meat and other products then scientists could help to design a group of ‘prefect’ animals which would be able to produce meat, milk, and other products, which would be far superior to the items which are currently used because the genes which designate the quality of meat and other items that come from the animal would be made to extreme quality. Milk that could fulfill the calcium needed in just one glass, or have just one six ounce steak which would contain the protein and other beneficial vitamins and minerals so that the human body would become stronger.  The first creature to be cloned was Dolly, the lamb. Dolly was the first successful cloning and took around 277 egg cells injected with DNA to produce Dolly the Sheep. It is believed that for humans, with 10,000 eggs injected with foreign DNA that three would be able to make it to adulthood. Because there has been no proof of a human clone these numbers are just educated guesses.   Cloning has become a topic of debate with if it should be legal or not. Cloning should be allowed to be studied and understood so in case there is a time of need the information will be ready and remember, if you were the one laying on that hospital bed in pain, would you want to have to wait and see if they could find a match for you or have a readily cloned organ waiting in case of an accident like this?

 Last night was so long... I worked from 5pm to 11pm and then I couldn't get to sleep until past Midnight. It sucked. O, if anybody hadn't noticed, I added a chatroom and two different counters to the page as well as a 'Bookmark Me' thing. There are also links to blogs that I like on the right side down a little ways so go look at them later on maybe? But on with my night from hell.  I'm not sure what is worse yet when working at JJ North Restraunt.. Time where you are being rushed to wash tons of dishes at once, time where there is -nothing- to do at all so you just -sit- and wait, and hope that a Manager doesn't come in even though there is nothing that you can do, or clean-up. Clean-up lasts until at least 11pm at night, which sucks for making much out of a night. Though it felt tempting to just drive around for an hour or so and see... umm... who was out... yea, that's it.. I didn't though, maybe next time cause I kept thinking about it from 11:30 [when I got home] until past 12 and thinking of places that I could go. O well I guess, always more chances and if not I can die virgin and nobody would give a care. For some reason that sounds... too correct too......  Women are tempting, evil, sneaky, sexy creatures. When they want something they will either come out hard with it or they'll try and hint at it, or if all else fails, they'll just flirt like hell until you give them -exactly- what they want. So yea, just a random though I guess. I have others, like parents can be a pain in the butt sometimes, you try and help them with something and they just turn it around on you. Like I had asked my mom about and hour or so ago if the laundry needed to run because there are whites just sitting in water [soaking I guess?] and she just ignores me about it, then my dad just got home from his first day at work and he is talking and I notice the laundry, -still- sitting there, and try and ask my mom between pauses cause my dad can talk for hours on end sometimes but that isn't always bad. So I try and get a word in and get barked at for 'interupting'. WELL SORRY FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING! Jeez! I mean, you always talk and I swear my family has tendencies to never listen to me anyways. Enough of that though.  My sister's mute cat just jumped up in my lap, makes a strange noise, my guess is when it opens its mouth and his teeth drag against eachother and his gums? He's a cute cat and all, friendly too. Won't be staying here though! Hehe.  I think it is time for me to stop writing/typing and play a game cause I'm rather bored and well... lonesome. So I guess I'll go play a game and write some more later or tomorrow. And before I forget, I have to work from 1-4 pm tomorrow.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.

 Have you ever had one of those days were you don't remember telling somebody to do something? Yea.. Apparently I told somebody to read my blog yesterday, I don't remember doing it though, I doubted she'd like it anyways cause it talks about girls that I've liked/dated, yea, you know what it talks about if you've read it and if not get off your lazy ass and do it then to know. So yea, now she is mad at me, is there a record for most girls that hate you at once? I could be going for a record here even and not know it! Well yea.. Things should blow over soon between us two. She's another girl dating somebody and likes me, or did... I'm starting to think there is a conspiracy? Maybe there is like a sign above my head I can never read that says something like 'Play tricks and cruel games on me!' cause I don't see how in any freaking way I am 'cute' or whatever the hell they say, I'm thinking they need therapy really. While I'm on the topic I should say what people think I look like I guess?  My best friend [since kindergarten, long time huh?]: Larry Byrd [Bird?], that basketball player from who knows how long ago. He and his brother said it a long time ago, like 3 or 4th grade to me, lol, still sticks in my mind, ish funny really.  Parents, Family: They think somehow I look like Harry Potter. For one, I have brown hair, and brown [mostly brown] eyes. I'm not English either so shouldn't this kill their thought of it? Nope, not at all, it doesn't kill the thought for them that Harry Potter is a fictional character which is described in books, no visual pictures anywhere less you mean the Harry Potter from the movies? Yea, right.. I look like -him-? *Falls over laughing.*   O!!!! Good song just came on the Radio, and anybody that lives near GP, Medford, RR, Roseburg, and some other areas MUST listen to KROG! 96.9 GP 97.1 everywhere else near here. But yea, it is a really good station and this song is really good. 'Can you hear the dolphin's cry'. Parents think that KROG is a bad station, cause some of the DJs are not the sharpest crayon in a box of pencils. Otherwise they like most of the music, except for those with 'explicit' lyrics, like Damn, crap, fuck, shit, bitch. Those yea, lol. I wanna have some fun so most people will want to jump over this little part... Damn - Holds water back, man-made. Somebody stuck on a 'N' cause they passed kindergarten with a F-. Crap - People do that, animals do that too. Cycle of life, like sex. Grow up people. Fuck - Speaking of sex, another name for it. Shit - What happens when you crap. Bitch - a female canine. A few words that somebody said and nobody remembers who did but is still good advice: If you have to use a four letter word maybe you aren't ready for life? ...Wait... That wasn't how it went. O well. Not many of the songs have 'explicit' lyrics on the station though they have quite a few drug references in the commercials and some of the DJs do likewise, like at 4:20 they have Bob Marley songs play. O well, I'm either at work or I'm not listening to the radio at that time so it doesn't matter.  I'm running out of things to say... I still haven't got a comment about how anybody thinks the blog looks so I'm wondering if anybody ever visits... I think I'll put on a counter, right by my Yahoo thing and add a few other things for the hell of it and fill that space some. Ciao.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.

  That was so weird... The dream that I had this morning put a whole new meaning to crazy world. Had nothing to do with anybody even, which was bizarre cause I don't normally dream like that. I guess I'll get down to detailing the dream before I forget too much more of it.    ~~~  The Dream~  I start off in a colored dream, I'm not really sure of the place [forgot during the whole waking and time and all]. I remember there was something like a family reunion going on but I know it wasn't my family. This isn't the part that was strange even though... The reunion carries on and what feels like hours later I am walking up hill, in my town, beside the Hull and Hull morgue [I guess it could of been a funeral that I was at earlier in the dream?]. I walk along and up the hill and take a Right, which is mostly a dead end except for the two buildings at the end. I keep walking and to my left there are women carrying what look like artwork, from one truck to another, and back again. [Getting strange yet?]. I wander along down the road, in the -center- of the road. I come to the dead end where there is a wall/building and take a right, down a sharp drop off driveway. Down through a doorway I walk and back through some rooms with art and then down into an 'office' like room which is no bigger than a hall closet. The walls look like they are a painting, just made up of thousands of different paintings just hanging there. I sit at the desk which I don't know how it fit in that office or even got in through that small of a door. Sitting at the other side of the desk is a woman, [of course] nondescript looking and we start discussing something. [This is odd cause most my dreams if there is conversation I normally hear it but this time I didn't and it was in color so it was strange too...]. I woke up too early is what sucked, I didn't get to see what happened after, I woke when I was 'talking' to the person... So yea, crazy.   ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.

 Nothing new from Her, I wish I would hear something... She seems to hate me and I guess I deserve it then, because after all, she cannot really hate anybody and I manage to be the only person in the entire world that she hates. I posted a comment to one of her blogs, she'll probably just delete it, though I didn't really say anything much other than about a product that she talked about... O well... My night sucked again, instead of having any good dreams they were all crappy and consisted of Her being mad at me.. I have a feeling these dreams are going to be going on for a long time. I checked this morning too, to see if she even had me on her messanger lists.. Nope, MSN says I'm not on her list and I'm guessing the same for Yahoo.   Anybody feel like reading what emails when sent back and forth last night after she said she hated me? Ah.. well here they are: [note, Her name is changed to Her or to [name] because even if she hates me, I still care about her and am not going to try and ruin her life.]   Brian -> Her  If you will... please... talk to me.. I really don't want this to happen... I don't know what I can say if anything that will get you to stop hating me, but I want to try, I do, even if it means starting from nothing... Please [name].... talk to me...   Her -> Brian  No. I had to stop friendships in this situation before. You obviously won't give up, so I have to give up on you. No, I'm sick of being torn in half over this. I'm sick of being forced to regret falling in love. Yes, that's how you made me feel. You made me regret falling in love with Ama. I won't take it anymore. No, move on with your life already. You're getting pitiful. You knew&nbsp;I wasn't feeling well today anyway, and you still kept on with being annoying. Screw it, and screw you. Good riddance.   Brian -> Her  ...Good to know that you can just forget me like that I guess... I should of known that it didn't matter as much to you when you said you already loved somebody.. I know I pushed it and I guess I'm paying for it... but I'm not going to forget you... even if you decide to just forget me... I doubt you care, and probably blocked me now.. but at least I'll know that I care for you enough to try and work with things and try to at least be friends...   Brian -> Her [sent from a different email address]  I don't want to give up that easy on you [name].. I want to talk toyou.. I want to at least get a real goodbye from you please... You...you... you probably are just going to block me here too... but I'm hoping you won't... I'd do anything to get you to talk to me...anything, Please [name]... please   &nbsp;  Those are the last words that she said to me and that I said to her.. I doubt I'll see her in vRO even any more... Today has started out shyty already and I doubt it will be getting any better unless things change between Her and I.   ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.

 Well... she hates me... I am the only person in the entire world that she hates.. she said it was basicly impossible for her to hate somebody... but I'm the one she hates... She has me blocked on MSN, yahoo, and by now both my email addresses.... I doubt she'll read this any more even.. but on the off chance that she will.. I just want her to know that I still love her... that I will do anything to get her back as a friend even  &nbsp; ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.

 I'm shoving off my resume off this top index part because I need to know of my page I working right, with my luck it will be all screwed up just like the rest of my life seems to be at the moment...   O yea, I can mention this now, I'm adding this little thing at the bottom of my posts and I'm trying to get rid of that damn ugly time date and by who posted crap under each post.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.

 Last night... Depending on which point of view you look from was either my best night ever or a complete nightmare... She visited my dreams, the one I talked of last time. She did not just visit one, but she was in all of them, colour, black and white, name it and she was there... My night was restless and I didn't get much sleep, though this morning I didn't mind because I got to see her, 'interact' with her, to a dreamlike extent I guess, what my brain wanted to happen... I lay awake for at least an hour, staring at the ceiling, or at my green bed sheets... Thinking of her constantly. Knowing my luck she will be reading this one too.. Think I'm some stocker or psycho or something... Not that it matters right now because she has basically said to piss off and wants nothing to do with me from now on... With luck it was just anger spew and not what she meant... I hope...   I may as well recite some of the horrour to my readers huh? If they excised even or if I am just writing this for my autobiography or for my own hell and pleasure so I can get what in bugging my mind out on paper, [essentially].   I promised that I'd try and cut back on the flirting, because after all she is dating somebody.. I got the feeling that she still wanted a little flirting, just for fun but not too much to make her want anything.. Well that I read wrong totally, I should just ducktape my hands behind myself and do the world a favor. As a matter of fact that is what I told her too, that I should keep my hands to myself and do the world a favor, yet.. As the world of women go this made her upset/mad/pissed/angered/etc at me and she vanished from online... I would like to say, the only thing flirtatiously today was when she poked me I licked/sucked her finger, a typical thing that I've done for a long time, normally just a nip on the end of the finger or whatnot. Well as of right now, it is 8:09 pm, which is 20:09 Military time, on PST [I'm in Oregon, remember]. Either she went to bed, and I won't see her tonight, maybe not tomorrow even, or ever if she is that upset at me.. Or like she told me before, that she says things she doesn't mean when she fumes and it is best not to take it to heart and just give her time to vent alone. This is why I did not message her when she logged off, I'm sure that would be like bringing in a CAT to help with a 20 foot whole I dug by hand. Or the straw that breaks the camels back, whatever way you want to think about it.. Anybody that wants I guess can email me and tell me what they think, all you have to do is send me an email at:  urlLink falcion@gmail.com &nbsp;: and tell me what you think&nbsp;I should do or any thoughts on the matter, I'm the clueless boy in love with a one of a kind girl. Thanks for reading, I might write later on tonight if I have time and my dad doesn't need the computer for&nbsp;work... Mom's calling now, I'll see you all up a little on the page.

 Because I'm not sure if she would want me to use her name I'm not going to but the Woman I will be talking about, I will call her 'Her' and nothing else for now. Now I know I haven't posted in a -really- long time, but nothing really has changed in my life, I have a job, wow ~_~ a dishwasher.. How... Important? Well, there is one thing that has changed with me now though, it is that I was invited to a game, Ragnarok, specifically the Valhalla server. Well, to cut out a few weeks I made two characters, one I don't use any more so no use putting that blab in here but I'll skip to Rithem. He is a bard, he acts like me, which is good, because it is me after all. Well, in vRO, bards are not very strong, at least not alone are they strong, they are a support person, much like a dancer is, until you get them together. And this is when the woman I will call Her comes in, and an entrance she made into my life too.. I'll just back some, not far because I only recently met Her, as of today it will be 4 days, and well, emotions can be a pain in the ass some times cause she had that effect on me, it was an instant attraction. It probably was the best thing so far for a -long- time in my life. I don't want to do something stupid and mess up, well not any more than I did today just a little while ago.... I'll explain I guess, because if you are reading this you either are too bored to care or you actually care and want to know so either way if you made it this far you better read onward. Her and I met 4 days ago, from today. In vRO, at Prontera Fountain and then moved north to the benches to have a little peace from the noise of markets and n00bs. We talked a little and because she is a Dancer, it went well, Her and Rithem, Dancer and Bard. Well we agreed to party and gain some Exp for our characters. Either way, to skip some of the boring things [at least boring to a reader], I will carry you into yesterday, when we exchanged Yahoo and MSN IDs so that we could talk more often and easily. The day carries on and we come to a few more personal parts which I'll just say some cause yea, unless you are Her you don't need to know them and because -she- knows them because she was there, there is no point in me restating. To cut things shorter, I began to like her, a lot, more than I probably should of for having met her so recently but you know, I'm not the most intelligent male in the world and she was hard to not become extremely attached to, *cling* as she puts it. *grins*. At any point I will get to the 'drama' of what happened, how today became a roller coaster of emotions. I begin with waking up, after sleeping so poorly that I couldn't have paid somebody to spit on me. I hadn't had food yet and I went to the net, for a little revival hopefully and sadly She wasn't on yet, and wouldn't be for about and hour. So I read through her profile, she is just about my age, [yes, she is -very- cute because I have a few of her pictures and her eyes are the most attractive things in the world. Her eye! ->&nbsp; urlLink http://pages.ivillage.com/crimsonsilverhawk//eye.jpg &nbsp; ], I thought she was a little older than me, which was kind disturbing, me reading things wrong again of course and that started the conversation off badly when I talked to her when she first got on, and I apologize to Her. Day goes on, we are playing some pool and of course, she is winning. In the mean time we are flirting some, off and on while we play pool and the topic becomes discussion. I don't much like talking about this topic, because, well, as she put it I am coward, LOL, true, and I know I'm shy. Things went down hill fast and things were said that I shouldn't of, [like normal]. Being the wonderfully perfect female that I don't see how anybody could ever mistreat her she seems to of forgiven me, partly how she is putting it now, and well maybe fully by the time I finish writing this. And anybody who knows me knows I'm and idiot at times, and this is one of those times I'm gonna be a big idiot and take a chance for once and stop being such a coward in life. I will put it plain and simple, and those of you that don't like it I guess can go bite yourselves but I believe that I'm falling in love with the most wonderful girl imaginable... And I have to wait and hope that she will take me back fully and then wait until she is available to date.

 Because I missed yesterday I will write some about the events yesterday and also introduce something else to this blog, or well kinda.  Yesterday: 8/4/04... Discovered the meaning of 'Peice of Shit'. They were all refering to this mutt dog that my sister has staying here. She is here for maybe an hour during the day and then at night, -sometimes-. I am always having to take this dog out side and I cannot stand it because the dog has no cordination what so ever, it also could possibly the only creature with negitive IQ standings. If you cannot tell by now that I -really- don't like this dog then you might have problems. But I'll go on with the story of why I cannot stand this dog. Yesterday, around 3:30ish I took out the mutt to go to the bathroom, pea, poop, whatever. Well he goes and peas, ok... Runs back onto the deck in back to the door like it wants to go back in so yea, great, lets go back in cause I really don't like having to take you out dog. We go in, I come back up, talk to some friends, and then go down stairs for a snack and back up again. I go down to make sure all the stuff is taken care of downstairs and I smell something, so I look around, AND THE DAMN DOG TOOK A SHIT ON THE CARPET! NOT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT EITHER!!! NOOO!!! COULDN'T BE SMALL... It was like the runs with a little firmness... it was so wrong... Ok, what is worse, I have to pick up this mutts crap... So I go find some latex gloves, two full rolls of paper towel, a pitcher of water, and a trash bag... I'll skip that part though. Just so you know, I hate the mutt.  Oks.... onto today.... No more mutt stories, thank the Lord!! Today I have been trying to get it to where you can pick your own text colour for this blog but it isn't working yet, the java is kinda screwy so I'm working on it still. On to the 'suprise'. Other than the fact that I work tonight, from 8-10.... I am adding another blog to my blogs!!! A Dream Log Blog! Hehe. I invite you to go look there, the link should appear in the right hand side with my other blog and the Blogs that I like section. Go take a look, I'll have it up soon I am hoping.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.

 Today has been a pretty good day so far, hehe. I had a little 'encouragement' earlier in the morning and that pretty much made my day perfect. Now just to get rid of the person she -just- started dating as like a rebound. Grr... She needed to just wait a little longer... Would have been better, then I wouldn't have to figure out how to get her to leave him or him to just lose interest. Either way I'm not giving up this time on it, even if I have to drive there and tie the guy to a pole until he promises to leave the country. A little over dramatic, just 6 tads and 12 bits huh? I've known her for 5 years so I'm allowed too. Women are confusing, I'll state that again. This time maybe there is hope though? Maybe she'll be the right one this time?  How come I'm starting to sound desperate... I'm only 17.... This really doesn't sound right... lol. Just so long as we are only with each other everything is good I guess though, so that is all I have to wait for, and make sure this time it stays that way too. Commitment, think Commitment.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.

 Well thanks to the comment by Sarall I have the font colors that I'll use now for a while, hehe. Just move your mouse over the font to see a different color, I'm contimplating doing the same for the font too so it changes the font but ya never know. So far though I just woke up after my two sisters and the stupid dog that my sister has here were playing 'Who can be the loudest, stupidest idiot' game. I swear if there was a prize for that they'd have it.... The Darwin awards aren't even bad enough at times for them.  I just found out that one of my friends started her own blog, she hasn't gave me the address to it though... Though she did read me some of what was in it, the part about me. She starts school [high school] tomorrow, which is just so wrong cause it is summer still, I mean! I don't even start school til around Sept 5th or 10th! This is so early! Hehe.  Does anybody know how shyty minimum wage is!? 7.05$ an hour! Holy Cow! You cannot even live on that! Jan 1st we are supposed to have min wage bumped to 7.25$ an hour, which is easier but still it is not enough to live off! I mean come on! My car takes like 30-50$ to fill it and I don't even have car payments and it is rough to get by. Get my first pay check on Thurs. though... Working 4 days straight though so the one after will be a pretty good sized check at least, still not 40 hrs a week though. Maybe I should try and get the Desktop publishing job that my Mom found, I'll look into it.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.
