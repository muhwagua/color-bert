      So I didn't do a whole lot today.  Early on I took some Tylenol which happened to be for la noche instead of extra strength...so I pretty much slept the day away.  I've been reading past journal entries of Joe's and I can't understand why I was drawn to him.  Sure he is good looking, but he is very cocky.  Who knows?  I think I'm starting to like Nick...which could lead to some good things.  However, I need to figure out what ol' Andy is thinking about "us", because I don't want to mess our friendship up.

      Today I hung out with Laura, which hasn't happen in a few weeks because of my absence.  I have missed her so much!  She is really kind and genuine...and I just love hanging out with her.  She told me about everything that has happened with Tim lately.  I've decided that he is a bastard because he won't go out with her, but treats her as if they are going out.  Whatever...  We saw Stepford Wives (which we both liked) and went shopping.

      So yesterday I was in a car accident.  I was pulling out of this driveway, there was a car in the other lane, I slid on gravel and pulled out as they were switching lanes and we collided.  They hit me so hard I spun around...kind of scary.  The mother of the girl who was driving was really rude about it, but the daughter (who didn't have her license yet) asked if I was okay.  They took me to the hospital because a witness said my head was flopping around, even though I didn't want to.  Maegan called me as I was sitting in my car sobbing.  After I told her that I had been in an accident she ran about a mile to come get my car so it wouldn't be towed.  Then she came to the hospital to keep me company because my mom was out of town working.  Some other friends (Andy, Nick, Jonny, and Josh) showed up as well.  It was nice knowing that I have friends like that.  They made me laugh.  Maegan's dad also showed up to take care of me I guess.  I really owe them but I'm not sure what I can do to repay them.  Any suggestions?  Oh and Andy's mom bought me flowers and left them on the porch today...how sweet.

      Yeah, I have a hickey but I'm not so sure if I'm proud of it.  I mean, yeah I had a good time yesterday, and I was really looking for some ass.  But thats all--ass, not a relationship.  And I'm afraid that he thinks it is more.  Or that I least like him like that, and I don't think I do.  I don't know what to do...

      Yes I realize this must be really pathetic being the third post but I thought I might add that I made out with Andy today.  I'm kind of confused about the whole situation.

      The trip began by flying in the most impressive airplane I've had the pleasure to ride. Each seat had their own personal screen where you could choose from a number of movies, play games, or watch downward looking camera, among other things. Very entertaining. We arrived in Stockholm, picked up our car, and drove to Uppsala. We ended up driving the wrong way on some streets because the road signs are different and they took a while to get used to. Our hotel had beautiful wooden floors and fluffy feather comforters. Little did I know this would be commonplace in the hotels we would be staying at. We visited the oldest church in Scandinavia, pretty impressive for a church, very decorative. We also walked down the cobblestone streets window shopping. Great place, I must say.   On the way to Kirsten's (a second cousin) we saw some ancient burial mounds. They were also impressive. I mean they were basically hills, but I had a good time. We stopped in a small town, Horndal, where my father proceeded to steal a poster with a ping-pong champion Anna Berglund (a relative of mine) on it. We decided not to return to that town.   Kirsten spoke English very well as did her children Linda and Terese, and her husband, Kenneth, although they all thought they were horrible. Linda was really funny. When I asked her what St. Lucia was about she replied, "Fucking religion."   Kirsten and Kenneth made breakfast and guess what we had one time...horse!   When we went to our rooms in an apartment down the street we saw a woman with dark old-fashioned clothing on. By old-fashioned I mean high collars, butt enhancer things (I don't know what they are called...sorry). Kirsten said that they were kind of looked down on because they weren't viewed as trust-worthy. She also said that her non-violent/safe town didn't react well to the Gypsy moving in. Someone broke the windows on her car, trying to drive her out. Kind of sad.   The next day we met relatives. None really spoke English very well. Leif was one of them...very cool guy, funny too. (Kirsten translated). Karl-Inge was another relative. He made a nickel-harpe (some stringed instrument) and played it for us. There was also this incredibly old lady named Astrid Berglund (Astrid! I love it! It's a sign!) who was married to Bengt (Bengt! I love it! It's a sign!).   Kirsten taught us some words that night, like sprattlegubbe (jumping jacks), mygg (mosquitoes). And I ate horse for breakfast!? Kind of bizarre, tastes like ham.   The Euro-Cup was going on while we were there. We watched some of the games with Kenneth, a football enthusiast to say the least. When he couldn't explain a call in English he would get frustrated and would call Kirsten to translate.    Goteborg was next. Goteborg was quite the modern city. I had a lot of fun walking around, shopping, you know how it is. There were a lot of malls and shops. Sweden was playing in the Euro-Cup that night and my father thought it would be a good idea to go to a pub, to experience the feel of the true fans. Boy was he right, there was cheering and screaming and so forth. Luckily Sweden won, because otherwise, I would have feared for my life.   The next day we went to an amusement park, quite like Michigan Adventure. I rode all of the big rides. Fun times.   The next stop was Stromstad, a beautiful, tiny fishing town right on the rocky shoreline. We also stayed in a beautiful hotel with two bathrooms, wooden floors, a balcony the size of my room, and two floors with a spiral staircase connecting them. The balcony looked right out onto the bay. It was amazing! We drove for a while to the only fjord in Sweden, then climbed a lot of the rocks so we could see water for about 270 degrees. I wanted to stay there forever, as cliche as it sounds.   After leaving Stromstad we visited a castle/fortress. It was beautiful as well, and had an amazing view over intersecting rivers. It was quite windy at the top of the towers. I was wearing my sandals (hey, I thought there would be flat ground), and I slid all over the cobblestones. At the top of one tower I could smell brownies. Later I learned there was a cookie factory several miles away.   There was another castle (although I can’t remember quite when we visited). We could only go into part of it because there were no more English tours, but it was interesting.   Next was Stockholm (through Norway). Stockholm was quite the town, right on the river. It was beautiful. We watched another soccer match between Sweden and Italy (which ended in a tie). The Italians were...let's just be honest here...beautiful and quite enthusiastic. When Italy scored they were cheering...kissing the screen, and when Sweden scored a few stomped out muttering words under their breath.   We visited the Drottingham theater as well as the palace in Stockholm.   Old Town, in Stockholm, seems just that-old, with new shops. I had a good time just walking around, looking at things. Then we came back...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You can find the pictures at  urlLink http://hannahspictures.photospot.com

      I adamantly oppose the death penalty...always have. If you don't I recommend the documentary  Deadline , it might change your mind.  On a completely different note (I obviously need new transitional phrases, I use that one way too much), I just listened to this message that I got from "Florida", a kid at camp with Andy in Ohio. I will attempt to transcribe it...it is funny as hell.  Hey Hannah, this is "Florida" a.k.a. Alex Rushin, at lacrosse camp in Ohio, and Andy, a.k.a. Michigan, who went to Ohio State, so if you have no idea who I'm talking about just ask around cause I'm sure you dont know who the hell he is, well technically he claims to have had sex before, and I called him out said, "No, Michigan, you are a virgin." Ok, thats what I said, those exact same words, and if you dont believe me you can ask him, and thats that, well anyway, he told me that he had sex with some girl named Hannah and we called you up, ok, got that? Anyway, so what I need you to do is call me back on my cell phone...you can call me Florida, you can call me Alex, whatever, I'm pretty cute by the way in case you were wondering, so there won't be a problem there, then there's a cute kid too, anyway, you can send me a picture too if you want, we're just trying to find out if Michigan has had sex before or if he is still a virgin like we believe that he is, alright, peace.  Hahahaha...I laughed for minutes about that one.

      I have quite the thing for posting twice in one day, don't I?&nbsp;   Anyway, I just finished a book I began earlier today:&nbsp;  Like Family , written by none other than my ex-stepmom.&nbsp; I was really surprised, she writes beautifully, poetically.&nbsp; I never knew those things about her.&nbsp; As I read I could picture her exactly, even as a young girl she appeared 30 because that was how I knew her.&nbsp; I tried fitting in what I knew of her sisters into the story, but then got lost in the words.&nbsp; I enjoyed it.   I was reading someone's journal and a question posed was, what is the best feeling?&nbsp; The girl answered something about family, which I respect, and trust me, I love my family, but after reading the question I immediately thought of an actual feeling.&nbsp; I absolutely love it when an airplane is landing.&nbsp; The wheels touch down and everyone's head jerks slightly at the impact.&nbsp; Then you lean forward your hips straining against the seat belt as you hurtle what seems like thousands of miles per hour, the wings upturned in an attempt to slow the plane down.&nbsp; That is my favorite feeling.   On another, non-similar note, I went to Ohio today and yesterday to visit my brother.&nbsp; We went to a baseball game (Indians/Tigers) and visited the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&nbsp; I was just telling my friend that I don't really enjoy baseball, and I'm not the biggest fan of halls of fame, but I had a fantastic time.&nbsp; I could be sitting in a field with my brother and my dad and have a good time.   Oh...now to try to get to bed.

       A.  I doubt that I will ever be happy with the way I look; in the mirror, in pictures, in other people's eyes.  There is one picture that I like of myself.  One, in all of the million billion pictures that have been taken of me.  I hear a lot of people saying they were geeky in high school, no one liked them, they were ugly, but I doubt they had the same complete lack of self confidence that I have.   B.  My brother does not have a bad mother.  I never really thought she was  bad,  but I never thought she was that great either.  She always moved around, and I know that kids need a good base, a home that they can come to.  She is wonderful as far as I can tell.  She loves Connor, feeds him, and thats what really matters.  Why I doubted this isn't really clear to me.  I guess because she "took" my brother away from me at times (my parents are divorced, as are my brother's parents) that I didn't really like her.  But I never really didn't like her...I'm lost.  C.  I will always feel at home on the road.  I was raised on the road.  (Ha!  That sounds so funny, it is only partially true.  In all actuality I traveled a lot as a child, and I guess a lot now, but as a child most of the destinations were reached by car.)  I think only really smart people/really stupid people can travel for a long time on the road.  The smart people think of ways to entertain themselves, see the value in traveling, the stupid people are too stupid to get bored...(I tried, I'm not sure how to explain my feeling on that one very well.)  D.  I can get by without people at times.  Other times I need them like air...no joke.

      I have been looking back on my entries lately.&nbsp; I just discovered one that described my sadness when listening to Jeff Buckley (because of Joe).&nbsp; That was a sad attempt at romanticism.&nbsp; I get sad when I listen to Jeff Buckley because he has an amazing voice, touching lyrics, and he died and therefore no longer has the chance to create music.

      Actually I love my teeth.&nbsp; A little too much.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; I went to the dentist today, quite gladly I might add.&nbsp; And lo and behold, I have a cavity.&nbsp; The dentist explained that because I have deep crevices that brushing/flossing could not have prevented this decay.&nbsp; Well, that doesn't make it go away, does it?&nbsp; Doesn't fix the fact that it happened, hell why do I even brush if it isn't to prevent decay?&nbsp; At least it is small.  I just got pissed off because I love my teeth and I don't want to lose them to tiny bacteria.

      Is it possible that I like Jose?&nbsp; Because I start to cry every time I think about him.&nbsp; Maybe it is just what he stands for.  But he was a good dancer, and he was fun...  Maybe I'm just not taking enough medicine (no special joke intended).

      Heeeeeeeeey  &nbsp;  So life has been not so great since I've returned from the wonderful, glorious&nbsp;land they call Mexico.&nbsp; I miss it.&nbsp; I miss the people I met there--Benito, Jose, Fernando, Diego, the Arturo(s).&nbsp; I feel really depressed.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I don't feel like doing anything.&nbsp; I want to hang out with my friends, but then again, I'd rather lie&nbsp;on my bed, supine,&nbsp;and cry/sleep.  &nbsp;  On another (but not that different) note, I sent Jose an e-mail today.&nbsp; I hope he returns my letter.  &nbsp;  Maegan informs me that Andy likes me and, not just that, wants our relationship to go somewhere.&nbsp; How the hell do I handle this situation?&nbsp; I can't as of now.&nbsp; That is why I am running towards the flatlands of rural Illinois in a few days.&nbsp; Maybe I can avoid him until he forgets my name.  &nbsp; God...no wonder I am depressed.&nbsp; I even bother myself sometimes.

      Well I just got back from Mexico and I miss it so much.  &nbsp;  Let me try to recount my trip.&nbsp; It began incredibly early in the morning.&nbsp; And although I complained (wait, I didn't really complain, but I sure wanted to) it ended up being good because we were able to spend the first day on the gorgeous beach.&nbsp; I will have to post some pictures...it was just so damn beautiful.&nbsp; After sunset we went to the markets to look for souvenirs and such.&nbsp; Everyone is so friendly there!&nbsp; They all asked me if I had a boyfriend...and that they would be my "Mexican Boyfriend".&nbsp; Everyone kissed me on the cheek and held my hand, touched my back, etc.&nbsp; Honestly, and this is not an exaggeration in the least, about 17 people asked me that.&nbsp; One, Diego, even offered to take me dancing, he would pay the cover charge.  &nbsp;  The next few days were pretty similar.&nbsp; I met this nice guy, Jose, and he told me where I could get cheap beer, and we talked.&nbsp; Every time I saw him after that we would talk for a while...just have good conversations.  &nbsp;  We went to Chichen Itza as well...rented a car and drove out there.&nbsp; It was amazing how advanced the Mayans were.&nbsp; They had accurate calendars and they also had this amazing thing where you could stand near the temple, clap, and it the echo would make the sound of a sacred bird.&nbsp; A few days later we went to Tulum (which was right on the beach, also beautiful).  &nbsp;  All the while, at nights, we would venture to the clubs.&nbsp; On the way there was this lady begging, and she had the most beautiful children, so I would give her money and have a little conversation with her every day.&nbsp; I also saw this cute little Mayan boy, Benito, selling bracelets, and I talked to him.&nbsp; I asked him his name, and where he was from...stuff like that.&nbsp; When I asked him how old he was he got kind of nervous...I think he was too young to be selling things.&nbsp; But we also became friends...we would talk when we saw each other on the street.&nbsp; Every night, even when we didn't go to Jose's bar, we would talk.  &nbsp;  One day we went on this  Alltournative  thing.&nbsp; First we pedaled through the forest to a cenote (which is like a very clear sinkhole) and went snorkeling in that.&nbsp; It was amazing...the water was so clear you could see the bottom, which was, in places, 50 feet.&nbsp; Another cenote, not as amazing, but still better than a lot of the places I have been snorkeling, was visited.&nbsp; Then I went on three ziplines through the jungle.&nbsp; I have never done anything like that..ever...and I probably won't have the chance to ever again.&nbsp; After the zipline-ing we were blessed by a Mayan priest-type-guy, and then had a traditional Mexican lunch.&nbsp; It was an unbelievable time.  &nbsp;  So now...I find myself at Jose's bar, downing margaritas and tequila shots with the skill of an accomplished drinker.&nbsp; Our waiter was the most handsome man I have ever seen in my life.&nbsp; This certain Argentinean, Fernando, had dazzling brown eyes, thick, curly, kind of longish hair, a perfect nose, and a charming smile.&nbsp; After a few drinks he asked me to dance and of course, after gazing at his beauty, I had to.&nbsp; So up I went, onto the bar, grinding and talking with the visual man of my dreams.&nbsp; Not only was he beautiful, but he was a great dancer, and a kind person.&nbsp; We talked and talked.&nbsp; I started stumbling around after a while because, as I stated, completely drunk.&nbsp; Fernando tells me that I, "don't have to worry, I wouldn't let a girl like you fall."&nbsp; After a few songs, and many many many shouts/whistles, I returned to my seat.&nbsp; Two more margaritas later I had made friends with all of the waiters in the bar.&nbsp; Completely drunk, I ended up kissing two of them (I'm pretty sure they made the first move, but, admittedly,&nbsp;I did not resist), and dancing with all of the others.&nbsp; Each one told me I had beautiful eyes/I was  bonita /that I had to return the next day.&nbsp; I even danced with Jose.&nbsp; One of the men that I drunkenly made out with looked like a Mexican mobster, with long curly hair, but a large smile.&nbsp; This man was quite a few years older than me, I am sure of it.&nbsp; But I must say, it was the best kiss/kisses I have ever had.&nbsp; I'm sorry, you white boys just can't compete.  &nbsp;  Then I had to say goodbye to all the friends I had made.&nbsp; I hate being home without being able to flirt with Fernando and Jose.&nbsp; And poor Benito...I miss him.&nbsp; I miss them all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I miss being gazed at by everyone on the street.  &nbsp;  I must return soon.  &nbsp;  Oh and by the way, Jose gave me his e-mail address so hopefully we will keep in contact.  &nbsp;

      Well it took me about 10 years to learn to appreciate the Indigo Girls.  My mom used to play them on the way to the beach, on the long trip to Arkansas, and when I heard their voices I would roll my eyes and try to fall asleep.  A few days ago I was humming a song and I realized it was one of theirs.  I pulled out a CD and listened to it and was pretty amazed.  I usually don't listen to this type of music, and there were a few songs that I didn't enjoy, but they were so passionate...intelligent.  I can't stop listening to it...reading the lyrics.  I think my mother is proud.    On another note I went out to Tasty Twist with Ben yesterday.  It was fun...and I think he had a good time.  I wonder how the whole Heather thing is going...we didn't really talk about it.

      I love it when people tell me I'm beautiful while I am asleep, or while crying.  These are the times when I am the most vulnerable and least likely to try to act like others expect me to.  This is when I am most like my true self, so when people compliment me during these times it means the most to me.  The worst thing someone could say to me is that they hate my laugh.  I laugh all the time...it is such an integral part of my life.  I would be so self concious if all the time I was doubting my laugh.  On another note I'm planning on drinking with Nick...sounds like fun!

      So I was looking over some previous posts and they all say the same damn thing:  I didn't do anything, I had a good time, blah blah blah.  So besides deciding that I'm boring, I have decided to answer/pose random questions to help myself out.  Feel free to leave a comment.  To be continued later...because I am way too boring to start now.

      Yesterday I went to my mother's friend's beach house.  I had a good time, but I was ready to go home that night.  I didn't want to stay because there were 12 year old girls, and 50 year old parents and no where for me to fit in.    Sometimes I feel like I never fit in.

      So yesterday I went to my cousin's open house/graduation party.  I didn't really want to go because I thought that she didn't like me, but I ended up having a great time.  It was a long drive, but Rachael is so funny.  Natalie was there, and some of Rachael's friends.    We drank...a lot.  It was a good time.

      Whilst at my father's house we attended somewhat of a pre-reception party and I met a wonderful kid (only about 8 years older than I).  He likes the Pixies and the Shins.  He thought I was in college.  His two favorite movies of the year were Eternal Sunshine and Lost in Translation.  He is working on his Ph. D. in psych.  He said I looked like Scarlett Johansson.  He got accepted at NYU.  He is a socialist.  He has lived in Rome, been to Sweden, and perhaps would like to live in Stockholm.  He is smart.  He wears black.  He has a crooked nose.  He asked my dad if I could go to the bar with them.  He has a cool girlfriend...

      Well I couldn't make it to work today, thats 60 dollars gone to waste.  I'm pretty sick, coughing, gagging, it is not pretty.  I didn't even watch any good television shows which is also pretty depressing.  Today I signed up for soccer.  This will probably be the last team that I play on because I don't really want to play on varsity.  But who knows, the past two years I have been talked into it, some things never change.  I'll update when I actually have something interesting to say.  Here's to wishing I was back at the Dave concert...

      ...because I work on the computer for 8 hours a day.  It can get pretty tedious at times, but I'm fine if I have my music with me.  I listened to Dave until my iPod ran out of batteries.  I wish I was back at the concert, dancing, listening to good music...mmmm.  I'll leave you with a little taste of the concert...   Forget about the reasons and The treasons we are seeking Forget about the notion that Our emotions can be swept away, kept at bay Forget about being guilty, We are innocent instead For soon we will all find our lives swept away                                                       -DMB

      Wow, I had the most amazing weekend. After I got off from work (which is going well), we drove to Natalie's in Illinois. The next day Aunt Monty and Uncle Jerry renewed their vows, and there was quite the party. My cousin Rachael is so funny, I def. need to hang out with her more. After dark Natalie, her friend Amber, and I started drinking, and it wasn't long before I was really drunk. There was this guy named Phil, or hot guy #3. He was def. trying to get with me, and it was fun flirting with him. But then my uncle called me over and said he was watching me, very protective, and kind of scared the guy off.  The next day was the DAVE concert. It was amazing. Natalie and I got drunk and then went dancing all over the place. So many guys tried to get in our pants, kissing us, but we danced and had a GREAT time. I love Dave, and I love the concert, get drunk and dance atmosphere. I must continue going to great concerts.  Here is the set list:  Don’t Drink the Water One Sweet World Fool To Think Sugar Will Stay Lover Lay Down I Did It  Seek Up Rhyme & Reason Hello Again Joy Ride Loving Wings Where Are You Going Jimi Thing Crash Drive In Drive Out What Would You Say Crazy Easy Tripping Billies

      Despite all my qualms about living where we do (read:  not wealthy), I love it here.  Sure I don't play with the kids, or really go outside much, sure I don't really like to answer the door, but there is a sense of community.  I feel asleep listening to the old couple next door mumbling in Greek, I love it.  I mean, no one else I can think of has that kind of opportunity where they live.  They live in silent seclusion, the noise of their neighbors drowned out by the sound of their air conditioning.  I admit, sometimes I would like to live in a house where I couldn't hear the neighbors fighting at night, or where no one's grass is overgrown.  But that just shows the impersonal side of me.  I like living in a neighborhood with character and heart instead of fancy architecture (although I do dream of a beautifully constructed home).  I should really stop complaining about where we live.  Mostly, I love it.

      I saw  The Village  today with Nicolai, my beautiful big headed Russian friend. Kind of a disappointing film, but nevertheless, I had a good time...he can make me laugh-a lot. We make fun of each other for being stupid, for having insane fears, for the people we've been attracted to. I just feel like myself around him.  And I leave you with a funny quote:  With Iraq plunging into chaos and gas prices at record highs President Bush took time out this weekend for a ride on his bicycle, but unfortunately he fell off and sustained cuts to his face and hands. Apparently Bush was distracted by the enormous responsibilities of the presidency. I'm just kidding. He hit some gravel or something." -Craig Kilborn             Oh yeah, Aaron also asked for my phone number...said he would be giving me a call soon...
