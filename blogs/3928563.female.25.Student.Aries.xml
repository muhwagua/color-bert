      My boyfriend told me a few months ago that he was molested as a child. He was really drunk when he told me and now he clams up whenever I try to talk to him about it. Looking back, I can see so many ways that this has affected our relationship. I really want to be able to discuss this with him. How can I start him talking?  -----  First, a note of caution: if you are in a casual relationship, you might want to think twice about participating in your boyfriend's healing process. Healing from sexual abuse is a long, hard road. If you don't want to put in a lot of time and energy supporting your boyfriend, you need to consider your own boundaries and you need to stick to them from the beginning. That said, a well-placed ear, caring support, and BELIEF in their experience can all be great gifts for abuse survivors.  If your boyfriend's clamming up, it might be because he doesn't want to talk about his abuse with a) anyone or b) you. So don't bulldoze him into revealing all if he's not ready. Instead, I suggest bringing the topic up in a way that leaves him a choice on whether or not to share with you. Something maybe like, "Boyfriend, a while back you told me a bit about being abused as a child. I just want you to know that if you want to talk about it now or any time, I would love to be there for you. I don't want to pressure you, but I do want to be able to support you as much as I can. What do you think?"  Here are some more ideas about talking your partner:  1) You should pick a quiet time (NOT during, right before, or right after sex) when you both are relatively relaxed and have some hours to devote to the discussion.  2) If your partner wants to talk about his past but is having difficulty, try taking baby communication steps instead of aiming for a full revelation right from the start. Talk about WHY he can't talk about the abuse, for example.  3) AVOID saying anything that could be remotely construed as blaming the victim or denying the assault. This includes the following statements: "But why didn't you tell anyone?""I don't understand how no one could know if it really happened." "Your mom would NEVER do something like that--she's so sweet!" "But why did you go home with him if you didn't know him?" "I just don't understand how MEN could be RAPED." Trust me. Large parts of society (and possibly a good part of your boyfriend) are already blaming him for the abuse, so...  4) Keep your doubts to yourself. It will be a nice, and NECESSARY, change of pace for your boyfriend to hear no judgements from you--just sheer belief and support. "I believe you" and"It's not your fault" should be your twin mantras from now on. Warning: your partner's story may come in different versions, and he may even contradict himself. Just keep listening and supporting him, without challenging him on the details. Memory is a tricky thing, particularly when it's linked to such a traumatic event, with often shameful overtones.  5) Ask open-ended questions ("And how did that feel?") as opposed to yes/no questions. Listen waaay more than you talk. Let him guide the discussion. Don't rush in and offer tons of advice--he's the expert on himself.  6) Realize that if your boyfriend confronts his past, he will need enormous amounts of tact, support and caring from you. You have a tough role to fill, and your boyfriend will have too much on his plate to support you emotionally in this difficult situation. Get the support you need, but be VERY sensitive to your boyfriend's privacy. Don't, for example, go blabbing around the circle of your mutual friends. If you must confide in a friend, pick a very discreet person your boyfriend doesn't know.  Recovery from sexual abuse and assault is a long and difficult process. Very serious trust, intimacy, and sexuality issues are par for the course. You and your boyfriend need much more information and help than I could cram into this little column. I STRONGLY recommend going to a therapist skilled in sexual abuse issues.  Also, you may want to check out some books on the topic. The bible in this field is  The Courage to Heal , by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis. Sadly, it's oriented toward female survivors. They have a bit of a franchise, so you can check out their other books as well. You could also look at  Outgrowing the Pain: A Book for and About Adults Abused As Children  by Eliana Gill. One book I've heard recommended for partners is Ken Graber's  Ghosts in the Bedroom: A Guide for the Partners of Incest Survivors .

       What are some good ways to tell your partner to stop doing something or try something new in bed? I'm a pretty polite person, so I don't want to just come right out and say,"Man, you really suck at this. And not in a good way."   -----------------   What a  great question! I just love talking about communication. But, like most of the world, I'm a lot better at talking than actually communicating.  Sooner or later, you WILL want to give someone feedback about sex. Even if you're in bed with the most skillful person in the world, you're lots different than the last piece of ass they had their hands on. It's important to be able to point out those little differences in a nice way and to point your buddy in the direction of what makes YOU happy.  Talk about a common situation: I once dated a guy after my friend finished with him. She LOVED the way he gave head. Best in her life. After the rave reviews, I was pretty anxious to take his tongue out for a test drive. Sadly, when I finally had him where I wanted him (in between my thighs), I was NOT impressed. He knew his way around, he had a passion for the work, he was dedicated and tireless (probably has tongue cramps to this day), but I just wasn't feeling it.  During the next day's post-mortem, the first thing my friend asked me was: "Did those circles he made with his tongue drive you nuts or what?" Well, I HATED the damn circles. I just didn't know how to say so without being rude. So this column is for both of us, babe.   There are three main methods of giving feedback in bed. The first, the  Non-Verbal , is most tempting and used by 99.9% of the population. Want him to deep throat you? Gentle hands on the back of his head. Hate a finger up your ass? Remove the offender promptly from your danger zone. Ok, so it's easy, and it doesn't ruin the mood like an "Uhm....excuse me? You, down in front?" But beware, my friend. You run the risk of seeming abrupt or being misunderstood. You may think you're giving a "Do Not Enter" signal three miles wide, and your partner might think you want her to replace her finger with a 12-inch "super-wide" dildo.  The  Sandwich  method requires finesse. No, I don't mean inviting your best friend to drop by for an instructional demonstration. Rather, you say something nice (a lie), then say something not as nice, but in as nice a way as possible (the truth), and then finish it off with something nice again (insert lie here). This is a good one to use in the heat of the moment: "I LOVE it when you give me head. Could you maybe...just a bit right, and up, and WATCH THE TEETH and OH, that's really,really good. God, you're a pro."  The  Direct Approach  is the scariest, but most mature way to go. Say you'd like to get a good spanking, but your partner never seems to get the hint when you wear your assless undies and fling yourself over his lap. What to do? I say, come right out with it. Pick a good moment. If you're not used to talking about sex with your partner, it's going to be awkward over the breakfast table. I've found about 5 or 10 minutes after the start of a makeout session to be ideal for a minor/slightly kinky request.   Bat your eyelashes a little, act all seductive, and say something like "You know, sometimes I just get so damn horny when I think about being spanked. Is that something you'd be into?" Prepare for defensiveness from your partner (you ARE offering constructive criticism, after all). This is a good time to ladle on the compliments and reassurance. Remember, one issue at a time is just about all most people can take without turning into a fetal ball of insecurity. So don't bring up all your complaints at once, ok? Finally, if you need to discuss a heavy topic, disregard everything in this column and see the next one.  Tactful communication in bed is an art form. You might be tempted to just shut up and fuck, thinking it's not worth the trouble of correcting a partner's bad habits since a) you'll never see this person again or b) you'd really like to see them again so you don't want to offend them. Well, you're wrong. First of all, for the good of humanity, you want to leave your partner a little better than you found them. Curbing a bad biting habit, for example, is practically a tax-deductible act of charity. Second of all,you can really make a good evening great (or a bad evening, well, salvageable) by sharing a few pointers on what makes you tick.

      i've been having a spanking fantasy a lot lately. if i get my partner to spank me, will i keep wanting it more and more until i can't get off without it? --------------------------------------   Let's say  you try spanking, and the worst happens. You love it. You quiver whenever you see a wooden spoon. You spend your day dreaming up naughty acts so that you can be punished come sundown. Remind me again, what's the problem with that? Sounds pretty fun to me! If some safe, sane, consensual activity gets you hot, why deny yourself?  Besides, if you enjoy a variety of sexual activities now, you'll likely enjoy them just as much post-spanking. You'll just have a great new sensation to work with. I say give it a try, with your partner’s consent. Check out the spanking tips below and remember that it takes a few practice tries for reality to live up to fantasy.   Spanking 1-2-3  Keep a spanking session light for the first time. The strokes should be gentle and teasing, with lots of caresses in between. Leaving a session wanting more is way better than leaving it feeling overwhelmed.  Try having the spankee lie across the spanker's lap (the classic position) or kneeling beside the bed with head and chest down on the bed. The ability to relax and give yourself over to the spanking is key. Spanker: it's a really nice touch to tease your partner's genitals during the event.  The spanker should use her hands instead of a paddle for the first sessions. It's more intimate, there's less danger of hitting too hard, and it's quite delicious to see a bum squirming under your bare hand. If your spanking arm is getting tired out from night after night of chastisements, it might be a good idea to look into some paddles. Be creative with household items like hairbrushes or ping pong paddles, or invest in a paddle from your local sex shop.  Jay Wiseman, in his book SM 101, advises cupping your hand and spanking upward, as opposed to a downward stroke. He also cautions that gravity can pull asscheeks down, so make sure to spank on the lower part of the buttocks on a kneeling person. You can also spank the genitals (start gently!), the breasts, and just about anywhere on the body.  Feedback is the MOST important thing when exploring a new activity. Spankee, if you don't like a sensation (or if you do), speak up and let your partner know! Spanker, make sure to ask the receiver how it’s going. Is it too hard, too slow, are they ready for another spank? As with everything in bed, your partner is going to be a lot different from the last person you laid your hands on. Lots of people, for example, want to know exactly when the next stroke is going to come. I like to be pleasantly surprised.  A final word: once you get into power games like spanking, it's time to start thinking about safewords. A safeword is a code word the person on the receiving end can use to give feedback to their partner. One popular choice is to say green when you mean "I'm ok, keep going," yellow for "slow down or switch it up, please," and red for "please stop right now. Untie me and let’s have some tea." Just remember that safewords are serious business, and should NEVER be taken lightly by the giver or the receiver. Respect the safeword!

       i have always dreamed about the classic "food sex" experience with whipping cream and strawberries, champagne and maybe a banana for later. but i keep getting nightmares it'll turn out like that movie scene where it's all messy with olives being launched out of the bellybutton--over the top and gross! i don't want to keep a minifridge beside the bed, or "ruin the moment." do you have any advice on logistics?  &nbsp;  -------------------------    My hero , Dan Savage, once labeled food sex something like "boring breeder faux-kink." The man was unnecessarily harsh, but it’s true that unless you get off on messes, food sex might not change your life. On the other hand, it’s a fun way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon! Why eat brunch off a plate when you can eat it off your main squeeze? Why eat grapes out of a bowl when you could be blindfolded and nipping them out of your lover’s teasing fingers?   My biggest helpful hint to you, dear reader, is to avoid getting sugar near any type of poon! Yeast loves sugar. Need I say more? No whipped cream or alcohol douches. Chocolate is pretty much out. And hold off on the banana unless it’s got a condom over it. In fact, your mom would tell you to wash/wrap any food you’re going to play with. Who wants pesticides up their ass?   I do think Saran Wrap would be a pretty sexy add-in for a food fiesta. Saran’s a pretty fun bondage tool (remember to have strong scissors handy—Saran knots are impossible to undo--and for God’s sake, NOT THE FACE), and it would keep you squeaky clean while your lover ate to their heart’s content.   You probably won’t want food straight out of the fridge unless you’re going for shock value. I HATE the cold. In my opinion, there could be nothing worse than sticking your dick into a freezing cold cantaloupe. If freezing’s your thing, you could try this DIY ice dildo: dangle a condom down over a paper towel tube, snap the top of the condom over the top of the tube and secure, fill it with water, and set carefully in your freezer. Unless you’ve got an enormous condom, this guy’s gonna be kind of skinny at the top. You could also use one of those make-your-own popsicle plastic moulds. Do let ice melt a bit for lubrication BEFORE you shove it anywhere too special. Remember that whole stick-your-tongue-to-the-freezing pole thing?   The heat is much more MY bag, so I recommend steaming your vegetables slightly (you still want them nice and firm, though, right?) and heating up your chocolate sauce. Remember to test the temperature on your wrist before you dump it all over your man’s balls. Safety first, people!   Finally, remember that you’re gonna have to EAT most of what you or your partner is wearing. So, three cans of whipped cream might sound fun in theory, but whipped cream gets awfully old when you’re munching away at nothing but.    10 sexy foods:        Cucumbers    Avocado     Strawberries    Wine    Peaches    Asparagus    Honey    Melon    Warm chocolate sauce     Ice

      I have a friend who has genital herpes and I don't want to catch it from him! Is genital herpes completely different from oral herpes? Or is it a virus that could manifest itself in other places (eg. saliva)? Could one contract the disease by sharing drinks with an infected person? What about sharing a bathroom regularly?   ----------------  The short answer: there are two kinds of herpes, oral (causes cold sores) and genital. Yes, the two viruses are similar and can transfer between the two sites. Many people, for example, get 'oral' herpes on their genitals after getting head from someone with a cold sore. On the brighter side, it's hard to get genital herpes on your mouth, so your friend likely isn't going to transfer his herpes to his mouth and then infect you that way.   In case your friend DOES develop a cold sore: a lot of the herpes support websites say that you can't get oral herpes from sharing glasses or cutlery with a person having an outbreak. Well, I would personally be a bit hesitant about sharing a glass with someone who has a big old cold sore, as the virus can live up to four hours outside the human body. MedLine encyclopedia recommends washing eating utensils in hot water and not sharing a toothbrush with someone who's having an outbreak. Kissing is right out, even kisses on the cheek (most kids get the virus from being kissed on the cheek), and don't be getting head from this "friend" either.  As for sharing a bathroom, I guess it's CONCEIVABLE that you would get genital herpes from a toilet seat. Conditions would have to be pretty damn perfect, though. Basically, your friend would have to pee or wipe his cock on the toilet seat. Then, before four hours have passed, you would need to come in and rub YOUR genitals in his still-wet juices (since you can't contract herpes through normal unbroken skin like your legs or buttcheeks). I don't know about you, but my genitals tend to give the toilet seat a miss and go for that big hole in the middle. If you're really worried about it, you can just wipe the seat before you sit.    Finally, another scenario for transmission that you might want to think about: your friend is having an outbreak. He touches himself, and then shakes your hand before washing his own. You promptly run off to the bathroom to masturbate for some reason, and don't wash YOUR hands first. You could (chances are slim) get genital herpes. Moral of the story? Wash your hands before you play with your treasure.   More about Herpes   Oral herpes usually shows up as a blister on the side of your mouth--a cold sore. Genital herpes usually shows up as a cluster or blisters or sores on your genitals or anus. The sores may be painful or itchy. If you're having a really severe episode (especially the first one), you may have swollen glands or feel like you have the flu. These sores will go away (lie  dormant ) but the virus remains in your body, and the sores may pop out again from time to time (about 50% of people with genital herpes have these flare-ups, or  recurrences ).  Herpes is a really common STI. Over 50% of North Americans have already been exposed to oral herpes, and 22% to the genital kind. The two types, oral (Herpes Simplex 1) and genital (Simplex 2) are named for the regions of the body they prefer to inhabit. Oral herpes likes to live near your ear, while genital herpes likes to live near the base of your spine. The two strains are more easily aquired and are stronger on their home territory.   However, the names are a little misleading because the two herpes strains are very similar and can cross-infect. As I said above, many people acquire a Herpes Simplex 1 infection (supposedly "oral" herpes)  on their genitals  after receiving oral sex from someone with a cold sore. These infections are usually "weaker" (have less severe symptoms, and are less likely to recur) because they're not taking place on the virus' home ground. On the other hand, genital herpes is quite difficult to spread to the mouth and almost NEVER recurs there. That is, you have one outbreak and then no more.  Usually herpes is quite a mild infection. People act like genital herpes is the end of the world, but really, unless you have a crappy immune system, it's not much worse than cold sores. It's just on a different part of your body. Like cold sores, genital herpes tends to come out when you're tired or stressed. And like cold sores, genital herpes goes away and lies dormant for awhile after an outbreak. Most people have such subtle symptoms they don't even know they're infected!    Safety notes:  Herpes is generally more of a social problem than a medical problem for the people who contract it. However, any kind of genital sore increases your risk of contracting other STIs like HIV. If you are immunocompromised (e.g. have AIDS), herpes can have more serious consequences for your health. If you are expecting a baby, please consult with your doctor about your case of herpes and how it will affect your pregnancy. Finally, oral herpes can occasionally spread to the  eyes. That sucks. To prevent it, don't touch your sores. If you do, ALWAYS wash your hands. Also, NEVER spit on your contact lenses.  As with genital warts (another relatively mild infection, health consequences-wise), contracting herpes is no fun for your social life. If you do have genital herpes, you have a DUTY to tell your partners and to work out safer sex guidelines for everyone. These should include no sex at all when you're most contagious, before or during an outbreak (often people can feel an outbreak coming on, getting a tingly sensation where sores were before). Condoms don't offer good protection during an outbreak because your partner can still get infected by sores outside the condom or fluids that happen to leak over. You will most likely want to use protection (latex condoms and/or dental dams) in between outbreaks. That's because although although you are less contagious in between, asymptomatic people tend to occasionally shed, or give off, the virus at random times.

       It feels almost out of fashion these days to be using condoms as birth control, but that's what I do. The problem is that after sex I feel like I have little cuts just on the inside of my vagina. It makes sex pretty painful. I wonder if it's the same situation as described in "love hurts" or if it's an allergy to spermicide or latex. Any ideas? Also, on my box of Avanti (polyurethane) condoms it says "if you are not allergic to latex, you should use a latex condom." What the hell does that mean?   ----------------------------------  I think you're right: sounds like you're either irritated by the latex (rubber) your condoms are made of, or the spermicidal lubricant (containing nonoxynol-9) on the condoms.  How to find out which is the culprit? Easy. First, let your vag more or less heal from the last time you had sex. Then try having sex with a latex condom that has no spermicide on it (you can get them at your local drugstore, along with non-spermicidal lube). Feel good? Your problem is spermicide, and you are not alone: many women feel your pain. The cure is simple: stay away. Buy unlubricated condoms, provide your own, non-spermicidal lubricant (like KY), and don't use birth control methods like the diaphragm that require spermicidal foam.   If you dumped the spermicide and are still having irritation, wait a few days and try a polyurethane (non-latex) condom like the Avanti condom.  If THAT feels good, you need to start avoiding latex. Another way to test for latex sensitivity is to try wearing a rubber glove for a few hours a day. If you develop a rash on your hand, no more latex condoms for you.   Latex sensitivity is nothing to sneeze at. For starters, many fun things to put in your vagina, like  urlLink the Keeper , are made of latex. More importantly, if you're irritated by latex, you could possibly be allergic to latex gloves. You know, the kind doctors use in open-heart surgery? Although many more people are just   sensitive   to latex (think rash), rather than actually   allergic   to it (think going into anaphylactic shock), you should definitely consult a doc regarding the risks to you.  Warning : do NOT try out latex condoms if you have never used them and have reason to think you might be allergic to latex. If you are allergic, you could go into anaphylactic shock! Go to the doc instead.  If you're sensitive to latex, you still (thank God) have a few options for STI protection and birth control. I recommend you switch to polyurethane condoms. The two most popular brands are Avanti (male condom) and Reality (female condom). The downfall of polyurethane, and why there's a warning on the package, is that it's more likely to break or slip off than regular condoms. Also, it's expensive. On the plus side, it tastes better than latex and is compatible with oil-based lubes.  You could also switch to "skin" condoms. I don't know much about them, but they're non-latex, really are made out of animal skin, do provide birth control, but don't protect against STIs. I've also been told they're hideously expensive, but worth every penny, sensation-wise. Some websites recommend "doubling up" latex and skin condoms: your partner wears a latex condom next to his skin (STI protection) and then rolls a skin condom over (protects you from latex). I have my qualms about this method. First of all, that seems like an awful lot of layers for everyone's sexual pleasure. Second of all, doubling up on condoms is bad because the increased friction leads to breakage! Double up at your peril.     Your symptoms don't sound similar to those described in  love hurts . If you were having problems with too much friction during sex, the pain would be more intense and would occur primarily at the opening to your vagina. If his cock was too damn long and was bumping your cervix--another common cause of pain during sex--you'd likely feel it at the very top of your vag (now, some gals do appreciate a little cervix action, but I find it VERY uncomfortable). So if you have gotten rid of latex and spermicide as above and you're  still  having trouble with pain and irritation, go to the doctor. You probably have an infection causing your problems.

       Poppy here:  I recently attended a *ahem*  stimulating  workshop by Patrick Califia:  How to Top (for people who usually don't) . As advertised, the evening was all about topping, or dominating, for beginners. Sign me up! I'm a complete beginner at BDSM--at least, as much as your average adventurous 20-something can be.  First, some definitions:  urlLink BDSM  is a blanket term for lots of kinds of erotic power play that doesn't fit under the banner of conventional sex. Real BDSM is always  consensual  and relies on open communication and clear limits. The letters stand for  b ondage and  d iscipline--where one person is under physical restraint like handcuffs or ropes,  d ominance and  s ubmission--where one person agrees to put themselves in the control of another (usually, to obey their orders), and  s adism and  m asochism--where one person receives pain from another. Common, but not universal, shorthand for the participants:  top  for the person with the bullhorn, whip, or key to the handcuffs, and  bottom  for their happily tormented partner.   Patrick, a longtime lesbian/SM/transsexual activist and writer, (buy his  urlLink books !) was a wonderful, accessible celebrity presenting to an open and friendly audience. Of course, the audience was at least half bottoms, so they were ready to believe and/or obey just about anything he said ;)    Despite the cozy atmosphere, I found the presentation a bit intimidating. Mostly it was because I was an outsider, someone who isn't yet into the BDSM scene and doesn't have a partner to play with. BDSM encompasses so many different kinds of people that get off on so many different kinds of things! There are so many rules, etiquettes, and caveats to remember! Of course, they're all in place to safeguard people who are boldly going where your average couple doesn't. Indeed, because they need to think so much about consent, power, and control, BDSMers can teach the vanilla world a LOT about safety, communication, and self-knowledge.   So, I imagine you're wondering what great tips Patrick had about topping:  First of all, you gotta establish a  persona . You need an attitude and you need good clothes to get you in that topping mood.  Second, you can't top if your heart's not in it. Ask yourself what  you  will get out of the scene. An orgasm? A manicure? A sense of humble satisfaction that you showed your partner a good time?  Third,  negotiate  with your bottom BEFOREHAND. Don't wait till everyone's naked to find out that not only does your new parter HATE your fetish, he won't give you head either. Patrick suggested making a list of things you each need, things you like, and things you just won't do. That way you won't be tempted to go beyond your comfort zone.  Fourth, decide how you're going to  transition  into the sexual part of a scene. You've got the flirting, the buildup, the negotiation, and then this kinda wonky grey area where both of you are just kind of sitting, looking at each other. As the top, it's your responsibility to get the party started (and to decide when it's over, if your bottom doesn't use a safeword first). Anyways, decide on some action that shows YOU'RE in control, order them to take off their clothes, and away you go.  Fifth, and most important,  safety first . Don't forget to establish  urlLink safewords , and don't forget the keys to your handcuffs! For more about BDSM safety, check out this great intro by Jay Wiseman and Lady Green:  urlLink BDSM Tip Sheet for Beginners .  The presentation was more about attitude and planning than specific tips. Patrick suggested being flexible and lighthearted, and pointed out that if anything goes wrong, you can blame the bottom for it and they'll be happy to take their punishment!  I guess the biggest lesson _I_ learned that evening is that for right now, I'm so much more attracted to being a bottom. All that persona stuff sounds like WORK. Why be in control when you could be deliciously in someone else's power? Good thing there are a few people out there that don't feel the same way, and can indulge me in my tastes. God bless diversity!  -------------------------------  There are more BDSM resources out there than you can shake a stick at.

       My ex cheated on me and now I'm afraid I might have an STD. I don't have any symptoms or anything, but we weren't using condoms. I think I need to get tested, but I'm nervous about going to the doctor. What do they do? What do i get tested for? How do I find a good place?   -------------------------------------------------------    Getting tested  for sexually transmitted infections is a bit scary at first, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It's important to be informed about your visit and know what tests to ask for, because you can't assume your doctor is actually giving you the full meal deal every time you go see her. In this case (and every case, as far as I'm concerned) knowledge about your bod is power over your health.  Some symptoms should definitely send you running for tests. These include: blood in your juices or urine, pain during urination or sex, soresblistersrasheswarts or other "growths" on your genitals, abnormal or stinky discharge from your genitals or anus, and tenderness, swelling, or itching of your genitals or anus. That said, MANY STIs, including HIV, are symptomless for a long time after they start doing major damage to your body.  To get an STI check up, make a doctor's appointment somewhere you feel halfway comfortable. Many Canadian hospitals have STI clinics. Most urban areas in Canada have sexual health doctor's clinic, like Planned Parenthood. If that doesn't work, any old doc should be able to give you the tests, as long as you halfway trust them not to give you any shitty attitude. In Canada, the doctor's visit is FREE and the tests are FREE.   The appointment will likely include a sexual history, an external examination to check for syphilis, herpes, or warts, then swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Then you'll need a follow-up to get your results. Need more detail?   When you get to the appointment, the doc or nurse will ask you about your  sexual history  (including number and gender of sex partners and activities you've engaged in). This is to determine your level of risk for different types of infection.  Then comes the  physical exam . This is the part where you get naked, put on a paper getup, and spread your legs. The doc should check the outside of your genitals for any suspicious sores, blisters, or warts from  herpes, syphilis  or  human papilloma virus . Doctors can't read minds, so you have to tell them to check out your mouth and throat if you've had high risk oral sex (if you didn't have vaginal or anal intercourse with those people), or to have a look at your anal area if you're a back-door kinda person.   About the  herpes virus  and  human papilloma virus : these are both incredibly common. More than 50% of the population has been exposed to either Herpes type 1 (causes cold sores) or 2 (causes recurrent genital blisters) or both. Probably about 75% of the population has been exposed to human papilloma virus, different strains of which cause warts on different parts of your body (including your genitals and anus). Some strains of HPV have been linked to cervical cancer in young women.   You usually need to see the doctor DURING AN OUTBREAK of herpes or warts for a 100% correct diagnosis. If you are seeing strange blisters, sores, pimples, or soft, cauliflower-like things on your genitals, and have not yet been diagnosed, you need to call the clinic ASAP. Say something like, "I think I might have herpes and I'm having an outbreak right now. Do you have any emergency appointments available in the next couple of days so I can get diagnosed? If not, do you know where I CAN go?" Do not wait for the infection to go away, because these things have a way of popping back into your life.    On to the rest of the physical. If you're a gal, the doc will then do a couple of more things; first, she'll use a speculum, which looks and opens kind of like a duck beak, to have a peek at your cervix. That's a little protrusion tucked up at the end of your vagina. While she's poking around in there, she'll take some swabs (with special Q-tips) from your cervix to look for  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea.  These are sent to an outside laboratory to be analyzed, so don't expect a diagnosis on the spot. The doc might also do a pap smear, which is basically another couple of swabs. If you are sexually active,  you should have a pap smear every year  to check for the beginning stages of  cervical cancer . See the notes for gals below for more on getting your pap smear done.   The doctor will probably also put a finger or two inside your vagina and palpitate your abdomen at the same time. That's to look for swelling and pain that could be pretty serious symptoms of something gone wrong in your reproductive system.  If you're a guy, you are spared the speculum, but you DO have to get tested for  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea . In some clinics, this test is done by swabbing a thin Q-tip a little bit into your urethra. In other clinics, the test is done by peeing into a cup. The doctor will send your swabs or urine to an outside laboratory to be analyzed. It'll take a week or two.   Ok guys, I know which test you'd PREFER, but I hear the swab really isn't that bad. It's momentary discomfort, not agonizing pain. And really, did you SEE what girls have to go through? I think guys who refuse to get tested because they don't like the swab are inconsiderate assholes who don't give a shit about exposing their partners to infection.    About  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea : these are both REALLY contagious bacterial infections. Thankfully, they are both curable with antibiotics. Guys, if you do have symptoms (technicolour penis pus and feeling like you're peeing shards of glass) you'l know it. But, 50% of guys with chlamydia and 10% with gono WON'T have symptoms. Not only that, the vast majority (75-80%) of infected women won't have symptoms either. This is especially troubling because chlamydia and gono can cause serious health problems, including infertility, in women who don't even know they have the disease.      On to the  blood tests , which are the same for girls and boys. The doctor likely won't take your blood right then and there. Instead, she'll give you a piece of paper (a requisition) to take to a special laboratory techician who's trained to take blood. They don't take much (less than a tablespoon of blood) and it's 100% safe. In Canada, you can usually pay to get your blood taken at a private clinic or you can go to the hospital and get it taken for free. The blood lab sends the results back to your doctor in anywhere from a week to a month.   Many clinics routinely do blood tests for three sexually transmitted infections:  Hepatitis B ,  HIV , and  Syphilis . In many urban areas, you can find anonymous testing for HIV and sometimes even Hepatitis B. Ask your local sexual health clinic (like  urlLink Planned Parenthood ) about it.   About  Hepatitis B, HIV, and Syphilis:   Hep B  is a virus that seriously fucks with your liver. It's 10 times more contagious than HIV, but less likely to be fatal. There's no cure, but most people recover from the virus--although some go on to be carriers, able to transmit to others without having symptoms themselves. There is a series of vaccines for Hep B (often free to IV drug users and men who have sex with men). Most young people in Canada were vaccinated in school, but I highly recommend buying the vaccines if you weren't.    HIV  is a virus that attacks your immune system and eventually causes AIDS. It's an incurable and hard-to-treat infection that used to be an automatic death sentence. New treatment regimens are allowing people with the virus to live longer in good health. But there's still no cure, no vaccine, and taking a bazillion heavy duty pills a day just isn't fun. Always use a condom, right?  Warning:  It takes about 3 months for HIV to show up on a blood test. So if your boyfriend only started cheating recently, you might have to wait three months to get an accurate result on your test.   Syphilis  is a relatively rare, but contagious and NASTY bacterial infection that is on the rise in Canada. Remember how people used to go crazy and die from "venereal disease?" That was syphilis. One of the first symptoms is a painless sore or ulcer(chancre) in the place you contracted the disease.   Finally, you have to make a  follow-up visit  with your doc to get the results of all your tests. They MIGHT call you beforehand if you have an infection, but are you really going to trust those overworked clinic staff to pay attention to your result? Plus, they will NEVER give HIV results over the phone. So you have to come back. Do come back. It's for your health and safety.    Do get tested on a regular basis if you've been sexually active. It's the decent thing to do for yourself and for your future partners. Getting an STI is never fun, but there ain't no shame in getting one, either! Lots of people have them, seriously! Normal people, people you work with, go to school with, and who officiate at your church. Most STIs are either curable or controllable, so don't let shame or fear hold you back from making that appointment.   Special note for  guys : don't pee for, say, two hours before your appointment. That's because pee is a nice way to temporarily wash bacteria out of your urethra, which can hide the fact that you're infected with the chlamydia or gonorrhea bacteria.   Special note for  gals : If you are planning on having your annual pap smear done when you get tested, plan the appointment for midway in your cycle, or two weeks after your last period. Don't douche or use vaginal medications 3-4 days before your pap smear. (But just don't douche at all. It's bad for you.)   Also, ladies, if you are sexually active, it's  very important  for you to get checked out regularly. Here's why:    Women are more likely to infected by men during vaginal intercourse--especially unprotected--than men are to get infected by women. One reason? He's spurting liquid out, away from his body, whereas you're taking liquid in and wallowing in it for a few days.  STIs often have more serious health consequences for women because our important reproductive organs are a lot closer to our vagina, anatomywise, than his are to the end of his penis.   STI symptoms are often more subtle, nonexistent, or harder to notice in women. So we can go for a LOT longer before realizing something is wrong.   If you'd like to more about STIs, check out the  Planned Parenthood  website. They've got lots of good info:  urlLink http://www.plannedparenthood.org/sti/ .  Ciao!

       I get sore after a certain amount of time having intercourse. I feel like this must be related how regularly I have sex, but since I haven't dated anyone and had regular sex for a really long time, I'm unsure. The pain isn’t inside, definitely on the surface, like the skin right around the entrance to the vagina. What do you think? Do I just have to suck it up and get over it?  -------------------------------------------------  I've definitely had mid-sex soreness before, especially with those special boys who just seem to last and last. I think you're probably suffering from too much friction. A lack of lubrication and a tight fit are the two main culprits in this horrible scenario.  The easiest culprit to vanquish is insufficient  lubrication . Even if you think you're using enough lube, sex with condoms (you  are  using condoms, right?) can get awfully tacky. Those rubber things just seem to suck all the moisture out of you. Try the following:   a) use lots of lube. Reapply a few times, and give a good dose of saliva to the proceedings in between (spit in your hand, apply to cock, repeat);  b) pause for some gooey head every 10 minutes or so (for you or him);  c) if you are using glycerin-free lube because you are scared of yeast infections, try switching back to a lube with glycerin. Sadly, glycerin-free just isn't as slippery. One lube to look out for is  O'My , my personal favorite. It has some glycerin, but some natural antifungals to combat yeast, too.   Solving a tight fit:  if you're a bit small like me (which definitely can happen if you're not having sex often, which I'm not) friction seems to be more of an issue. Sometimes all the lube in the world just wouldn't be enough, and sex involves way more pain than it should. You can try any of these tips:  a) switch positions to something that allows for less vigorous thrusting and less deep penetration (you on top, for example, or from behind but with both of you lying on your sides);  b) limit vaginal intercourse to 10-15 minutes at a time and while the rest of the time away giving head to each other;  c) remember that you are a delicate flower, and that some parts of you are naturally more delicate than others. There's nothing wrong with a little finesse--unless you like it rough, of course;  d) incorporate more penetration into your everyday masturbation routine. I think doctors like to call this "dilation," and it WORKS. It does take some dedication, though. You have to be willing to fuck yourself (GENTLY) with fingers, veggies, or dildos at least a couple of times a week. When I was working through my own vaginal pain problems, I started with a buttplug-- because it was conical, I didn't have to force a big fake penis head into my poor little lady. After I could get all the way to the end of the plug (and this took a few months), I invested in a size small dildo--as smooth as I could find. Eventually I worked up to a pretty big, very attractive glittery orange guy. You have to be patient, though!   Most of all, you must to think positive and sexy thoughts about your vagina and the dildos you're using. That's because this condition called "vaginismus" really aggravates vaginal pain. Basically, your VERY strong vaginal muscles, once they start associating pain with intercourse, tend to tense up whenever you try to talk to them about having sex. Sadly for you, those tense muscles contract, block off the first third of your vagina, and make intercourse even HARDER and MORE painful. You have to seduce those muscles and make them feel at home with strangers in your poon. Try alternately tensing and relaxing them to gain control, Kegels style (one way to practice contractions is to make like you're stopping a big dump and a big pee at the same time...then relax slowly out of it).  I hope this helps, dear reader. I also want to caution you that vaginal pain can be a symptom of underlying health conditions. This includes mild yeast infections (where you wouldn't notice the symptoms) and some sexually transmitted infections. So get thee to a doctor for a checkup, just in case. And remember, you're not alone! I believe pain with intercourse is one of the most prevalent and least talked-about sexual problems of our time. Fuck Viagra, let's talk about making sex with men better for women.

       Seems like many men complain about condoms, but some are more diligent than others in "following the rules." I am currently dealing with someone who's pretty uninterested in condoms because they feel tight and don't allow for any feeling/sensation during penetration. He keeps insisting that he has "really good control" and will not cum while fucking. This might just become a regular little exchange that we go through because I remain convinced that condoms are better for me and he remains convinced that no condoms are better for him.  I guess I should go visit the pharmacy and see what the selection is like because I'm sure it is vast, but it seems like you have a good idea of what's out there, so any suggestions for a lady in distress?   ---------------------   You're using  the withdrawal method of having sex, which is where you have sex without a condom and the guy pulls out of the vagina before he comes, coming instead onto whatever's handy (your stomach, face, a kleenex, whatever). The withdrawal method is favored by 13-year-olds and fundamentalist Christians. Do you want to be using anything these two groups endorse?  One of the major downsides of withdrawal is a very high risk of accidental pregnancy. I'm assuming you aren't using another method of birth control, here. Well, you should be. Even if your guy has "really good control," and would never ever get so carried away making love to your beautiful bod that he would forget to pull out just once, he can't stop precum. Precum is basically what it sounds like: a bit of come that helps lubricate the penis during sex BEFORE the guy has an orgasm. It's involuntary, it emerges from his urethra (pisshole) as soon as he gets hard, and there are plenty of little sperm swimming around in it. Some guys have lots of it (no, you're not a freak if your cock starts drooling as soon as you get hard), some guys not so much. But it's there, and it's fertile, and it's bad news for the ladies.   Second of all, guys who refuse to use condoms are at pretty high risk for sexually transmitted infections. Precum, for example, is a great way to transmit infection. And you know, if he's not considerate enough to use a condom with you, is he REALLY going to be so considerate as to tell you about that little bout with Hepatitis B he had awhile back? If you have sex with one of these gems, you're placing yourself at risk. I suggest getting a full battery of STI tests right away.  So, what to do with a guy that refuses to use condoms? My first impulse is to tell you to kick him out of bed and lock the door behind him. But sometimes the spirit is willing and the flesh is weak, so here are some other ideas (and if anyone else has ideas on making condom use better, post a comment below!):  1)  Forget  what everyone tells you about condom sizes being a load of horse crap. I mean, if condoms really were THAT stretchy, they'd be the size of a thimble when they came out of the package, right? I have seen a wide variety of penises with my own eyes, and they DO vary in size. Quite a bit. If your man is significantly larger than average, try using a  larger size condom . They really are better for the bigger man.   2) Remember how you pinch a half-inch at the tip of the condom while you're rolling it on, to leave room for the guy's load? Try putting  a drop or two of lube in the tip . It helps increase sensation for some boyos. Don't slop the lube on, or else the condom might slip right off into your vagina. And what good would it do there?  3) Your guy may have some other issues with condoms that he's masking by saying they're uncomfortable. I've known quite a few guys to, uhm,  deflate  when the rubber goes on. If your guy's not comfortable with you seeing him go soft, he may refuse point-blank to consider condoms. The time-honoured solution is to make putting it on part of foreplay. Roll it down over his cock with your teeth (but don't rip it!). Tickle his balls and do that thing that drives him crazy with his nipples while he's putting it on. He can also practice masturbating solo with a condom to get into practice and get used to the feel.  4) Remind him that  reduced sensation means he can fuck for longer .  5) You could try using the  Reality Condom  for women. This may be a good option for you, because it seems like your partner's not into negotiation. This is a female-controlled barrier method, made of polyurethane, that looks kind of like a really big condom with a small, flexible plastic ring at the closed tip and a bigger one at the open base. Basically, you put the smaller ring (at the tip) as far into your vagina as possible while leaving the bigger one kind of hanging out, making sure it completely covers around the opening to your vag. Then your partner fucks into the condom/your vagina. Remember to put the lube on the INSIDE of this condom. You can also remove the inner ring and use the condom for anal sex.  Upsides of the Reality condom: it's female-controlled, not tight at all, and not latex so people with latex allergies can use it. Downsides: anecdotally, it seems more prone to breakage than regular condoms, it's expensive, and some people complain it's kind of like fucking a grocery bag. In your case, reader, I really think it's worth a try.   I also think it's worth a look at why your guy is resisting condom use so strenuously. Ok, so sex educators are a little off the mark when they insist having sex with a condom is EVERY BIT AS GOOD as sex without. You know what? It's not. Condoms do reduce sensation. Cocks really prefer skinnydipping to wearing a bathing suit.   But sex is STILL pretty fucking amazing with condoms, and using them is sooo much better than waking up infertile from chlamydia, or having your liver destroyed by hepatitis B, or going through that annoying abdominal bloat that accompanies pregnancy. Considering women are more at risk for contracting STI's, that many STI's have more serious health effects for women than men, and that, of course, you'd be the one stuck with the birth or the abortion if you got pregnant, why would you stick with a guy who's willing to expose you to that?
