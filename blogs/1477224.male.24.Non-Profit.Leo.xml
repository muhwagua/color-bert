      The other day I was having lunch with a pastor from the church I grew up in.  He and I were talking about how churches rely so much on strategy.  If you walk through a Christian book store you'll find all sorts of books on how to do church.  Now I'm not going to be the guy that sits here and says that those books are wrong, because to some degree they're right.  There's nothing wrong with church strategy.  It's perfectly reasonable to try and come up with the best plan and then implament it. I don't even think it's a bad idea to try and adapt other peoples good ideas either.  So, remember that as you read the rest of this post.  We were sitting at Pizza Hut talking about churches who get so wrapped up in trying to find and implament the correct strategy that they forget the focus.  Doug said that for a church to rely so heavily on "the plan" or "the strategy" is almost humanistic.  That caught me off guard.  I've never thought about it that way, but it's true.  We say, "the Gospel's true, God's grace is real," two totally super-natural events that can only be explained by the power of God, and then we try and figure out the best strategy.  We don't give God the room to work today, and we're convinced if we just think, plan, and try hard enough we'll have a break through in our churches.  Where's the balance?  I belive that the balance lies in the verse that every Christian already knows.  No matter how clever something seems, or how brilliant a plan looks, it's still rediculous to lean on our own understanding.  The power of God is what changes lives, and if we can't grasp that we'll always be in the way witn our finite plans.

      "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."    .matthew 7:13-14    What's the difference between the wider path and the narrow one?  Thus far in my life I've always associated the "wide path" as that which takes one straight to hell.  Recently I've realized that it's more than just heaven and hell.  I realize that the narrow path isn't just making moral choices with my life, it's about making the decisions that are hard to make.  I've realized that in my life there is the way that I know things need to be done, but it's rough.  It takes committment and a lot of focus, but there are the choices that can be made that are just "ok".  You know the ones.  I think that my life is mostly made up of the easy moral choices.  You know, like when you're faced with the thoughts of foresaking all for the sake of the Gospel, or giving it that good old college try.  Neither are immoral, but only one models who Jesus is.  So, if the path to destruction is wide then it's become obvious to me that there are many choices that I make regularly that probably lead me down that path.  It's really kind of sad to me, b/c now I've seen this in my own life, and over the last week I've done nothing to change it.  What's even worse is that I think it proves so much about my faith.  Kind of sickening isn't it?  hmmm...

      I love baseball.  The past two days I've really really enjoyed watching the first two games of the Yankees v. Cubs series.  I know many of my friends don't appreciate how amazing baseball is, but truly, there is not another sport that draws me in like baseball.  It just feels right.  Today Roger Clemens tried for the third time to win his 300th game.  I have never been a Clemens fan, so I'm always very happy to see him loose.  Fourtunatly for me he lost again, but for the second week in a row, it wasn't really his fault, it was more the fault of the bullpen.  It was a great game though.  Sometimes I don't really know what to put on this blog.  I really feel as though I wasted my day today.  This morning I woke up and went for a five mile run, and then took Meri to the airport so that she could go to Virginia for her brother's graduation.  When I returned home I sat down to watch the Cubs v. Yanks game and sat here for the next 4.5 hours until I had to go to Rhoda's, a girl from my youth group, graduation party.  After a HORRIBLE display of my croquet skills I returned to the sofa, this time in a friends house to consume an hour and a half of the Animatrix.  Now I am back on my couch watching more tv and writting useless dribble.  Oh well.  My friend  urlLink Brian  gave a little review of Metallica's new song St. Anger over on his blog, and I just wanted to add my two cents worth.  While Brian thought that St. Anger was a bad effort for the boys in Metallica I would have to say that my opinion differed a little bit.  I believe that St. Anger wasn't just a bad effort it was one of the worst songs I've ever heard Metallica do, it sounded like it was written and recorded in the same minute.  What a bunch of crap.  It won't be long before you'll see the Def Lepord, RATT, with very special guests Metalica coming to a washed up rocker venue near you.  On that very same note I have to say that MTV had a very very bad idea when they decided to bring back HeadBangers Ball on M2.  I have been watching for about 10 minutes a week for the last month and I must say tonight I saw the worst video todate by a band named Strapping Young Lad.    The video featured fat, ballding (however with the remaining hair reaching their butts) rocking out in some S&M club, while a robot smashed skulls with a large hammer.  It's disturbing that someone somewhere thinks that this deserves to be on TV.  The even more disturbing  thought is that there is someone somewhere with enough money to bankroll these guys.  It almost makes me sick to my stomach.  Metal's just plain stupid.  MTV should just stick to putting unrealistic reality tv shows on the air.  I've now wasted approximately 112 seconds of your day.  Check back again later, when hopefully my brain will be back to full speed.  Late.

      I'm back at 'em.  It's been a little under a year and I've decided to get back to it.  Not sure that there's much to add tonight, but I will be adding many different thoughts to this page over the next couple of weeks.  If you get board with the stuff here, head on over to  urlLink Midwest Mindset  for debate over what me, my brother, and Jonny Rice are thinking about.  Check back soon.

      I guess the point of a blog, at least a good blog, is to start posting whenever one gets a chance.  I however have failed over the past year of actually posting much of anything.  I've dedcided that I am going to take action though, and start posting whenever possible, about whatever I want.  This weekend is about half over,but it's been overwhelming up to this point.  I traveled up north to Hillsdale to be a part of David and Wendy Rice's wedding.  They married this morning and had a great reception.  It was really a great time, hanging with old friends, meeting new people, and seeing two people fully in love come together in marriage.  Weekends are just a busy time around here with church, and especially since we set up on Saturday night.  It's been extremely busy around here lately, and with more stuff coming as summer approaches I am begging for the church to hurry up with the hire on the middle school guy.  This week alone I will have attended 8 different programed events within our youth ministries.  It's just too much for one guy, especially if ministry is more about people than programming.  At any rate tomorrow we've got a big event for our 5th and 6th graders and I'm not really looking forward to it all.  It'll be ok, but I just know that I won't have too much fun, and in the end it'll pretty  much stink.  Oh well, that's life right.  Do what you have too for your job, even when you hate it, b/c it's your job.  Something that I really want to talk about in the very near future is some ideas that I've been thinking through regarding solitude and The Last Samurai.  It's something that's been perculating in my brain, but I would like to watch the movie again before I say more.  I'm going to try and do that this week.  So tomorrow is a big day but Meri and I are going to be heading off for a little get away time right after the "big event" is finished.  Not sure where we're going, wish we had a ton of money to spend, but who really knows.  Look for some updates soon.  Hope you've enjoyed the read.  Check you later.

      Sometimes I wish I knew what I was doing.  At this moment I am speaking specifically of creating this blog.  I have tried to steal some html code, but what we've gotten out of that is some unwanted bullet points.  Not that important I know, but if anyone "accidently" reads this post and knows how to fix it, let me know.  My goal of this blog is to voice some thoughts and opinions on all sorts of stuff.  I have a real desire to be a writer and a speaker in addition to everything else that I do, but I need all the practice I can get in both of those areas.  So, if by some accident you've happened across this page because you searched for "book deal" the answer is yes, I'll take one.  If you can't offer me one of those that's ok, just read and enjoy.  Promise I'll have more to talk about soon.

      I've found myself watching the WE network recently.  [WE of course stands for Women's Entertainment]  I'm sure that for some of you that is slightly alarming, but to be honest I have good reason.  In the middle of the afternoon WE shows Ned & Stacy as well as Two Guys and a Girl.  In their day I was a big fan of both of them, but I've found myself enjoying them once again.  Both of them have quite clever writting, but the most enjoyable part is to be able to see what was in style at the time the shows were made.  For instance, Debra Messing (first seen in Ned & Stacy) looks pretty pug-ugly in all the clothes from the mid ninties.  At any rate the shows are fun, and this is a bad bad post.  oh well.  late.

      So I've been thinking a lot about this movie, The Last Samurai.  While I know the point of the movie was not what I've been thinking about, let me let you in on the ideas that have been perculating for so long.  Meri and I went to see another attempt to get Tom Cruise an Oscar nomination right in the middle of the Christmas season, which is one of the busiest times of the year for almost everyone.  It was the middle of the afternoon on Saturday and because people started shopping early, the place was full of people rewarding themselves at the end of a crazy hectic day.  In the middle of the movie Tom Cruise is captured by "horrible" samurai's who desire to keep their country the way it's been for ages because, or course, it's better than the modern approach to things.  Cruise's character is only in China to bring about that change and is fully American in his approach to life.  During his stay in this villiage he is changed, but it begins through one realization.  While walking throughout the villiage he realizes that everyone only does 2 things with their day.  They learn what they do well and do it well, and they spend the remainder of their time in deep religious thought.  Since I saw that movie I've reflected on my own spiritual life, and I've recognized the fact that I never spend time in deep religious thought.  I started wondering why, and started thinking through what I do on a daily basis.  There is no one thing that I do well.  There are many things that I do, all of which have the potential to be done well, but none of which have any opportunity to be done in any skillful way because I must quickly move to the next thing.  I am attempting to be a jack of all trades, fully realizing that I am a master of none.  The fact of the matter is that I feel like there is not enough time in the day for me to do what I need to do and cultivate relationships, much less my relationship with God.  I'm always always trying to get more done, and there is NO time to spend time in deep religious thought.  I began to long for a simpler life, and in a sense I still do.  The fact is my job does require a lot of me, it takes a ton of my energy and time, and it's quite difficult to balance things the way I would like to.  The fact is though, that there is much more time in a day than I actually use for good.  I just have to get better at using those hours for good and not for evil.  I guess evil isn't exactly the right word, but maybe you get what I'm saying.  I'll dig a little deeper into what I'm talking about later.

      I’ve got my dream job, and I hate it.  I guess that statement needs a little clarity before I go any further.  I’m a 25 year old “youth pastor” at a growing church, with great vision and a ton of youth.  So what’s the problem?  How could I hate something so perfect, and why did you put youth pastor in quotes?  Let me see if I can’t explain.  Besides the normal dreams that a kid has about playing baseball or being a rock star, the only thing I’ve ever wanted to be was a youth pastor.  It was sixth grade when I felt “the call” to ministry, and from then on there was no doubt in my mind that I would be doing ministry when I grew up.  I spent time with as many pastors as would give me the chance in high school and tried to learn as much as possible.  As a sophomore in high school I knew without a doubt where I was going to go to college, because I just wanted to go to the place that would prepare me for what I knew I was made to do.  Even in college I spent as much of my “free time” doing ministry so as to expand my abilities.  All I cared about was becoming as qualified as possible to do what God had called me to do.  After a bit of searching for the “perfect” place to start out I landed at a church plant that was on the move.  In the time I’ve been here I’ve seen the staff go from 4 to 9, the congregation go from 250 to 1400, and the youth ministry grow from 20 to 120.  We’re one of the biggest games in town now, and more and more people are coming to see what’s going on.  It’s truly exciting to see what God is doing.  Sounds great right?  So what’s the problem?  I will fully admit that part of the problem is how jaded I’ve become over the past two years, but I believe that almost all of the problem lies in the title that is on my business card.  On my card it says Andy Sikora – Director of Student Ministries.  My goal was to be a “youth pastor” someone who would offer spiritual guidance and care; however most of my time is spent programming and pulling off big events.  My last week has consisted of two meetings about how our “programming” isn’t fun enough for middle school kids, planning out and pulling off two big group “ministry” events, a battle of bands for high school kids, a movie night for middle school kids, and when there’s left over time (which there hardly ever is) I try and plan out the spiritual side of our ministry.    The feedback I get is always about programming.  How can we become more and more relevant?  What kind of “environments” are we creating for our kids?  What kind of events do you have planned?  Why are there no snacks for the kids?  What kind of thought was put into the prizes for this game?  The times when I’ve known that I’m doing what God has made me for are when I get to really teach God’s Word, after carefully studying and preparing, when I am sitting with a group of kids talking about what they’ve been called to be a part of as followers of Christ, working side by side with students and volunteers as we serve the community, praying with students who are going through some of the worst things I’ve ever heard of, or discipling those who’ve come to Christ from the interactions they’ve had at our church.  The problem is there’s no time for that.  The ironic part of our programming is that no matter how hard we try, it’s never really that great.  Kids have so many options around here that they seldom find what we’re doing to be better than anything they could do at home, school or find on TV or the internet.  In discussing this with my wife she mad an amazing statement.  “Name one youth pastor that doesn’t have to do all this?”  The worst part about what she said was that she’s totally right.  This is what being a youth pastor is about.  It’s about the bells and whistles, the fun and games, the one upmanship.  There’s not much pastoring at all if you’re a youth pastor.  So what am I called to be?  What doe sit mean to be faithful to that call?  Am I a youth pastor or a program director?  Whatever it is I better find the answer fast because everyday pushes me closer to the edge, and makes me feel less and less like I am called to anything.

      You know how when you get an e-mail from somebody you really care about and you want to really put some time into a response.  They're the friends that you feel deserve a heartfelt response, but it's hard to find the time to do so in the midst of your schedule, so it just gets kicked back a couple of days.  Eventually you either write an apology or you just act like you never got the message.  That's kind of what we've got right here. It's been so stinking busy around here.  Work's been taking it's toll, as you could probably tell by the last post, and I'm just worn down.  So, I just thought I would drop a bit of an update for those who don't have anything better to do.  So here's what's been filling my time... I got a bunch of new cd's lately.  It's really weird when you buy too many cds at once b/c you know there's some cd that won't get a real fair shake.  I bought the new Pedro, Piebald, Denison Witmer, and Brandston cd.  I really have enjoyed all of them... kind of.  I like the Denison b/c it's like the old ones, the Brandston cd is EXCELLENT (I got a signed poster from them, I feel really dumb having it, and I'm sure I'll feel dumber knowing you guys know), I like the Pedro CD I'm having a tough time getting into the Piebald though.  I'm sure it'll appeal more as time goes by.   I worry about Pedro the Lion sometimes.  I really believe things come out in songs, and I wonder if David Bazaan is ok.  I think that he's thinking about a lot of the same things we talk about over on  urlLink Midwest Mindset  but I just wish that there was more hope on his cds.  I know that is just silly, but that's the way it goes. That's all I got for now b/c I'm tired.  Talk to you later!

      Roger Ebert  urlLink talks  about the criticism of Michael Moore's new movie.   "The wise French director Godard once said, "The way to criticize a film is to make another film." That there is not a pro-Bush documentary available right now I am powerless to explain. Surely, however, the Republican National Convention will open with such a documentary, which will position Bush comfortably between Ronald Reagan and God. The Democratic convention will have a wondrous film about John Kerry. Anyone who thinks one of these documentaries is "presenting facts objectively without editorializing" should look at the other one."   Everything in America has to be black and white.  This movie has not even come out yet and every Conservative Republican is up in arms about this film.  This is something I'll never understand.  When a person aligns themselves with a certain ideology they become so personally offended by anything that even "questions" their side of the aisle.  If for some reason the other "side" seems to be gaining ground we just call into question their character.  I've seen this recently in response to the movie    urlLink SAVED!    and now again with  urlLink   Farenheit   .  My question is what are we afraid of?  Is it that we're so afraid to be wrong, or that we're even more afraid that someone so opposite from me on some sort of religious/political/moral issue might be (kinda) right.  I mean waht if I don't have the market cornered on the truth.  I'll go ahead and admit that Moore is just as defensive and angry about things as everyone else, but that's another post.  Who knows, maybe this movie will change things a little bit in America, but I'm guessing it will just be a bit more yelling, screaming, and finger pointing.  God bless America.

      What's a guy to do with dreams?  It's so hard to understand.  I grew up watching all the grown men around me do nothing but work the jobs they had and they did so with all their heart.  In all my growing up years I never heard of a grown man who had a dream, a desire, a thought, even an inkling that they would chase down or even imagine pursuing.  If, by chance there was someone who did decide that they were going to pursue a dream the person was labeled as irresponsible at best.  For instance I have a friend who was in a medical field.  He was making a decent living at his job, and had been at for at least five years.  He decided to go back to school and pursue a higher degree.  The degree will bring about a garunteed higher paying job after 2 years of schooling, but in the mean time his wife is carrying the entire financial burdern for the family.  It's rough I'm sure, but I heard someone say that they thought it was "irresponsible" of the guy to be in school.  This guy will be making far more money than he was before, and yet chasing his dream is irresponsible.  So as a grown man, I don't know what to do with the dreams I have.  I believe that God has some purpose for me, some big deal kind of purpose for my life, and yet it's still somewhat unclear what that purpose may be.  I feel like there is so much that I need to be doing, and yet there is no time for that kind of thing.  A responsible grown man does the job he's got.  A responsible grown man works for a promotion or a raise and just keeps his nose to the grindstone.  More than anything though, a responsible grown man doesn't chase after dreams that he thinks may be motivated by God.    But maybe it isn't the fact that society doesn't let grown men dream.  Maybe it's actually that I'm afraid that I'll chase something that isn't supposed to be pursude.  Or I'll go after something, and it'll be a mess.  I don't know though.  Maybe I just need to go and do.  Or wait and see... who knows.
