      Restless tonight 'cos I wasted the light between both these times I drew a really thin line  It's nothing I planned and not that I can But you should be mine across that line  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?  I promise I might not walk on by Maybe next time but not this time  Even though I know I don't want to know Yeah, I guess I know I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?

      P2 was absolutely horrible. The trig question took me more than 10 minutes to do, and I still couldn't do it. (But then again, I'm stupid.) Actually most people found it quite difficult, but I'm sure I'm the only Further Maths person who lost more than 15 marks already. AHHH well... That's life.   Still got M2 on Friday... AHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhh~~~

      People always ask me why I'm so concerned about my weight. They think I'm too obsessed, they say I'm not fat, but that really isn't the point. It's not that I want to look fit, or that I care so much about looks.  I don't think there's anything to be proud about. Being good-looking, I mean. You're born with it. It's not like you have a choice, or that you can do anything about it. So I really don't understand girls who are so proud of themselves for being pretty. It's not like you even did anything for it. You were born that way. We don't choose to be ugly, do we?  But being thin and keeping fit is a whole different thing. It's something you can actually work for. It means something. To keep fit and be thin you need to control your diet, resist temptation on yummy sweets/fattening food; you need to exercise, not be lazy, etc. If you can't even control your weight, how can you control your own life?

      Got rid of 5 exams today, and all I want to do is SLLEEEPPPP....  'Cos... I skipped all the lessons on Monday, and sat in my room, with my Biology textbook and revision guide, and studied from 9:00am until 5:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to the loo and one large break to lunch including internet time of 30mins. After that I went to tea (dinner).  After 7:00pm I sat in my room with my Music Anthology and Past Papers and revised until... 11:00pm. During which I took several small breaks to Elisabeth's room.  After 11:00pm (lights-out time), I took a flashlight and revised the musical definitions under my covers. I finally fell asleep at about 1:30am. Then this morning I woke up at 6:30am to study for Music again.  And guess what, the exams were so bloody easy!! Especially music. I wondered why I studied so much for it. Biology Modules 1 & 2 were also easy, but Module 3 was quite difficult (may also be that I didn't actually get to finish revising for Module 3)... but overall it was ok.  Yeah, I got a Math Pure 1 exam tomorrow, but it's easy la...

      Highlight of the week: taking my SAT's.   Test center was in Esher, so I had to get up at 6:30, take the train from Worcester Park to New Malden, then to Esher. Got out of the house, and I realised that I forgot to bring my mobile phone w/ me. I thought "shit," but ok.  When I got to New Malden, I discovered that I had forgotten my Admissions Ticket. This was really bad and I considered for a moment NOT taking the SATs at all, but then I figured I might be able to do something about it when I got there, so ok.  When I got to the American Community School in Esher, (took a taxi from Esher Train Station), I found that I didn't bring my calculator.  I was really pissed off, and I wondered why I was even taking the test.  Eventually I learned that even though I didn't have my admissions ticket, I could fill out a registry form and be a "stand-by" test-taker. I did that... but then after I handed the form in, I realised I had filled in the wrong test center number, and also my passport name. I registered online for the SAT using my english name, not my passport name...  What was even worse, I got so confused during the test when I was filling in my name on the Answer Sheet. I kept thinking to myself: passport name? english name? which one? And now that I think of it, I really can't remember which one I used. I think I used my English name.  Anyway, although I didn't have a calculator, I'm pretty sure I got all the math questions right. If nothing went wrong, I'll probably get full marks.  But the verbal section was sooooo horrible... I was guessing all the way through. I mean, yeah, maybe the first 5 questions of every section (anologies and shit) I could do, but the rest was just pure guessing. The reading passages part was pretty much ok, though. The sad thing is that I didn't finish the last verbal section because I had put my answer sheet on top of the question booklet, and I did not realise there were 5 more questions until the lady was like, "please put your pencils down." And I picked up my answer sheet and saw 5 more questions..... (and thought: FUCK!!!) I WAS wondering why there weren't any questions about both the passages!!!!  But oh well, what's done is done, nothing can change it. Bleh.  After the exam, I had to walk (an hour!) all the way back to Esher train station because there were so many people taking the SAT's, and all the taxis were booked. I was very pissed off, and I arrived in the library like... at 3:00pm. Can you imagine? Leaving the house at 6:30am, and coming back at 3:00pm just for an SAT exam.  And gee, I really can't wait until I take my SAT II subject tests! Haha.   Yeah... so I've been studying in the library the past few days, and... now I'm back at school. Half-term is officially over.  Tuesday is the official exam for AS Biology Module 1, 2, and 3. Then Music Aural, History and Analysis. Haha... 6 exams in one day. And I've got Math Pure 1 on Wednesday. Boy this is exciting.

      I finally watched the season finale of Scrubs. It was funny, but I guess they want the J.D. and Elliott thing to be like Ross and Rachel. Maybe 7 years later on their final episode, they will get together when Elliott flies to Paris or something. Haha.  Sometimes I think I take too much for granted. People have given me so much, but what do I have to give back? Nothing, really. And it's sad. Ugh.  Ok, from tomorrow on, I will be doing REVISION REVISION REVISION for my exams... AHHH~!!!

      Seems to me most people don't (or can't) think. They only think other people's thoughts. People who enjoy being in crowds are mostly like that. They like speeches and demos because they are told what to think. And they are with a lot of other people the same as themselves, which makes them think they're thinking for themselves and doing something about what they think. But they aren't. It's all a trick, a con. What they're really doing is giving themselves up to somebody else who is just using them.  å–”, å·®é»å¿˜äº†, ä»Šå¤©æ˜¯æ—æƒŸè±çš„ç”Ÿæ—¥. Happy Birthday!

      Yeah I know that the  6th Form Ball  was like nearly a month ago, but I didn't get the photos developed until today.   So anyway, here they are. (It's not very good quality, since I had to shrink them so they would fit in the tables of this blog. The original gallery is   urlLink here  , if you need a better view... although that's still not the best quality. Ah well.)    [edit]  Okay, so I uploaded them to my   urlLink GJ gallery  , where the quality is better. You click on the photos to enlarge them, and they appear as the original size. Just keep in mind that these photos were scanned, so as far as quality goes... hahaha yeah.  [/edit]                                                                                       Yeah, and that's it. Thank you and goodnight.

      Today I wished I were in high school.    Yes high school. Not Sixth Form (no come on!!!), not American High School (duh!), but the kind where you wear uniforms and sit in school all day from 7AM to 5PM through boring lessons and endure horrible tests that never seem to end and sleep and laugh and talk to your friends and pass notes and make fun of teachers and bitch about people and wait until you can go home. Like normal Chinese high school. The kind I used to be in. The kind I used to hate so much.    Don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean that I regret my decision of leaving, and certainly doesn't mean that I've changed my opinions and now love my urlLink  old school , it just means that after careful consideration and comparison, I wish I stayed. Not that it's much better or anything. In fact, it's not. It's just the feeling that I wish I still had. It's completely different than what in England.    "Different how?", I hear you say. Well for starters I don't have to pay 5468921873214  pounds per year. Secondly I don't have to fly around the whole time, sleeping in airports and what not. I never have to worry where I'm going to stay during holidays and shit, 'cos I can go home. Don't have to worry about money, either, 'cos I'm not spending any (well not much anyway). I don't have to deal with Cantonese (no offense, really, but when you hear it the whole time and you don't understand anything, you want to EXPLODE). I don't have to meet fake, annoying, slutty and obnoxious people or any kind of weirdo produced of that sort (or not the sort, whatever). I don't have to spend nights (and days of course!) missing Chinese/Taiwanese food, the warm (though damp and disgustging at times) weather, my family and friends, and (especially) that ceratin someone.    I'm not denying that it's been better for me. Because it has been, definitely, in lots of different aspects, a lot better than my old (high) school, and I truly learned quite a lot this year. I just don't think it's worth the 3274 million pounds my mother had to and has to pay.    And if I could turn back time, I would've waited. I would've waited until I graduated from high school to leave for university or college or some conservatoire or whatever. But it's too late. And I'm sorry. God I'm such an idiot.

      Had a nightmare last night.  No, not because I watched "The Ring" before I went to bed, (which, by the way, has at least 1/4 of material that I still don't understand,) and certainly not because I feel guilty about not practicing very much violin this week.  Speaking of "The Ring", does anyone actually like it? I personally did not find it scary at all. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it in the first place. Or it's probably because I'm Asian, and the Japanese Version was much more scarier. Or maybe because I watched the Japanese Version when I was 10 (and too young), and I didn't bother to watch "the Ring" until now, (and I've grown up, plus I know the plot and shit). Or maybe because it was on HBO and they cut out all the disgusting scenes...  No, no, my dream has nothing to do with not practicing or other horror stories. It's actually a very normal story with 2 main characters (apart from me) having tea and talking. My character doesn't even do anything but observe them.  But it's bugging me so much!!! I don't know why my dreams bother me so much. And it always affects me in real life. And I've been thinking about that dream all day already.

      In Heathrow I slept 4 hours or so. On the plane I slept about an hour half. Wedenesday I slept for about 7 hours. Then I slept for like 14 hours on Thursday - Friday. And then last night (Friday night) I did not sleep. Then later on in the afternoon I was practicing... but then when I woke up ('cos somehow I fell asleep...|||) it was tea time. And now it's 12:00am and I'm not tired.  Ahhhhhhhh...........

      And all the time, and a lot of the time since, I wondered: Why him? It can't have been that I liked the look of him; it can't only have been physical, not that alone. Can it? Was it?  Maybe I loved him. I thought I did. As much as I knew what the word means.  How do you ever know? I used to think I would know when it happened. Know immediately, without having to wonder about it.  But all I knew for certain was that I couldn't get enough of him. I wanted to be with him all the time. And yet when I was with him that wasn't enough either. I wanted to look at him and touch him and have him touch me and hear him talk and tell him things and do things together with him. All the time. Day and night.  For instance: He would leave. I'd wait on edge for him to come back. People must have thought I had some sort of convulsive twitch because my head and eyes would keep darting towards the door every few seconds. But they couldn't have been mistaken what was going on, when Mr. Wonderful hove into view again, because then I went to pieces. Lost my grip entirely on what I was supposed to be doing and had eyes for nothing but him until I got used to him being there again.  Sounds like a pet dog. And I knew what was happening to me even while it was happening.  At first I tried to stop myself. But I couldn't. It was a compulsion, and obsession. Irresistible. After a while I gave up caring how I behaved or who thought what about me. Trying to hide how I felt was too much strain, and I wasn't succeeding anyway. I was just making a fool of myself. So I let it show, let it happen. I felt easier straightaway. More natural. More in charge of myself. If that was the way I was, I told myself, why pretend anything different?

And the official tracklist is supposed to be (I've removed the translations that I don't agree with, and slightly changed them.): 01 æˆ‘çš„åœ°ç›¤ (Wo De Di Pan / My Territory) 02 ä¸ƒé‡Œé¦™ (Qi Li Xiang / Orange Jasmine) 03 è—‰å£ (Jie Kou / Excuse) 04 å¤–å©† (Wai Po / Grandmother) 05 å°‡è» (Jiang Jun / The General) 06 æ“±æ·º (Ge Qian / Stranded) 07 äº‚èˆæ˜¥ç§‹ (Luan Wu Chun Qiu) 08 å›°ç¸ä¹‹é¬¥ (Kun Shou Zhi Dou / Duel of the Trapped Beasts) 09 åœ’éŠæœƒ (Yuan You Hui / Garden Tour Fete) 10 æ­¢æˆ°ä¹‹æ®¤ (Zhi Zhan Zhi Shang / The Youth That Ends War)  My computer's fixed, and it's much better, I must say.

      It amazes me how some Chinese people can believe in these fortune-tellers (ç®—å‘½å¸«) so much. Like, they believe every single word.  This one fortune-teller told my best friend that if she has beef/steak, she'll have bad luck. So all her life she hasn't had any steak or beef or any cow-related food. (Well maybe once or twice.) That's just missing out on the nice food.  My other friend (who is a very good violinist,) heard from a fortune-teller that if she goes to Europe, not only will she have get a major illness, she'll also fail to get her degree, and end up broke. So now she's not going to even think about going to Europe to study music.  It pisses me off, sometimes, these fortune-tellers. I mean yeah, I know they have no other life skill and probably need this to make money to live... But what they're doing... it's like ruining other people's lives. My friend here could be a very good violinist. And now, if she stays in Taiwan all her life... I doubt she'll get anywhere.  Oh, and she changed her name, too. 'Cos the fortune-teller told her that her name would bring her bad luck. So she changed her name.  What the fuck??
