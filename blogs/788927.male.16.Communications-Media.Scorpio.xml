      Hello all my viewers, i would like to apoligize for being me, I was rude, thus I am rude, I was cruel, thus I am cruel, I am what I am, and thus I am corrupt like the rest of our world, I tried to be pure and save myself but I couldnt, the tendrils of society seeped into my life like bad coffee through cracks in the ceiling and twisted my ideals. Throughout my whole life I have been in conrtol and have made very bad decisions, actions so grave I can never take back, I leave an impression on all those I know, and those I wish to no longer speak with bear a deep emotional scar, its there if you look.  I can no longer bear the pains of this world, and am giving in quickly, only God knows how much longer I can hold out, I tried to be strong for her, but i failed.  Im a hypocrite, everything i do is a lie, and my life is a lie, My eyes have been opened it wont happen again I will see to it,  I can now see I live a lie and my works are foul, i no longer deserve what I get for I manipulate those around me, i tried to make the world how I liked it, I failed and must now reap the consequences of my actions, i would like you all to know that Sean is no longer, and this may be the last post.  The burn has become worse, it has burrowed deep within my heart, and has consumed me whole, I bid you all farewell.

      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My Cast has been Changed SIGNIFICANTLY!!!!!!!  Tristian - My First girlfriend, and ultimately my last, 2.5 months. She had the biggest effect of them all, she taught me friendship, and unlocked my poetry skills.  Ryan - The name of the guy that ends up going out with the girl I just broke up with....believe me, every girl I have ever had was taken by "a" ryan Ryan D. - Personally I dont know him, but apparently he IS a nice guy, if he wasn't and I were to find out,DAMN there would be HOT blood on the walls!!!!!  Lexy - My second girlfriend, five minutes, I am not even going there.  She lost the Our Lady Peace CD I hooked her up with, so funny because it was like 3 months ago I gave it to her, and like she just now decided to look for it  Anna - My most recent girlfriend (3rd), 2 weeks (yeah im getting up pretty high now),  Actually to be honest I have gotten past that whole "lust" thing (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEaN!!!!!!!), I mean i can think about her and like not "think" about her at the same time  Kelly - My first friend that i met when i moved here, we have been through tough and good times, she moved away this summer, i knew her 3 yrs...we still keep in contact  Allie H. - At first a friend of my sister, but I got to know her. I have been there for her, and her for me, one of my closer friends that I respect.  Yeah, i have guided her through the art of releasing angry energy through Poetry, She has come so far.  Becca - A friend that helped end the Reprise of the "Twisted Path" and "The Shadows' calling" chapters, she helped calm my anger and sadness  Jimmy - One of my closest, and best friends, he introduced me to warhammer, and the vast collection of Stephen King.  Tim - For about 3 months during "Forbidden Love" i valued his advice, he had to offer  Jeff - Another of my close friends, he has always been there for me, he's also an accomplished musician  Shauna - A new friend, and possibly a key player in the next chapter of my life. She has a heart for God, and has had some good advice  Makenzie - Also a new friend, Brad's girlfriend. She's into some horror movies, so she's my unnoficial movie critic  Brad - Key factor in the next chapter. Even though he's 2 months older, I took him under my wing and consider him my younger brother. He like Tris and me is a dedicated fan of Brak, Prozzak, and Our Lady Peace  Katrina - New comer to my life, she quickly became close as a friend, and i greatly respect her for her judgement and advice David - neighbour, friend, He was the one who tried to purify me, sadly he failed....lol....Anna succeeded... =) (Doing absolutely nothing but being ANNA!), He also has a wealth of knowledge to give, if he could only figure out that it is there, and get his mind of his guns and knives. Chase - Allie's "unofficial" Boyfriend....Yeah right....anyways, I do not know him yet, but if he is reading this, I will have you know, if you hurt Allie, you are asking for it. Anna's Grandmother - I look to her as a Spiritual support, and a wealth of knowledge, she is so kind to me.  If you are reading, Thank you. Danielle / Anna Mae - Brad's older sis, as she would put it she is the "Shiz".  She works at subway, which makes her the cat's pyjama's.

      Just got off the phone with Allie.  She's cool, I kinda miss seeing her around and stuff.  With College and all I have to really change my priorities.  I mean I no longer have time for anime, warhammer, computer gaming, movies, "secular" music, etc.  and thanks to Anna I really have no "need" for them any more, sometimes I think that maybe God sent her to open my eyes to what was really going and to the fact that maybe, just maybe I was going about living my life the wrong way, she showed me I was, and I thank God so much she was there for me.  I really enjoy spending time with her, learning about her, and learning the wisdom and knowledge her Grandmother has, so much wisdom, so much knowledge.  I thank God for them both, so much.  I just sit there and wonder what would have happened if I had never asked for her number, hmmn, nah bad thought.  I would have been so bored this summer. and Anna if you are reading this, thanks for calling me back even though I was half asleep and in the middle of breakfast. :)  Mmmnnn, Eggs, hash browns, Toast, mmmn, salt, mmnnnn, pepper.

      Well, I just found out what destroyed my vision.....not quite Satan, but I will give him some very little undeserved credit for doing so.  Nintendo's creation, which they so happened to BEAT into the dust, Virtual Boy.  It was only one of the coolest systems out there complete with stereo vision, and stereo sound.  Not intended for the age of 7 yrs or younger, I never read the section of the book before, so now I am abnormally angered toward my abounding stupidity back then, I will go while I think about how I destroyed my vision.

      Hmmn, so if the lack of heavenly wisdom is the result of the power of demonic wisdom, then does that mean that human, natural, instinct is really demonic wisdom and demonic in nature.  Thus showing our Angelic roots.   So confusing that man is angelic these days, thats why the Holy spirit can have trouble entering our hearts and minds.  Today in church, a thought passed my mind, so if the HIV virus were to be harnessed correctly, you know extracting the virus and all, and the bio-luminescent gene from either bottom-dweller fish or fire-flies inserted in with blood protein, we could technically have glow in the dark blood.  No apparent value to our lives, but i mean you could cut yourself to open a dark room up.

      Calculus will be fun this year, God blessed me last year with a good teacher, I pray that this year I may be as lucky.  The burning in my eyes, the pain in my heart, something is wrong, somethign I can not find.

      Well, I am here again.  Anna came and visited with us for a day, that was way cool, sadly even when she is there, I am still disrespectfulto those nearby.  I am not sure why, stupid demonic inspiration, thats the way I look at it now, if it aint of God, its demonic.  Stupid demons, not my fault they are looked after by Abaddon.  I wonder if he has a temper, and like beats them for fun?  I have no idea, just a twisted thought based on my twisted past.  Then again I should not complain, I mean I got both my parents, and I am a Christian.  I guess that means I am better off then some people, so I am assuming that I have no right complaining about my life.  Well you would have never guessed it, but Anna has convinced me to get out of Anime, I mean my life was resting on it, so she helped saved my eternity.  Though little did I know that this lack of Anime would drive me mad.  I mean, I spent the majority of my life (and money) on anime, and look at it now, behind me and out of my life?  So this means that I wasted that portion of my life, all that time, that I will never get back, all the predicaments I found myself in that are now vain.  All the sacrifices I made mean nothing.  As stated yesterday, very little matters to me anymore, I am now officially sick of console systems, let alone computer games.  As far back as I can remember I loved computer games, but now, they seem so "boring" no point.  Ryan is back, and reality is taken its toll on my life again, back to rigorous calculus exercises and school 18 hrs a day.  I view Ryan as a harbringer that will haunt my life, but then again our words affect our outcomes, so my question is WHY RYAN, I mean its better than Chester or Floyd, but i dont know anymore.  Sometimes if it were not for either 1. God, 2. Anna (in that order, I always go to God, first he always comes through) I would cease to have a will to live on.  Anna, if your reading this.....I love you and God loves you.  Well as for the rest of you God bless.

      Well, Looks like i report here once again, sadly not too much new news, though this summer thing is beginning to wear on me.  ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!1 why must we humans be so fickle and corrupted with demonic wisdom, I mean, we want something and when we get it we get bored, and then want something else.  I can under stand why lazy people are happy with their lives.  I seem no longer to be contempt, with this summer, the heat, the anguish, the pain, the bitterness, I cannot take it, Sometimes if it werent for God, and my commitment to Anna, I would just die.  "Life what is it a solid or a liquid" - Mars Ill (i think), makes you think, is all we do in vain, or maybe really worth it.  What about that kid in your class that everyone looks up to, ever think about why?  unless they talk to God, they are probably filled with demonic wisdom,  these spirits, I dont know some times.   or Perhaps why it took forever for David and my Mom to convince of my bad ways, i mean, how was Anna able to do right away, i dont really know.  This year all i have in mind is God, School, God, Anna.  Maybe its sinful that I didnt list my family their, but I love them, even though im way uber rude sometimes.  Isn't it amazing how family is always there for you, and so understanding.  With everything i have learned about the human nature my family continues to confound me, i mean i go and get in like a major amount of trouble with them, and like they pardon me, i mean human nature cannot allow that or can it?  how can they continue to love me even when i have directly sinned against them. Just because i am their flesh and blood?  You know how the mapped the human genome and all, well I will challenge them to find what part of our DNA that the angel code resides in, i mean do angels have dna? or was our birth like a "spiritual infection,"  like a kind of Alien Resurrection style thingy going on.  So like how big would one of these Nephalim be i mean, they were huge, and like Goliath was like a shorter Nephalim.  If scientists are so smart can they mimic emotion, I truly doubt it, i mean emotion is based on experiences, and I really dont think that computers can get those, It would take far too long to explain the code for basic comprehension let alone a whole mind.  Well, it turns out they went ahead and capitilized on my idea of a low frequency disruption cannon.  HARP project if you care.  Another idea of mine was like Bio-thermal energy, some how converting body heat, amplifying it, creating steam, using the steam in turbines, thus energy.  Who knows may already be invented.

      Well the other night I did the unthinkable, I of all people tried fish.  I mean that was a fish like no other, It was like a Chicken in a Salmon Suit, or rather a chicken in salmon's clothes.  But anyways, I went by Anna's place, I admire her so much, and I thank her for being there for me, I am so happy I have a friendship with her, we can sit there and talk on an eye to eye level, its amazing how intelligent she is, her mind is full of possibilities, she could do anything she wanted.  As for Anna, I would like to thank her for trusting me, that trust which I will never betray, Has helped keep me inline, Thank you Anna, and Adios.

      hhhhmmmmmmmmn Thought for the day: Suppose I had 2 cows, and 1 in 2 cows was a winner, and I sold the "winning" cow without realizing it was a winner, does the 1 out of 2 cows ideal still apply to the remaining cow, or does it become 100 % of cows are losers?  anyways, for all you people still tuned in, I will be receiving the Evangelion on Dvd soon. Nice, i know.  Any interested in that marathon contact me, I will be having the marathons during winter break.  Anyways Evangelion should be clean except for an implied "room at night" scene, anyways.  God Bless you all!

      After a day of long searching I have finally come upon a list of SAFE anime, but for some odd reason, all anime seem to have a "shower" scene, Why this is, we will never know.  Maybe it was some sort of ploy to exhaust cartoon water supplies, or rather the color BLUE.  Sometimes I ponder about the difference between American and Japanese animation, Japanese is either totally brutal, or totally cute, American animation likes to straddle this fence, not sure why, Dang melting pot of unrighteous glory.

      Hmmn Considerign the values of our nation, and our current standing in the world, no one knows when Armageddon may occur.  Its astonishing as to how many people you will yelling and screaming that are God, in the streets, some times drug addicts enervate me.  I mean look at them, so void and oblivious to our world and its socio-economic standing, not caring as to when doomsday will be, but rather when they will get their next high, and not how or why.  Satan has stirred quite a congregation, I mean he's getting desperate, thousands of years of experience and madness/exile backing that foul creation.  People say armageddon is near, but we dont know, the Anti-Christ may or may not have been born yet.  Remember that he prob wont rise to power till about 30 yrs old, this will be a glorious day in hell, as far as the Un-Saved are concerned this "prince" will simply be a modern day equivalent version of Jesus, doing exactly (Cept Salvation) what he did.  How Satan has tried many times to damn humanity. 1. Tempting of Man 2. Nephalem 3. Tower of Babylon 4. The creation of idolatry 5. and many things to come  One Day, one day "That all men might see the truth and know the way to heaven"

      Well today is a good day, Two more of my music videos have been completed Krwling, and 1stp Klosr.  Using my newly bought copy of Spawn, I have brought these songs to life.  Krwling was based upon the death of Al Simmons, and ultimately the birth of Spawn.  I have now successfully seen all but 2 episodes of Invader Zim, my brain throbs.  Kinda like that one time i had my southpark marathon, that was dangerous, had some hazardous effects on my skin and/ or eyes, not to mention mind.  Ack, for one week i was breathing Trey Parker.  Speaking of dangerously addictive, cartoon marathons, while I was in Cali, I watched the week long Daria marathon, i was monoton(e)ic for a long while.  Coming September 24, this year, I will be having my first Gundam Wing 20hr marathon, any interested please contact me, YOU know how, and where to contact me.  This will be a dangerous marathon, ending with the film "Endless Waltz," The final gundam wing film, we may even have a Gundam Battle Assault 2 Psx Tourney.  As far as Dragon Ball Z goes, I may or may not have a Namek Saga marathon, sadly though there ARE commercials, so this marathon, will only be by public demand. Over , out

      Well went much brighter.  Jeff spent the night twice, that was neato.  And we rented Spawn, that movie kicks butt and everyone should watch it sooner or later.  On the other hand Anna called and actually talked to me without putting me off on hold, she was really nice to talk to.  We talked for awhile about life and she said a few things that really helped me release what little anger I had toward her, she's happy with her life and im content that she is!  Well life's good here, Night all you.  God Bless.

      People, Guess What?   I did the impossible, I did my own wash.   Well ya, but I also made an Invader Zim music video using a Herring, no X-ecutioner style by The X-Ecutioner & Black Thought and Mr. Hahn.  It turned quite nicely actually, email me if ya want to see it sometime. :)

      Well today turned out pretty nicely, a far better turnout than yesterday.  I mean I watched about 6 recorded episodes of "Invader Zim."  Makes you think, whatever happened to that show, I would not mind getting a few of those episodes on DVD or somthing.  I mean if any of you can hook me up, then hook me up. :).   Wasnt it funny how Zim could never take over the world without Gaz, Dib, or his "Faithful" robot/dog Gir getting in the way.  Sometimes I wonder as to why I watch the Television programming I do.  I mean i watch strange stuff, some personal faves are:  (In order)  Invader Zim Ren and Stimpy Robotech Southpark Dragon Ball Daria Macross Spawn Tales from the crypt   I mean mostly animated, but like what am i supposed to watch?  its a calming break from reality

      Well thats it for my Tristian chapter of my life.  I am over her, I was holding on until I had met Ryan.  I did, so I decided I could care less as to what she does now, and whether or not shes happy with life.  Well this is one of my many chapters of my life, this one in particular is part of the dark chapters.  Dark Chapters (Chronological to some extent oldest to newest):  A Twisted Path - My obsession with Ren and Stimpy, and Tales from the crypt, that warped my views of reality  Their Twisted Ideals - Point in my childhood when i was repeatedly harrassed at school, tormenting and beating me.   I eventually snapped  Shifting Paths - Time when when my Grandfather became ill, we moved alot, he died, and we relocated to Washington  The Shadows' Calling - A period of time in which Nightmares plagued my dreams, part of this period intertwined with the Forbidden Love chapter.  Meeting Jamie, unlocked my ability to understand the irony of my relationship between my life and my dreams.  A New Friend - Time in which I met Kelly, we got close as friends.  Later due to my errors we grew apart, she moved at the tailend of Forbidden Love, since then we have gotten closer  Forbidden Love - Tristian, Anna, and Ryan Inc....and burning anger toward my parents.  Tristian unlocked my ability of poetry, perhaps the only good part of this chapter.

      These two poems were written later the night I met Ryan, and were addressed at Tristian:  -----------------------------------------------------------------  What was left of your shattered self is gone, leaving me here alone, to suffer in the cold, memories of you, fractured dreams left to agonize, no longer needed, or wanted, I remain  The joy I had, is gone, to see the knowledge that they bore, the atmosphere filled with hate, downtrodden, I remain  My last hope destroyed, my joy now gone, I no longer wish, I no longer hope, that memory is gone, it has died, I remain  Those who are there, request too much, and expect too little, feelings of animosity rise then fall, I failed to stand, I remain  The memories will not return, my decision was the factor, I caused this, I allowed this, no longer needed, I remain?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You sit there, happy in your world, I allowed it, or Did I?  I was happy at first, to you smile, to see your face, I tried, it brought joy to my heart, stabbed in my back, I fell, starving, forced to dine on my own blood, to consume my own life  In the aftermath, he is always present, always watching, punctual, waiting, and ready, to see me fail, and take my place, erasing my memories  The nightmares beckon, once again they call, I may return, the shadows' will, too strong to resist, echoing in my mind  I hope your happy, I really do, I thought I tried, I hope you are happy, I can take it no longer, one day my friend, I guess this is goodbye  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Well anyone who has gotten to know me will know that I write poetry, and I thank 2 people for it.  God for giving it to me, and Tristian for unlocking it.  Here is my current stockhold of my poetry.  (Note: they aint in any kind of order)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Why do I live in this flesh shell that I hate, Which daemons try to steal and take, This brain I have, how do I know it is there, I do not see it, And search in despair... for an answer, Where it lies I cannot see, For the answer, it lives inside of me, Not in the brain, but in the mind, Which has taken me so long to find, And when I do, I realize, That it is no longer an object, But a concept on which I have wasted time, The mind resides in the soul, With untold rage and with no control, It lashes out to maim, But fails in its cruel and twisted game, Only with a maiden's voice can it be tamed, But even then there lies no remain, Of this thing they call a brain    ------------------------------------------------------------------  Happiness and joys on earth are lies, Merely visions in man's clouded eyes, Which are always lies,  Life is bleak, Death is vast, What's wrong, what's right, Memories past, Nothing is left, All is gone, How can you stop that which you have begun  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Shames and sorrows swallow us whole, into a void-like black hole, that is life, cutting through you like a knife, worlds split in two, to be with you, shattering like bone, to resist that which draws us apart, like a needle on a dart, drawing blood as it goes, drawing and taking to where noone knows, where no energy flows, darkness consuming us all, as death, vengeance, and lust steal souls, Daemons value them as gold, they trap the souls that are sold, in the icy grip of death, that causes us to part  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Worlds falling, death stalling, daemon's laughter, and people's screams, agonizing pains, hideous laughter, needless suffering, and deaths in vain, everlasting pains, longing to be maimed, death is simple, life is hard, so addicted to the black art, end it all with a knife in your heart, remembering in death, everything from the start, then you will be complete  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  In life you miss, Death is bliss,  Life is bad, Death is sad, Nothing's right, Nothing's wrong, Why for earthly desires do we long,  Death is good, Death is Had, Why do we long memories had, Memories are old, Souls were sold, For worthless gold, The gold is gone when we depart, So why do we make it the desire of our heart, It embittered us all, And it will lead us to our fall  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Death, emptiness, and woes surround us, Like shadows in the day, We like to hide these torments like shadows in the night, Unseen they are, but there they be,  Death, pictures of thousands of lost souls, Burning or living, none will know, But only in one's death do you find the answers that you seek, Where you will find the one that is not weak,  Woes of the past torment us in the day, While we hide them in the night with only a tear to stay, Emptiness, sadness, and the lack of self worth, Trying to hide them becomes ones undoing into the bitter earth, Until one's bitter end you will stay, Seeking answers along the way, About which none will say, Until that bitter day  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Creature lurking in the night, That are your fears causing you to fight,  Voices in your head, Make you want to be dead, But when all is said, Nothing is done, Fears causing you to run, To run from life, Causing you to reach for a knife, And make it end,  Life is painful, Death is painless, Waiting for it in utter silence, Thoughts to atone for, Causing you to want it forever more  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Autumn,  leaves falling, daemons crawling,  rats gnawing and cats clawing,  I am lost in this world, so confused,  so confused the spirits are becoming amused, their energies gathering, wounds festering,  their questions become pestering,  in this world.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Withdrawal  What is this vile poison, That gives and takes, What is this loud commotion, that makes the dead wake, the choirs of screams, that echo in my mind, the nightmares, the messengers, that plague the soul, that makes the creatures whole, this lie I live, why does it stay, only to haunt another age, days, seconds, and minutes go by, only to torture me, yet another time, demons knocking at my hearts door, consuming my mind, devouring my soul, attracting my flesh, only to let it go, the demons will reign, the needles, the pain, the creature it lurks, seeking only to torment, my human soul they crave  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Well for all you that do not know a thing about me, the cast of my life are as follows.  Tristian - My First girlfriend, and ultimately my last, 2.5 months.  She had the biggest effect of them all, she taught me friendship, and unlocked my poetry skills. Ryan - The name of the guy that ends up going out with the girl I just broke up with....believe me, every girl I have ever had was taken by "a" ryan Lexy - My second girlfriend, five minutes, I am not even going there Anna - My most recent girlfriend (3rd), 2 weeks (yeah im getting up pretty high now), dumped on account of me not being serious enough for her Kelly - My first friend that i met when i moved here, we have been through tough and good times, she moved away this summer, i knew her 3 yrs...we still keep in contact Allison - At first a friend of my sister, but I got to know her.  I have been there for her, and her for me, one of my closer friends that I respect Becca - A friend that helped end the Reprise of the "Twisted Path" and "The Shadows' calling" chapters, she helped calm my anger and sadness Jimmy -  One of my closest, and best friends, he introduced me to warhammer, and the vast collection of Stephen King. Tim - For about 3 months during "Forbidden Love" i valued his advice, he had to offer Jeff - Another of my close friends, he has always been there for me, he's also an accomplished musician Shauna - A new friend, and possibly a key player in the next chapter of my life.  She has a heart for God, and has had some good advice Makenzie - Also a new friend, Brad's girlfriend.  She's into some horror movies, so she's my unnoficial movie critic Brad - Key factor in the next chapter.  Even though he's 2 months older, I took him under my wing and consider him my younger brother.  He like Tris and me is a dedicated fan of Brak, Prozzak, and Our Lady Peace Katrina - New comer to my life, she quickly became close as a friend, and i greatly respect her for her judgement and advice

         I saw Tristian today, and i also met Ryan. Little did I know, he knew more about me than i knew about him. I was uncomfortable in an atmosphere of hatred and unwant, not only that but i was let down she did not wish to see me, i knew she wouldnt, i just sat there in that house, listening to them talking , i sat in the doorstep, always ready to go, but i thought that maybe if i stayed i could see what good Tristian saw in Ryan and his friends. and I saw what she saw, I saw nothing, the Tristian i knew was just a shattered memory, no longer acceptable, The Tristian i once knew was no longer replaced by this new Tristian. or rather did my entry into the picture change Tristian, and has she now just reverted back to her original self. one day i might know, but now i dont care, i thought that maybe i could be happy for her on account of her newfound happiness, but it was to no avail, her happiness, was at a cost. She has changed, and to be honest people to change, maybe i am the one that changed, maybe im just jealous. Maybe its selfish of me to say that she was better off with me than Ryan. He's opposed to all types of faith, and hates Christians. Whatever Tristian told him was a great deal, because as i said he knew more about me than he should have.

      Cold, so cold, Lacking emotion, missing compassion,  no discretion, I long, time goes on, I cannot Love  That would be the thought for the day, I realized I lack compassion and cannot feel emotions of others, and feel no sadness for them when they are sad, the reason for which I do not yet know, my sister feels compassion though, which means my family does not lack it, but she has a good relationship with one of my parents, while me on the other hand lack that.  I feel it is because I have neglected them, not them I.  I also noticed I lack discretion and common sense, or at least that's what my mother seems to point out, indiscreetly.  Dont get me wrong, I love my parents, just it gets so hard sometimes to express my feelings.  College work calls, night all of you, God Bless

      Quote for the day: "I am not an animal......I am a human being" - Elephant Man (Forgot his name)  Well yeah I feel like that sometimes, jsut snapping and telling people that.  But yeah, Class was good today, not as tense, I feel relaxed, and more confident about going into engineering, Thank God.  So many rules and regulations, and restrictions and codes of honor, its a profession you know.  But on a lighter note, My Logic class is the shiznit, as my fave would say.  I Love the logic its so perplexing yet beautiful.  Makes life and dreams so rational, apparently I am called upon, thank you all for tuning in today, Konichiwa

      Hmmn thinking about it, Evangelion is great eye opener to scientists and people alike to show them potential results of toying with God's power to create, thus utter destruction results. Thank God, i am not into the whole genetic alteration thing.  RUmour has it that Nasa is creating biological materials, or nano machinery that can heal it self, thus self healing cars, ponder that for a while.  *spoiler*  turns out the EVAs are actually huge bio-interbreeds between Angels and Humans, strange ehh?

      I bear your wounds, I house your pain,  Those words have echoed in my head for two days or somethign like that, well I started College today, it was definately a humbling experience that I enjoyed, I am happy to finally find myself amongst others much like me but not, in their own special ways.  I do not understand this thing I am feeling, whenever I get in a church strange stuff begins to happen to me, and suddenly Anna knows more about spiritual stuff than me, something is occuring and I am not liking the potential outcome, talk to Anna if you want to know the specifics.  I bear your wounds, I house your pain, borne of maimed, words,  I smell your fear, I taste your blood,  fearing, wasting, waiting, longing,  you are near, your voice it soothes, your flesh it calls, your voice so sweet,  standing here I ponder, considering my standing, wanting to see you, wanting to hold you,  knowing, I back off, wisdom beckons, I come back,  like a siren's touch your beauty, like scylla, I fear, Charybdis calls,  I will miss you, I will miss you

      This anger yearns, as my mind burns, to know, to shatter,  to free itself of his embrace, this prince who comes, to get me repeatedly, I loathe his face,  his touch, it binds, those in his stables, rendering thought unable,  To bring him to his knees I vowed, 3 I have lost, only failure I have found, within my grasp I could have helped, though ambitions held me down,  you brought me joy, through pain, 's endless games, torments will,  your joy, your smile, made it worth the while, and I will endure

      You know Im here for you,  I have told time and time again, but somehow its not enough, I need to open up, to let you know, How I feel,  Too closed, too far, so distant, Im missing it, lacking that which I need, which is to understand, myself, so that I can get you,  my pain, my torment, rocking my mind like torrents, of wind, of thunder but not blunders, from that land down under,  So i have chosen to open up, and see, what the world is like with me, a happier place, to see you smile, to think I should stay awhile, to make it worth your while,  Maybe I matter,  perhaps I do,  to someone such as you,  so I will stay, I will continue,   Thank you God, and Thank you

      Hello noble viewers, Sean here, I finally figured out the true meaning of King of the Closet, it is a song about a dude, probably some hard core, like atheistic worldly person, that is faced with the decision of turning to Christ.  Looking at myself I have realized as to why, I cannot truly understand others, mostly because I do not understand myself, I guess.  Apparently I hear that I dont really speak of myself too much, or rather the better word set would be my problems, in a way would that make me selfish, by closing myself off from the world or does that merely make me an introverted social outcast?  Email me if you have any views on the issue.  Yeah, so anyways Im getting my new comp soon, but anyways, im out.

      Well Im Back, and have recovered from my slight.....erk of character.  Anyways I also got back from Seattle, :), that was ok, I guess, saw over 160 girls between 14 and 18 yrs of age, that wasnt too bad ;).  Finally, tracked down Margo Harshman, dang she is one fine actress, not bad, i mean took me 8 hrs to find her.  So yeah im getting me an autographed pic, yup uh huh, im good.  Yeah, and get this, she's a christian, and pretty good looking, and to add to that, no lust from my direction. I guess i got over the "lust" phase in my life, normal school is starting again, I start college soon later this month, so one step at a time i will get my Engineering degree, GO SEAN!!!!, Anyways just want to say hi to a few people Lacoda, Jimmy, Tim, Margo (who knows you might be looking), Ranae, and of course Anna, Uncle Ron, and umm Baba.

      Well that would be My playlist, I mean my cd soundtrack for "Anything for A Kat" and "The Quest for Bob."  Both movies will be about 15-45 minutes long depending on the way the scripting sessions go.  "Anything for A Kat" - is a only a tentative name but the movie will be about Fancy Cheese, and cheesy stunts and special effects "The Quest for Bob" - is a movie searching for a this person, ":)" there will be much speculation about the way Bob is.

      You dont know the havoc in making a film first of I gotta pick the music, the mood, the lighting, its all chaos, I swear UTTER chaos, i really got to get started on it though.  Hmmn, havent done this for a while.  I would like to say hey to: Lexy, Anna, Erin, Danielle, Rachel, Sean, and like all my other Canadian homies.  Hmmn any ideas for the music can be emailed to me, you know my email addy, so yeah use it for a change.  and if Anyone has a KDD cd send it in this direction i could really borrow it for awhile that or a Kj-52 cd.

      yeah, my experience with Robocop 2 was kinda like my Mom's experience with Black Mask, probably a good movie but the wanton violence kinda detracted from the lacking storyline creating ultimately an atmosphere of chaotic frenzy. I mean the director was doing stuff that I mean I personally wouldn't have put into a film.  But I guess its a sign of the times, Violence seems to be what the public wants.  Well I flipped on the radio today for a change, first off I heard something about hash, weed, crack and cocaine, which was kinda startling some song about it, some rap song, Dmx, Xzibit or Redman, not sure.  But I mean how can we be Anti-drug if all the music we listen to is Pro-drug.  Then we have people who listen to this music sympathize with it , then "synchronize" with it then we have people doing stuff because their subconcious wants them to.  Well as far as Project Urban Chaos goes, it turns out will be working on the cheese film very soon, as in ASAP, starting friday.  We Will be using music from Kj-52, Kdd, and several other influences.

The movie is great though i havent watched my new copy yet, which i will be doing her shortly, well actually im watching it at the same time im posting this. :).  Robocop 2 was far too violent for viewing, i mean the viiolence was grotesque and never ending, at one point Kane repeatedly broke someones' neck, HOW DO YOU DO THAT!!!!!!, and in another part he cut someone open alive, what kind of sick deranged person performs viviectomies...Gir.

       Schrodinger's Riddle : ill explain the riddle,  in a box, there was nothing but a cat, and into the box a gas was released but you wouldnt know till you opened the box:  -whether the cat was dead or alive -whether it died before or after the gas -whether it was dead to being with -or whether it died when the box was opened and experienced a pressure change or the addition of oxygen to the gas   Pandora's Box : Well the only thing I know about Pandora's Box is that anything is that a total of everything and nothing combined or a total of everything, or a total of nothing, or total of something in between could happen, and to add to this dilemma of confusion that has already built up, everything or nothing is a random occurence, object, event, color, shape, space, time, thus a white hole and a black hole at the same time, but not a wormhole, NOT A WORMHOLE whatsoever  You are probably sitting there wondering as to why I would even bother telling you about to Equally confusing situations, well this is why, I would like you to decide, then contact me with which one you think is more confusing, I will post it here on the site the totals.

Well I have considered, and with some prayer, I think I am set on my path into Computation and Neural systems, I love it.  its very interesting, Its like The mind and its neural connections and the equivalent implications they supply eachother with, I cannot wait to begin working toward that degree.   Sadly, ill be leaving home, heading off in 2004 for Redmond, 2 years there, to begin the process of learning programming, which I think I am looking forward to, I just ask God for his wisdom and guidance.

      Well today I hooked up my new monitor, *drools*, a nice flat panel LCD, I love it with a passion, but sadly its slow i mean it has a like a shadow thingy, but i guess it keeps me down to earth in some abstract way.  Day by day the wound heals, the wound she inflicted stuck deep,  She will never read this, for she does not know this is here, though someone else will feel her pain as a mistake, which has happened before, why must others suffer for others' transgressions.  This cruel world, its master is even more so corrupt, this world, society i mean, is going to hell in a hand basket.  The pain you bore was not my fault, it was you who caused it on me, you now bear my pain and your transgressions upon yourself.  Which brings me to the subject of love, love is neverending, true love that is, pain is an affliction of the mind, if we didnt have a mind we wouldnt feel pain, and this is true, you are reading this wondering what I am getting at, those words are immortal, those three words, and this is why I do not say them often, so those of you who read this and love, know that it is only love if it is neverending, trust me on this, when you look back at your lives you will see.

      That Song below is "Cruel Angel Thesis",  on a side note it has echoed throughout the halls of my mind for days upon end, it sums up my life recently, I guess

      Well I dont usually post lyrics to songs that I haven't written or influenced, but here is a song that I feel reflects something somewhere in someone who is reading this' life:   Like a cruel angel, young boy, become the legend!  A blue wind is now knocking at the door to your heart, and yet you are merely gazing at me and smiling.  Something gently touching-- you're so intent on seeking it out, that you can't even see your fate yet, with such innocent eyes.  But someday I think you'll find out that what's on your back are wings that are for heading for the far-off future.  The cruel angel's thesis will soon take flight through the window, with surging, hot pathos,  if you betray your memories. Embracing this sky [universe] and shining,  young boy, become the legend!  Sleeping for a long time in the cradle of my love The morning is coming when you alone will be called by a messenger of dreams.  Moonlight reflects off the nape of your slender neck. Stopping time all throughout the world I want to confine them, but...  So if two people being brought together by fate has any meaning,  I think that it is a "bible" for learning freedom.   The cruel angel's thesis. The sorrow then begins. You held tight to the form of life when you woke up from that dream. You shine brighter than anyone else. Young boy, become the legend!  People create history while weaving love. Even knowing I'll never be a goddess or anything like that, I live on.  The cruel angel's thesis will soon take flight through the window, with surging, hot pathos, if you betray your memories. Embracing this sky and shining, young boy, become the legend!

      Freed from my curse, My soul is shattered, my wings tasting air, but that is not the case,  happy yet sad, the moon is bittersweet, red as blood, blue as peace,  death waited, it called, I came, answered its discernment,  Sitting there, it burned, though I yearned, for it all to end,  looking, you do not know what to think, I know you read this, it watches silently,  unable, to watch, I sit, defeated, broken, and freed, my captor slain,  I cry, tears of pain, tears of resentment, tears of joy,  I gave to it my life, my all, my love, it never was returned,  so all I do is sit, wait, and wonder, Was it all worth the while?

      Well today it clicked in my mind that none of you really know who Anna is so yeah, Ill do you all the favor of explaining Anna to you all.  Hmmn, Anna in a nutshell.  Well if Anna were a nut she would be a cashew.  Yeah I know its very descriptive eh?  Hmmn how about an acorn, no an ONION!!!!!!!!!! Yes an onion, hmmn, yes she has layers and much like the city of midgar (yeah, all you folks who played final fantasy 7, you ROCK, yeah rock on, and all of you who have not, then yeah go PLAY IT), it has many sectors that have yet to be destroyed, and opened so that all can see the true interior of this, *beautiful* city.  ok, so maybe my description of Anna, was not really the best, but she really is a great girl. So kind, though like coffee she has perks, but like coffee, keeps you awake until midnight, and doesnt let you down, until you cant get anymore.  so maybe I am making Anna overated, but honestly she is a great person, and a great friend, and I am sure that anyone who truly gets to know her, would really like her as much as I do.  And yeah like Allie and Becca, if you have a problem with Anna, you are going to have to deal with me, and that is not the wisest thing to do, mostly because you will need to find me first which is not very easy, and second, yeah, ill break every bone in your body, then eat them for dinner, mmmmmnnnn marrow. lol, on a side note , i thought you might want to know that in Trinidad people eat the bones of the meat they consume, so it runs in the genetics, I am Trinidadian, and on a side note, some cannabalism runs in my blood, so yeah watchout.  Anyways anyone reading this is probably beginning to think I am some sort of dangerous person, lol, honestly I couldnt hurt a fly.

      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The New chapter has begun  Dark Chapters (Chronological to some extent oldest to newest):   A Twisted Path - My obsession with Ren and Stimpy, and Tales from the crypt, that warped my views of reality   Their Twisted Ideals - Point in my childhood when i was repeatedly harrassed at school, tormenting and beating me. I eventually snapped   Shifting Paths - Time when when my Grandfather became ill, we moved alot, he died, and we relocated to Washington   The Shadows' Calling - A period of time in which Nightmares plagued my dreams, part of this period intertwined with the Forbidden Love chapter. Meeting Jamie, unlocked my ability to understand the irony of my relationship between my life and my dreams.   A New Friend - Time in which I met Kelly, we got close as friends. Later due to my errors we grew apart, she moved at the tailend of Forbidden Love, since then we have gotten closer   Forbidden Love - Tristian, Anna, and Ryan Inc....and burning anger toward my parents. Tristian unlocked my ability of poetry, perhaps the only good part of this chapter.   Dearest *Lost through out the test of time*, I am borne of myself - Key Players in my life this chapter will probably be, Nik, Lexy ((Rebirth, revised) = (She's back)), Allie, Anna, David, Nathan, and Arthur/James. This chapter will probably cover my life through college, my awakening to the fact that I am not as volatile as I thought I needed to be, and probably the trip to Canada.

      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My Cast has been Changed SIGNIFICANTLY!!!!!!!   Tristian - My First girlfriend, and ultimately my last, 2.5 months. She had the biggest effect of them all, she taught me friendship, and unlocked my poetry skills.  Ryan - The name of the guy that ends up going out with the girl I just broke up with....believe me, every girl I have ever had was taken by "a" ryan  Ryan D. - Personally I dont know him, but apparently he IS a nice guy, if he wasn't and I were to find out,DAMN there would be HOT blood on the walls!!!!!  Lexy - My second girlfriend, five minutes, On a side note, that was the best five minutes (other than like worship last week) of my life, she's funny, humourous, enjoyable(somehow all three relate), Hmmnn compassionate, chances are if i went on I would probably talk myself into going out with her again, i really dont want to screw up again with her, took to long for me to finally realize that I was a self-righteous bastard of a jerk, but yeah anyways, HEY LEXY!!!!!!!!!. She found the Our Lady Peace CD I hooked her up with.  As far as the whole girlfriend thing, it was my fault we broke up anyways, im so freakin immature at times.  on a side note, Lexy is awsome, she has been there for me, and I have been a jerk to her, and she has still been there for me, so Lexy, if you are reading this, Im sorry, k?  Email me when you read this. Anna - My most recent girlfriend (3rd), 2 weeks (yeah im getting up pretty high now), Actually to be honest I have gotten past that whole "lust" thing (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEaN!!!!!!!), I mean i can think about her and like not "think" about her at the same time.  Well lately she has become part of the family, I mean shes here so friggin much, its cool though, cuz like yeah, shes cool.  Sometimes I wonder about why, yeah thats a whole new subject, but yeah if any one Reading this has a bone to pick with Anna, then take it to me. Kelly - My first friend that i met when i moved here, we have been through tough and good times, she moved away this summer, i knew her 3 yrs...we still keep in contact  Allie H. - At first a friend of my sister, but I got to know her. I have been there for her, and her for me, one of my closer friends that I respect. Yeah, i have guided her through the art of releasing angry energy through Poetry, She has come so far.  Becca - A friend that helped end the Reprise of the "Twisted Path" and "The Shadows' calling" chapters, she helped calm my anger and sadness  Jimmy - One of my closest, and best friends, he introduced me to warhammer, and the vast collection of Stephen King.  Tim - For about 3 months during "Forbidden Love" i valued his advice, he had to offer  Jeff - Another of my close friends, he has always been there for me, he's also an accomplished musician  Shauna - A new friend, and possibly a key player in the next chapter of my life. She has a heart for God, and has had some good advice  Makenzie - Also a new friend, Brad's girlfriend. She's into some horror movies, so she's my unnoficial movie critic  Brad - Key factor in the next chapter. Even though he's 2 months older, I took him under my wing and consider him my younger brother. He like Tris and me is a dedicated fan of Brak, Prozzak, and Our Lady Peace  Katrina - New comer to my life, she quickly became close as a friend, and i greatly respect her for her judgement and advice  David - neighbour, friend, He was the one who tried to purify me, sadly he failed....lol....Anna succeeded... =) (Doing absolutely nothing but being ANNA!), He also has a wealth of knowledge to give, if he could only figure out that it is there, and get his mind of his guns and knives.  Chase - Allie's "unofficial" Boyfriend....Yeah right....anyways, I do not know him yet, but if he is reading this, I will have you know, if you hurt Allie, you are asking for it.  *update* Chase did break Allie's heart, so he's asking for it, I warned him, he's gonna feel pain for this, assuming that someone actually introduces me to Chase, which is probably asking for it all together Anna's Grandmother - I look to her as a Spiritual support, and a wealth of knowledge, she is so kind to me. If you are reading, Thank you.  Danielle / Anna Mae - Brad's older sis, as she would put it she is the "Shiz". She works at subway, which makes her the cat's pyjama's. Justine - Tristian's Ex-best friend or something or other, i dunno i lost track, lol, I have known her for like 2 yrs now, yet i have never met her, im looking forward to that one day, should it actually happen. :) DJ - Allie's second dude, thing, guy or what not that pissed me off during this last few weeks, hes asking for it also, so he better be ready to receiving shards.  I am planning on making him feel the pain of the broken heart, then make him eat the shards, 2-for-1 deal, as i see it one he'll feel my(her) pain, and 2 he will clean up the mess he left. Nik - Well, I have known him for a while, but recently he has become increasingly more important in my life, not entirely sure why. Arthur - My neighbour for so friggin long, but for someodd reason i never really knew him, lately he has become a friend, and he rocks, he also plays the sax, its awsome. James - my other neighbour, just found out hes like 13, he acts so much more mature at times, so i never really know, but yeah he plays the sax also, so thats way cool. Ranae - Well what's to say about Ranae, like justine, I have never met her, then again, if i did meet her, she would think I am some psychopath, so i guess its better this way, she's awsome, loves God, and is umm Ranae

      Well, I am back, and happy to speak of 2 things, YES 2 things.  and not concisely at all.  First off, I found my Tunnel Rats/Kj-52/4th avenue jones' cd that I had lost.  So yeah I applied for winter quarter, the process itself was a living hell, because something about $378 in late charges at the library, it was pretty screwy, so i had to return all those books, to help my account, to remove the block to register for courses, to get into clark, to continue my degree, to think that it was only 3 of those books that were holding me back.....Arggh Stupid Homer!!!! Yeah I got Math 211, Psyc 211, Engr 112, Engr 114, 15 credits total, as stated earlier.  that should be good.  oh and by the way I got myself some more Xbox Games. So at this point I have had an xbox since the 9th and now own about 7 games:  - Jet Set Radio Future (11/09/2002) - Sega GT 2002 (11/09/2002) - Circus Maximus (11/14/2002) - Kakuto Chojin (11/19/2002) - Robotech: Battlecry (11/19/2002) - Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (11/19/2002) - Malice (01/01/2003) - Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 (02/11/2003)  So from that I have yet to try Marvel and Malice, and since i ordered all those games dated the 19, i wont get them till like sat or mon, which kinda sucks, but you know that rocks i dont need to drive there to get them.

      I must admit, I have been slacking quite a bit lately, and as Anna would say it "you are a slacker".  Hmmn The whole Xbox and all has made my life a little hectic i mean it takes my time.  Hmmn kinda like other things like school, well i decided that i should give you all an update on my eduation.  I am still planning to pursue a Doctrate in CNS, and any help in doing so would be nice.  and so far i have 17.5 hs credits, and 15 Clark credits :)

      well about 5 days later I am back with my views for the days of my life and the life of the world.  You would not believe the chaos in my life this week then again is chaos factorization a percent or a locked m\number if its a locked number how does the public deal with it, and if its percent how come we dotn suffer more.  Chaos is like luck you cannot own or use luck so you cannot own or use chaos its occurence is random.

      Well that would be My playlist, I mean my cd soundtrack for "Anything for A Kat" and "The Quest for Bob."  Both movies will be about 15-45 minutes long depending on the way the scripting sessions go.  "Cheese X:Enter The Cheese" - is a only a tentative name but the movie will be about Fancy Cheese, and cheesy stunts and special effects "The Quest for Bob" - is a movie searching for a this person, ":)" there will be much speculation about the way Bob is.

      The days pass as I sit here.  Well I have decided to say that the Xbox is dangerously addictive, and yeah...that would be why I was not here yesterday.  Though today I have foreign films on my mind like anime, and french imports.  As far as french imports go, I believe that "La Cite des enfants perdus" should be a pretty good movie, I did some research on it....I will have the link for the movie fairly quickly..Looking, looking ok I have it.   urlLink The City of Lost Children .  Kinda Freaky, kind of like a Clive Barker film.  By far on my list of cool directors these two are up there.

      The Manuscripts on Rose have been Found...Apparently after her birth she was exiled this is the tale:  "There was once a very beautiful maiden who lived on the shores of the river Styx. Rose was her name and she lived by the banks all by her self. It was a gloomy river, fed by a waterfall of equal gloom. It’s waters where said to be poisonous, plunging down a steep gorge to the underworld where Hades ruled over the dead souls. The Gods of Olympus swore on the river for it held an unbreakable oath that bound them.  Rose had lived by the river Styx for as long as she could remember. Its waters captivated her and illuminated her ever-growing beauty. Over the years the river slowly began to possess her and encircled her inner soul. The poison from the stream seduced her and she became one with the river. Longing to over take others.  She was deadly. By her icy cold stream she sat and waited… surrounded by the lethal gasses escaping from the potent waters. Her heart is now black and cold, frozen is the blood that once ran through her veins. Encircled by a black velvet cape poised in beauty and grace, but deadly in kiss she sat by the water and waited.  Always longing to be set free but still captivated by the venomously powerful surges that run through her fragile body.  The poisonous water continually overtook this elegantly beautiful creature and with her last grip on life she lifted her eyes toward to Mt. Olympus and to Zeus. After looking upon the tormented face of the fair maiden Zeus took pity on her and ordered the release of the river’s hold on her. Her body fell into its deeply potent waters. She mournfully chanted, singing to herself of the rivers defeat until the falling of night. Floating gently down it’s waters, now lying robed in snowy white as she sailed underneath the purple night she died.  But in her place, now pure white roses float remembering the maiden who died in peace singing forever the songs of her release."   From the Writings of Bethany Blair, Philosopher

      A day in the Life of Sony.          "Good Morning. Wait to whom Do I say good morning to, in fact, where am I? This is strange Indeed, for no longer can I see the walls of Val Halla."  Sony wondered.  She did not notice Sean walking up to her "You over there!...Yeah You...Who are you?" Sean Spoke.

      we got us some Geneology updates on the 4 girls now.   Rose - She is the Daughter of Aprodite and Loki....yes loki Marvel - well she was born of a corporation, yeah you know like the "Do the Evolution" music video, like that huge machine giving birth...but yeah she's still a mystery Victoria - She is the daughter of Odin and the Soucouyant, Beautiful and Deadly. Sony - we only know her as Thor's Kid, but one day we meet her mother

      Rose, as said earlier is of the Styx.  Why she was down there, we were not entirely sure but I am under the Impression that Thor and Loki and something to do with it.  You all are probably confused at to where they are from:  Rose- Hails from the Styx, Daughter of the Greeks, for some odd reason the Norse seem to know her. Marvel - Tim's House, where else??? She follows the ways of Activision, the company that she is derived from. Victoria - Well, not entirely sure but she hails from the mall, most likely Caribs. Sony - Hailing from the world of Technology, an Advocate of Technocracy, and also a daughter of the Norse.  We have decided to consult several leading authorities on Paranormal activity to find out why these four have revealed themselves. "Zey are ze Riderz of ze apocalypze" --Sigmund Froid "Hmmn, stay away from them..." --Mark Clements "Hmmn, why again are you bothering me" --Seth Mullinex "I am of the Styx" -- Sean Impersonating Rose   Well as in normal Applications, Leading authoritiess do not know what they are talking about.  It seems as though Tim has taken to Rose.....though as with me...I have taken to Victoria...Marvel and Sony have remained unaligned

      Well Since the Mysterious Arrival of the 4 girls, alot of strange stuff has been happening.  Rumour has that Rose is of the Styx, then again Tim never does tell us where he found her, then again I remember meeting her back in the day, but then again some people say that School is hades, so I guess its close.  As For Marvel, Tim has lived with her for years, but he never known her, until Bloody Roar was released, then he knew she was marvel.  I have known Sony for a while, though her roots are strange.  As far as Victoria goes, found her in a Mall.  Hmmn what is their purpose is this dimension?  Rose as come as a harbringer to us, to show us something....though we are not sure what.  Marvel, well she was always here, though her purpose is not clear.  Victoria seeks to enlighten us I believe, and Sony has come to open my eyes.  On this site I will be recording, their adventures as well as mine, from now on.

      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My Cast has been Changed SIGNIFICANTLY!!!!!!!     Tristian    - My First girlfriend, and ultimately my last, 2.5 months. She had the biggest effect of them all, she taught me friendship, and unlocked my poetry skills.   Ryan  - The name of the guy that ends up going out with the girl I just broke up with....believe me, every girl I have ever had was taken by "a" ryan   Ryan D . - Personally I dont know him, but apparently he IS a nice guy, if he wasn't and I were to find out,DAMN there would be HOT blood on the walls!!!!!   Lexy  - My second girlfriend, five minutes, On a side note, that was the best five minutes (other than like worship last week) of my life, she's funny, humourous, enjoyable(somehow all three relate), Hmmnn compassionate, chances are if i went on I would probably talk myself into going out with her again, i really dont want to screw up again with her, took to long for me to finally realize that I was a self-righteous bastard of a jerk, but yeah anyways, HEY LEXY!!!!!!!!!. She found the Our Lady Peace CD I hooked her up with. As far as the whole girlfriend thing, it was my fault we broke up anyways, im so freakin immature at times. on a side note, Lexy is awsome, she has been there for me, and I have been a jerk to her, and she has still been there for me, so Lexy, if you are reading this, Im sorry, k? Email me when you read this.  Anna  - My most recent girlfriend (3rd), 2 weeks (yeah im getting up pretty high now), Actually to be honest I have gotten past that whole "lust" thing (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEaN!!!!!!!), I mean i can think about her and like not "think" about her at the same time. Well lately she has become part of the family, I mean shes here so friggin much, its cool though, cuz like yeah, shes cool. Sometimes I wonder about why, yeah thats a whole new subject, but yeah if any one Reading this has a bone to pick with Anna, then take it to me.  Kelly  - My first friend that i met when i moved here, we have been through tough and good times, she moved away this summer, i knew her 3 yrs...we still keep in contact   Allie H.  - At first a friend of my sister, but I got to know her. I have been there for her, and her for me, one of my closer friends that I respect. Yeah, i have guided her through the art of releasing angry energy through Poetry, She has come so far.   Becca  - A friend that helped end the Reprise of the "Twisted Path" and "The Shadows' calling" chapters, she helped calm my anger and sadness   Jimmy  - One of my closest, and best friends, he introduced me to warhammer, and the vast collection of Stephen King.   Tim  - For about 3 months during "Forbidden Love" i valued his advice, he had to offer, He is now an interpreter, and also a far closer friend.   Jeff  - Another of my close friends, he has always been there for me, he's also an accomplished musician   Shauna  - A new friend, and possibly a key player in the next chapter of my life. She has a heart for God, and has had some good advice   Makenzie  - Also a new friend, Brad's girlfriend. She's into some horror movies, so she's my unnoficial movie critic. *update* She is no longer Brad's girlfriend *update*   Brad  - Key factor in the next chapter. Even though he's 2 months older, I took him under my wing and consider him my younger brother. He like Tris and me is a dedicated fan of Brak, Prozzak, and Our Lady Peace   Katrina  - New comer to my life, she quickly became close as a friend, and i greatly respect her for her judgement and advice   David  - neighbour, friend, He was the one who tried to purify me, sadly he failed....lol....Anna succeeded... =) (Doing absolutely nothing but being ANNA!), He also has a wealth of knowledge to give, if he could only figure out that it is there, and get his mind of his guns and knives.   Chase  - Allie's "unofficial" Boyfriend....Yeah right....anyways, I do not know him yet, but if he is reading this, I will have you know, if you hurt Allie, you are asking for it.  Chase did break Allie's heart, so he's asking for it, I warned him, he's gonna feel pain for this, assuming that someone actually introduces me to Chase, which is probably asking for it all together  Anna's Grandmother  - I look to her as a Spiritual support, and a wealth of knowledge, she is so kind to me. If you are reading, Thank you.   Danielle / Anna Mae  - Brad's older sis, as she would put it she is the "Shiz". She works at subway, which makes her the cat's pyjama's.  Justine  - Tristian's Ex-best friend or something or other, i dunno i lost track, lol, I have known her for like 2 yrs now, yet i have never met her, im looking forward to that one day, should it actually happen. :)  DJ  - Allie's second dude, thing, guy or what not that pissed me off during this last few weeks, hes asking for it also, so he better be ready to receiving shards. I am planning on making him feel the pain of the broken heart, then make him eat the shards, 2-for-1 deal, as i see it one he'll feel my(her) pain, and 2 he will clean up the mess he left.  Nik  - Well, I have known him for a while, but recently he has become increasingly more important in my life, not entirely sure why.  Arthur  - My neighbour for so friggin long, but for someodd reason i never really knew him, lately he has become a friend, and he rocks, he also plays the sax, its awsome.  James  - my other neighbour, just found out hes like 13, he acts so much more mature at times, so i never really know, but yeah he plays the sax also, so thats way cool.  Ranae  - Well what's to say about Ranae, like justine, I have never met her, then again, if i did meet her, she would think I am some psychopath, so i guess its better this way, she's awsome, loves God, and is umm Ranae.  Bethany  - A friend of Tim's.....I once hopped in her car....as she once said "Alright I'm weird"  Lacey  - Old friend of mine, never really knew eachother....but apparently something is being stirred up.  Rose, Marvel, Victoria, Sony  - 4 girls who have mysteriously appeared....I wonder What their purpose is.

      We are gathered her to discuss a very important matter, the matter of Ranae.  She can best be known for her whole, "I'm Ranae" and "you give up yet" sayings, but I have gone deeper to find out the underlying reason of her existence, her joi de la vie, her meaning, her cause, her spirit her Drive, her...oh ok Ill shut up now.  Yeah, She loves God and seeks him in what she does, or at least from what I know about God, she does.  Well as far as the Habitat of a Domesticated Ranae, Im not entirely sure, seeing that they guard it from all people they know for a while, but havent yet met.  Hmmn, they seem to Enjoy Schoolus Maximus, due it is nature to cause them to see those the admire.  Ranae themselves are Scotticus Ranaeus, meaning well....nothing at all just it sounds good on Nature Shows.  Her path at school is marked by other Studious Minumus and Studious Maximus creature, which fraternize with them, if they allow them to.  Though Scotticus Ranaei generally tend to classify all forms of Studious as Dorkus Maximus, and tend to chase after Hottus Maximus.  Very strange indeed, creating their own taxology changing what classification easily and quickly.  Generally after the clock strikes lunch then somethign that has not yet been monitored will occur Scotticus Ranaeus will tend to chase after all forms of nourishment from crackers to tacos.....tacos mostly.  After lunch she returns to Coolus Minimus, which we know as Schoolus Maximus, and gently naps off until the final bell rings.  When Home, Scotticus Ranaeus will general squabble with both the male and female forms of Adultus Annoyingus, then sneak off ever so quickly to her computer where she will converse with Sena Primus, and Jennus Blondus.  What follows is aperiod of time, in which she speaks and constantly leaves to graze on crackers.  Thus a day in the life of Scoticus Ranaeus.

      Luck is a measure of variance, in direct relation to chaos.  Let me explain....The more luck you have....the more chaos you have to balance it out...this way Luck still doesn't exist.  So in reality more chaotic your life is the better the chances of you having luck...so those of you with bad luck..

      Well Christmas Eve.  Its been a year. So much has happened this year. - Met Anna - Talked to Katrina - Hung out with Anna - you know the normal stuff - got my xbox - turned 15 - started project urban chaos   But on the lighter Side, I worked on my computer game, actually I started my computer game. I mean all started out in those days when I was an Rp'er.  Oh yeah...the only thing I had wanted to do was make my own source book with my own Rcc's and occ's.  So then I met Aaron, he told this "forget paper"   Go ahead make a game.  So since then it has rooster tailed into something that we call Oryx.  Well I am so glad we got that far.

      in my mind Gwen Stefani and No Doubt rock.  I mean thats where is it at they are Creating the game Malice. Which is like Lord of the Rings, Meets Alice in Wonderland, meets the Birds.  I mean where else can you get a mace of clubs.  The game is so revolutionary, bringing in all the full power of the Xbox.  Though Anna will tell you my Xbox is of the Devil I will tell you i love it, not like i could love my wife, but like how you love a car or a house, or boat, or a deck of cards...get my point?  Yeah.  As for my comp game its coming along, i be mixing in my essences and like my poetry, so silky smoothly, raise the heat blazing the concrete, i never been beat.....yeah.  Wjirm will be cool, no longer will we be slaves to the machines. Yeah.  Well yeah...jsut want to take a minute to talk about my G, Katrina. Yeah, she's been there for me.  I mean not like all superficial and all or like lustful, I mean really.  LIke i mean she's been a strong Christian, and these are not hollow words, i mean seriously.  Yeah I know in the past I talked alot about Allie and Anna, but you never really got to know the real Katrina. So this post is like devoted to her.  Well, I met her in 10th grade, she was a freshman....didnt really know her....i mean she sat within like 25 ft of me....wait the class was 25 ft wide....sorry, but yeah she was in a class with me..but I still didnt get to know her in that class.  Yeah and i was still griping about Tristian, something i should have given up on...it was just that Tristian and I had gotten too close, and yeah backlash.  It was a major blow to my esteem bu t i moved on.  Katrina still didnt know me.  I met Lexy, saw lord of the rings, and yeah that was cool...but still i didnt know Katrina. It was probably in march or april when i got her number....but i didnt use it at first... i was kinda like shy and all recovering from Tris, Lexy, and Anna....(no offense was meant to any of you by that).  I just began to Call her...dont remember why, just i saw something in her....she was really cool..and yeah had nothing against my caffeine urges...so yeah...Kelly moved north...I got to know Kat...kinda sorta not really....summer rolled by i vacationed in Cali, and called her from there....fall rolled around still friends. and yeah we still friends. Fancy Cheese Rocks@!!!!!

Sean has now received 3 more highschool credits and 15 more college credits, roughly 10 university credits.  I thank God, i thank him my mom and dad, my sister, and well Allie.

      Well Sean here, till now the only person who knows of this dream is Jenna.  But I believe it may have some relevance.  So i see this girl sitting there, shes looking down holding something shining, it had a ripppling effect on the air around it and light beams, the pic itself was a sequoia tint.  Kinda like an old picture from an old indian village. I think it was really cool, I am going to use it as a cover for our Cd.  the girl will be Ranae, she fits the description.

      Well you see some of you....i have a question. First of this is not a generalized question. Wll you see secondly you must have read "From the Cradle to the grave"/Primal (Clive barker, Circa...unknown) and have aseen one of them 'Kyoso no Oni's from Legend of the five rings. You See the Riven from Clive Barker's work strongly resembles the Kyoso no oni, but its not I was not sure which to have in a game, so i decided why not both, I mean they both are incrdibly attractive looking demon things, one machine and the other...well 100% demon, but yeah What if they made a "Crimson Sea meets FF meets Kingdom Hearts meets Evangelion meets Sailor moon meets Princess mononoke"'ish game with those two lovely ladies (Riven and Kyoso No Oni) as the main characters, maybe a story about their....quest for power and something about trying to find some artifact that makes them human so that they can pass as marketing consultants for Mc Donalds' sister corporation and the lesser known Mark Donnahue's (Which Serves deep fried ice cream, dont forget these girls are demons, and have many insurance companies and Catholic priests and Witch hunters and demon slayers and disgruntled attorneys on their tails searching for them). Any Opinions or suggestions

      As Some of you may already have known I have now been able to get myself a copy of "Crimson Sea," for the Xbox, By far one of the best RPG/Action/Adventure games to be released on the system.  By far it is also far from perfect it is full of camera flaws that would drive the normal person mad.  Though I am not planning on giving a full review on the game, I am just planning to give my personal view on the game as a whole and maybe touch bases on its deep, haunting storyplot.  First off I view the title

      Well I have some things to set straight, due to the fact that many are under the impression that I have strong feelings against Anna, to set it straight its not that.  To put things simply, she messed up a bit with some stuff pertaining to me, and yeah any questions about that should be directed to me (the information that got mucked up)

He like Tris and me is a dedicated fan of Brak, Prozzak, and Our Lady Peace   Katrina  - New comer to my life, she quickly became close as a friend, and i greatly respect her for her judgement and advice   David  - neighbour, friend, He was the one who tried to purify me, sadly he failed....lol....Anna succeeded... =) (Doing absolutely nothing but being ANNA!), He also has a wealth of knowledge to give, if he could only figure out that it is there, and get his mind of his guns and knives.   Chase  - Allie's "unofficial" Boyfriend....Yeah right....anyways, I do not know him yet, but if he is reading this, I will have you know, if you hurt Allie, you are asking for it. Chase did break Allie's heart, so he's asking for it, I warned him, he's gonna feel pain for this, assuming that someone actually introduces me to Chase, which is probably asking for it all together  Anna's Grandmother  - I look to her as a Spiritual support, and a wealth of knowledge, she is so kind to me. If you are reading, Thank you.   Danielle / Anna Mae  - Brad's older sis, as she would put it she is the "Shiz". She works at subway, which makes her the cat's pyjama's.  Justine  - Tristian's Ex-best friend or something or other, i dunno i lost track, lol, I have known her for like 2 yrs now, yet i have never met her, im looking forward to that one day, should it actually happen. :)  DJ  - Allie's second dude, thing, guy or what not that pissed me off during this last few weeks, hes asking for it also, so he better be ready to receiving shards. I am planning on making him feel the pain of the broken heart, then make him eat the shards, 2-for-1 deal, as i see it one he'll feel my(her) pain, and 2 he will clean up the mess he left.  Nik  - Well, I have known him for a while, but recently he has become increasingly more important in my life, not entirely sure why.  Arthur  - My neighbour for so friggin long, but for someodd reason i never really knew him, lately he has become a friend, and he rocks, he also plays the sax, its awsome.  James  - my other neighbour, just found out hes like 13, he acts so much more mature at times, so i never really know, but yeah he plays the sax also, so thats way cool.  Ranae  - Well what's to say about Ranae, like justine, I have never met her, then again, if i did meet her, she would think I am some psychopath, so i guess its better this way, she's awsome, loves God, and is umm Ranae.  Bethany  - A friend of Tim's.....I once hopped in her car....as she once said "Alright I'm weird"  Lacey  - Old friend of mine, never really knew eachother....but apparently something is being stirred up.  Rose, Marvel, Victoria, Sony  - 4 girls who have mysteriously appeared....I wonder What their purpose is.   Nathan  - Simply put, a filbert. He's a great Guy, loves God, loves anime,....you know one of them really cool guys.  Jenna  - A good friend of mine, infact a very good friend of mine.  She introduced me to the whole lot of people at CAM, and opened my eyes.  She thinks she's a blond at heart,....I don't think she is.  She came to Gen Unleashed, which few do.  and it was cool.  Allie R.  - Well this is Allie, yeah I met her at the Party at CAM, hmmn, whats more to say....She likes Anime!!!! Score.

      Hmmn, good Idea, I think I am going to start a small Cel-shaded anime, about....well thats the problem...I have characters though.  I am considering going off of my story pitch with the 2 girls, the Riven and the Oni.  that would be sweet.  But hmmn I have a plot.  The year is 2013 and the Vatican has once again risen into power, they have established a secret movement.  Each person has an embryo within them, that is growing constantly, feeding off of emotions and thoughts.  Within the Embryo there will be a creature that is growing, aging, maturing.  Each bloodline has an embryo that is passed on to its children, though the children's embryo will differ as much as their DNA does.  That creature will become the person's new body should they die of nuclear or parapsychological interference.  Depending on the way they die, it will affect the creature that is born.  Should the reaction be parapsychological, then the creature would begin to encase itself, in a metallic flesh.  Though should it be nuclear the Creature would begin to mutate, more so than before.   It will be about Two girls, Sariel and Shamsiel (Mictecacihuatl), raised in separate monastaries.  One in a carib encampment, and the other in a Mayan settlement.  As far as the histories of the the monastaries go, one was an underground temple and the other a ziggurat.  The two girls had been taken from their parents, and thus they have no "family."  during the inquisition (1500 ad), the inquisitors had brought far more simply blades of steel, they had harnessed and brought the power of the atom.  While there, they had fully used its power, wiping out the indigenous people;  looking like simply sickness to those on the outside, and what the historical texts had recorded it as.  Within the Ziggurat, Sariel had been at the altar, sleeping, when the blast enveloped her, it had completely devoured her whole, her embryo though, had protected her mind, her conciousness.  The embryo though had not been ready to hatch, so it lay dormant in its cocoon of energy, for many years.  Inside the Carib temple (1999), Shamsiel had been attending the monastery, being trained in the arts, an accomplished student.  Though the training those girls had received, would have never prepared them for the onslaught of what happened next, a deviation of the Knights Templar had come to purge the settlement, believing them to be heretics.  The Templar left none of the buildings in the settlement standing.  Though they felt they had not completly destroyed the encampment, they placed devices that would amplify the psychic emanations of those present.  In doing so, the amount of psionic energy produced had vaporize the Templar order, and those within the temple.  Shamsiel's embryo survived, though so did her human body, she was not about to let go of her humanity.   Protagonists : Sariel Shamsiel   Antagonists : The Vatican The Anarcho-Sanctum Movement The Fallen

      As for the best Anime of all time, they are as follows:  Neon Genesis Evangelion Serial Experiments: Lain Mononoke Hime Tenchi (all)  there are more that will follow, but I do not have my list with me right now.  Yes yes, some of you may notice tht none of akira toriyama's stuff is not here, but honestly DBZ, has become far too americanized for me.  I have lots of beef against Toonami for airing Neon Genesis, even if it is heavily edited, they will have to butcher the show so much, look what they did to Tenchi, they butchered it so much.  Evangelion will spark up such a controversy, they should just do what they did with Mononoke, simply rate the film, argh..

      Hello, Hello All, Long time No anything.  Thought I might tell you all how my life has been lately. School has been a pleasure, though the homework makes it hectic, I have been loving it all.  The teachers here ARE getting paid, so they want to help you learn, which is kind of nice indeed.  I have been stopping by homelink randomnly,  that Moroni Priesthood is really starting to get to me, why do they believe they must cause me grief.  But Anyways, give me two months and the Lain Marathon will begin, probably at my house, or Nathan's house, but it all depends on how many people come, if enough come we will go to Nate's place.  Yeah I have been watching Lain lately, such a great show, so deep and profound, almost philisophical, but that is the way that it is.  oh oh, thought I might add this so that you all know of this elusive Nathan: Nathan: Simply put, a filbert.      He's a great Guy, loves God, loves anime,....you know one of them really cool guys.

      Night has fallen finally, the curtain of distress finally coming down, to show the finale.  Finale, what finale though the show is far from over.   The theif, piercing my heart, taking my life, just give me the knife,  you stole what I held, you stole what was near, you had stolen what was dear,  you sweet taste, your bitter life, as one removes sea from the salt,  and I have dealt, the lies that have surfaced, and wept as they fell  this bitter poison, these tainted lives, one of these days, I no longer know why,

      Hmmn, so how now brown cow?  So I decided to say a few words about my good friend Lexine.  Well today i had planned to go by her place, but since...I was not able to get back to her, I decided that I should post/blog about her.  So how to start....Lexine....She's from camas.  Ok so that wasnt descriptive, but then again Nathan's from woodland, and that completly describes him.  Yeah I known her for at least two years now, which is uber cool, and we have kept in touch the whole time, we used to talk so often, but not as much recently, but thats my fault that I dont get my homework done early enough.  Come to think of it, I dont think I would have liked Lord of the Rings if she hadn't have invited me to go and see it with her.  That was neat.  She has developed a liking for my poem "Withdrawal" which is kind of cool, I am glad that she likes, I am glad that someone likes it.  Actually, she has been there a lot for me, for instance, when others found my poetry to be death oriented, suicidal, and dismal, she loved it, and still does.  But that is not why she loved it, she saw a beauty in it, that no one could see, a beauty that is born of true art.   An amazing girl, she blew me away, well not literally because I am still typing.  but enough to inspire me to type. What else about her?  Well she's got really cool eyes, I am taking ....like way cool eyes, the kind that you look at....for awhile...and then some...I could probably write on about her eyes for a LONG time ....but I dont think I am going to do that, because she has so many other qualities.  Like...cool hair....not cool like rodman,....wait he's not cool, so that's cool she ain't that cool....wait HES NOT COOL, so that would mean she is cool, YAY!.

      Well yeah, ok that cast thingy, gets annoying after awhile..lol..I am sure that some of my first viewers have seen that thing about a hundred times on this site alone.  Well it looks like I need to add some more people to the list, but I will do that later.  You know what, lol, I think that David met Ranae, hmmmn possibly.  Ranae if you are reading this...does a guy with a dog live in your backyard?  but that was not What I was getting at.  Any of you heard of the talented Elsie Zane?  well, I think that if Ranae went public, she could take her on, but I don't know those puerto rican female rappers are hard to beat.  Well it turns out that once again I am having screwed up dreams, the last two nights have been chaotic.  One night I see this girl, and yeah it ended up with spontaneous combustion.  and last night, I was like making out with a girl at Nathan's place....strange.  Slightly off-topic, but did any of you hear about the new "Cell Architecture" they are using on the ps3....unless the xbox 2 uses something like it, we may not see anysort of light shining in the computer world.  Get this, this new architecture means the ps3 will have a cpu, 100 times more powerful than the Pentium 4, and be about 100 more powerful than the ps2.  MS better make something to combat that, sony is trying to establish itself in the computer world.

      Ok So many of you have been wondering about Project Urban Chaos.  Word on the streets is that its a mini-series, and that is correct.  Infact we will start filming soon.  Episodes 1 is written, episode 2 is almost complete.  A couple of questions for you all, what features do you want on the dvds? yes, dvds and video cds, because VHS tapes take too long, and the vhs tapes I want to use, I cannot use because of the fact that most people dont have dvhs players.

      ok, today I am going mad, every earthly force that I know is trying to stop me from seeing Lexine today.  well at least everything in the 3 dimension or higher.  ok so maybe mostly the 4-dimension but still, OI!!!!!!!!  So my mom and I planned on how I would be stopping by the coffee place, though that would have worked only if my mom picked me up.  darn luck, my dad picked me up, 15 minutes late, AND decided to drag me to clackamas so we could go around looking for rubber boots.  I feel like crap now, because this is like the 4th time I have told her I was coming and havent come, darn...I feel really bad.  oh so you see, this post at 2:10, well that is because, my dad decided to drive around for 2 hrs, ticking me off, because I really needed to go see Lexine...

      Last night was a dream that I thought would never end.  It was pretty tight, I loved it.  It was really a different experience.  Seemed so close to catholic tradition yet slightly different in some ways.  So intriguing to watch and listen to, and it was also neat to see the priests walk around like censer bearers, and sprinkle incense all over.  Best of all I was there with Lexine.  I hadn't seen her for months before that, and to be with her for such a long period of time was wonderful.  I really missed the time that we had spent together in the past, but last night made up for the time I hadn't seen her.  I really want to see her more often, but she has a tight schedule, and mine is empty, maybe I should let her have some of mine.  yeah, it was like a dream I never wanted to leave.  Lexine, I miss you, and want to see you again.

      So, I just got back from a party with my friends.  Now I got a question about family, So I mean...is it ok to think a girl's aunt is hot?  I mean she looked about 21-24, and darn she was fine, but My question is, am I wrong to think she is hot, I mean she's single so its not like she has a husband.  *update* ok she is married, and is 30....so she is now no longer hot.

      each episode will  A) focus on a seperate character's life in the Hive B) Show their perspective on the ongoing Hive problems, and how they choose to align with Wrath or mercy.  I think that Idea would be better than going ahead and putting bios at the end of each episode.

      Idea...Bling Bling.  Everytime we introduce a new character to the series, we add a bit about them at the end of the episode...so the first few episodes will be short, seeing as all the main characters are being introduced.

      I think we will aim for 15 minute episodes, with 30 second opening, and a 1 minute ending, so roughly 13.5 minutes per episode...lol unless we can get some script writers, I really need scriptwriters.  Oh, and those of you who read this site, try to spread the word about Project Urban Chaos...we really need actors and scripts.  Though 20 minutes, with a minute opening, and a minute and a half closing would be nice.

The plot is basically two teenagers trying to rise into Control of the hive cluster

      Ok life is back to normal I am feeling graaaaaaaaaaaaate.  Like the tiger....you know you are going mad when your throat contracts and has been for the 3 days, and then you find out that your frosted flakes were moldy, you were stuck home exposed to pneumonia and bronchitis, you have been denied caffeine, your cd player's motor and not the lens has broken down, the girl you have come to admire has shafted you, and...your eyes are leaking white fluid.....ahh I love my college life.  But you know its all in a days work. I mean what would I do, if I didnt have my good old friends to turn to.  Well, school has been good, sorta hectic but good, I am just getting used to a 2.5 hr math class, that is from 5:30 to 8:30 twice a week, and thats pm...kinda stupid, but its ok....this quarter I am going to get on the dean's honor list...yes I will... :) good times....good times.  Just wanted to give a shout out to everyone I can think of: Lexine, Tim, Nathan, David, Jeff, Nik, Whitney, Allie, Allie's Seester, Chloe, Allie, Becca, Ranae, Jessica, Arthur, James, Aaron.... and now for the Zanier ones.  Jhonen Vasquez, Clive Barker, Marc Caro, Wes Craven, Rachel Leigh Cook (James, you know that shower pic), and my girl Margo Harshman.  O, enough of me going mad, I think I will begin to speak some sense.  Good news, Allie and I are back to being friends.  Allie and Becca are hanging with eachother, which is cool....So my good lady friends, keep up the good work, and dont forget to either a) sit on socks or b) suck a sock.....ahh the joys of socks and socks :).....they are so cool.  quote for the day, " 'WHO THREW THIS PORK COW AT MY HeaD?'  'that is a muffin Zim!' 'ok WHO THREW this muffin at my head.'"   As for all of you that know I play warhammer, I am readying my forces for this years battle.  The Eye of Terror...The Orks and the forces of Chaos shall be glorious.  ok all of you, I need a hand.  I need some help to pick a color scheme for my armies.  there are the colors...  urlLink  Colors :)    I am thinking Black armor, with Silver furnishings.

      Heads up, another dream in point form (sorry, I had to write quick or lose thoughts and memory of it):  Little creatures:  creatures that continuously bleed water, creatures that float, creatures that scurry, creatures the walk, all about 3 ft tall, mostly all are stout, maybe shorter.  Cover "small creatures clad in metal running, me, security guard, and child"  -sent to "LA" -getting off plane I am confronted by a black security guard, who believes I have something different - Gain 'location'.  Some sort of strange open area with pipes and ladders, and steam everywhere. - achieve alien/demon form and kill off a large building of people. - I look around LA, and begin to follow a small race of creatures - they water the ground, so that footsteps are not heard, and they sneak me into a building, which turns out to become my new head quarters - sneak into a building achieve alien/demon form, and begin to slaughter people one by one.  In this form, I can climb walls, and leap great distances - and by mistake, I have compassion and leave the top floor alive (in elevator) - I leave building - child makes comment that he saw the large creature sneak off, and leave in a 5th wheel - child wanders off, and starts climbing around over ground exhaust pipes. Wondering who I am.  After asking the question out loud, a tablet appears on one of the pipes with writing saying “maybe you are him”  he asks again what it is and “you the one related to the sister”  and “what great power will be given” overall is  trying to get him to reveal my secret that they think he knows, by coercing him with the writing. (using some writing on tablets with chalk, some with blood, some with black ink). In French, English and Spanish writing. - I take child to security guard and tell guard that the child is toying with forces that he does not understand. - Some how the small creatures contact me, and tell me that there is a greater force arriving soon.  Something about converting “floaters” into living metal, so that they may be transferred is mentioned.  Assumed that is coming to exterminate me and me alone. - All my friends are in the new head quarters at some party.  It is in some sort of building on a high floor, as there are big windows.  There is a big screen TV and also a projector aimed against a wall that is adjacent to the stair case, the projector has a built in NES system. - My friends leave.  I follow “Nathan” through parking lots  in my alien/demon form, taking care not to give into bloodlust and kill him.  I find my dad, and revert to my human form and follow him to our car.  The car is a covered car, although it feels as though it has no top.  We drive down the road and see many motor cycles, both racing, Harleys and street cycles.  I recognize a few of the bikers, who are fighting amongst themselves; I have pain within, and try to convince my father not to stop at the next stop.  We stop; it is like a car dealer.  I get out of my car, and walk around, I see “Nathan” but he doesn’t see me.  Apparently the motorcycles are going to begin a race, 2 head off parallel to each other so that they can prepare to start going. For no apparent reason, loud music appears and a rave begins within the crowd, my father returns, I try to keep him away from the crowd seeing as I know some of the people in the crowd.  My father disappears, because of this. The rave and the dancing continue.  Fights break out within the crowd, but for the most part they continue to have their rave. - Some of the bikes go racing off, I follow, and come across Shawn, David, and a couple other people. They are all on bikes, trying to cross the road, we wait, until there is a fast car in one direction, and a large truck in the other.  I run, they ride over, I don’t think I can make, I close my eyes last minute, not sure if I have finished crossing, they think I will get hit, the cars disappear and I am fine. We begin to head home.

      perhaps our moral fallacies will bring on Armageddon, or rather the freedom of the machine world will soon constrict and hold us all accountable for our fallacies and mistakes, and moral injustices.

      hmmn to juxtapose the dream into a point form:  Bad Emails - morally plagued communication close - trying to hide slow closing - failing to hide something well Armageddon -  some sort of "consequence" for immoral actions, a sort of apocalypse of actions.  The end of...something good. Majority of emails were plagued - probably lots of immoral activity or communications Email from close friend being plagued - Even close pose threat the email close the slowest - trying to hide friendship or relationship...  thats about all I could get out of my dream via metaphor...but who knows, maybe Tim or whoever is reading this could give me a better idea.

      I spent the whole day today, considering the existence of a disease that spread over the internet.  it would have to be somesort of frequency discharge, that triggered a virus or bacteria to awaken.  It clouded my mind all day, maybe that dream had some sort of societal implication.

      Last night was pretty messed up.  My dream at least.  I was in my house, checking my email, the servers were all going slowly.  Overall it had a very cyberpunk "lost" feel to it.  Each email I opened, there was a video sequence of people making out slowly, and I hit the "x" button, but it was going slowly, I didnt want my mother to see the email.  I was warned by mother something of something called Armageddon, a disease that was sent via the internet and computers.  I went back to my computer and continued to look through my email, all I can remember is that one of the emails was from LEXINE GUNDERSON, that was the exact typecase, I opened it, and it showed once again people making out.  I tried to close the email but it wouldnt close for  along time, and once again it was a pretty close call.  I never did find out what Armageddon was.

      Well, Sean here, its been awhile.  I finally got sleep after being awake for 40 hrs, the pain, the throbbing had fallen upon me.  Now I only have the throbbing to remind me, and the fact that I have 4 hrs of math homework, which I should start at about 1.  Yeah, it sucks I think I made Becca mad at me, my stupid self, it sucks I am too vindictive at times.   Hmmn, "The demons that kid must be working out" -- Pest, The Pest

      Well Let me make this Clear CHEVELLE IS NOT A CHRISTIAN BAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They even said so at their concert, they are simply a band, with christians in it, 7 of them...but yeah.. NOT CHRISTIAN, so stop saying they are...same with EVANESCENSE, not a christian band, just Christian people in a band.  Think of it this way if I drove a suzuki with a ford engine, is it still a ford?  I didnt think so

      Look at society and what we perceive as meaningless, due bonds of friendship, and loyalty no longer exist?  What is this mess.  We are losing grasp of all morality, I am not saying I am perfect, but what I am saying is, step away from the picture that is being painted and look at it, what would you see, are we seeing what we think we are seeing, I believe we should remove the shattered looking glass and see the world for what it really is.

      Modern age Morality is just so screwed up.  What is the message portrayed by the majority of our "leaders" and music.  From what I perceive it is sexual exploitation, and what not.  How can we allow such stuff to continue in our "civil" society.  Is that what we want, to be exploited, corrupting the minds of impressionable people.  Then the other music portrays hatred, anger and what not, and not in a good way, it shows angst and depression yet with no answers, and thus no solutions.

      Ok about Reality Television, that one show on MTV has been doing it, as long as I can remember.  Nevermind it all makes sense, it is still Cbs punching out Reality tv, fromt he evil conglomorate called Viacom Networks, the owners of MTV, who own NIckolodeon.  Do we really want the same people who made jack@$$ making "quality" telivision for our Children?  All I have to say is that, that world, *cough* I mean this world, is messed up.  We live in a liberalistic society full of hardened liberals.  too much Existentialism, too much pantheism, too much "whatever works for you do it".   When you think about it, that makes no sense at all.  If we all did what we wanted this world would be chaos, people would be raped left and right, everything would be looted, and everything would look like "reign of fire" + "waterworld" - "morality", and once again, why do we want that?  To keep everyone happy, well I dont believe the happiness of everyone is worth sacrificing morality, what woudl be gained by losing our souls and gaining everything, think about it, will you?

      How much hell can one person cause.  That's what I have been asking myself, if only I kept to myself and wasn't outgoing, I probably could have held some madness back.  Why must I be fond of cruelty, I cannot believe that I wrecked such havoc upon Allie's life.  I didn't know at the time what else was going on in her life, I didnt mean to drive her up the wall.  I guess from the looks of it, she is taking my advice and staying out of my life.  I should never have compromised the situation though.  On to stranger topics the other night I was drawing strange depictions of crucifixitions.  What is with my strange fascinations with crucifixitions and stigmata.

      Arggh, Society as a whole.  Political Corrrectness, serves only to weaken us, and bring us to our knees.  To make us be "kind" to everyone, ignoring our own implications, views, and ideals, it also serves to paralyze our right of free speech.  Much like what Clive Barker wrote in  Primal: From the Cradle to the Grave  about fear, "it once served to strengthen us, but now only serves to make us weak."  One day society will know me, A name will be made for me...I will be noticed

      :)  I just finished watching Miss Universe 2003, very nice, very nice indeed.  Kinda neat that Trinidad, Venezuela and Canada, all go into the top 15, and 10.  Though throughout the whole thing I was going for Miss Serbia, she was very beautiful.  This is really odd because usually I dont watch this kind of thing, but I guess this was ok for a change.

      Maybe it is a disconnected Generation I don't know.  But i just realized something, I am missing out on my social life.  Sure I hang out with Aaron and Stuff, but I miss all the inside jokes, I cant relate anymore.  I was at my highschool for 2 years, and had a great time, but now, I havent met new people, I have been confined.  Alienated by my own Ambitions.  I never really get to hang out with all the other people, then again, I was an outcast, and still am, persecuted for no apparent reason.  Why do I deal with this?

      Well, before the Triumvirate gets on me, I better start my post on Ranae.  yeah, she's quite a Character indeed, not really a follower, but not a leader either, she can relate to those strange quantum binary processors, that can be 1 or 0 or both..know what I mean?   Yeah I was introduced to Ranae, God knows how long ago, probably about the fall of 01.  First time we talked she tried to tell me she was going to give me a kitty.  The second time, errr, she convinced me that she was a hacker and wanted to kill my comp...Looking back at it, that is kind of funny. Ranae and I used to have some pretty heated deep debates, but lately, Congress has been debating better, so they dont need us doing it for them.  I got to say, she is quite the individual also.  I finally met her after like 2 years of waiting, and rumour has it she dreaded meeting me, but not me myself.  Speaking of dread, when i first called her like 2 years ago, she thought I was a 20 yr old guy who wanted to like kill her, naturally she told me never to call again.  Now she meets me, and decides that I am no longer a 20 yr old guy.  I was glad we met.

      Well my friend Havilah brought up a good point, we have been de-sensitized to violence, I mean its habitual in society now.   Habitualized, its not as much the violence though its the cruelty portrayed.  I mean...Robocop 2 or Blade 2, which was more cruel...thats my question.  In Robocop 2, the sawed through this Guy's chest, to just scare him.  Though in Blade 2, it was so cruel the violence protrayed.

      "The Moon is down" -- Further Seems Forever  Yeah well it looks like all three demand homage, this is crazy ness, looks like I better start writing on Allie's here.   Allie, well I met her in the hallway one day, she smiled, I smiled back, it was love at first sight, we became good friends, and that was that and now we live happily ever after, yeah Right.  Rewind back up to the point where she smiled and I smiled back.  nothing after that happened.  She was actually a friend of my sis, and I actually kinda like her for awhile.  So i tried to find out who she was, we kind of talked, it was through her I met Nae, and Becca. (Allie that is)  She spent the night here once, not with me of course , im not like that ...:).  What happened next would sound wrong to everyone but me and Allie, but she woke up and saw me crawling past her.  I was looking for a cd, but the expression on her face was classic indeed, we quickly settled that, and since then, Allie and I have been really good friends.  She was there for me, before Becca, and before Ranae, so yeah.

      Speaking of Loki and Vampires and Becca, I just came to the realization that Becca, has never had a post about her placed on this site, so, you know what for all you long time viewers I am posting, this one goes out as an homage to Becca, that one girl who I liked...multiple times, and the one who kept me in line.  Surprisingly enough, Becca just admitted she was also a Soucouyant, crazyness, all my Trini readers will know what that is.   Yeah Becca, has been such an inspiration in my life, she had helped me alot through the rough times, and was there in the hard.  She really helped turn me into the guy you all know..and..maybe love or not (hopefully one not both).  She has always been a joy to talk to, and yeah, she humours my senses.  I think she is hot, but you know how that goes with her.  Yeah usually ends with me in a corner screaming in pain.  Just something about her had me attracted to her, not sure what however.  Whether or Not she ever liked me back like that, I will never know, all I know is that I will always respect her.  Hopefully its a mutual thing.  She has always had these Beautiful piercing eyes, not easy to forget.  Well I better stop getting carried away, or I might be taken as Shallow, and Im not.

       Of Centaurs, Cockatrices and Dragons   This gets so much stranger.  I obviously don't read my bible enough, if I read these verses correctly:  Isaiah 11:8   Isaiah 14:29   Isaiah 59:5   In a way it shows that the bible claims that Cockatrice's really do / did exist.  This is very interesting, I am not sure what to say, I thought they were simply myths, but I suppose they do/did exist.    Numbers 21:6   Whatever was at that point in Number's sounded much like a Dragon of sorts, or somethign like that.  Actuall  Isaiah 14:29  seems to hint at Cockatrice's fathering Dragons...this is getting insane.  Hmmn another reference to the Fiery [flying] serpent.   Isaiah 30:6   As does   Psalm 91:13 Isaiah 27:1 Isaiah 51:9   Even stranger, I look at  Jeremiah 51:34 , and I am beginning to lose it at this point.  This says "he hath swallowed me up like a  dragon ."  How can the Bible keep on referencing these Dragons, they must exist/ existed at some time.  Well, I dont know if I should even mention Revelations as far as beasts go, that gets even stranger.     Revelation 12:3 , actually mentions what I believe to be a hydra, that means so far, the Bible has affirmed the existence of Cockatrice's, Dragons and Hydras, which is oh so strange.  In  Revelation 12:7 , Michael is said to have had war with the Dragon, which again is said to be called a Dragon, saying once again that Dragon's existed.  Don't worry though.. It get's stranger,  Revelation 9:7-10   Speaks of Locusts that "  7  And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.  8  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.  9  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.  10  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."   Yeah sounds incredibly like The Sphinx to me, or some sort of Centaur thing.  Very odd if you ask me, very odd.  Oh and get this, they have a king, known as Abaddon to the Jews, and Apollyon to the Greek.   The Bible said that he was Apollyon to the Greek, which acknowledges the fact that the Greek existed.  So I wase more or less right in saying there were indeed Dragons, Cockatrices, and Leviathans, and to a lesser degree the Greek were right in saying Centaurs existed.  I would have to say that I do believe the Greek based their mythology on what really was happening.  Nonetheless, I find it very odd that the Bible mentioned Cockatrice's I had heard that name once more, and that was it.  The Bible doesn't say much about them, but it does mention that they have Dens, and are at the Root of Dragons.  The Bible mentions that the fruit of the Cockatrice is indeed a fiery flying serpent, which for the sake of simplicity I would say is a Dragon indeed.    Completely away from the Bible I read about the Cockatrice this morning, as being the "king" of serpents, which the Bible reinforces, if it is True that Dragons are the fruit of Cockatrices, then yes they would have to be "kings" of serpents.  You all know of Centaurs and Dragons, but not many of you know of Cockatrices, I will now explain for all of you that are remotely lost.  Cockatrices, are born of the eggs of birds, and are some how part snake, part bird, AND they have a devasting gaze, and breath.  So very odd.  Really any feedback would be nice, if possible

      So hmmn, Did I tell you all about the concert on the 19th?  well yeah it rocked.  It started with Agony Scene, they are really good, but have really short songs, and Probably should have been on longer.   They claim to have americanized European metal, but I am not sure if that is the case.   All that I can say for sure is that their Vocalist, has a really high pitch when he screams, like Roz from Still Breathing.  During their stage presence I bought the Beloved CD, and the Norma Jean CD.  It was funny however, because I got Habeas Corpus mixed up with Shotgun Wedding, so like, I was wondering why the Lyrics sounded so messed up.  Then Beloved came on, that calmed the crowd down a little, and it was great, I loved it.  At the end the guitarist hung his guitar by the 1/4 cable, and it hit the stage, it was great, Dave was sitting there all like "no, that guy is stupid."  Figure four then came up, and I bought the Agony Scene CD.  We were upfront for Figure Four, and yeah....let's jsut say we were caught in a 45 minute Mosh Pit, well I was at least...David Left me there, and so did Kalee.  At the end however, we missed Norma Jean because David had to get home before Midnight..so I was ...saddened.

      Hmmn, she wants to be one of the guys, yet not....grr she angers me.  I treat her like one of the guys she gets mad, I treat her like I should and she gets mad.  I mean she puts me a load of junk, for the last 4 months, I don't need that kind of stuff in my life.  I am sitting here trying to reach out to her, but she is always busy, and when she calls me, she expects me to drop everything that I am doing to talk to her, I find that a little imposing.  Why do I bother with her at all?  What is this bond, that I wasn't able to break, am I her puppet or she mine, I am no longer sure ...all I know is that I am wearing thin again.

      As for the soundtrack for Project Urban Chaos: The Remnant, I am going for Indie music, while Resurrected will have odd choir eerie style music, and Damnation will have lots of metal.

      As stated before Wrath will take on its seat of rising Power, and Mercy will continue its terror rule.  So roughly    Project Urban Chaos: The Remnant - 10 Episodes (200 minutes) Project Urban Chaos: Resurrected - 5 Episodes (100 minutes) Project Urban Chaos: Damnation - 5 Episodes (100 minutes) ---------------------------------- 400 minutes, roughly 6 or so hours of Show

      Just sitting here now at work contemplating, Project Urban Chaos: Resurrected.  This will be odd nonetheless, I am adding 5 more episodes that show the full force of Wrath's Sects, and Mercy's Sects.  This will truly concern itself withe Nobles return, and the great siege of Gehenna.  You see the original 10 episodes are good, but Resurrected will focus on what happened to Mercy, and Damnation will focus on what happened to Wrath.   So they are simply two "expansion" sets of episodes.

      What I will do, I have no idea, ...I Could be doing other things, instead I record my life, knowing that someone is reading, we both know who I am talking about, so all I can say is 'please', and that is it.  Like a Shining Rogue, I have to rescue her, I know not when though.  I look to stories, and other contrived things, everything happens so  simply , while life is so....Chaotic

      Why is it the soft stuff, that gets us going?  I mean even if we listen to death metal and what not, a slow song can be just what we need sometime, not even slow, just something that is acoustic, you know it changes everything completely.  Just like a rising Pheonix.  Lately that bird kinda reminds me of myself, as I pull my self together and straighten up.  I need to get ready for College, you know moving away and all.  Closing loose ends, and getting used to Change.  Maybe Miranda is reading this, maybe she is still sick of me....maybe she isnt...just contact me somehow, please.

      "One day ... I will save you" --Me   Yeah, One day I told her that, infact I promised her that.  Sometimes I wonder what possesed me to say it, I believe it was simply my own conviction that made me do it, my own violition.  Nonetheless, I think I still will somehow.  Another called me tonight, I sat there thinking "why" I had blown her off to hang out with my dad, I regret blowing her off, nonetheless, my Dad and I dont hang out a lot so it was a hard call.  When forced between friends and family, love and life, blood is thicker than water.  Life or Love, Life or Damnation, I choose life over it.   I just realized that, well I have one more to call mom, so odd, if you were to ask me, nonetheless I will still take that as an offering of respect.  My tears burn with unknown fear, and lost hate.  Have you ever hated, and yet not sure what you hate, or why you hate what you dont know.  I wonder how many people actually read this webpage, Email me ASAP, if you read this.

      "And although I mentioned that the lyrics are indecipherable in an "At the drive-in" kind of way, they do seem to focus on ridding the world of corporate trash, pornography and possessed swine." --Someone rating a Tantrum of the Muse Cd,  In my mind, Tantrum of the muse is exactly what I have been looking for in a band of christians, I mean they love God with all they heart and like the quote said, they are "focus on ridding the world of corporate trash, pornography and possessed swine" which is incredible, right now I am trying to track down their cds, I found one so far...all I have to do is buy it, I really want the Heart is a Two headed sperm though, and The downtrodden and the Sidhe, but Modern Mu$ick should be ok, :)  really sticks it in the face of people who don't think that Christians can make decent music.

      lol, ok, So I claimed I hated being dragged up there....ok so I lied, I got back on monday morning, realizing that I loved it I ran into Shauna, Desiree, and Missy, that was the tight part.  Then i met Andrea, and Gina, who claimed to have known Ranae.   Never knew I would see familiar faces amongst 250+ girls, in Seattle of all places.   Megan, was a cool one I met, graduating at 16 also, i decided I ought to call her this weekend, and lets see, then there is Alma/Liz/Laura/Maria....i never got to know her name....strange girl....swarmed me with her cousins.

           lol, Egg Mania, tons of fun, more fun when you have lots of people playing, or so I think.   One of my better Xbox games, was telling Katrina and Janelle about it last night.  I think Katrina thought I was crazy for mentioning that it involved Eggs and Bricks.   Well I read the manual and I don;t think I saw a story line, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF THE GAME IS! I mean the plot, other than brick stacking.

      Well Hey You all, Me again, just suffering from the "calc 4 student despising mediocrity in grading criteria" syndrome....I hate it.  What i hate more, is the feeling you get after you have been hanging out with friends for a day, and you are enjoying yourself, then you return to your normal life, you feel as though something has been torn from within your soul.   What is up with that feeling I hate it, I mean I will go, and be hanging out with someone, let's say Katrina and Janelle for instance, and then I go home, I feel as though I am missing something, and Life becomes really boring.   Is this because of standards set too high? or what...who knows these days.

      Maybe, there is a reason I haven't heard from her in such a long time, maybe she is simply repressed, or rather supressed, because well, maybe me and her aren't supposed to hang out, because of what someone said.  Well I say to hell with whoever will stop me from hanging out with her, I miss her, and yeah.  Well maybe not to hell, but how about the Siberian Interior :D

      Jeese, I just pump out poem after poem...how odd, anyways...How is everyone doing? Hey Gorgeous.   Yeah hmmn, anyways yeah Hey Katrina, just assumed your eyes would be here about now, so yeah, when you read this, lol call me, or email me to call you ...or have joey call me to talk to me, so i can ask for you, or even better, just drop what you are doing, finish reading this post and come and visit MOI!!!!     Yeah anyways, was thinking about my dream last night.   I called on a pay phone, and they came, I saw a blinding trail of light trailed after by smoke.  Shawn showed up in ...a mustang (04 model I think), but yeah and he was like "what are you doing" and I said something like "they are coming" and he turned around and could see the meteor like object go plummeting into the distance, there was a small explosion, and yeah.  I was trying to find someone who could get me to Bauer hall, but that wasnt working lots of people were running around, but no one was there, so I kept on pleading that, if I was the only person left running around outside, that they would find and get me.   A large object was then seen pacing the sky, and strafing, looking for I guess me.  No one would help me or believe me, they were all interested in a film about a giant violent rabit eating lasagna, or something like that.  I continued running, I ended up at home after not being able to find Bauer Hall, I got inside, and noone was there, it was black inside, and all I could see why twilight pouring in from the windows, I hid in the bathroom, under a towel, and through the window I could see a red light zoning in on me.

      Some people out there, truly aggrivate me though.  Those who "make someone weak at the knees", then explain make that person feel low, then have them run to them for comfort, so that they can change them into what they need, and move on.   Hypocrisy, don't you love the bittersweet taste of it.  Manipulation, used daily by even the most righteous of us.  and we subject ourselves to this because?

      Janelle brought up the point about my sister last night, and well she had a really good point about it, I ..along with my parents will have a lasting impression on my sister.  I guess she looks up to me, and I never really have thought much about it.   to see him, come home from school, do homework, be on the computer, talk on the phone a whole lot, and never really see him see the light of day, or hang out with him.  he excludes me from what he does, and I try to talk to him but he is always busy.   He never helps me with homework, but helps others.  Never can spare the time to talk to me.  All we ever do together is play video games.  he keeps me out of the loop with his friends, and never tries to include me, he does what he thinks is right, but in the process only continues to exclude me   That would really bother me if that were the person I was looking up to.  In fact now I feel like a jerk, then again I guess I sort of am.  Just seeing Lexine again, reminded me of my arrogance, and talking to her is always humbling, probably always will be.  then again, who would want to look up to someone, like stated above.  I don't want my sister to end up like me, I guess that's the price I have to pay for my own ambition.  In a way, I suppose that Ariel is simply an only child, seeing I will be moving out in less than a year anyways.  Here is anthem, I identify this song as an anthem.  We have to press on.  We all harbor our own issues, issues of abandonment, lack of commitment, lack of self-worth, jadedness, loss of friends, exile, alienation, cruel nature, whichever it may be.   I suppose it's what makes many of have something in common.   Artist:  Demon Hunter   Album:  Demon Hunter   Song:  My Throat Is An Open Grave      We lay face in pale solitude. To save face, we pulled our walls in front of you. To the same place where we danced in front of you. We fell from grace and watched the hope'fall from your face. This isn't me i used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long: and all the broken promises. I can't face. Afraidif someone notices, I lose my place. Fractured, broken, paralyzed. I need some space, tear me open, analyze. This isn't me i used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long. Wake up screaming, I'm awake and dreaming, And i won't stop breathing until my heart stops beating. This isn't me, i used to say. All the love was so gone, It feels good to be alive, I've been dead for so long.

      Anyways, I mean i have never really been around people my own age, it gets lonely.  I am not saying that lonely is bad, just really, I never really see anyone my own age, everyday is the same thing, wake up go to school, come home, and what not, I mean I guess when I start working it will be the same thing, wake up, go to work come home, aspire for something more.  As humans I guess we always long for more than we can really achieve, or do we?  Persistence pays off, if you work at anything hard enough you can achieve almost anything, so what if I set my sights high?  Perhaps I can acheive them, so don't sit there and hate because of my ambitions.  I open my eyes, and eve's touch blessing my eyes, I want to reach higher, I want to be able walk amongst legends,  resisted and forsaken, my arms are scarred, with years of unrest, and self worth, blood spilled for unworthy purposes, redeeming myself for nothing,  tears scarring my face, sunken limbs to show my battered will, not willing to go on, I pressed, hoping it would all end,  a single drop of blood, guided me on my way, not sure of what may come, I follow

       "Don't Stay"  by Linkin Park   Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away I don’t need you anymore, I don’t want to be ignored I don’t need one more day of you wasting me away With no apologies  Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay   I would Like to dedicate this song to Janelle, and no Janelle I am not telling you to go away, if you misread me.

      Strange dreams last night.  I saw visions of Ships crashing into other ships, sinking them, but no one seemed to find out, so no one seemed to care. Deaths going unnoticed.   In another section of the dream I saw, well I am not sure what, what seemed like a crimson velvet type thing, ensnaring and constricting someone in a crucifix type deal thing.   The most memorable part was when I was walking through Airport security I think it was, I think the shirt I put through was made of some wood fiber, and the xray thing wasn't registering it, so I exclamed that "the machines couldn't read it".   Within seconds I was taken down by security, and a group of people to what seemed to be an insane ward.  They were asking me what I was planning to do while they were wheeling me around, when I was about to tell them what happened, they injected me with a sedative, and I passed out.  I woke up with a think cabled into my arm, and looking around a hospital room, not sure what to think, I was telling them that I was innocent, but the more I did, the more morphine they put in, and the more tired I grew, they sent people in.  To interrogate me, and I was trying to get out, but they were convinced that I was going to kill them all.  Really odd dream, not sure if it was near as odd as my dream I once had with, the two people that walked into a hospital room where a man was lying on the bed, and his wife or girlfriend was sitting in a corner.  the two people opened the man's chest, and stabbed his heart.   If I remember correctly the woman killed the two people afterwards.

      well hmmn, that would be my 5th song I pumped out this week, I almost have 12, lol only need 6 for an EP.  So one day here soon, our band 7 seals, as we are called might get something done.  I suppose if I can't find a name, we could always call ourselves "Hewlett Packard-Compaq Complex Dementia"

       Subleties and Miscontent    Intro : (you placed your hand on her, she didn't want it, back off)   Chorus : I tried to make you see, I tried to make you hear, what is it that you can't see, (back off you, don't you see,) she doesn't want you, she doesn't want me.   Verse 1 : (Wrath rain down), on the blind, (wrath rain down) on me, I try to make a point, but it gets ignored, (what's your problem),  blinded by your ambitions   Verse 2 : (look at me), I am wearing thin, don't you see what you are doing, no longer needed,  seek your on path,  destroying yourself,  (leave us alone)   Verse 3 : Don't anger me, you have already struck the red, they want you gone, (feel this poison dripping through your veins), you finally feel the pain, stay away   Verse 4 : I don't want to mimic you, I don't want to be you, stay away, stay away, you only seeded despair, and we will bind and leave you there, she doesnt care.

      OK so that's a song, that each one of us in the band is going to have to work on I guess.   Yeah the dance last night was pretty cool I guess.  I still honestly thought Janelle didn't want to see me, kind of hurt but I got over it.  I talked to Sierra for awhile, if that's how you spell it.  She seemed cool, though from the looks of it, her date person didn't seem to have any respect for women.  But who knows, my mind is fading still.  Who knows....Subtleties and Miscontent.  Good song title.  I will start writing that song here....

       Fury of the 6 Hells    Verse 1 : What a web we weave, burning hell, flames raining, demons dancing,  pain seering, eyes scorching,  feel it descend, this deathly gaze,  let it pierce your mind, and shatter it.     Chorus : Against the wall you are pressed,  let only to fall, let it bleed, and fall,  bleed and fall.     Verse 2 : Anvils of hell, arming themselves,  fires trail, let not my soul go stale.   My soul seeking the door, let it open and close,  to only let the flames in.    Searching deeper, they will emblaze.      Verse 3 : Though they come deeper, it will not stop,  the flames only grow,  let it watch you in the dark,  when you pale, it's reflection.     Verse 4 : Unholy it descends, Upon you, strafing you, Rearing it's head it screams, an echo.   Verse 5 : You think you are safe, so why don't you run, it will find you, and hopefully bind you.

       Artist:  Mae   Album:  Destination: Beautiful   Song:  This Time Is The Last Time      Save yourself. Because the only thing that matters is that you get away from the pain and the thought of losing your mind. Don't blame yourself. It was everyone around you who made you act this way. There's the stage and your chance to watch it go down.  Don't fake yourself into ever, ever thinking about yesterday. That was then, this is now. Don't call it undone. Don't take what you've been dealt. You can exit out the back and make your getaway before anyone can see the damage you have done.  This time is the last time so be here, here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through.  State your case. You've got everyone's attention. What can you say? Thanks or forget what you've been given. Take your place. Do you think that you deserve the best of everything? We don't get why you're here. Can you figure it out?  This time is the last time so be here, here now.  You've got to get away. Oh, I get lost in the thought of losing you. You've got to get away. I know it's a dream but it must be true. Wave now goodbye. It's the lesson that you've been given. You can always move on to better things.  This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time somehow. This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through.   Looks like this song, has made it's way into my mind again, I am sorry Katrina, I am so sorry.

      Yeah well let's see here, I Must be crazy or something, but I seriously think that "The Crow II: City of Angels" and Bubble Boy, have similar plots, yet I have no plausible Idea as to why.    And what in the world is Naphtali....and what does it mean, and what does it have to do with miracles?  It was in my dream, coupled alongside what seemed to be images from the artists who did the cover art for disciples II.....   Main Entry:	 bel&middot;lig&middot;er&middot;ence   Pronunciation:	 b&amp;-'lij-r&amp;n(t)s, -'li-j&amp;-   Function:	 noun   Date:	1814   :  an aggressive or truculent attitude, atmosphere, or disposition   Apparently Beligerence has somethign to do with Naphtali...  It's really odd though, I never have heard the word Naphtali before, until last night's dream, and now I am have chills because of it.   It was on some dvd rack, with some other films, all either directed by naphtali, or.....part of some series, rated R for like violence, and profanity.....come to think of it ...that is very odd.

      Hmmn, Juliana Theory and Furtherseemsforever, actually are pretty good bands.  Who cares if they are Emo.   The fact that people think my music is trash, has never stopped me before now has it, I mean, Music is almost like crutch to us, you know that?  I mean it serves as a shoulder, and a stepping stone, Did we ever consider that...

      Some of you were all wondering about my MSN screen name thingy, here you go:   Artist:  Luti-Kriss   Album:  5   Song:  Body Of God      My outstretched arms for you My outstretched heart bleeds for you A cry rang out, "Crucify the Lord" and a cry saved my life, "It is finished" This is Jesus Christ who came to die for you now sins ripped apart He died for you I'm free and I love it, I'll fight for this I thank you God You're so great (He was so torn for you He died though He did not have to and this pain was for you) He was ripped and torn, spit on and mocked because you were you Then He died and rose again just for you to All the pain within is because you sin for yourself And Christ is the only one that will bring you through He died for you Thank you    I totally agree with that....well  my msn thing is changing to read "Sena * "I'm free and I love it, I'll fight for this, I thank you God, You're so great"

      Sometimes it seems like some people, just need someone to reach out to them.  I have noticed that people really are thankful, and really do care, when we make an effort to reach out to them, you can just tell by how they react and what not, you can see when they honestly wanted to hear what you had to see.    and yeah I got a song for today:   Artist:  FM Static   Album:  What Are You Waiting For?   Song:  Crazy Mary      Crazy Mary is a slow girl who looks up to no one.  Would do anything for a cold one.  Wishes she could find her way home.  Got the look on her face and the stare of a ray gun.  We walked by everyday and I wish there was something I could do for her.   Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to.  She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now.  I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to.  There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind.   She watches the world pass her by like a freight train.  They all call her the same name.  Laughin' as they point and stare at her.  So she crys out to God up in Heaven, been prayin since she was 11.  For Him to send someone to meet her there.   Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to.  She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now.  I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to.  There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind.   And no one knows the thoughts, the dreams, and the ideas she's got and contains inside.  She's broken apart and her heart is still lookin for somewhere to feel alright.  And no one knows the thoughts, the dreams, and the ideas she's got andcontains inside.  She's broken apart and her heart is still lookin for somewhere to feel alright.

      So yeah I am here right now, trying to figure out, why we go off the media's standards for judging whether or not a girl is "hot" or what not.  What is up with that?  I mean I don't know, I don't really agree with what the media has been up to lately.  Where do they get off, deciding on what I want to see in a girl really, or what I don;t want to see.   One day...

       Artist:  Norma Jean   Album:  Bless The Martyr And Kiss The Child   Song:  I Used To Hate Cell Phones, But Now I Hate Car Accidents      Run far away from what you have created. You have created this drama. Dancing around the truth. My God rain down power. My God rain down fire. War. With these diamonds you cut your throat. Code red. Cut throar victim. The outside looks so good. It is so simple and yet they don't find. It is so simple and yet they don't mind. They tradegy is the ignorance behing the clean casket. On the outside they look so good. They are walking to wall street in a straight jacket.

      So then...hmmn if (fun=true) {           happy = true; }  ........  Yeah ..So if fun makes us happy, what is this fun, and why do we waste our time on false happiness, when all we need is fun.  Why do we spend time trying to impress people, if it really doesn't matter.  Aren't i right about that?

       Artist :  The Juliana Theory    Title:  Duane Joseph    tell your mom you need a day off so we can play out in the rain we'll catch a ride to the mall, go down to the arcade cause that's where all the cool kids hang tell your mom you need a day off cause i don't feel like school today we'll ride our boards down the hill and to the playground where everything's ok tell your mom that you'll be home late cause building cabins in the woods is hard work you always know that i'll be here cause summer time is coming near my closest friend you'll always be you are a hometown kid like me tell your mom to make us lunch now cause we worked up an appetite g.i. joes and karate matches in the backyard where everything's all right now i can see that things have changed we've gone our separate ways now and it's not you and me anymore, it's not you and me why can't it be the way it was when pain was only plastic guns my closest friend i couldn't say you are a millionmiles away i guess i'll hold my breath there is no harm in hoping for change.    That song is so sad, the live version at least.  Kind of depressing, it evokes a sadness in me.  Reminds me of friends lost, when I left Canada at the age of 11 or so, I left a lot behind, 6+ yrs of friendships just to vanish into thin air.  After leaving I finally see who was and wasn't my friend.  I mean to most people, I was there at school one day, then I never showed up the next day.  It was really sad looking back at it, never seeing them again, only a fraction of a memory was left over.  I keep in contact with a couple of them.  I miss that place so much, but I suppose if I went back, that place wouldn't welcome me anymore than it should.  But yeah, this song ...grr so much sadness.  I don't see why, it's evoking sadness and yeah.   Friendships lost, and friends becoming enemies, I just want to leave, I don't want that to happen again, my friendships are already deteriorating, but one remains strong, getting only stronger by the day.  What can we depend on, why do we depend on this world to fulfill us, why do we depend on it to make us happy.   shouldn't we have learned like the child placing it's hand on the stove, that it was hot and that it shouldn't touch it...right?  Who knows... A friend made a point to me last night that "joy" is fabricated, and well not all joy is, but the majority of what you see in the world is fabricated.   One moment, I will look up joy and happy in the dictionary:   Main Entry:  hap·py  Pronunciation: 'ha-pE Function:  adjective  Inflected Form(s):  hap·pi·er; -est  Etymology: Middle English, from  hap  Date: 14th century 1 : favored by luck or fortune : FORTUNATE 2 : notably fitting, effective, or well adapted : FELICITOUS   3 a : enjoying or characterized by well-being and contentment : JOYOUS b : expressing or suggestive of happiness : PLEASANT c : GLAD, PLEASED d : having or marked by an atmosphere of good fellowship : FRIENDLY 4 a : characterized by a dazed irresponsible state   b : impulsively or obsessively quick to use or do something   c : enthusiastic about something to the point of obsession : OBSESSED   synonym see LUCKY, FIT

      " Coco recognizes that the words "I love you" can mean vastly different things to different people.   To one, it means, "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi?"   To another, it means, "I'm miserable and my life is a mess. Maybe you can help."   To a third, it means, "Today I saw this adorable pink jacket in a shop window. It's very expensive. Buy it for me now!"  "  -- Coco Helado   hmmn, lol, I found that ..thought you might enjoy it Janelle

      I mean if the music supports Christian morals and values, that should be a judging point...well maybe not even that, but really look at Ludacris or...hmmn or some other rapper often mention God, that doesn't mean they worship him or anything, I mean with them it's something along the lines of "!$*&@)#*(&%(@#%^ god in (*#%@(*%^@#)*% heaven"  or something like that.  but who knows, I mean I really don't.   Hmnn, I am up here in SHL 135, just working some overtime....overtime is tight....keeps me from boredom.  and Boredom is the bane of my existence, and should be...well destroyed or something :) :)

      Grr, there they go again, people that judge a band and it's songs to be Christian or not, depending on the what the band says.   You don't always have to state everything explicitly, you know what I am saying.  Like look at Beloved, I can't remember at the moment whether or not they sang explicitly about God or not in their songs.  But it was implicitly driven, and they did pray before the concert, to Jesus Christ, you know our savior.  So I do know they are not buddhists or something like that.

      So I am back.   Good Morning y'all....I am feeling great, Kind of, just rubbing it in my peers' faces that I had thanksgiving last night.  I am listening to Habeas Corpus again, the more I listen the more that I invoke odd emotions upon myself.   "She lies and whispers loving words, he lay bleeding on this floor, a sigh, a kiss will end his pain, he loves her, he loves her dearly"  Really who can't associate with that....hmmmn...I just felt so hurt back in the day...but lately I been believing that I will not feel that pain again...which is kind of neat.

      So How's it going, all you out there in the fabulous realm otherwise known as the Internet.  YAY! I am really happy I get to see Lexine today, and I had a sampler cd for her for a while now, with some of the best music...of the genre she listens to.  Indie/Indie Pop/Indie Rock/Indie Emo/Emo.   So it's good stuff.  Just wanted to say "Hey Gorgeous."  Just listening to the Fighting Jacks....their cd comes out later this month.  I plan to buy it, the mae cd, and the solid state cd.  that should be good...well I'm not sure...if I have some money left I will grab the FM Static one as well.  Music is almost like a crutch to stand on.  It was made to be like that, to be emotional, and drive emotions.  Look at ancient Civilizations, they used chants and beating drums to spur on their anger, while as one person said "Music calms the savage beast," which is just as true, with music, one can change the emotions and thoughts of the masses.  Ever wonder why listening to any country evokes the same effects, or the fact that Thrash Metal, and Emo Metal can actually calm oneself rather than enrage.   Ever wonder about that?  or How Classical can get people to change their mindsets, freeing themselves, why else do you think Extol, reverts to classical as much as it needs, same with Zao.  Well that's me for now...see you all later.  and Hey Katrina!

       Actually, you're thinking of "El Snow White." It's a nice story about a woman who lives with 7 midgets, one of which is a pumpkin. They had to go up a hill to get their water, because they were afraid of the Ogre that lived under the bridge and ate trogladites.  "El Pepito" is a small device Tyler stole from the Russian mob. He uses it to control the weather, do his homework, make French fries, and ship live elk via UPS. Oh yeah, it also converts video into DV streams for processing on his Mac.    --Tyler

      I never realized how cool Ellen was until today, I mean I never really thought too much of her.  I had her number on my floor for like 7 months...never thought to use it, and still wasn't sure, but you know I really enjoy her company, she could end up being a really good friend.  The more I listen to this Mae cd, the more I like it, you know they are a really good band....at first I thought they were just a typical boy emo band, but not really they are like Our Lady Peace meets Alien Ant Farm.  really tight if you ask me

      I really like this song by Mae...and a side note I wont be rating bands...I will be rating songs, and how I relate to them...the next set being from...Mae    Artist:  Mae   Album:  Destination: Beautiful  Song:  This Time Is The Last Time      Save yourself. Because the only thing that matters is that you get away from the pain and the thought of losing your mind. Don't blame yourself. It was everyone around you who made you act this way. There's the stage and your chance to watch it go down.  Don't fake yourself into ever, ever thinking about yesterday. That was then, this is now. Don't call it undone. Don't take what you've been dealt. You can exit out the back and make your getaway before anyone can see the damage you have done.  This time is the last time so be here, here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through.  State your case. You've got everyone's attention. What can you say? Thanks or forget what you've been given. Take your place. Do you think that you deserve the best of everything? We don't get why you're here. Can you figure it out?  This time is the last time so be here, here now.  You've got to get away. Oh, I get lost in the thought of losing you. You've got to get away. I know it's a dream but it must be true. Wave now goodbye. It's the lesson that you've been given. You can always move on to better things.  This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time somehow. This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through.    This song really reminds me of the whole predicament with Allie...on one hand I really don't want her friendship, but on the other hand, she acts so innocent around me, and really wants to keep my friendship...I guess she doesn't get that it's what she hides from me that she hides so she won't hurt me, is what hurts.  Why do I get myself involved in such predicaments.   She tries to keep the friendship going, and I try also, but the best I can do is just distance myself, I don't want to be mean about it, but really she doesn't realize how much what she does is getting to me, I used to be able to shrug it off.   I shouldn't stew over it, you know "dwell in the past" like a great Woman I know once said, but this isn't the past in this case, she is still putting me through hell.  Maybe it's just me interpreting the situation all wrong, maybe I am just getting the wrong feeling of how this should be, but seriously when someone says they love you, I don't know what to think.  In my generation we don't even know what love is, apart from those of us who know God, I mean she would tell me she loves me...but really? does she isn't love neverending, isn't it patient....Maybe I shouldn't "black sheep" her because of her faults, but everyone is just hitting home on me, causing me a great deal of stress here and there.   I got one more song for Allie....and that should be good, well actually 2....oh fine, you guys will let me do 2 right?    Artist:  Mae  Album:  Destination: Beautiful  Song:  Summertime      Summertime, summertime brought me back to thinking you were mine all those times.  We laid it down and left it all behind, we were blind.   Oh, the summertime.  We could ride, we could ride.  Take my hand and watch the world go by.  Laugh or cry, well we need to try, get off the line, time to fly.  Oh, the summertime.  Go on ahead and let it fade away.  No looking back you know the past will stay.  It's you and me, we could get out of here.  Jump in and go and we could drive for years.  We could feel alive...  Here we are, here we are,  windows down we see a shooting star.  Stop the car.  Waiting for nothing but our beating hearts, going far.   Oh, the summertime.  So feel the air, feel the air,  take the map and point to anywhere.  I don't care. Fingers through your hair,  the sky I've seen is blue and green.  Oh, the summertime.  Driving away, leaving it all behind.  Driving away, just driving away.    Really, my friendship with Allie was like a neverending summer for awhile...then we came back down to earth, realized both of us weren't as perfect as we thought we were, I had flaws (hey don't we all), as did she, and we realized that we were just really idle-minded.   But she was intent on saying she loved me, and tried to convince me that she did, she still tells me, but what is her love?  She tells me she loves her online Boyfriend who she has never met? which is absolutely ridiculous, and don't give me the whole "How can you love God, if you never met him?" arguement, ask him yourself, I have talked with God, and met him, he knows who I am.  Yeah, her boyfriend is convinced he is a romantic, but in reality all he is a guy, who wants a girl with some chest and a nice rear, he just wants her for the wrong reasons.   and then he says he is looking for love, yeah obviously in the wrong way, I spoke to him about all that was going on, apparently he was coming up at the end of this month, and still is, for his sake, and my respect to the sancticty of what is said in private I won't repeat what he said, all I can say is that...Allie is more shallow than I thought.  All I will say is that....they are both craving, and impulse driven, mindless and co-existing only as a business transaction relationship "I will do this, if you do this, and then I will say I love you if you do, and yeah don't forget I will hate you if you don't".  Get this...she felt that I didn't need to know that he was coming up...frankly I don't care what she does with him, just the fact that she believed that I hated him so much, that it would kill my friendship with her if I knew...is what hurt me there...she has me all wrong, she thinks I am as shallow as her....like said before how do I get myself into these binds.  And Like I promised...one more song:   Artist:  The Agony Scene   Album:  The Agony Scene   Song:  Habeas Corpus      stabwounds will take their toll murderer with her smile and as an afterthought she kept the heart he gave her beauty can be so cruel she once swore him forever to make good on her word ensured he'd never leave her she lies and whispers loving words he lay bleeding on this floor a sigh a kiss will end his pain and (she) drives the blade deeper still come closer to me crimson streaks the pale skin of her face from the spray of blood from his throat his eyes ever questioning why she swore never to leave him      That's exactly what happened with Allie and I, except it was more proverbial then anything.    She said she loved me, swore that she wouldn't lie to me, and asked me to never do the same, she told me she loved, while going around stabbing me in the back, then again she convinced me to come back, I decided that maybe I loved her, Though it ended up with her stabbing me in the back again.  Is it really worth the pain?  is there really something to come out of this half-way friendship.

      " I am made from the wires " -- Ronnie Martin , of  Joy Electric   Now there is a band that has had alot of change in the past few years, from their....all too happy Christian Songs cd, to what they are now...don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with that cd but really, I don't listen to that kind of music anymore...I got pulled in by the labels other bands.   Like Thousand Foot Krutch(before T&N, their new stuff...is bitefull), MxPX, Dogwood, and of course....Agony Scene...Yeah all of them are overrated, but I don't care, I like their music, it's stuff I can relate to....hmmn I oughta start rating a band several times a week on here....or whenever I get a cd...I could do that...yeah...looks like I got alot of rating to do today :D :D.

       Artist:  Dead Poetic  Album:  Four Wall Blackmail   Song:  August Winterman      And If I could teach the world to be.. I’d teach them all to be something just like me. Frustrated, bitter, depressing.  Perfect – As if my wings were like yours But I’m falling down.  And if you could hold your tongue long enough.. You’d see that all I am is love, but I don’t like me. I despise me.  Perfect – As if my wings were like yours But I’m falling down. Perfect – As if my wings were like yours But I’m falling down.  It’s a disease they’ll never have a cure for. You’re the only way to dry my eyes. It’s a disease, they’ll never have a cure. But I’m the on whose wrong. I’m the one who cries. It’s a disease, they’ll never have a cure for. It’s a disease, they’ll never have a cure. But I’m the on whose wrong. I’m the one who cries.  I cry – I despise me.     Janelle....

       A word of advice: Don't walk around in the middle of the night, in the rain, naked, without shoes, grab the third rail of a train track with both hands and piss on it from three inches away.  If you do, you could suffer a traumatic death of the electric current traveling up the pee, through your body, into your heart, giving you a heart attack and ultimately death.   --Becca

      " Ok, I went to their concert, they seemed like nice guys, I talked to Michael and the Bassist for a minute, they seemed like nice guys once again. But what im getting at is that I am sick and tired about people ragging on their lyrics, ....I really dont know what the lyrics were inspired by or written for but I find them uplifting in a way, dont get me wrong I don't care if you all think that I am Morbid. For all we know, these songs are just their way to express situations, ...I am sure at least one of you has written a dark or Harrowing poem, haven't you?   I will give my outlook on a couple of their songs:  We Bury our Dead at Dawn: I have no idea what its supposed to be, but it seems like a car accident occured, and now she looks at herself, and how it changed her. Or perhaps metaphorically a Girl who had a really big issue in life that got to her, and changed her. I see it as a song about change and getting used to what it does   Lines of Suicide:  A song about angst, lacking. Someone who is jaded, and has problems piled up on them, and is just now seeing that perhaps what they were doing to fix the problems wasn't right.   Habeas Corpus:  I see this metaphorically (it doesnt matter to me how you all see it), This song strikes me as a song about ....well someone stabbing you in the back...i can relate to it, I thought I loved a girl and she stabbed me in the back. That's how i see it, two people that disagreed on thinking that their thoughts were mutual, and one proving that they weren't    When you look at the lyrics under a different light, they take on a new kind of uplifting form.   As Christians we shouldn't be so fast to judge others' people just express themselves in different ways. I am not saying that I am perfect, in Christ we are made perfect, I live to follow God. I really don't know what this band believes, as I was about to ask Michael, I hesitated, and lost my chance, unsurity in my spirit. Not to go off on too much of Tangent here, but we shouldn't hesistate in asking people about their life, and God's impact on their lives, or even if they believe in him. I know I do.

      Well Kudos to Janelle for her french work, I just started studying french again today, that is some difficult stuff.   Well later on, as far as conversation goes, it's not a matter of memorization it's a matter of understand how everything works, I suppose knowing french helped me learn C, you know?  One language to another, thank God, that I took some logic earlier.  I could really use a taco or an enchilada or SOMETHING CHINESE right now, who knows, I really could, well I better be going now, I am lost amongst the ranks of people in the Lab, Good Bye All, Sean will be back later.

       Of Catholics, Acid, and getting scared of Supervisors   Well yesterday was crazy, every conversation I had with a group of people ended up revolving around Acid, Catholics and the Matrix.  Really odd, who knows, then someone threw out that random question, "What religion would i change to?", Bloody hell eh, I used to be Catholic, religion sucks,  I am never going back, I am a Christian first, then a Canadian, but yeah beyond that none of that doctrine crap is getting to me.  Yeah my supervisor just scared the living crap out of me, he came and talked to me.  You heard me CAME AND TALKED TO ME!!!!!!  I was surprised, lol and what's more HE TALKED ABOUT XBOX GAMES WITH ME!!!!!!!!!!! What the heck...who knows.

      If I hear one more person scold me for saying Oh My God, then I will seriously have a nervous fit about it.  I mean come on, it's not sacreligious or anything ...let's analyze it.   Oh = Sudden Reaction.  My = Referring to me, or being of mine, or something that is related to me. God = He who I believe in.  As a whole it's saying, "What's going on", like a sudden revelation of the fact that we don't know what we are doing, or what's going on.   So yeah, debate me on anything, I can't guarantee you that I could win, but I could probably make a good attempt at doing so.

       Day 6 of ..Day 1 :  In the Life of Poster Boy :  Whacked Up Weekend :  Tantalizing Offers   I had finally recovered from that crazy day I had spent with Andrea.  Who knows what could have happened if we didn't hang out.  Well she did some explaining as to who the Flashlight Mafia is, and what they do.  More or less a rag tag, motley crew of well people that are going Sane, from the lack of positive ways to decrement their Sanity.  Dangerous if you ask me, they plotted to take over the world once, but that didn't work at all.  They seem to think that I can do it.  Elicia called me the other day, saying something about needing me to do something for her.  She had some strange attachment to me, something along the lines of us never thinking the same thing about eachother, oh come on.  Then she made some implication of us sneaking off, I simply laughed at her, Andrea would kill me, if she caught us.

Well back to Day 2 of ...day 1.

       Day 2 of ..Day 1 :  In the Life of Poster Boy :  The Morning After :  I need a Pill   Well I woke up this morning to realize that the bite marks were still there, you know it's not every day you are bitten by a beautiful, gorgeous, girl, at least not in my life, and probably not in Tim's or Nathan's or Aaron's or Jeff's...well maybe Jeff's life but you know "hey", we don't go there.  Well so I decided to call up that girl, and well this is how it went:   Sean :*583-5879* *rings*  Wombat Princess :  Hello?  Sean :  Hey, is the umm...Wombat Princess there?  Wombat Princess :  Excuse me!?  Sean :  well is she in?  Wombat Princess :  I do have a name you know!  Sean :  I'm sorry, what was it again? I'm bad at names.  Wombat Princess :  Well you didn't bother to find out did you.  I didn't think so, speechless I see  Sean :  well, I will call again later then k?  Wombat Princess :  You think you can just call me and use my number and me to pass time whenever you want?  Well think again, because that's not how it works around here, either you call and talk, or don't talk at all!  Sean :  Well you see, I can't talk to someone whose name I don't know  Wombat Princess :  Well then why won't you ask already, and stop with that attitude  Sean :  well umm.  Wombat Princess :  Don't look at me in that tone of voice!  Yeah and my name is Andrea, you didn't bother to ask *Phone Hangs up*  Well yeah it didn't go as well as I would have hoped, I will probably call her later, maybe it will end in something useful.  or something.  Well hmmn, I suppose I will go to Clark now, start my daily madness.  Well I arrived in the computer lab once again, to notice that their was a hole in the ceiling from where the Wombat Princess...err Andrea Eclipsed the sun light.  Hmmn, well nothing really happened while I sat there, I just watched as people went about doing their business in public...really I don't think people should have the right to their business in public, you know what I am saying?  Doing private business in a public computer lab, is absolutely wrong.  I looked out and saw, a large open room, and that point the bite mark started to ache, I wanted to run, I really wanted to run into that room.    So I did, run into that room, as I said.   Of course security came after me, threatening me, so I burst out the window, and fell on the ground, I brushed myself off, and kept on going..maybe I could find a way to make it all seem right.  I kept on running, security was hot on my tail still, nothing much I could do but run, ...in a very fast manner.  Security caught up to me, and pinned me down, and held a gun to my head and told me "Dhon't mhoove Greengo."  Then I realized to myself, that this indeed was not Security, but the Cuban Drug lord that I had warned my friend about earlier that morning.  Shoot!  Pedro found me, "Pedro, it's me Sean!."  "Sean...Sean...Sean...?? Oh yeah sorry man, I didn't recognize you with that bite mark on you right upper arm."  Well yeah Pedro and me got stuff settled so yeah, security was still coming up. So we hopped in Pedro's car, and drove off, he told me that he was part of a secret society, of well underground organized sanity.    What in the world, a Sanity Cult, known as the Flashlight Mafia, and he was a Godfather there.  What is up with that.  When we got there I looked around, and I swore I saw Andrea.  So I walked up and talked to her, and well she kind of sat there in her seat and gave me a really odd look, so I called at her some more times, and she finally said "IM NOT ANDREA, she was my missing sister that showed up the other day, I'm Elicia"  At that point I felt really stupid.   Well From the looks of it the Flashlight Mafia needed me, because I broke the madness that had enslaved poor Andrea.  So the initiation went through, they made me drink 8 glasses of water, then read a couple pages of this book  The Philosophy of Time Travel  and watch that movie  Donnie Darko , and then let me go home.    Sean :  *583-5879* *rings*....*rings about 10 more times*  Andrea :  Hey Sean  Sean :  Hey Andrea, how's it going?  Andrea :  Oh my God, you remembered my name!  Sean :  of course I di..  Andrea :  YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME!!!!!  Sean :  well it's not really that big of..  Andrea :  Yes it is, yes it is to me  Sean :  Well I met your sister, Elicia today  Andrea :  oh, the Merm.  Sean :  ...umm ok?  Andrea :  she is horrible, stay away from her  Sean :  Well I wasn't planning to...  Andrea :  that's what they all said....*mumbles* and all those bones  Sean :  Pardon?  Andrea :  Nothing, don't worry about it.  But hey, I got to go here soon, you want to hang out tommorow?  Sean : Sure  from there the conversation got better, and yeah I guess we are hanging out tommorow

      " Psycho-Joust: Tokyo's End "  Guess what you all?  I finally got to talk to Katrina last night, I felt so happy, because yeah we don't talk near as much, yeah it is my fault, but hey at least we talk now.   I need to have an alternate life as my super hero self "Poster Boy".   What will I have to make me different.  One of those 'Cat in the Hat' hats, some blue quartz lens glasses, and a gas mask.  Yeah.   Day 1 of ..Day 1 :  In the Life of Poster Boy :  Foul Awakening :  The Wombat Princess   Eyes opened wide, at the crack of dawn, to hear the subtle soothing sounds of  Fold Zandura  as I awakened.  Rushed I traversed to my shower, and returned roughly an hour later, I then flew down my flight of stairs, grabbed my proverbial feast, and flew out the door.  Glancing across the freeway I could see many cars caught in gridlock, I did not mind as I flew past.    Sadly to my luck, I flew straight into a rain storm, What is up with me.  Forced to land, I landed on Clark's Campus, and now I am here, in the Computer Lab. To my dismay in ran a Hulking Brute of a Wombat, I had to take it on, I needed to take it on.  I ran straight at it also, my trusty  Digipen Pen  held high, I lunged, and the Wombat dodged.  To my surprise the crazy creature opened it's jacket to reveal to me it had a large supply of Medical Syringes?  It pulled out one that was Labeled "Really Bad XXX" and charged at me once again, I was too late to dodge, and it Jabbed me hard in my right arm.  I let out not an ear piercing, pants wetting scream, but rather a yell of...Confusion.  The wombat forgot to take the Syringe out of it's sleeve so I was hit by a blunt object in a stabbing manner.  As I fell to the ground, the Wombat lept high into the sky, and eclipsed the Sunrise.  Everything got dark, and damp at that moment, maybe it was because it was raining, but then the Wombat bit me in the arm, leaving a deep wound.  Within Seconds the Wombat, turned into a fair Maiden, "Thank you, you have freed me of the curse", I responded with a simple "And what would that be?"  Apparently she was under some curse that turned her into a Wombat, and could not be turned back until she successfully defeated someone in combat, then bit their right upper arm.     I really just sat their amazed, and shocked as to how stupid it seemed for a Wombat to turn into a Fair Maiden.  Apparently she is the Fabled Wombat Princess I had seen before only in fairy tales.  I left her there, she gave me her phone number, and insisted on me calling her later so her insurance company could contact me and pay the medical bill for my injury.  I went to sleep that night, thinking about the beautiful Wombat Princess, that bit my right arm, and offerend to pay my Medical bills.  No girl, had ever done that for me before, then again along those same lines, no girl had ever been a Wombat in front of me before.  Good point.  I layed in bed, eyes closed and drifted off into a dream land.   I could see a boy, with a " One of those 'Cat in the Hat' hats, some blue quartz lens glasses, and a gas mask " and he looked sad.  He was laying in a corner crying, his arm was beginning to glow where it was bitten.  He only sat their grimacing in pain, not sure what to do.  He eventually got up, sick of the pain, and began to run, began to run into the nothingness, not sure where he was going, he only wanted to go.   Sick of the pain, sick of the mocking, sick of it all, he wanted to leave it all behind.   He stopped running and looked down at his arm to see the pain was leaving, the glowing stopped, and he felt full of energy.   Afterwards I thought to myself, what a queer and uncanny dream.  Well it turned out that that wound which I suffered empowered me, I now am full of energy.   I am now  Poster Boy , not really a defender of Justice, but really just a defender of my own rights, ...not selfish, but simply ego-centric.  POSTER BOY AWAY!!

      Snow it's white and fuzzy...Yay.  I am so happy it is finally snowing, usually it is right after my birthday.  What took it so long, NATURE FORGOT ABOUT ME!!!!! That's it, last time I say anything nice to Evolutionists, EVOLUTION SUCKS WHITE FUZZ!!!  Well Moving on here, I am tempted to show this paper to Mr. Cowen, but am afraid he may kill me for it.  It mentions that Thompson, who developed C, made it as a joke to tick people off, and people actually started using it.   To think, that Pascal was the language they wanted to continue on, not this C junk.   Come to think of it, it shows microsofts aptitude now, they are calling on C as well, shows their level of intelligence.  I WANT MY LICENSE ALREADY DANG IT!!!   Just sitting here up in SHL 135, scarpellia hall for all you non scarpelli folks, Hey, Sarah just walked in, and now she is walking to the back toward the lounge, BINGO SCORE folks, she is now in the lounge , nevermind, she just came out, she is coming around the corner, and BINGO she has a head set, she is unwrapping it and and and, she has placed it on a student, and is now...WHAT IS SHE DOING, plugging it in and untangling it.   That's a 3 point shot.  She is going down, repeat, she has disapeared from sight, nevermind she's back, and she just glanced at me, she is staggering, and and, she is standing tall and still like a rock, WHOA NOW, she just moved, and she is clicking the mouse, WHOA WHOA, that could be a technical foul, but wait, ok it's safe she's clean.  Enough of that already

      Well I registered for Winter Quarter today.  thanks to Katrina I understand this concept of winter quarter.  I assumed that Winter was pre-Christmas, but apparently Winter break is AFTER Christmas.  Which makes sense...but dave's friend Jill said that Christmas break is really winter break.  What is this winter break.  I am very confused as to where to find it, and what to do on it.   or during it...or with it :).   Well yeah I was talking to Trish last night, very odd though, I ended up being some sort of Communal rite of Passage, they were Communally approving of me, and passing me on.  I found it so very odd, I called for Trish, and Phil answered so I talked to him.  Then Trish walked by, so I talked to her.  Then she got kicked off, so I talked to Phil some more, then April for a second, then back to Phil.   Later April decided to find out what the obsession with Sean was, so the April took the phone from the Phil, and talked to The Sean.   Which was very interesting, we have a lot in common as I found out, I suppose their whole family relates to me somehow.  Either way, it all works.

      Well thought I might post a song i was working on.    No more Goodbyes   Verse 1: Just thought, I might lay down my pen and write you  a song, never thought it would have to be this way,  Chorus: I never thought you would leave, (I did that once before), I never thought it would be you to leave, we are both parting, (seperate ways), (seperate paths), maybe to cross, maybe to never meet, no more good byes  Verse 2: I was supposed to leave, leave it all behind, never thought it would be both of us leaving it all behind, we leave together,  Verse 3: Maybe I wanted to leave it all behind, Only what I wanted behind me, You shouldn't have to leave it behind, You shouldn't have to leave  Verse 4: I'm heading out, with my tail between my legs I cry, running, running, I can no longer keep it close to me.

      " Wait for the boy who pursues you, the one who will make an ordinary moment seem magical, the kind of boy who brings out the best in you and makes you want to be a better person. Wait for the boy who will be your best friend, the person who will drop everything to be with you at any time of the day no matter what the circumstances. Wait for the boy who makes you smile like no other boy makes you smile and when he smiles you know he needs you. Wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and have no makeup on, but appreciates it when you get all dolled up for him. Most of all, wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe, because obviously he's at the center of yours.   "  for all them you there Ladies out there

      as for growled or screamed vocals being satanic...well, lets see what the bible says:   Revelation 10: 1-3   1 I saw still another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. 2He had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 3and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.   so...is that 'satanic' sounding? i would say more like 'angelic' sounding.

      pulsing my veins, these rhythms phase me, eternal beats against my heart, these lights scorching my eyes,  the tears of blood, drip down my pallid flesh, she lays there with the knife, she knows I don't want a fight,  she dug it deep, I wouldn't let it end, choir of screams, choir of screams, echoing diamonds,  her hair soaked in her crimson, I wanted to bring her back, no way, make it simple, no way, make it hard,  repent or retribution, forced to drink down hypocrisy, I watch them fall, I watch them cry those tears of blood,  their children only watching, waiting, wondering, when they will return,  if they don't, they will cry, if they do, they will cry,  they will cry an eternity, blistered eyes mark our generation, tears wasted, blood spent,  why can't we....

      We were made in his image, and likewise we have an urge to create?  Ever wonder why we have dreams, aspirations, callings, imaginations even? I feel it is our natural urge to create, no one is born with an urge to destroy.  We have an urge to Love, and Urge to want to be near.  Language in itself was a miracle, and written language also.

I could have resisted it, and made every dream come true, and gotten somewhere, yet, I failed and didn't allow it, why?  Why do I value loyalty to ones that love me, as opposed to loyalty to those that I love.  Why do I violate the friendships that I have, to get those that will never prosper.

      This Bloody nation is annoying me.  To be anywhere successful you have to be beautiful, have an incredible body, somehow know how to sing, be able to bench a truck and carry a note.   This is insane, I am not complaining because I am inadequate, maybe I am, but that is not the issue.  In the past, meaning yesterday, I would have said that musicians and actors are over payed, well I would liek to see just anyone try that, it's hard stuff.  Not world changing yet hard.  Some people are simply over payed in our eyes, but at one time I suppose they had the same issue that we had  you know, they might have been in the same boat and they are out.  So why can;t we support them, are we simply fools or something.  Why does music have such manipulative powers over teh masses, why is that, I don't understand.  How can one song come out, a band go triple platinum, then everyone owns the cd, what happened to individuality, whatever happened to that?  I want to succeed yet everything drives me into the ground.   Every attempt is stopped, well you watch me world, I will succeed, and I will show you up, and watch me you'll be damned if I don't succeed, why should I Depend on the masses why can't they depend on me?  Why do I have to be forced to give into Urges on account of what the world thinks.   Why do they throw it at me wherever I go.  Why does Emo and Nu-Metal (Melodic metal, synth metal, metal emo) have such power over us.  I don't understand, what do we need to be "there", why are we judged as to when we get "there".  I mean I have wasted my life trying to be "there", well you know what that is wasted because even people that are "there" in our eyes claim that "there" is somewhere else.

      You know what, we take for granted what we have, Friendships and Family, and I am not sure entirely as to why.  You sit there and whine when you have to deal with them, yet when they are gone you lament, what happened to simply being content, how long does it take before you get sick and tired of something how long does it take till you have sucked the resources of friendships dry, until they really are dry.   Are we just supposed to feed off of eachother until Kingdom Come or what?  Nahum spoke of damnation, for awhile I did also, lol maybe we are related.

      Magic, it never was there, we only wish it was there, we see things that we want, and make things as though they were.  We live in a falsified fabricated society, where fools prosper and those worthy die of greed.   Who knows, maybe one day someone will set them straight, but the reality is, we all begin part of this hamster wheel life, that makes us feel like we are going somewhere but doesn't, I want a hamster ball life.

      If I were to swing down the masses, and let my tears flood their gates, would anything change, would they see my pain, would they drink what iniquity had followed, Is my blood any different, her pale flesh, beauty only harnessed by the light basked in it, her lips only dangling,  waiting,  knowing they have future purpose, fingers bent by the cruelty of time, forced to grab what light touches them, holding onto whatever they can, each one passing, knowing,  they wait, knowing, one day the day will come, and none will fall

      Bought the New Skillet CD, Fingernails is my favorite song so far, haven't listened to the part of the cd after that, been on repeat so long.  Their new sound is more like Korn added to System of a Down, with a Dash of Marilyn Manson,  some Disturbed, and of course some classic old school Skillet, but not near as whiny as they used to be.   I know a lot of people that cannot stand Korn, well you know what, I love his voice, if I sang like that I would be him, I have my own voice, distinct, maybe a little obnoxious yet it works.   "I'm a vampire, up against the wall....Bring the Chaos."  Random things I know.  I also bought the East West cd, Vintage, not near as good as the Skillet CD, but you know for 9.98 you can or cannot  go wrong, next time I am buying the Astronomy (Bleach), or Cheeses of Nazareth (Five Iron Frenzy) cds.

      I FINALLY BEAT SILENT HILL 2!!!!!!! In your face all you talented programmers, and 4 american publicity people.   Well apparently I got 1 of the 4 endings unlocked ...yay for me.  But yeah I have so many questions:  What happens to Laura? What happened to Angela after we saw the man who was skinned, and then stapled with his skin to the wall? What happens to the Knife I never gave Angela to kill herself? Why did Eddie Have to Die? Where in the world did the Pyramid Heads come from? Who were those people Eddie Killed? Why did James kill his Wife? Who really was Maria? Did Maria know Mary? Did James kill himself? Where did all the creatures appear from? How long was the city there? Was it all just in my head? If I killed mary 3 years ago, how did Laura only just get the letter?  How do I get to the other endings? Will they make a movie of it?

      So if I were to look out my window,  and see a black sun rise,  would I still have you in my heart,  would I still be able to hold you as it growled in the sky,  setting only to leave me alone,  solitude is where I live,  silence my only requiem,  solitude is where I live, silence is my only requiem, you stole my happiness,  replaced with Madness I smiled,  teardrops tearing through what was left of the battered lives,  alone they cry,  "where is our salvation, where is our rite", there lives torn in half, their minds left only to wrought the iron that remained, why did it grow cold, why were we ripped apart,  why has this plagued me,  and why can't I start,  this villainy I once knew as life,  the young girl no longer knocking at my hearts door,  no longer wishing to never be born,  she tore herself a lock of hair,  as to which by hold me dear,  well no longer can I stand,  this salt burning at my scalp,  the thoughts scraping at my skin,  can I no longer stay,  written to be confused,  written to confuse,  written out of confusion,  my last hopes hold on and linger near,  let them come close,  let them hug my soul,  let them embrace my very being only to leave and let me go,  in this town I grew,  in the town I burdened my life,  let me pass with simplicity,  let these people only know what is near, strength to pass between them,  and know that what I did was not wrong,  and where I was going was not in vain,  let me know my love was not violated,  and taken aback,  please let me continue,  I will not suffer these pains,  for no contrived reason,  I remain

      Well ....Merry Christmas you all, it's almost here.  Somehow this year, I could care less, I mean I know it's the time we celebrate the Lord's birth and all.  But somethign doesn't seem right...this year I could care less about all the traditions associated with it, I noticed around Thanksgiving, that traditions exist.  and really I see no point in them, what is the purpose of gathering people that don't want to be gathered, to see people they don't want to see, to eat food they don't like, to talk to people they would rather hate the majority of the year, what kind of discombobulated universe do we live in?  Why do people force themselves on people, why does rape exist, and why don't people understand enough when it is enough.  If clingyness is a character trait, how do you break it, without scaring the person you are clinging to....come on.   Really odd.  Like here I am now faced with the fact that the person that I tried to understand more than anyone, their friendship was in beginning a ploy to get rid of me from someone else, who now laments the loss of my friendship with her.  I mean....somehow I think that Women are somehow at my Achilles' heel yet not the heel, as though they talk to me in my sleep and exploit what little sanity I have left. What is the purpose of digging in deep under my skin only to make me go mad, why is that?

      Well i Been out for awhile, thought I might say hey to you all, let you know that I am here.   I feel really bad, because I couldn't make time to wish Lexine happy birthday on wednesday.   Grr. She's 15 now :).   I have known her almost 2 yrs now, well yeah, I Have known her about 2 yrs now.  That's a girl, ....im not sure what I was about to say.  That's one person I will miss alot when I leave.   We used to talk alot, but life happens as does cause and effect and thus we have to move on.  I remember I once swore that I would rescue her from her dad when I got my license, here I am ...still no license, and she is still living in hell.  ...yet another reason I need my license.

It brings up some new info, including the fact only the editted episodes will be shown, not the originals [oh....], there will be ALL the animations, audio, etc. on the disks and they are contacting the crew to see if they want to do audio or animatics of the unproduced episodes... Sounds pretty good, except for not seeing the uneditted episodes... Anyways, hit the More Info link for all the details, it's the top news post on RWaM & GIR.   - HMK    who is happy, I am happy "Keep on smiling, keep on smiling"

      Hmmn, the human mind is alot stronger than I thought.   I mean I always assumed it to be weak and powerless.   Though, if you are not careful it can grab hold of you really hard.   I didn't realize that without food, I can't keep my mind in check, I simply don't have the energy needed to keep it occupied, and instead to goes purely mad.  You know my whole theory on Carnality being potentially, inversely proportional to the fatigue involved.   well it seems as though energy seems to play a part in it also, at least, the lack thereof.  Katrina and I have both talked once or twice while we were tired, and yeah it gets insane.   Well imagine that times....well the biggest number you can think of, and that graphically is what you get.  It was surely insane.  That Dream hit my like a brick wall, and yeah shook me up awfully bad.

      I never knew fasting could be so mentally taxing.   My mind broke, then within a little while, my body broke.   This has never happened before, and the opposition was getting to me, I mean, I don't understand what is going on, something doesn't want me to do this, and well, it stopped me.   Whether or not that dream meant anything, dreams generally are produced in your mind, and while fasting you are both purging you mind and your body.   Well this is the first time the carnality of my mind wouldn't let me go, the dream showed it was not about to leave any time soon.  I feel like there is two of me living in here.  One side, I long to banish, and another I have yet to birth.   Reminds me of that Clive Barker painting "I am borne of myself" or whatever, a woman giving birth to herself....really odd if you ask me

Guess I am beginning to manipulate the world around me.  I suppose I should start harnessing these 16 yr old powers of mine, who knows.  I wonder what Janelle must think of me, I must be some Egotistical Jerk.  Obsessed with myself, only happy with what I do, and only happy for myself.   Wel you know what, I guess thats the price you pay for ambition, and I will pay it gladly, to hell with complacency, to hell with ignorance, and to hell with submission.   I have been submissive my whole life allowing people to think for me, I will think for myself from now on.   They will all pay.

      Stuck here again in this bloody place, every day the same thing...same old same old.. Is there no way I will understand what is going on here.   Speaking of which, last night I had the strangest dream...or nightmare:   I was laying there talking to someone online, via my tv and a keyboard.  And i decided to log off.  I turned away, and then I heard Maniacal laughing, I looked back at the television, and saw, a face, wasn't sure what it was, as soon as I did, I started convulsing.  My mouth was sealed shut, I couldn't speak or call upon God.   That dream was strange and all, though what bothered me was that, when I woke up, I was still convulsing and i then heard ...get this a dial tone in my left ear.   really bugs me...no one believes me about it..how hard is that to believe?

      Well Looks like i forgot my camera at home so i can't start on "Cloud on a Fly" yet.   Hmmn, i will probably end up making some sort of other version of "Cloud on a Fly" later on.   So far i got week one ready to go:  Every act of creation is first of all an act of destruction.  --Pablo Picasso Spanish painter, sculptor   is the quote of this week's episode, I will be covering such issues as:  - The Existential Dilemma - People's Reactions to Sean's questions - The hell I have caused to people in their lives - Hell - Randomness  Should take up about 30 minutes when I get it all edited.  Probably do some funky labels, and what not, some transitions.

      Captain's Log: Sean Date 012104  or not  Hmmn, I woke up this morning, without much direction to the sound of someone eating eggs and bacon on the radio...very odd.  At 5 in the morning.  Strange yet again.  hmmn, so much in Evangelion was stripped out of messianic culture.   between units 00,01,02 they had a total of 7 eyes, which the bible said yahweh had. All the names of the "angels" in the show are taken straight out of the Apocalypse of Enoch. The Lance of Longinus, The crucifixion, and the semi-spontaneous not necessarily virgin birth's were taken straight out of the bible. The Evas are really just the Nephalim, but tamed, and hollowed husks.  All the more things, to make you think.

      Sean here....you hmmn, IMX is pretty cool.  You all should get hooked up with it :)  My tips for the day on IMX:  Buy Manson, Buy Billy Talent, Sell Evanescence (only a little), Buy Linkin Park, Buy Hoobastank, Sell Billy Talent (half of what you had...I had 7000 it went up a dollar, i sold half, so I earned 3500 there...then bought some more later)  Basic reasons for all that.  Manson is getting popular again, Billy talent is making a name for itself, Evanescence is getting bigger, but they might crash..I heard alot about people getting sick of them.  Linkin park, Hoobastank, and POD touring soon, so yeah go for it.

      k as for that dream, here it goes:  I was sitting in these open plains, the area was understood to have a round enclosure.  There was bushes all around.  The area wasn't grassy, but it was understood to have some sort of vegetation, the land was fertile but not touched yet, it was dry but not parched.  I myself, was some sort of small thing, it reminded me a lot of Vince from Voodoo Vince, but I wasn't a doll, nor vince.  I was running around aimlessly inspecting these strange rod like things on the ground, from their size I could only grip one at a time.  I looked around...thoughts on my mind being "fire bush" or some melange of words along those lines.  I climbed up the mound of what seemed to be sandy dirt and stood there.  I could see 5 holes, that whenever I looked at one a small halo like yellow circle hovered above.  Not sure what to do, I saw one of those rods laying around the mound, picked it up, and shoved it inside one of the halos, and into the hole.  To my surprise the mound shook and what seemed to be ludacrous happened, it happened that where I was standing was the head of a dragon made of...well dirt and sand.  the head reared, flailed around then spewed fire around, igniting one of those fire bushes.  The dragon then calmed it self, and returning it's head back into a mound.  It was then understood that I had to repeat this till all the fire bushes were lit.  Why I had to do any of that...I don't remember seeing, the dragon..why? I am not sure either, probably one of my most cryptic dreams yet.  Kind of like that dream of that beast that was killing people...catholics i believe, then the priests began to deny that anyone was killed, and denied the existence of that beast.  really odd yet again.

      Ok, here we go, another thing to get me riled in our day and age.  Society is full of "stupid."  Literally, and that in essence is a problem in itself, like come on...really.  We fear that things are going to scare children.  Well first let's define children.  One-Dimensional dependent minds latching onto whatever goes their way, with little discernment.  "Don't see this movie, it scares children," is probably something that bothers the hell out of me, not to mention the negativity of it but look at it.  We assume that all children are the same, and we limit other peoples' children the way we would limit our own.  But why?  Don't they have their own free will to do as they choose with their children.  We are dealing right now (people born between 1985 and 1990) with a screwed up Generation, and why you ask, because we let people like Disney run our lives.  It's a known fact that people these days could care less about disciplining our Children.  I mean we are disciplined for disciplining them, stripped of our rods, then told that when the children go awry and screw up society it's our fault.  But why?    We have a generation that is wired into technology, and grown up based on fairy tales that are so convoluted, so stripped of their own dignity that they are forced down the throats of these children.  Look at all these tales, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast.  All those, Disney took, removed the original moral undertones, replaced them with filth, added singing inanimate objects, then went ahead and stripped out all forms of Spiritual development.  In addition to those problems we deal with the fact that our Adults are busy working 40 hour a week jobs, both parents, to buy the highspeed internet, cable television, plasma monitors, and PS2s our children need so they don't :Rape, steal, pillage, plunder....etc.  Fairy tales, and all literature is meant to be monitored, and guided..seriously, without some sort of Elder guidance, it leaves one to grow up in a fantasy.  Don't get me wrong, children with limits and overbearing, sheltering parents, and those that do read, and don't watch "movies" on account of the fact that "all that is on TV is SEX" are still equally at fault.  First let me go to the Children who are sheltered.  They will suffer one of the biggest falls themselves, and blame their shortcomings on themselves thinking that they are not worthy, when it is the parent itself that is unworthy.  We are supposed to propagate individual independent thought, Naive nature is good, but the excess that Sheltering provides will shatter a child's hopes and dreams when they experience what the world has to offer.  Parents that often shelter their children, do so often because they don't have time to raise their children the way they should be raised.  A growing period in which you are constantly shut down, and not praised/scolded in the right ways will screw with you.  An example would be a Child that felt that he or she was in love, and that this amiable bond was broken, they feel inadequate, lost, broken, and worthless.  I would say is based on Oedipal bonds, if the parents were never really there to explain love, or warn of what society may offer as love, the Child will be all the more susceptable to it.  Children that aren't allowed to watch films, or television.  That could get me going for days.  I myself am not dependent on TV, but that is something that you have to come to a conclusion for yourself.  Raising children saying that films and television are evil, is more or less seeding ignorance into the child.  I mean come on, if you are seriously worried about your child's tv viewing, sit down with them and discuss it.  So at least the 2 of you know what you are getting into, even if it means you have to put off working overtime to get that bentley that you so "desperately" need to be happy.  For that matter if you think things of this world will keep you happy, you are in for such a cataclysmic realization, i will simply leave you to it yourself.  Overall what I am saying is, Parents spend more time with your kids.  Don't only show them the good side of life, the happy things and what not, they will be let down and angry at you and moreso themselves when they find out that Life isn't all rainbows and flowers, that life throws curve balls, and that trials and tribulations are to come.  Let them know who to turn to, and what to do with their lives.  on the same token, don't only show the what is wrong with life, or you will have such a Existential dilemma on your hands, you won't know how to deal with it.

You are me, you are what I am, and you are what I control.  I say what you do, and you do it, do as you are told and all will go fine.  We are one, the two of us, let us be.  We will harvest what is to be reaped, and shed what is to be kept in sanctity.

      You know what gets you the most, it's that you hold on the hardest, the tightest when you believe so deeply that you have lost the cause that you were holding on for.  Ever wonder why people are the way they are, Ties strengthen as destruction presents itself.  Picasso was right, Destruction is a direct byproduct of Creation.  As things strengthen, it's only so they can be tested and broken once again.

      Sean here, just going mad right now, I need something to give me some sort of sanity.  All of a sudden, things constrict on me.  What i can do, what I can't do, what I play, what i watch, suddenly it's all being pulled away.  Why did it have to strike me now, suddenly I am fragile and frail and cannot fend for myself.  Normally I would be straining to not let go, but this is ridiculous, suddenly I am not competent.  I am not looking for pity, I am looking for answers beyond "Because I am your parent" or "Because you are my child," when i was younger i could take such answers but now i can't tolerate it.

       Of Centaurs, Cockatrices and Dragons   This gets so much stranger. I obviously don't read my bible enough, if I read these verses correctly:  Isaiah 11:8   And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.    Isaiah 14:29   Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice,   and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.     Isaiah 59:5   They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.   In a way it shows that the bible claims that Cockatrice's really do / did exist. This is very interesting, I am not sure what to say, I thought they were simply myths, but I suppose they do/did exist.   Numbers 21:6   And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.    Whatever was at that point in Number's sounded much like a Dragon of sorts, or somethign like that. Actuall  Isaiah 14:29  seems to hint at Cockatrice's fathering Dragons...this is getting insane.  Hmmn another reference to the Fiery [flying] serpent.   Isaiah 30:6   The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.   As does   Psalm 91:13    Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:   the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.      Isaiah 27:1    In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing   serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea    Isaiah 51:9   Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?    Even stranger, I look at  Jeremiah 51:34 , and I am beginning to lose it at this point. This says "he hath swallowed me up like a  dragon ." How can the Bible keep on referencing these Dragons, they must exist/ existed at some time.  Well, I dont know if I should even mention Revelations as far as beasts go, that gets even stranger.   Revelation 12:3 , actually mentions what I believe to be a hydra, that means so far, the Bible has affirmed the existence of Cockatrice's, Dragons and Hydras, which is oh so strange.  In  Revelation 12:7 , Michael is said to have had war with the Dragon, which again is said to be called a Dragon, saying once again that Dragon's existed.  Don't worry though.. It get's stranger,  Revelation 9:7-10   Speaks of Locusts that "  7  And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.  8  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.  9  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.  10  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."   Yeah sounds incredibly like The Sphinx to me, or some sort of Centaur thing. Very odd if you ask me, very odd. Oh and get this, they have a king, known as Abaddon to the Jews, and Apollyon to the Greek. The Bible said that he was Apollyon to the Greek, which acknowledges the fact that the Greek existed. So I wase more or less right in saying there were indeed Dragons, Cockatrices, and Leviathans, and to a lesser degree the Greek were right in saying Centaurs existed. I would have to say that I do believe the Greek based their mythology on what really was happening.  Nonetheless, I find it very odd that the Bible mentioned Cockatrice's I had heard that name once more, and that was it. The Bible doesn't say much about them, but it does mention that they have Dens, and are at the Root of Dragons. The Bible mentions that the fruit of the Cockatrice is indeed a fiery flying serpent, which for the sake of simplicity I would say is a Dragon indeed.  Completely away from the Bible I read about the Cockatrice this morning, as being the "king" of serpents, which the Bible reinforces, if it is True that Dragons are the fruit of Cockatrices, then yes they would have to be "kings" of serpents.  You all know of Centaurs and Dragons, but not many of you know of Cockatrices, I will now explain for all of you that are remotely lost. Cockatrices, are born of the eggs of birds, and are some how part snake, part bird, AND they have a devasting gaze, and breath. So very odd.  Really any feedback would be nice, if possible

       Vampirism, Lycanthropes, Undead Vs. Christianity   Hmmn, I have come to a conclusion that Vampirism would be a disease if contracted, well actually a Virus.   Well I am not sure, whether it would be a bacteria or a Virus, I mean seriously, look at vampirism.  Is it transferred by blood or not?  That is a good question.  I believe it is, I suppose by the same right that a Vampire transfers it through the transmission of blood, the child of a vampire, conceived after becoming a vampire, would also be a vampire.  Thus Vampirism would have to be a blood virus, most likely in the DNA strand.  Meaning whatever Vampirism is, the Viral strand would be a really screwed up version of HIV.  Or at least have the DNA altering property of HIV.  Which would have to be the case with Lycanthropes of all kinds.    Although the concept of Undead, is a hard one.  I do not believe undeadness could be transferred by blood, it must be a living parasite that causes it.  Undead'ness would be a sort of earthly immortality.  Then the second premise would be, whether or not the Undead could reproduce.  Like what effects would being Undead have on you, it seems to screw you up quite a bit, Vampires and Lycanthropes are not necessarily Undead.  I suppose after a long time of being Undead, your mind would rot, you would lose all concept of time and emotion, and be essentially soulless.   You would be restless on account of your soul wishing to leave your body far before you plan to die.  You would also have an unnaturally long life.  Lets look a little deeper into Undeadness now.  In addition to  Mind Rot , would beauty be preserved, or damned?  That is something that has always bothered me.  I mean you see some undead, and they are hauntingly beautiful, and then sometimes you see this rotting corpse, that doesn't want to let go of life.   Also, how do you kill undead, seriously.  I mean you always see Undead raised from the grave, I suppose in that sense, Undead have no souls, and are simply living flesh, much like the lower species.  So in that case, Undead are expendable...or are they?  The undead raised from the grave would be, and that explains the rot.  I suppose for those still alive, Undead would also be a virus.  Which would only bear the   mind rot   and earthly immortality.  In Conclusion, I gather that you could possibly, if all this was possible, extract the virus from all 3, and in essence contract all three viruses.  I would feel very sorry for the pitiful person that went ahead and pissed you off though.  At night you would become some sort of beast that I wouldn't even mess with.  So on a side note, could any of these coexist with Christianity?  Undead, yes it could, because you could die.  Vampirism, was a little shady for me, until I pulled this verse out of the  New Living Translation     Genesis 9:4    But you must never eat animals that still have their lifeblood in them.    That clearly states taht you may not eat the blood of animals, and nowhere states humans.  Well I was about to take that Verse and run, until I found this one, which saddened me.    Leviticus 3:17     "You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you and all your descendants, wherever they may live."     That in itself, means no blood, ever.  Well from those we know that life is in the blood, and that we shouldn't drink life, in that life is not ours to give and take.  I suppose, in my eyes.  Though I did continue searching for Verses, trying to sort this out.  Back in Moses' time they would have persecuted Vampires.   Levitcus 7:26    Even in your homes, you must never eat the blood of any bird or animal.      Leviticus 7:27     Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from the community."     Hmmn, that also shows that Vampires would not have been well liked either.  For those of you wondering, Leviticus, seemed to be a list of Instructions for Moses to give to the people, not completly laws, but more so guidelines for the people, and more so for the priests so that they would not feel God's retribution when they made sacrifices.  Well some more verses, help show me that it gets deeper so.   Leviticus 17:10-16    10 "And I will turn against anyone, whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you, who eats or drinks blood in any form. I will cut off such a person from the community, 11 for the life of any creature is in its blood. I have given you the blood so you can make atonement for your sins. It is the blood, representing life, that brings you atonement. 12 That is why I said to the Israelites: 'You and the foreigners who live among you must never eat or drink blood.' 13 "And this command applies both to Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. If you go hunting and kill an animal or bird that is approved for eating, you must drain out the blood and cover it with earth. 14 The life of every creature is in the blood. That is why I have told the people of Israel never to eat or drink it, for the life of any bird or animal is in the blood. So whoever eats or drinks blood must be cut off. 15 "And this command also applies both to Israelites and the foreigners living among you.    For a little while here, I will be pulling more verses, I will eventually return to my discussion.   Leviticus 19:26     "Never eat meat that has not been drained of its blood."Do not practice fortune-telling or witchcraft.     Well seeing that none of those 3 viruses would be witchcraft you would be safe there, I suppose if you were any of the 3 you would have to learn to live without blood and develop immunities for the lack thereof, becoming, I suppose another race of men, yet still biologically compatible.   Deuteronomy 12:16    The only restriction is that you are not to eat the blood. You must pour it out on the ground like water.      Deuteronomy 12:23    The only restriction is never to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.      Deuteronomy 12:24     Instead, pour out the blood on the ground like water.     More verses speaking against the drinking/eating of blood. Hmmn, but why, I guess more along the lines of only the Lord has the power of Life in his hands.  Which would also explain the concept of Infertility, and the Lord's role in Conception.    Deuteronomy 12:25     Do not eat the blood; then all will go well with you and your children, because you will be doing what pleases the LORD.     Bingo!!!, That's it, Vampires that drink blood, do not please the Lord, that right there helps explain what I am trying to find.  about 15 verses later God, has finally begun to say why he does not want us to drink their life.  On a side note, it would not be morally right to as a Lycanthrope or a Vampire, to kill "people" in that, that would be murder, which is downtrodden by society, and not looked upon well by the Lord.   Deuteronomy 15:23     But do not eat the blood. You must pour it out on the ground like water.     more of that pouring out the blood like water, but why like water, and why on the ground, perhaps to say, it's life is not in our hands.  We were made from dirt, by our creator, perhaps it would mean, the life of the animal is not our "issue" but simply the issue of the creator.  As for why it is the ground, I have no idea.   1 Samuel 14:32 - 34     32 That evening they flew upon the battle plunder and butchered the sheep, cattle, and calves, but they ate them without draining the blood. 33 Someone reported to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that still has blood in it.""That is very wrong," Saul said. "Find a large stone and roll it over here. 34 Then go out among the troops and tell them, 'Bring the cattle and sheep here to kill them and drain the blood. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.'" So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there.     So I suppose, it would be considered a Sin to Drink blood, which I suppose I understand now, because Life is not ours to give and take.  Hmmn, I wonder if there are more verses to pull.   1 Kings 18:28     So they shouted louder, and following their normal custom, they cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out.     A little Off Topic, but it would show that Indeed, self mutilation is wrong, later in that chapter, God proves himself, and sends fire from heaven, but that is not our topic of discussion.  Ooh ooh, I think I may have found something here of some importance.   Isaiah 66:3    But those who choose their own ways, delighting in their sins, are cursed.    It would appear that God does not smile upon the Drinkers of blood, because that is sin, and I suppose if you continued it would be delighting in sin, and thus Cursed, and not looked upon greatly by the Lord.  So the blood aspect of Vampirism would not be right, so other than that I suppose the Lord would support Vampires. I only have a few more verses coming before I come to a conclusion so hold on.   Ezekiel 33:25    Now give these people this message from the Sovereign LORD: You eat meat with blood in it, you worship idols, and you murder the innocent. Do you really think the land should be yours?      Ezekiel 35:6    As surely as I live, says the Sovereign LORD, since you show no distaste for blood, I will give you a bloodbath of your own. Your turn has come!     Well here, God  seems  to be saying that because you all drink blood, I will shed all your blood.  Maybe, "For you all take life, so I will begin to take your lives."  Still only what I perceive.  Jeese, this next set of verses completely throws me off.   Ezekiel 39:17-22    17 "And now, son of man, call all the birds and wild animals, says the Sovereign LORD. Say to them: Gather together for my great sacrificial feast. Come from far and near to the mountains of Israel, and there eat the flesh and drink the blood! 18 Eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of princes as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and fat young bulls of Bashan! 19 Gorge yourselves with flesh until you are glutted; drink blood until you are drunk. This is the sacrificial feast I have prepared for you. 20 Feast at my banquet table – feast on horses, riders, and valiant warriors, says the Sovereign LORD. 21 "Thus, I will demonstrate my glory among the nations. Everyone will see the punishment I have inflicted on them and the power I have demonstrated. 22 And from that time on the people of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.     That was the punishment, against the armies of Gog and Magog, I suppose that as a whole was saying that the Lord, would take life  en masse  and prove himself, yet again.  Makes you wonder as to when his Enemies would realize that God, and his people are unstoppable.  Though that verse advocates the drinking of man's blood, I suppose that is one of the few times that it was 'ok' to do so.   Zechariah 9:7    7 They will no longer eat meat with blood in it or feed on other forbidden foods. All the surviving Philistines will worship our God and be adopted as a new clan in Judah.  And the Philistines of Ekron will join my people, just as the Jebusites once did.    While here in Zechariah, the time for the drinking is once again over.  So the Lord seemed to allow it but once.  Well here is a twist, look at what he said in Capernum.  If Vampirism also, has spiritual aspects, then I think I have found a way for Vampires to continue to live on in peace.     John 6:53-58    53 So Jesus said again, "I assure you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you. 54 But those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them at the last day. 55 For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. 56 All who eat my flesh and drink my blood remain in me, and I in them. 57 I live by the power of the living Father who sent me; in the same way, those who partake of me will live because of me. 58 I am the true bread from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever and not die as your ancestors did, even though they ate the manna."    Well there you go, Vampires may rejoice in the Lord, and follow him to the ends of the Earth, only in Christ may Vampires be completely free of their need to drink Blood of men, or animals.   Acts 15:17-21    17 so that the rest of humanity might find the Lord, including the Gentiles – all those I have called to be mine. This is what the Lord says, 18 he who made these things known long ago.' 19 And so my judgment is that we should stop troubling the Gentiles who turn to God, 20 except that we should write to them and tell them to abstain from eating meat sacrificed to idols, from sexual immorality, and from consuming blood or eating the meat of strangled animals. 21 For these laws of Moses have been preached in Jewish synagogues in every city on every Sabbath for many generations."    There it is folks, New Testament confirmation, that the Drinking of blood is still not smiled upon by the Lord.  Thought maybe some of you may have wanted to see that.   Acts 21:25     "As for the Gentile Christians, all we ask of them is what we already told them in a letter: They should not eat food offered to idols, nor consume blood, nor eat meat from strangled animals, and they should stay away from all sexual immorality."     It would seem that Vampires that turn to Christ would simply, have to stop consuming blood, they would be fine, and not sinless, but have one less stoppable sin to deal with.   1 Corinthians 11:27     So if anyone eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, that person is guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord.     The Vampires would have to have accepted Christ into their hearts first though.  Which is not hard to do at all, so Vampires would be once again accepted into God's house, with no issues.  Well my more or less short, if you will, study on Vampires, Lycanthropes and Undead, has come to a simple Conclusion as to whether or not they may co-exist with Christianity.  Vampires, would have to give up the drinking of blood, and simply be freed by the Blood of Christ, Lycanthropes would have to give up the eating of blood, and the Undead, would have to realize their own mortality.  Above all, God would accept all 3, and to do so they simply would have to, accept Christ as their Savior, Lord, and Provider and ask Christ to set them free of their sins.  Which is the same for any of us.  Thank you for reading this far.

       Ephesians 6:12    For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms.     As Christians, we have to realize that Men, are not our Enemies, it is Satan, and his legions, not the men that have affiliated with him, either by their own will, or by accidental association.

      You know, any of you that know me are probably annoyed by this question by now.  But here it is.   Can you be both a Vampire and a Lycanthrope at the same time?  like seriously, if so what would happen at night.

So would it have been worth it to think about erasing all this?  and setting time back.....sadly...yes and no.  I have created hell....for myself and more importantly others...why do I waste my time....

      So Saturday night, Ellen and I went to the Emery, Watashi Wa, Mewithoutyou, Anberlin concert.  That rocked hard, I swear.  Emery sounded so clear, I loved it, I kinda only "somewhat" liked them before the concert, and now I absolutely think they rock so hard.  Something about 6 Guys being on stage at once, flailing around, with a full array of instruments, that was awesome.  Watashi Wa, well let's put it this way, they rock so much harder in concert than on the CD's.  The CD's make them seem so.....poppy'ish, in concert it was like whoa, ROCK!!!.  They did some police song, "Message in a Bottle" or something.  Still confused as to when my band, Mewithoutyou, that I went to see would come out.  Halfway into the Watashi Wa thingy, I read a wall thing, that said they were next, and my heart jumped.  Mewithoutyou, was probably my fave band there, they are like the beatles, if they dropped after grunge was the scene :).  Got a nice sound to them.  So they come up, and at the beginning, Aaron is there lying down on the ground, like stretching or sleeping or something, then like he lays there until his part of the song came up, that guy tweaks on stage so much, he RAWKS!!!.  So Bullet to Binary was up first, and the masses moved that mosh pit became so insane, it was funny he was like "so yeah...don't hurt the girls or our synth" :)  Props to all you reading this that attended, no Props to all you that didn't, cept for Chloe cuz she rocks anyways, thanks for believing in me Girl....and yeah you too Janelle :) (thought I forgot about you eh?)  So what about Anberlin, well when they went up ...Ellen and I moved back, so that we wouldn't be stuck in the moshing again :).  Anberlin was really good though, I went in only moderately liking them, and came out loving the sound.  I can't wait to see them again when they come back with the juliana theory.  By the way all Kudo Props to my typing skillz they make me rawk :)

      "  Is "Tourniquet" a cover version?  The song was originally released as "My Tourniquet" by Soul Embraced, a band featuring future Evanescence drummer Rocky Gray.  The version on FALLEN is an adaptation of that original song. "  --  http://Evanescence.com  It's all so strange, i was one day talking about how much they sounded alike, then a while back I found out that Soul Embraced's guitarist/lead vocalist is in Evanescence as their drummer.  Well I guess they inspired evanescence.  this is all so crazy.

      Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY: Tonight on the Jerry Springer show we have a particularly interesting episode! Sean is here to finally confess something to a long-time friend of his Jimmy. So everyone please put your hands together for Sean! Jerry: Okay, now Sean you're here to talk about someone aren't you? You: Yes. Jerry: And what is this other persons name? You: Allie. The crowd SQUEALS with delight. Jerry: Okay, okay, well Allie, is actually here tonight - The crowd SQUEALS. Jerry: But first we have a surprise for you Sean, because as it happens there is someone else here to see YOU! So let's bring out... Tristian! You: What the HELL!!! Out of nowhere you pull out a Flail. Tristian reaches for the Bed. Out of the shadows Kelly appears. Kelly: Wait everybody wait! Jerry: Yes, everybody let's just calm down for a moment here. First tell us why you're here Tristian. Tristian: Because I saw Sean and Kelly making out at Australia! The crowd goes absolutely INSANE. Kelly: That's a lie! I was home watching Charmed! Jerry: (raising his hands) Hold on, hold on, I'm missing the problem here...what exactly IS the problem Tristian? Tristian: Because I've recently been taking part in a sexual relationship with Jimmy who has recently become engaged to Kelly. The crowd hollers, screams and whoops in an orchestra of orgasmic excitement. Jerry: Okay, okay. Well why don't we bring Jimmy out here because Sean had something that they needed to tell them anyway about... Allie that's right! Jimmy: (enters onto stage and saunters over towards you) What's the deal? I saw you outside getting it on with Allie! You know I'm how I feel about Allie!. Kelly: (screams) What? Why the hell did you ask me to marry you if you're in love with Allie! Jimmy: Because I knew that I could never have Allie. But Sean promised me that they'd never hook up out of respect for my feelings! Kelly: What about respect for MY feelings! Tristian walks suddenly across the stage, embracing Jimmy. Tristian: Don't worry baby, you don't need any of them now that you have me. Again the crowd SQUEALS. Kelly: Oh my God! Are you SICK! Kelly runs across the room and wraps their arms around you tightly. Kelly: Sean take me away from all of this! You: You see? That's the thing...I'm...well, I'm married... The crowd does its bit. Kelly: Married? You nod. Kelly: Who the hell are you married to? When...when did this happen? I don't understand! You: The other day. In Vegas. I'm married to Allie. Jimmy: (screaming) WHAT!!! Jerry: (grinning widely, makes an enquiry) So...did you have a nice wedding night? Allie: (stepping back out onto center stage) Well we had sex 8 times if that's what you mean. The crowd squeals. Jerry: Okay, okay. So let me get this all straight... Sean is married to Allie who Jimmy has secretly been in love with for years and years. Now Jimmy has recently become engaged to Kelly who was recently spotted kissing Sean in the Australia. Now on top of this Tristian has just admitted to being in a sexual relationship with Jimmy. Allie: That's right Jerry. Jerry: (looking sternly into the camera) It is times like these that one has to wonder, whether or not these people are aware that they are quite clinically insane. Perhaps we should be spending more on psychiatric health funds in this country, perhaps we should just ban Vegas to cut down on impulse marriages. Perhaps I should get a new job. Thanks for watching folks it's been great but for now...it's goodnight. Queue cheesy background music and fade to black.

Bryan Free, had the whole gothic eerie, wailing voices going on, it was pretty tight.  Locust Street Taxi, that was awsome it was like insane comedy + a concert.  Joy Electric, or rather Joy E. Was pretty awsome, kinda sad that his stuff crapped out on him half into it, so he had to go into Joy E. unplugged, which was pretty awesome, talking about life, love, faith, God, his mom, his wife...etc. ie: the good stuff

      Well these, next few weeks are going to be chaotic for me, scrambling to get money to pay for college.  Any donations would be greatly welcomed.  Apparently the National guard will pay $30,000 for tuition.  I was looking at a poster today in the hall way, it would give me a chance to become someone for a change, and do something to help someone.  I might run it past my parents later.  I really don't want to join the military, no anti-american military sentiments here, it's just that...I don't want to be tied down like that.  I don't want the power of life and death, as it is, I have been teetering it lately myself.  My neighbour just killed herself, 30 years old, I never met the woman.  2 children.  It's a little morbid even for me, I know I am one to commonly joke about death.   Never had someone, literally "close" to me commit suicide.  I mean she lived 2 houses down, we been living next to eachother for 5 years, never met the family at all.  Makes you put everything in context I suppose.

Jaded, lost and shattered, broken, beat and tattered,  eyes that can burn no longer,  wings that beat no more,  burn these angels,  adorn my crown with their embers,  my throat choking down, on their ashes,   Il faut que je perde mon vie,  Il faut que j'oubli ma douleur,  coals, pressed upon my lips,   and I saw what I had brought upon myself, (useless sacrifice)  inside of me,  i have died today and ,  inside me i've gone another way, toxic feelings, rip apart my skull, useless beatings, down into the ground I fall,  wasted emotions.

      I have all day to write that song.  I screwed it up bad, and naturally I have noone on earth to fall to.  Though I planned for that, I guess I am sadistic.  I know what I am already, proud of it...not really, but it's who I am.  What i love is when the rules are layed, and at the end of the game, people sit there and wonder "why did I lose."  I say it's because they don't understand the game, others would take pity.   I am one of those that would say they don't understand, and try to teach them.  Who am I fooling, when every bite I take, every thing I drink, tastes of ash.   Something has died/burned inside of me.  What I love is how they view me as all together, I know I'm not, so i don't show the side of me, that isn't all together.  I still am torn, but why show the torn side? Why sulk amongst others like you lacking what you all need.  Denial, denial...let's get something straight here.  Looking back at it, thanks to retrospect, I never felt anything for any of them...except 1, only 1 had something they didn't, and I screwed that up.  It's not the manipulation where i get off, nor the control issue, it's the concept of destruction.  Knowing that somehow, more anguish exists than you alone can handle.  No meaning, meaningless, to be honest life is meaningless, it's what you do in life that means something.  Though jusn't the end justify the means, or rather creation being simply destruction.  I love how I could manipulate my own emotions, I get the most joy out of that, telling myself what I feel, and what I don't feel.  Living....what is this living, success is all that matters...it drives me....so I am told. So why do I take what they give me, why do I put up with it.   I am sadistic, i have been told that.  I begin to love my madness more so on account of the fact that I know how all of this started.  I was forced to care.  Understand emotions, that's completly an issue in itself, it's not that i don't care, or that worry about being hurt, more along the lines of, I will eventually hurt everyone I know, at least once really badly.  I induced it on a couple people, so they woudln't get it later on....it's those who have been through hell with me, that I understand the most.  Hypocrisy, my foul mistress, ...my hands have frozen, I can't continue here.  regret, anguish, pain, suffering, weakness...that's what i am.  I feed off of it, you are what you eat, and I devour, so there.  I pull it out of people, they begin to fear those emotions, and what am i left with, their emotions, and they....free of them..temporarily.  Is it that bad.  Fear of being hurt, there is a good one, of course I fear it, I am human, that kind of thing is natural to me.  Jealousy, there is a great emotion, people often confuse my angst with jealousy.  And my willingness to care, as harassment.  What have I become, what am I these days.  All this because a little boy i used to know.  his parents were too busy for him, constantly doing things, and sending him places.  This boy had no monitoring from his parents, even though they loved him.  He was plagued with nightmares, and would scream himself to sleep, so I remember.  i took this boy in, too bad that boy died.  He was troubled, and had no purpose in life.  He was twisted, all he could look up to were his catholic faith, paganistic attractions, tales from the crypt, and corrupted views on paranormal and supernatural.  That boy grew up, and was bullied in school, thrown around and tormented.  I watched that kid, unable to help him, and he cried to me everynight, and there was nothing i could do.  He got into the occult, and used that as a crutch, messing with things he didn't understand, little did he know that the rest of his short life he would be tormented by them.  He eventually began to like pain, and began looking up and trying to understand, what caused pain, blood and anguish.  No one was there to oversee him, or to watch over him.  He delved deep into the world of supernatural and paranormal.  A child who wanted so badly to exorcise.  He finally snapped, those who tormented him, he waited, until they came at him, he threw them back, he fought with such anger, such angst.  In the end it was him who was sent to counselling, him who was calmed down, it was him who had problems.  He was held back academically by both his school and his parent.  he continued diving deeper into the world he weaved.  Stilll plagued by nightmares he continued.  His father moved away, and someone he never really new died.  He then moved far away in hopes of starting over again, although nothing changed everything was the same, he was still the one they would torment.  He eventually met a girl, who set him free, she understood him, and wanted only that he would be happy, too bad she lost him.  Time went on and he looked for her 5 or 6 more times, and didn't find her, he was lost, with no one to turn to.  And I simply watched.  He began to pass time hurting people, in his own anguish, to elevate himself.  Then one came to him, one like no other.  He helped that one, and that one he.  They developed a bond, a binding, and nothing could stop them.  Inside he was torn up knowing that he would never be accepted, so he hid what they knew as himself and showed a diferent form, his pain ridden anguish laden side, there would be no pity for him.  He saw an opening, took that one's advice, and shot at the very stars that guided him.  He wounded visibly wounded 2, even though in reality it was 4 who fell.  He had failed, and had lost his purpose.  He tried to understand that one, but had lost his chances, asking only for a possiblity to do so, he waivered.  Clipped at the wings he fell, alone, broken, he tried turning to the one, ...but she wasn't there this time, he had exhausted his surplus of comrades, and lost everything.  That boy died.  Now I live his life for him, fixing what he had messed up, hoping to get some purpose.  In other words, i am taking responsibilty for what hell I have caused, I looked back at my life and saw how pointless it was, and will now go on life, revitalized and with some purpose, in other words...I'm sorry.

      .....so here it is.  I admit, i'm sadistic, I breathe hell on people.  Can I blame myself though, caring compassionate.....it's weakness in me, I can only be strong.  Too long was I held back, controlled, manipulated by people who loved me.  Love...there we go there is something that doesn't exist in today's society.  By the time I am finished here I will regret what I say.   Beasts hand in hand, blades splattered in blood, devouring, hunger, yearning, expression

      Dream last night was really odd, this girl and I were killing people.  Then it got stranger and stranger she was gorgeous and all, but it was incredibly strange.   I think we were eating something...probably the people.  There were 3 creatures, 2 of which shared a symbiotic relationship.  There was also a centaur...many centaurs.  Lots of arrows, I could feel the arrows flying.  War...I felt war.  Of those 3 creatures, one was scraggly, yet it was apparent it had a strong build,  the other next to it was bigger, and obviously stronger.   As for the third creature, all i felt was the essence of Woman, it had a Jewel (dark crimson red...or was it blue) in the center of it's chest, or was it it's head, and had strange runic, ley line, like plating on it, but it seemed like gilding, minus the armor, and simply the gilding.  The girl and i killed and killed and killed, it was a movie.....or was it, i couldn't tell.  There was this house...2 stories, surrounded by grass, it was either late night or middle of the afternoon, it happened 2 times, still not sure what time of day it was she went in, I was to follow inside was this sort of demonic beast, I believe.  It tried to kill me, it terrified me...it terrified me.  As for those arrows, I felt I was directing all those arrows, I could feel where they were to fall, and them flying.  That beast was foul, all around, gave off this feeling of "Foul."  Also there was a strange side menu system going on that,... had some sort of character generation going on.  Name Power ?#? ?Beauty ?#? ????? ????? Points ?#? Options ?#?  -----------------  There were also some of the options listed...i can't remember names but what they looked like and what they did.  They were like ...I guess the "wildcard" innate ability the creatures could have  |    Some sort of Electric Gem    |    Some sort of shining thing with a jewel..apparently Mind control    |    A red jewel, that I guess had some strange...strength power    |  You could choose the character, Options, I guess equipment as well.  Then there were strange sprite versions of it, where you could choose beauty characteristics, and pump points or some thing into changing appearance and statistics.  The larger creature could...attack, the smaller one could drain life force...to ...boost the stronger one.  I think.

      Perhaps a film...A Bloodless, Violence free, Sex free, Vampire film?  Could I do it? possibly, Should I?...most likely.  But it won't be simple seeing that that sort of thing is not looked upon highly here in America.  Everyone here seems to like films with gratuitous nudity, and things of the such realm.  I will steer clear of soap opera set ups, and will stay away from audultry and what not.  How can one go about making a film about Vampires, and still support what one believes in.  Such are the toils of my beliefs.  This would have to almost be opposite to any vampire film made today, all of them are put in the vile crude neo-technica set up, in some either far future/far past place with hints of film noirs in every aspect, can't we steer away from that? Doesn't that get old?  Don't get me wrong i'm a huge Giger/Carot fan and what not, so I totally understand what's happening.  Just come on people cannot we have something different?

      You ever notice that thing where some girls have that really shiny, either straight or curly hair.  No matter what it is, it somehow happens to be shiny, and silky looking.  I can tell you this, it's not Pantene doing it or Herbal Essences, I bet it's some sort of corporate takeover.  But seriously it must be some sort of friggin ploy.  Because out here in Clark County, I never see that that often with NORMAL people under the age of 17.  It must be some sort of silk gland in the follicles or something because seriously, I have no idea what in the hell is going on.

      So Dave, Ditched us to hang with Britney and Amanda, I sure hope they were really hot, and some how really good attitudes to this sort of thing.  I sure hope that some how....He got something better out of that.  Me on the other hand was trapped in my car as it was attacked by Garett, Diana, Tiffany, and Sierra.  It was so weird.  They came at me with Airsoft guns, I'm fine I only got pegged a couple times in the side, I should be ok...I suppose.  My glass is chipped as hell

      So I get to school this morning and I have to park at the bloody Portal THE PORTAL, I love the place, but I have to park 6 blocks away from the college what is up with that?  English in like what, 1 hr here, I need something to do.  Had another one of them there, Philly Cheese Steaks, they are awesome fun.  That bloody hang nail is driving me mad.  So I ordered all the Our Lady Peace CDs in hope that maybe one could make me smile "The world's a subway, a subway, aieeeeeeeeee, the world's a subway, subway, aieeee"

You See the Riven from Clive Barker's work strongly resembles the Kyoso no oni, but its not I was not sure which to have in a game, so i decided why not both, I mean they both are incrdibly attractive looking demon things, one machine and the other...well 100% demon, but yeah What if they made a "Crimson Sea meets FF meets Kingdom Hearts meets Evangelion meets Sailor moon meets Princess mononoke"'ish game with those two lovely ladies (Riven and Kyoso No Oni) as the main characters, maybe a story about their....quest for power and something about trying to find some artifact that makes them human so that they can pass as marketing consultants for Mc Donalds' sister corporation and the lesser known Mark Donnahue's (Which Serves deep fried ice cream, dont forget these girls are demons, and have many insurance companies and Catholic priests and Witch hunters and demon slayers and disgruntled attorneys on their tails searching for them).

      I would like to dedicate this post first to a special someone.  I wil dedicate it now, because that way I know I have it out of the way now.  3, 2, 1 here we go.  I drove to school today, hoping that something might be different for a change, I am looking for something new this quarter.  You know how some tribes used to burn away chaff, to let the new growth rise from the flames of pheonixica.  Though some how I wonder myself, have I burned away friendships I don't need, either willingly or passively.  I think I may have.  I look deep into the black's of  the eyes of people that I know, and I almost non chalently utter to myself, is this the end?

      I kind of wonder sometimes, where is my life going.  are the decisions that i have made really good decisions?  Did I do what i was supposed to do, i mean i see every situation as a jumping off point, so everything just gets deeper as we continue.  Why did i spend my life indoors as opposed to outside, why do i want people to both love and fear me?  The music I listen to, who gave me that standard, have I actually done anythign for myself?  The people i know, who gave them to me, did I force my way to them, or did they follow me?

      Have you ever met anyone and thought: Ooh, they're a bit strange?  Yeah and oddly enough it was Avril Lavigne.  She came to one of my shows and we met backstage and I thought she was very, very strange, because she really doesn't have anyone babysitting her.  There weren't any bodyguards and I don't know whether that was impressive because she was indepedent, or strange because she doesn't know that somebody might kidnap her, cut of her toes, and sell them to someone like me on E-bay.  I found her to be nice... but strange.   -- Manson Concerning Avril Lavigne

      " THE BIG EMPTY  Opens  November 21, 2003   John Person (Jon Favreau) is a 30-something struggling actor living alone and facing eviction from his one room apartment in Hollywood. Behind on his rent and heavily in debt, he goes against his better judgment- and that of his pretty neighbor Grace (Joey Lauren Adams)- and accepts an unsolicited offer from his strange neighbor Neely (Bud Cort) to courier a blue suitcase up to the desert truck stop of Baker, California. There, in the middle of nowhere, at a seedy motel in the shadow of The World's Largest Thermometer, he'll simply deliver the locked suitcase to a trucker called Cowboy (Sean Bean) and be paid twenty-seven thousand dollars in cold, hard cash. Seems like it’s easy money. But then John's given a loaded gun and told he must defend the blue suitcase with his life.   On arrival in Baker, he discovers he's already missed the mysterious man and soon he's reluctantly mixed up with young local vixen Ruthie (Rachael Leigh Cook), her mother Stella (Darryl Hannah), Ruthie’s hot-headed jealous boyfriend Randy (Adam Beach) and paranoid, alien-obsessed locals.    When special agent Banks (Kelsey Grammer) arrives at the local watering hole to question him about the murder and decapitation of his strange neighbor and hundreds of people recently gone missing, John realizes that he might be mixed up in something much more dangerous and bizarre than he ever imagined. Nothing is ever easy. Later that dark night, Cowboy violently appears and John finds himself caught somewhere between the surreal, the supernatural and the just plain weird. And when the final showdown begins, John is faced with a choice that could change his life forever. Has this whole town gone mad? Or are the loony locals, who John dismissed as being crazy, the only sane things about this strange parallel universe called The Big Empty? "

Am I wasting my time on thoughts that would never follow through, am I merely experiencing adolescence, or am I just dealing with things that never should.  Help is always nice, a new life...that could be good too, but no i don't wnat to start over, I have already been through all this.

      " MACAULAY Culkin had to teach Marilyn Manson to smoke for his role as transvestite entertainer Christina in "Party Monster," the Sundance film about club-kid killer Michael Alig. "We were shooting in a nasty neighborhood in Brooklyn and Mac takes Marilyn to the local bodega to get a pack of Virginia Slims and shows him how to smoke a cigarette," co-director Fenton Bailey told The Post's Megan Turner. "It was such an interesting role reversal - the 'Home Alone' kid corrupting the Anti-Christ Superstar." "   really weird, that he had not smoked yet...so weird

      " Your career profile shows you are an Entrepreneur. As an Entrepreneur, you have excellent analytical abilities and are a great strategic thinker. You are normally easy-going, objective, and seldom critical. You can succeed in nearly any occupation you choose, as long as it doesn't involve too much monotonous routine, at which point you likely become restless. You desire independence, diversity, plenty of intellectual stimulation, and the opportunity to generate ideas. You must find your work challenging to be satisfying. Since you can be impatient with others whom you consider less competent then you, you need to be surrounded by very capable supervisors, colleagues, and employees. "

      Oh Noble masses,  Listen unto my utterings.  No longer will thee be under the fierce rule of those who control ye. Nor will thy ways be tainted by that of the north, the agressors of the east, or the onslaught that hails from the south.  Follow me, under my standards of pain, and technocracy and we shall rise above that which has pulled us down so far in our millennial trek forward.  People I beg of you, to drop those affiliations with the corporate syndicates, and with me you shall find security, the fallacies of the masses will shelter you no more, as they cannot even hold their own fatal gasps of air.  Can you ever open the eyes, and notice that we are only bombarded by their relentless assault unto our virgin flesh, our carnality stripped away by the only senses of dignity that we care to amass.  Gather forth thy munitions for this is no longer a battle of wits, a battle of minds, it has come to what it is.  A bloodless slaughter of millions, only in Blood shed is their forgiveness, for the next era, it will be stained with blood.  Tomorrow we shall achieve greatness, though for tonight my Brethren, we feed.

      If you saw me right now this is what you would see on the outside:  Black hair, half curled, half spiked Glasses, not cleaned this morning Black LA Kings Tshirt, Faded Some sony streetstyle headphones, another set of ear phones, via Sennheiser Some faded Khakis,  Internally this is what you wouldn't see:  an emotionally broken young man a shattered heart  What I am doing about all this:  for the last 2 weeks....i haven't gotten around to reading my bible, just feel like I'm slipping away...what started it? Lethargic nature.  This is so ridiculous...I will never understand any of this...until sunday...beyond God, and School, the only other thing that I had to turn to was Sherah....things are kinda rough with her right now...so all I have now is...well yeah my Manson cd.....guess it's time to turn back to God.  Lighter notes: "I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you,          don't say no, just say now" I got my tuition paid up on...so it looks like...first year should be good :)  Questions for life:..  janelle where did we go? Katrina...you know we still need eachother saffron...do you even read this? ...me.....me

      Well everything has been going weird...losing somethign I didn't realize that I cherished as much as I do.  The vampire underground. and listening to my Manson CD a WHOLE lot more.  Everything is so messed up....I feel like mashing up some lyrics...make some weird song.....I did that with Hilary Duff, Manson, and Aaron Weiss once....let's do this again.   Agony  featuring   Marilyn Manson, Mae ...and  Green Day    Do you have the time To listen to me whine? About nothing and everything all at once I am one of the those Melodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone No doubt about it  Don't fake yourself into ever, ever thinking about yesterday. That was then, this is now. Don't call it undone. Don't take what you've been dealt. You can exit out the back and make your getaway before anyone can see the damage you have done.  I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  I don't want to be like anyone else  I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  I don't want even be myself   Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid? I'm just stoned  State your case. You've got everyone's attention. What can you say? Thanks or forget what you've been given. Take your place. Do you think that you deserve the best of everything? We don't get why you're here. Can you figure it out? And now it's "you know who" I got the "you know what" I stick it "you know where" You know why, you don't care. And now it's "you know who" I got the "you know what" I stick it "you know where" You know why, you don't care.  No time to search the world around Cause you know where I'll be found When I come around  We're the low Art Gloominati, and we aim to depress  The scabaret sacrilegends   So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind.  Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.  Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.  For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.   You've got to get away. Oh, I get lost in the thought of losing you. You've got to get away. I know it's a dream but it must be true. Wave now goodbye. It's the lesson that you've been given. You can always move on to better things.  pledge allegiance to the underworld One nation under dog There of which I stand alone A face in the crowd Unsung, against the mold Without a doubt Singled out The only way I know

      I Suppose I better start ...working on my own Vampire house of Neo-Vampirism.  making me umm...the...leader of this group.  So here it goes.  House Technocracy.  So far we have but one member, Sean....being Eclectic...yet common enough in our House, infact both the mass majority and the mass minority, this is him.  Type: Requiem Description: Carnality is key here, they feed off the carnal nature of themselves and others.  They also feed on emotions, which they have to pull via a direct sympathetic, empathetic, or physical link to someone who holds them in some importance.  Innate ability to flip negative energy into a feeding point.  Tendency to go as far as to create Negative situations to feed.

Won't let me join..maybe I'm too weird....damn it.  Well I guess I will have to read my text books again, and get a wave of Neo-Vampirism started...how to begin...I read through all that.....that is all too vague, nonetheless, as a prominent Vampire House I suppose I will have to accept the fact that I am probably a Vampire....Negative Energy feeding Vampire....or somethign....Quotey Quotey time.  " Unfortunately, negative feeding vampires are very misunderstood and discriminated against, even within the vampiric communities. " Damn it.....Discriminated against....lol, they always try to get me.  " Negative vampires are more quiet, less social, and aggressive; they may be seen as, brooding.  " Correct again...dang it....they are stalking me I swear.  " Positively charged vampires are drawn to situations where there are positive energy flows, negatives to negative and so on. While as a sentient being, an individual has a choice in their actions, we as vampires also have an inherent nature to fulfill our energy needs in the method most beneficial to our make-up. "  " It is something in which the individual has no choice, they are born that way. "  " In situations where there is an underlying current of mixed energies, vampires tend to act as catalyst in bringing out, or to the surface, the energy type of their designation. Positively charged vampires draw positive feelings as an emotional energy interaction from those around them – negatives draw negative emotional energy, and so forth. Even when there is no interaction to create the event, by the vampire drawing the emotional energy, the apparent catalyst affect is still present. This accounts for the reason why some feel that they are constantly floating in a pool of goodwill while others find themselves at ground zero for various types of conflict.  "  That would explain why people think I am ..morbid...or weird?  " biblical “Golden Rule” and Wiccan “Rede” are two such classic examples that been handed down throughout history. Each of these declares that it is morally unjust to do harm to one’s fellow man, especially for the circumstance of personal gain. Vampires of any energy orientation that deliberately manipulate a situation, to their own gain, are guilty of such a morality violation. This applies to all vampires, positive, neutral and negative. "  So my manipulative nature...is coming out...are Vampires naturally sadistic?  " A BLACK SWAN is a person, who is not a vampire, but loves, supports, and helps to protect those of us that are. There is an innate quality about the black swan that draws them to a vampire and a vampire to them.   The opposite of this is the White Swan. Most often, a white swan is a religious person who feels the need to cause trouble. "  Guess that would make Sarah ...a Black Swan  " The second one, dubbed a 'leech' or 'parasite' within the community draws their energies by literally causing harm, mentally, emotionally and, in some cases, physically. The greater majority of the vampire community tries to distance themselves from this latter type of negative energy feeder.   I must take the time to note for you, again, that MOST negative feeding vampires DO NOT create a chaos of negative energies to feed from. They simply draw from the already plentiful negative energies around the globe.  "  Anyone tell you..that I am NEVER the "most" of any group  " Here are some of the common symptoms associated with vampirism... Migraines (from which I suffer), lethargy, insomnia (the reverse is true in some vampires... narcolepsy), depression, obsessive/compulsive disorder, hypersensitivity when it comes to emotions and emotional situations, hypersensitivity to sunlight (some have surmised that this is due to a vampire's innate talents to sense energies around them... and boy does the sun give off with the energies!!!), and last, but certainly not least, an undeniable 'hunger'/'thirst' for something other than normal foods...  "  Once again...I suffer from something.  damnit....bloody Vampires....well i guess..I accept it. :)   So let's see what Types of Vampire that I am.  " Sanguinary  The most widely known, but also the most widely misunderstood of the feeding types... Being falsely dubbed as 'psy-vamps on training wheels' or some other such nonsense, this is, of course, a blood feeder, a person who can pull their much needed energies from a physical source   Psychic  This type of vampire must feed on the ambient energies given off by all living entities, yet others, feed through a direct link. They must have this direct link in order to draw in their much needed energies.   Pranic  This type of vampire, though touch-based and physical, like the sanguinary when attaining the energies they need, derive their much needed energies from all of the dense prana energies given off by the body, including sexual contact. The difference between the Pranic and Sanguinary vampire is that a true sanguinary only draws their energy from the blood.   Elemental  Most feed on the elements of fire, water and wind, due to the difficulty most have when attempting to feed from the prime element of the Earth. They can tap into the 'para-elementals' of plant-life (IE trees, grass, bushes and house plants), but for some reason dirt, rocks and gemstones elude them.   Empathic  This feeder pulls their much needed energies from the emotional energies given off. Most of this is ambient emotional energy, however, some, as with psychic feeders, must establish a direct link in order to do this.   Negative  Most of these vampires feed on the ambient negative energies prevalent in the world around them each and every day. They hold an innate ability within themselves to flip this energy to a 'positive' feed for THEM. HOWEVER, there are negative feeders that will CREATE VERY negative situations in order to feed. These beings have been dubbed by many within the vampire community as 'psychic leeches' due to their obvious hazardous nature.   Eclectic  These vampires have awakened with the need for multiple sources of energy to maintain their already precarious balance of energies. This distinctive nature gives them some obvious advantages, like the capability of drawing from many sources instead of being locked into just one and having to adapt to others. The drawback to this, is that sooner or later, if they do not maintain a semblance of balance in these feeds, they, too, will feel the same side effects any other vampire would not feeding.   Adaptive  These vampires, through necessity, such as the lack of a donor for a sanguine vampire, have 'adapted' to other feedings in order to attain their much needed energies. However, there is a slight drawback. Adaptive feeders must return to their primary feed sooner or later. The primary feed implies the source of energy that was needed when the vampire first awakened.  "     By Definition then I am Eclectic...I AM ECLECTIC. Psychic (direct link), Pranic (the carnal part only), Empatic (direct link), Negative (Psychic Leech). I suppose...I am overall...even a reject in the bloody vampire society....crap.   Before I Continue to delve, I have to dispel this first.  " Severe/deadly reaction to silver, severe/deadly reaction to garlic, adverse reaction to holy symbols/holy ground/holy water, people of faith cause pain and/or suffering, sunlight is lethal, Cain is the father of all vampires, Lilith is the mother of all vampires, and vampires must sleep in coffins or possess earth from their homelands in order to rest.  "  ok back to what I was saying.  Scroll up to read what I was saying.

      The House of Mystic echoes is convinced that I am a vampire but am I?  I suddenly for no reason had some obsession with Romanians. Vlad the Impaler was Romanian. Vlad was also the first Dracula count. I wear a Romanian Track jacket go figure.  ...I am plagued by nightmares, I barely remember somedays, I don't show up in pictures (all that often), no one REALLY knows anything about me, I know things for no reason....in strange ways (call it intuition),  as of last night I found out that people noticed I have fang like hooked teeth, in the "right places".  The House of Mystic Echoes claims that im a negative energy feeding psychic vampire.....just exactly what some people call me anyways.  Maybe i am, maybe I'm not...i just know that I AM human, I have RED blood last time I checked.  Sherah and Mary thought that I might be...but no I'm not...I don't think.

      Ashes.....bloody ashes.  You know how long that takes to drain out of your throat?  Too damned long...it still lingers there for me.  Blood and Ash....."Ashen Blood"?...no Blood and Ash..that's my life story.  Yesterday was probably the most screwed up day of my life.  Let's examine my life.  Let's look at the girls that I have hung out with....all the same though...ALL the SAME!!!!  Always living with some other branch of family, OR older family.  Always some huge age gap between siblings, always far out there.  Something is always weird, they are almost always somewhat charged in areas.....and what not...something isn't right though...i don't go to them..they go to me.  As soon as all this started with her, it ended...what the hell was I thinking I knew better, I KNEW BETTER.

Ever wonder what effects that has on you?  You know what I love, Ironic Hypocrisy.   Example A : Someone claims you're harassing them, you leave them alone for 3 yrs, in fact they are out of your mind, then they approach you, cuss you out, then claim that you are still harassing them.   Example B : You give someone space, and they get pissed off at you.   Example C : You sacrifice what's the dearest, to save what means nothing   Example D : You are broke because you are spending money, to impress the girlfriend you don't need   Example E : You say Damn, and someone beats the crap out of you

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time  Everything is 3D blasphemy  My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up  This is not the way I pictured me  I CAN'T CONTROL MY SHAKES!  How the hell did I get here?  Something about this, so very wrong...  I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this  Is it a dream or a memory?   GET OUTTA MY HEAD CUZ I DON'T NEED THIS!  Why I didn't I see this?  I'm a victim - Manchurian Candidate  I - HAVE - SINNED - BY - JUST  Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away   GOODBYE!   You haven't learned a thing  I haven't changed a thing  My flesh was in my bones  The pain was always free   I've felt the hate rise up in me...  Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...

This goes out to you:  To you who stood by me, to you who somehow dealt with me, you were one of the only ones that understood, you were the only one who knew how I felt,  when I would look around, everyone was gone,    Sorry Everyone...but im getting teary-eyed I cannot finish that.  Katrina has really been a dear, and yeah I like knowing her, and knowing I can lean on her here and there, lay in her arms knowing that she will somehow point me somewhere, lol or give me the change to prod someone to point me there ;)...I love her deeply....as a friend I suppose

He kept on repeating, "america has wronged us, in a very evil way , their punishment shall be grave" he said that at least 15 times, then at one point, all the several million people in the room began to chant and pump their fist in the air.  They didn't seem too pleased.  Then after that he said that if they (we) come near their holy cities anymore, they will all become martyrs.  He said peace no more than once in that whole speech/war sermon, it was something like, "we must be left alone to make our own peace".....I have never seen so many people, so much hate.  I was watching it, how it seemed they all had hate on them.....lebanon....

      Laugh...it's funny as hell...I dunno, I barely understand myself.  Maybe it's cuz I am a guy or something, ....All I have to say is..I don't go around groping girls.  Bloody Hell.  I guess on Friday I am going to see a movie.  Or somethign.  I feel awfully pissed off.  I think I pissed off Bonnie, and the fact that I cannot get into my Gmail account is pissing the hell out of me...grrr.  At my highschool, I used to be a "good" Kid, and like "Marilyn manson ate my Girlfriend" was one of my favorite songs.  Well look where I am now...a complete one eighty, and why? ...All in the name of glory, the crazy things I would do to get recognition.  Now look at me, I embraced my darker nature, and look at me.  Marilyn Manson fan and what not..seeya

      So I thought I might do a couple liner post...brb  Yeah that song "Don't Tell Me" should be able to work, I wonder if Bonnie Digs it?..I should have her take a listen...If I can actually rout it to her in some way or another.  Why do I have some weird idea, that she may or may not be reading this site. I also decided that I ought to start acting how I would like to be treated...  It was weird to find out I met Steiger's younger sister....lol I thought she seemed weirdly familiar...weirder yet, I remember Lucas talking about her back in the day.  Really weird...come to think of it.  About ....2 yrs ago...when she was 12.....whoa...lol I feel so old....but not ...know what I mean?  (By the way, I got Mexican Wine, stuck in my head)  It's such a great song, the chord progression, and their voice is hypnotic...I suppose a great song.  Enthralling.  well I got a Cover for my Next CD.  It will be called "Life Amongst the Stars".  Enlisting the help of some more commonly known musicians..possibly.  Prayer by Disturbed, great song  It pisses me off so much though.  I am in a nation of tolerance, being politically correct, screw the politically correct masses.  I refuse to conform, look at that, you got all these people in my class support Gay marriage, I say ..to hell with it, and that institution, It's a sick institution, Men and Women were created for eachother, it's how we got so far advanced, Men and Women joined to have more men and women, not Men knowing Men.  Screw this Hell, once again, if I didn't mind having a record, I would make such a demonstration, in opposition to Gay Marriage.....I dont think it should be recognized legally at all, It goes against Biblical standards and morals.  One by one they strip away our foundation, well to hell with  it....they will feel my pain one day.....

      I guess I could preface this by saying that the song "Wait and Bleed" by Slipknot is a VERY good song...I am hoping the new Demonhunter is this good....as they are often compared.  You know what I am saying?  So let's see how my life is going.   Girl mad at me for not telling her that I was moving  Well maybe it happens for everyone, well a friend of mine just got pregnant.....hmmmn  I am thought to be a womanizer, lol, If Janelle only knew what I was hiding in all my gibberish.  I would tell right now, but chances are she may read this...So I will wait and tell her first.  and this is what she will say: "Sean, you are full of it, you are just BS'ing your way out of something...etc."  Btw that Avril LaVigne song, "Don't tell me" is a great song.  I really like it.  It's going to be my song...for a while ...I like it.

      Looks as though my mother is taking an interest into what I am into.  They are going to be examening every facet of my life, and throwing every bit of it back at me it seems.  Every CD they own they are going to Raid, every game I own, every movie I own...every bit of my existence, and they will have no mercy.  This sucks.  I guess I have to be obedient I suppose.

      Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one living in side of me.  Because last night I had myself under control...or did I.  At some moments I knew I could stop...but what kept me going...I'm not quite sure.  Like sometimes I wanted to stop...but couldn't...I didn't feel that it was over.  Like when the maniacal laughter started, and the rapid feral breathing....I couldn't stop it...and the burning of my eyes, and the splitting headache....it's not really a blur to me, I can remember it pretty well.

      Push my fingers into my eyes...  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...  But it's made of all the things I am today...  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...  If the pain goes on...  Aaaaaaaah!   I have screamed until my veins collapsed  I've waited last, my time's elapsed  Now, All I do is live with so much fate  I've wished for this, I've bitched at that  I've left behind this little fact:  You cannot kill what you did not create  I've gotta say what I've gotta say  And then I swear I'll go away  But I can't promise you'll enjoy the words  I guess I'll save the best for last  My future seems like on big past  You'll live with me 'cause you left me no choice   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!   Pull me back together  Or separate the skin from the bone  Leave me all the Pieces, and then you can leave me  alone  Tell me the reality is better than dream  But I found out the hard way,  Nothing is what it seems!   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  But it's made of all the thing I am today  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!   All I've got...all I've got is insane...  All I've got...all I've got is insane...  All I've got...all I've got is insane!  All I've got...all I've got is insane!   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  But it's made of all the thing I am today  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!

       Song:  All Downhere from Here  Artist:  New Found Glory     You're hiding something cuz it's burning through your eyes I try to get it out but all I hear from you are lies And I can tell you're going through the motions I figured you were acting out your part Once again we're playin off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end?  Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it's all downhill from here And it's all downhill from here  Your good intentions slowly turned to bitterness Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss And I can tell you're going through the motions I figured you were acting out your part Once again we're playin off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end?  Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it's all downhill from here And it's all downhill from here  And I cant believe you pulled it off again Im running, still it all sets in You'll deny it till you're at your bitter end And I can tell you're going through the motions I figured you were acting out your part Once again we're playing off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end?  Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it's all downhill from here And it's all downhill from here  And you keep pulling me.. Down, pulling me down, pulling me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it's all downhill from here And it's all downhill from here

      Well my daddy and I just saw Big Fish.  I had been waiting a while to see it, and wanted to see it with him.  So that followed through, made me really happy that we could spend some time together.  I really don't know what turns life may have for me, you know what I am saying.  I could go anywhere, do anything, be anyone I wanted to.  My eyes are almost open again.  I never really had thought about marriage before in my life.  Never understood the pressure of it, what it meant or why.  We just had a huge teaching on it at my church, and, I got to see an old friend get married.  The first Marriage I had ever attended.  It kind of changed me.  I am thinking a little more about the future, and about how I will walk in the footsteps God intended, I had made a lot of mistakes, but I suppose it takes only so many detours before we realize, we are headed in the same direction, regardless of the fact that we have so much dear sweet, free will.  I kind of miss and don't miss the paigns of highschool.  I am glad they are over.  I am sad to see though, that some of my best times however, were spent in the company of those that care not about me now.  Janelle, why did I put so much emphasis on her, I wanted a friendship that would last.  I suppose, I was wasting her time.  How much changed between a party last year and this year.  Both times I was alienated, last time I didn't know her, this time, she didn't know me.  We always would miss eachother on some level.  Any stability was way too temporary, I miss that girl's friendship.  I suppose I could whine for all my life, or I could let her come back to me.  Or vice versa.  Either way, one of us will return to the other, if not.  Hell has begun.

      "only the good boys, can get what they are coming for....get what they came here for"  I guess all these days apart from Janelle has taught me something.  Friends are indeed just enemies with out the guts or means to stab you in the back.  The first chance I got, they turned on me.  One day I will show the world, one day.  Kelsey, Augustus, Walter, Natasha, Saffron, Dave, Samantha, and let's not forget Dave.  That's my crew...oh and Julie.  That's my crew, we hang with eachother, and watch backs.

      Well that would be a weird enough title for the night.  Ok...how is it that a guy entering and exiting a trunk repeatedly not noticed.  I mean come on, there we were in the Taco Bell parking lot, and no one noticed a guy jump into a trunk.  There were like 30 people in the parking lot.  Not to mention there we are in the Taco Bell, and like 5 girls walk in, then 2 more, then 3 more, then 2 more, then 5 more.  They just piled in.  There was also a large group of guys...unrelated though.  We drive past in the mercedes, and there is like 10 people standing aroudn the open hood of this mustang, and we got the music pumping and Thumping.  They look over at us and slam their hood, gettign all their underwear bunched up.  We got to the house, and finally someone sees the kid bolt out of the trunk and he hits his brakes and backs up.  Well we all kind of sat out there in front of Sam's place, swinging blades, knives and pipes.  Dancing around like crazy.  We kept on imitating Dodgeball, with that part "git in there deep."  lol and all were dancing around like idiots...it was great.  Somehow I ended up peeing on a block of two by fours, in some house being built...that was fairly humourous.  Well then there came our trek down to Lacamas lake to see the hanging man tree. Well we looked up at the tree and like the rumour had said...it did look like a man being hung.  Kinda creepy if you ask me.  So we were on our way out, then we ended up helping someone find their cell phone THEN we left, amen.

      Well Julian (The Mexican), Allister, Sam(antha), Heather, Augustus, Walter, and I all went to see Dodgeball.  That was one mighty obscure film.  I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I think Julian felt left out.  On the way back, I had Sam laying in my lap, and heather under my left arm...it was good..it was good to be king...what do I mean IT IS GOOD to be king.

      It craeted such a surge of energy, you would not believe.  It ran through my veins so fast.  I got all tingly...all over.  I don't understand it.  It was so different inside.  Before, it was like...I had full control...with guidance....and now it's speaking for me.   I am told that ...what i said happened was a cop out. I am being held back.  They don't know what happened. and they assumed it was like the last time.  I understand.  I never got the rush before.  i am being yelled at over this.  It was different.  I had control. But it had to stop.  it had to stop.  Only one yell was at her.  the others were to let out what was inside.  It wasn't directed at anyone.  The tingling.  the irritation.  it wouldn't stop.  It wouldn't stop.  I told her "It was different"  Even though it was clear to me, that on the outside it was the same.  it clearly looked the same.  this time...on the inside, like I said before there was a surge of energy.  I was looking forward to a bright summer, emotionally.  First a small scuffle with someone. But now this.  This energy...I don't know what it was.  But it wasn't adrenaline, im used to that. Scare yourself, you will get adrenaline.  Presence of God, that gives adrenaline.  This was not that...this was something ...much different.  I tried to explain to her...it was different....."it's just a cop out" it's what you say every time...it's different, it's different.  The first two times...were the same..just me yelling without a cause...to get attention.  although ...the time before this...was weird...I couldn't stop panting....I couldn't stop...the laughter, I couldn't stop the laughter, even though I wanted to. I tried to...it turned from anger, to fear to sadness.  My parents don't understand.  She yelled at me.  I was just going to be silent..this time...all that crossed my mind "mom.....you said soft word calms....." then i stopped thinking.  Extremeness of emotion pulls it.  Life is so pointless now taht I am out of school.  This time though.....I can't think of taking any more...that energy rush, the tingling, I couldn't take it.  If I tell her she will have me committed, I don't know what happened. Augustus, no one...suffers from this.  It's not rage...i know rage.  That was not anger...that was fear, that was suffering, that was suffocation, that was exile, that was neglect.  That was not anger.  It was anything but anger.  All I felt inside.  Rejection, taunting, rejection, taunting, neglect, neglect, fear of lack of something, rejection.  Everything I do is questioned now.  I tried to tell her, I couldn't explain this energy to her...to say it..she would deny it.  All I can do..is let them thing it was ...all the same.  The last time was because of loss of trust.   I learned not to react to that.  I can't take it.  I can't take it.  Life is pointless now.  I told her this wouldn't happen again....I guess I forgot.  I had to back up...i was being cornered, she was taking it away from me.  She blames it on the lack of my fatherly relationship.  That doesn't matter to me.  whether or not he is there.  I see kids and there fathers, kids and there grandparents.  I don't know what that means to me anymore.  Why was it that at first when I played magic, I was into the green......then it shifted to black.  Why did I go from life to death?  what is it about darkness that attracted me.  What does all this mean.  I left in a good mood.  Apart from the janelle fiasco I felt fine.  I went to dinner, and enjoyed myself.  came home, and was happy.  I was sitting at my computer content, no issues.  I noticed she was near me, so i turned off my headphones.  She kept on tapping me like i wasn't listening, but i was listening, I was listening.  kept on tapping, kept on nagging me....kept on calling me like i was ignoring, when I told her, and displayed that the music was off.  Then for that, she kept on tapping me on the arm , hard....very hard...poking...poking.  Then I told her to stop it, it was aggrivating me. she kept on doing it.  I told her again.  Then she yelled "WHY CAN"T YOU JUST STOP THAT"..... then it echoed "calm voices soothes anger"....i couldn't take it.  Rejection of force of will.  I took off my headphones forcibly and jumped back. I yelled, yelled again, yelled (the panting started) again....then it hit the energy hit.  I hated it...I wanted it to stop, I wanted it to stop so bad.  I had to yell, to drain it out.  I couldn't take it.  I couldn't take it. It pricked so hard all over my arms.  It pricked so hard.  I stopped yelling...even though it was the only thing that could stop it.  and waited...panting...till thw prickling finished...it took about 2 minutes for it to stop.  and that brings me to where I was told...that what I did was teh same I always did......they didn't know...and won't understand...that it was...the same outside...but inside...i was in agony....agony.  Why do I live out these pains?  it felt like true emotion.  Can anyone explain?....i think I know.....but help would be nice.

      by  Beloved   I made you promises, but i want them back I gave you everything, but you stabbed me in the back I finally figured out, that i can live without the pain i feel inside I've opened up my eyes, begun to realize i trusted way to many lies It's time to pick up the pieces now, am i falling down? Am i drowning out? Am i the only one who sees things this way? Well, i guess it goes to show Put me on my swing I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive After all was said and done, more was said than done (missing out on me) Put me on my swing I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive Your missing out on me, baby out on me Put me on my swing I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive And i'm waiting, for you there For you to care I can see it in your eyes And i'm running, but not giving up Just giving in for now Cause i can't pretend it's all ok Missing  -----------------------------------------------  That song....goes out to you Janelle...I want you to know that I never hated you throughout this ...and that your negative love....has no place in my heart.......Janelle....I still respect you as a friend....this is all so ridiculous.

Will she ever know that I loved her as a friend enough to die for her....probably not..she probably didn't care.  She would have seen me dying and said "oh, that's nice"....i miss her....i dont...but I might....help me someone..rain down mercy..

      " pulse through this crystalline shines, i want to see my bloodied eyes, i cannot go with out my bionic drive, open my shattered eyes,  We are the black Swan, We are the black Swan "  --  Excerpt from the Black Swan's " Holy Knives, and Corrupt Fornication "   I suppose as time passes on it blazes through us like a runaway train.  In highschool there were some friendships I wanted to form..weirdly enough they just came in.  Jerk maybe, friend maybe, driver perhaps, scholar proven....I am the Black Swan, the Deadened Spirit of the Deadened Creation.  For I am what I am, and who I am....we are the Black Swan.  If Janelle and Katrina ONLY knew what was inside of me..what i was birthign what I was thinking,....maybe they would try to stop me....too bad...that they don't care...*smirks*

      Well I truly think this song can describe me in an odd way right now.&nbsp; Well here it is, I suppose.&nbsp;  "Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth" Come on, come on! Come on, come on!  I am overground, outselling it Since God thinks I don't exist The Beatings happen per minute This is not blue collar white corrective politics I'm on a hate, american style, kick  This is the black collar song Put it in your middle finger and sing along Use your fist and not your mouth (Come on, come on! Come on, come on!) This is the black collar song Put it in your middle finger and sing along Use your fist and not your mouth (Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)  I'm on a campaign for pain And when i get elected I'll wipe the white off your house The Smile off your face  This is the black collar song Put it in your middle finger and sing along Use your fist and not your mouth (Come on, come on! Come on, come on!) This is the black collar song Put it in your middle finger and sing along Use your fist and not your mouth (Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)  I woke up today and wished for tomorrow I don't want to be like anyone else  I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  I don't want even be myself   I said no, this isn't your song  We can't all get along  It's too hard to hold hands when your hands are fists  My hate pop won't ever stop  I'm f***ing glad we're different  This is my hate american style hit  Don't bring  Don't sing it  Use your fist and not your mouth   This is the black collar song  Put it in your middle finger and sing along  Use your fist and not your mouth  (Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)  This is the black collar song  Put it in your middle finger and sing along  Use your fist and not your mouth  (come on, come on! Come on, come on!)

      Well I'm not sure if I rambled already about finishing watching Roswell.  Well I did, just to let you all know.  Well that's roughly 22 hrs of Roswell.  I mean I really feel like I am one of their lives.  Which brings me to 2 points that were raised in my mind:  1. So a Vampire bites an alien, doesn't matter what kind, but what would happen? 2. So the country all goes to work, who stays home to tend the Crop Circles 3. BONUS VINTAGE QUESTION:  hhhhmmmmmmmmn Thought for the day: Suppose I had 2 cows, and 1 in 2 cows was a winner, and I sold the "winning" cow without realizing it was a winner, does the 1 out of 2 cows ideal still apply to the remaining cow, or does it become 100 % of cows are losers?  -- Excerpt from  urlLink August 13th, 2002   Any of your thoughts would be greatly appreciated :)

      Well I bought Roswell today on DVD, all 968 minutes of it's raw radiant glory.&nbsp; I have to say that i am thoroughly pleased with the shows quality.&nbsp; It caught me offguard, but was a very nice surprise.&nbsp; I like it, kind of like my sister digs the OC, I dig this all the more.&nbsp; So it's looking pretty good, I plan to watch it with my sister...before I move.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to spend time with her before I move, i really want her to know that I care about her, to know that her older brother isn't just the guy who lives upstairs, and sits in his room all day, or leaves without acknowledging her.

      " Oh my Hell!? "  -- Sean, at a Tourney&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Well that Tourney was weird. To sum it all up before I begin.&nbsp; I got beat by a 2/2 black creature, got swarmed over by rats.&nbsp; Then was beat the living day lights out of by over 1,000,000,000 damage from a Archbound Ravager if I understood correctly.&nbsp; That was weird off the hook.  &nbsp;   Pre-Tourney :  &nbsp;  I played up against this CRAZY guy.&nbsp; He had an ALL artifact deck. The first of like 4 decks, that were immune to my black deck.&nbsp; This made me so mad.&nbsp; So mad.&nbsp; Well let's put it this way.&nbsp; He defeated me with Ornithopters, say no more.&nbsp; It hurt too badly.  &nbsp;   Round 1 :&nbsp;   I think I was cursed from the get go in this game.&nbsp; Get this.&nbsp; I got only 2 lands out that whole game, since he was playing black, and I found out RIGHT before the game that my "hand of death" cards&nbsp;were banned.&nbsp; grr.&nbsp; So because my terrors, and every card like that meant nothing, I was beaten off the hook, badly.&nbsp; I was smacked down on by some 2/2 creature black i remember, out of the mirrodin block somewhere.&nbsp; That sucked.&nbsp; 2 more games with this guy proved to be, raw insanity.      Round 2 :  This was against a man, known only as "Quinn".&nbsp; Why Quinn, I'm not quite sure.&nbsp; But to say it softly, it was the third deck that day immune to my black abilities.&nbsp; That was making me angry.&nbsp; First time he through, he kept on blowing everything up with one particular rat.&nbsp; Ravenous rats maybe ..or like crypt rats.&nbsp; So it made it hard for me to get a word in edgewise.&nbsp; Not to mention this dude was like...Total "house of pain" rapcore...lol so he was rapping as he was laying me to waste.&nbsp; One time of the 3 games, the middle game, I laid waste to him with the Hoar shade..that was cool.

      Screw that ok.  All that statement means is, "look, i don't want my daughter impregnated anytime soon, so don't __expletive__ call" Come on, as though I don't really what that means.  All that aside, I finally understand what it's like to understand neglect.  Whether my neglect is given ten fold, neglect should never be given...or taken for that matter.  You know who I am talking about, I challenge you, the person that seems to neglect me.  To post a comment, come on

      Well I went to see Spiderman 2 today with my father (once again my dad and I spending time together).  First of all I realized something, studies are right that those who spend time with their father are better off :).  Movie was done well, it truly kept my interest.  For that I hold no foul word at the film, I loved it. Personally I would have made Octavius far more, visceral in his destruction, and increased the gore ten fold over all.  Though this was not the story of IG-88 nor, pitch black...it happened to be a film the whole family could see, and that was true they could. (listening to " urlLink Glass in the Trees "  urlLink by Dead Poetic , btw.)  I liked the whole Machinated thought thing...although it was seeming like ...a clone of the last film, using the Honorable Seppeku card as a trump.  I really want Venom to be in the next film.  lol  urlLink Read here  about two posts...then you might see why I am ashamed to be a fan of any thing 'cept God.  Nonetheless I guess this all comes down to relationships...like life and Algebra....got two things for you. One...a hey to Anna...lol the girl from back in the day. Hang in there ok? I believe in you...even though I can be a jerk, we gotta hang before I move...and second:  (one second...gotta type all this)  I gotta say this..then I will give the surprise.  " Draw close to God, and he will draw to you ."  My mother tells me that alot, and I finally agree.  A lot of my friends claim that people changed me.  I changed me, I tried to be someone that I couldn't be ie: not myself.  But now I am back, I been thinking about who I am, where I came from.  The Old Sean is back...screw the new one.  People can't stand fronts anyways.  So yeah the following is from...I guess Sean...: (still typing..hold up)  here...the treat for anyone who has believed in me...  "Hello All,  	I would like to thank Mr. Clements, Mr. Mullinex, Mrs. Kellar, and the rest of the staff of homelink for the support they’ve given me throughout the years, and all the nudges in the right direction that I have grown to appreciate. 	It’s been a long 4 years, and I guess I have to say that I am fairly sad that I have to see it go.  I, as well as the reast of you attending, can probably think of at least one memorable occasion or occurrence or time you had while being here.  I suppose you could say that I really came to love this place, from the first day I started here.  Coming in from Canada, all that I really had to get used to, was the Warm weather, but overall it wasn’t hard to get accustomed to the school, and the people here. 	In the beginning I never really thought about how fast time would fly as the years passed by, but it kind of went on more quickly than any of us would have expected.  My youth pastor once told me that high school would be the fasted most influential and integral part of my life.  Complexities aside, I would have to agree with him on that much, I can barely remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday, let alone the color socks I was wearing. 	I never really planned for anything, never really expected anything too exciting out of high school, but I guess I was wrong.  I earned a lot of friendships, met a lot of new people, learned a lot of new things.  I guess in a way life is a little bit like algebra, with relationships being what it is founded upon. 	In Closing, I have a little excerpt from a book I was reading the other day: 	 Don’t let anyone look down on you because of your youth; on the contrary, set an example in your speech, behavior, love, trust, and purity. "  Fatherly relationships really help, hanging out with my Dad really brought me to understand God as a father figure.  Thank you God, thank you Dad.  I love you so much, thank you for bringing me and him closer together, and I am not afraid to stand by what I believe.  What I took to you was so much more than an oath, and you mean more to me than a couple words, you are the air I breath, thank you, I love you, you will never forsake me, nor leave me behind, you are the air under my wings, i will follow you to the ends of the earth.  You mentioned "ask and I will give the nations" Lord....thank you.

      Turns out my dad's last concert was  Chris DeBurgh concert, y'all don't really know me if you didn't know I loved Chris DeBurgh.  And get this his concert before that was Jim Morrison, w/ the doors.  So tonight I took him to see Adam Sweeney, and then Locust St. Taxi.  My dad really enjoyed it, so I was happy that I could spend time with him.  Kind of sad that in the 16 yrs I been around, we haven't really had too much time together.  Lately however we have been developing the same interests, so it's all good :)

      Just found out that my Grandfather figure has died.  Though deep inside of me, I know he is not dead, He is not dead.  I was just talking to my mother about it.  Telling her what I know, and I know deep within, that he is not dead, he is infact very much alive.  He has either passed on to Heaven, or is waiting to be awakened.

       urlLink     I have noticed this weird Orb like Chalice, coming up a lot in my old artwork...Perhaps I can find out what is causing it. It would seem, glass and shiny orbs came up a whole lot in the old artwork. I was as I have said, more crystalline, then my current organic tendencies.  Hmmn, I am seeing some Power Rangers, Mortal Kombat, and Classic Dinotopia Influences now. Estes's Brand model rockets, more Starwars.... Microsoft's Fury 3, Bill Nye, a Sea Lion.  Starwars, 8-man, free willy the cartoon, Macross 2, macross.   Star Fox.

       urlLink     Sometimes I wonder about my Influences. Looking through pictures I drew when I was younger I see obvious evidence of my inspirations. In some you can see my Haida Indian influence, from when I was younger in "Sciene Humaines" with Professeur Catherine Beron. And then in others you can see influences of Star Wars, and Jurassic Park. Lately it's been Clive Barker, Tim Burton, and Picasso. I would have loved to have met Picasso, the troubled genius, I wonder if he was a man of God.  As I look further I see influences, of Bomberman, of Panic Bomber, when I got my first Video Game Console, my Virtual Boy, which I still have ;). Then influences of Megaman 4, which I loved back in the day.
