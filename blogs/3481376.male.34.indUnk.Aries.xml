       urlLink     Me flag, buckos      My brother,  urlLink Brian "What the fuck does WTF mean?" Howard , got me this big-ass flag for my boat. It may be a bit too big but I'm going see what it looks like if it'll ever stop raining so I can go kill myself on the boat. I may get a flag pole and hang it outside my house on holidays to freak out my neighbors. I may call me boat t' Black Pearl, even though it's more of a black striped pearl and kinda looks like a killer whale head on with the docking lights and all.     urlLink Here's a nice site  that gives you an idea about the town I live in. I live behind the Rave movie theater but I hardly ever go.

      Got another notice that my neighbors are narking me out about my blinds again. It mentioned that soon the neighborhood will be taking over the Homeowner's Association and they may be "much more stringent in pursuing compliance", we'll see. I still haven't gotten a book from them and I'm still not in a hurry to "comply" with such a foolish rule just yet so cry me a river. Off to the trash can you go!

      &nbsp; I started my workout yesterday and to my surprise I'm not in any pain right now. This worries me. I also took my "before" picture and I'm withholding it until I can put it side by side with the after shot. I must say it will be difficult to improve on my Schwarzenegger type body but Jeebus willing we'll all see what happens. Is it wrong to use a picture of myself as wallpaper for my PC?   &nbsp; I'm noticing I have a little more energy from taking my horse pill sized placeboes/suppositories. I'm sleeping less at work now but I get tired earlier and find it more difficult to watch my ReplayTV before beddy-bye time (Futurama isn't gonna watch itself you know). ReplayTV kicks ass and if you don't own one (or a TIVO) then you are missing out on some good ole fashion TV watching instead of life like I am. Guess which is better?   &nbsp; My brother suppose to drop by today and give me a pirate's flag he order for my boat. I hope it's not an ass-pirate's flag with rainbows (LOL!!!11!oneone…that was stupid). I'll be trying to board other boats saying  "Arrrgh! Show me yer booty!"  then steal all their crap and speed off through the no-wake zone. I need to look up a cool pirate's ships name for my boat so people will tremble in fear as they witness the horror of me wakeboarding through the shallows (assuming I can stay up for more than 3 seconds).

      &nbsp; When I was in my earliest of twenties, I took a couple of weightlifting classes in "college" because I was a little on the thin side (5'9, 135 lbs.) That's a fine height-weight ratio if you are a woman but technically I'm not, though I did have long hippy hair at the time and was called "ma'am" on more than one occasion when approached from the back. I need to find some pics of my hair from back then and post them for your horrifying pleasure.   &nbsp; Anyway, I took allot of amino acids and weight gaining powdered drinks that mainly just made me throw up and gave my colon a good workout but I didn't gain a pound. I was saved by turning 25 and being alarming lazy that I was able to put on the pounds I so desperately needed. I have gained about 40lbs or so but to my surprise it's not all muscle so now I have decided to give the workout another shot. We have a decent little gym here at work and I have a weight room in my house so I'm going to try to hit the weights at least 3 time a week for a month to see what happens. I ordered a supplement to suppose to block a chemical that suppresses muscle growth (myostatin) but I'm under no illusion that it'll actually work so who knows. I think I'll take a before and after pic to see if there are any real differences and post them if they are not too embarrassing.   The real test will be to see if I can get my incredibly lazy ass up to pulling this off.

       urlLink     Mi Casa      Here's a little background on my little problem. I bought a house about a year ago in a small (about 70 lots and maybe 4 streets) neighborhood north of Dallas and was told that there was a Homeowner's Association but other than the cost, that was all I knew about it. We don't have any real amenities unless you count a couple of fancy light posts so I wasn't sure what I was paying for but it is cheap (~$120 a year). I still have no clue why we have one and have never seen any evidence that it helps maintain property values.    I know what I'm paying for now, it's to have people tell me what I can't do to my own home. Most of the houses are in the $160k-$210k range and although nice, they not all that fancy. Well I got a note in the mail from the Association telling me that some of my neighbors have complained that my blinds do not conform to the correct color scheme of white or neutral in color (I have cherry wood colored blinds since my house is of a darkish color). WTF?! I wanted to explode! Those blinds cost around $800 bucks and they want me to throw them away and by new ones so my house will look uglier?!    Apparently this is a common rule in many Associations and I can not wrap my head around the logic of it. If they had giving me a copy of the rules when I bought the house I would have got white blinds to begin with but hell I still don't have a copy of the rules so I don't know what other trivial nonsense I could be violating.    BTW I live in what's called Glenview Estates in the Lake Dallas area behind The Rave.   UPDATE:    Joanne talked to the lady that sent the letter (she works in the same building and by chance was one of her smoking buddies) and found out that the people in my subdivision believe that they live in some ritzy neighborhood and sent in tons of complaints about each other like not mowing the lawn enough and stupid stuff like that. The Association has no money so they don't plan to do anything but send letters when someone complains. The neighbors even want to make it a gated community which is freaking insane! I think I might park my car in my yard for a day and see what happens.

        I stumbled across a Spanish web site the other day that hosted a bunch a short weird videos. They were things like skateboarders wiping out and some TV bloopers but then I started to run into some of the more morbid stuff. I think most people have heard of or maybe even thought they have seen a woman have sex with a horse before but believe me, it's not as "erotic" as it sounds. I did learn that horses like fat women and can't seem to last more than a few seconds and that throwing up on my keyboard really makes it smell.    Speaking of throwing up, what's up with the Japanese vomit sluts? Watching a girl give a guy a bj and puking all over his genitals made me want to join her puking fun. It pretty much goes downhill from there. I looked for a pen around my desk so I could gouge my eyes out but Joanne's 17 year old son used my last good pen to make a bong out of a Gatorade bottle. I fuk'n love teenagers.    I hate myself for watching this crap almost as much as I hate everyone around me or on the planet for that matter.

        Being a computer nerd with computer nerd job (ruler of the Windows 2000 network), most people assume I just spend all day surfing the Internet reading  urlLink Slashdot.org , watching my stocks tank, or looking up Britney Spears photos. Most people are idiots and I hate them but in this case they would be correct. Occasionally I get to show what all my useless computer certifications do for me. We are about to migrate from our own Windows 2000 domain to a corporate Windows 2003 domain which includes about 20 servers and 600 or so PCs. I've already come up with a few VBScripts that should (in theory) allow us to move our users and PCs over withot our IS people touching them and preserving all the user's settings and email. That'll be a trick if I pull it off but I am confident that my ego will allow me to push ahead with the assumption that it will work and to tell my boss so. He knows me well enough to know that half my efforts don't work as advertise but he still keeps me around so our group will have someone to make fun of.    One thing I do enjoy is raining on people's parades when it comes to email stories. There's a site call  urlLink Snopes.com  that debunks many urban legends and scams so when I hear some story that sounds a little odd, I hit the site and immediately send out a link if I find one there (9 at of 10 times I do). Telling people that they are wrong is fun and I suggest everyone to try it, especially in person and when they are twice your size as they tend to really enjoy it.

        I must have pulled something last week on the boat because every time I get out of the car my left upper thigh hurts like a bitch! I must be getting old or really outa shape since I spend all day sitting in front of a computer ruining peoples lives by denying people access to stuff. We have a decent fitness center here at work that I'm going to try to make use of today and see if I can't get pain worked out. Hopefully I wont need a walker or hip replacement anytime soon.    It's been a slow day so I've been looking up people online that I haven't heard from in years. I have access to a site (paid site but not by me) that shows driver's license info as well as does background checks and licence plate checks. Add this  urlLink http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=52  site for looking up marriages and divorces and this  urlLink http://www.texascad.com/  for looking up homes and/or owners and I can just about find out about anyone I want. So far I was able to determine that at least 2 of my ex-girlfriends are married now and where they live and even how much their houses appaise for plus I found an old friend of mine that I haven't heard from in 10 years. It's scary to see what's public data out there and I see how these "Find anyone" agencies work now.

       urlLink     Labinal-Corinth..in Corinth      We got some good news today at work. We won the wiring contract from Boeing to build the wires and cables for the new  urlLink 7E7 airplane  that will be replacing the 757 and 767 in a couple of years. We used to be a part Boeing until last year when our plant was bought out by a French company called Labinal that make wires for Airbus which is Boeing's main competitor. We are going to move to a smaller building in about a year or so in either Frisco or Gainesville which will suck for me since I live right across the highway from there now.   UPDATE:     Apparently we wont be building the wires for the 7E7 here, they will go to the other North American plants (the bid was under our plants name however). We suppose to be doing more complicated work but we haven't won the bid on that just yet. I may have jumped the gun on this one.

       urlLink     Joanne In SC &nbsp;   &nbsp; Went to Myrtle Beach last week and it was hot and humid just like here in Tejas. Joanne is an Insurance Underwriter and gets to go on these business trips and I get to tag along. This is the second time we've gone and they pay for just about everything. We get free food, drinks (read beer), entertainment (they took us to Legends and we got to see Elvis), and they put us up in a rented time share that was bigger than my old apartment in Lewisville. They are really into golf and Putt-Putt up there and have some of the most elaborate Putt-Putt courses known to man. I didn't get to play which it too bad since I'm the king of Putt-Putt but we'll probably go again next year and I'll make an effort to get out there.

      &nbsp; This is my nickname on Battlefield: Vietnam game (an online multiplayer first-person war game) and I just thought it sounded funny. There is an old Ska band with the same name but I don't know anything about it and I just discovered them today. I play that damn game too damn much when I should be doing laundry or mowing or downloading porn. I should name my boat "Army of Juan" or maybe "The Painmaker" because since I got it I've been trying to Ski/Wakeboard using muscles I didn't know I had. Everything hurts right now (especially my ass) yet I'm compelled to go out and do it again (like sex, except without all the crying).

       urlLink      The boat of the damned!&nbsp;    &nbsp; Being that I live right on Lewisville Lake I got a boat (a  urlLink 2004 Regal 2000 Bowrider, 20' long with a 220hp 4.3liter MPI Mercruiser engine ) but it's too big for the garage. The place I wanted to store it wasn't open on the weekend so I had to leave it in front of my house which I'm sure my neighbors were hella pissed and I'm expecting a letter any day now bitching about having the boat here. I don't mind anymore, I have a trash can right next to me and it'll make a nice home for it (the letter that is, not the boat). I didn't want it here and was worried to death that someone would take it but now it's locked up so I'm happy. I hate these damn blog things so I'm going back to playing Battlefield:Vietnam.

      I hadn't planned on posting again today but so much has happened today that I feel I need to post so I'll have a record of it. I'm very forgetful.  First, my grandmother called me at about 10:00 last night asking if I would go pick up my nephew from my mother's house. I live in Texas, my mother lives in Missouri so I was like "not right now" and as luck would have it my phone dies so I told myself I'd call her tomorrow. My nephew is a HUGE pain in the ass and has had a rough life. Both of his parents (and grandparents on his father's side) are in jail for drug related stuff and he's 14 with way too much testosterone and is also bi-polar. I talked to my grandmother this morning and she said he was fighting with my mother and wanted to come back down to live with my father (again) and that we decided that he can wait another week or so and come down with my mom for the wedding. We left it at that.  This morning here at work we had more layoffs which puts everyone on edge. So far it's just been 2 people but it was a surprise for us who they were.  My father just called and said he bought the land in west Texas and will be moving soon. The real reason he called was to tell me that my grandmother just broke her hip and is in the hospital right now. She drove herself to the hospital so I'm not sure about how serious it is but my dad drove himself to the hospital a few years ago WHILE HE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK. He had to have a quadruple bypass for that. I come from a hard-headed family I do.  My grandmother is 79 and still works so she wont be happy having to take time off for this. What a wacky lady.

       current mood:  headache, so shut the hell up  currently listening to:  my life slipping away  This just for fun because I ran out of shit to say.     Two men are sitting in a bar talking. One is a train conductor. He says, "I'm so embarrassed. Today I was on the train, and I was collecting tickets for Pittsville. I see this hot blonde, and instead of saying 'Now collecting all tickets to Pittsville' I said 'Now collecting all pricks to titsville.'"  The other man says, "You know, something like that happened to me too recently. I came home from work and my wife was upset, my supper was burned, the house was a mess. And instead of saying to my wife, 'Why is my supper burned, and the house a mess?' I said, 'You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.'"     I mentioned in an earlier post that I dated just a little before meeting Joanne (who ironically had ferrets just like my last 2 other girlfriends, what's up with that?) but there is one date I had mentioned to Joanne that she "enjoyed" so I thought I would share it with you guys along with this run-on sentence.  You see, I sort-of like to cook and by "sort-of" I mean "if it gets me laid". Well I was making my world class fajitas (fresh out of the box mind you, just like my wine) at my apartment when I helped my date to her chair and served her plate like the gentleman I pretended to be. I sat down to eat and tried to strike up a conversation about ferrets or something but she just sat there quietly and barely touched her food. This got me a little peeved but I tried not to show it but it didn't take long before I started to get a bit irate. We ended up getting into a heated debate about what's considered proper dating etiquette which surprisingly enough, I was losing! I finally had enough of this so I deflated her and put her back in the closet. Worst $50 I ever spent.

       urlLink     Poetry in motion   Make no mistake, I don’t like poetry but sometimes you run across something so brilliant that it makes you take exception. Here's a old one from a friend of mine that will really make you think.   Monkey  by Pete      I spank my Monkey everyday. Everyday I say! I say! I spank my Monkey everyday. I say, I say.      I put my finger in my ass everyday. Everyday I say! I say! I put my finger in my ass everyday. I say, I say.    If that's not genius then I don't know what is (which IS possible I suppose).

       current mood:  suicidal  currently listening to:  boss bitch'n at me to get to work  This will come as a surprise to most people but I do have my faults. I know what you're thinking, "no way, you seem so together in your blog!", well shut up for a minute and let me tell you, Ok? For Jeebus sakes, let a guy talk for a change. You see, I'm not what you would call an "emotional" person, much to the delight (read: horror) of Joanne and all my ex-girlfriends which is the reason my last ex gave me for taking off (I'm sure that guy she was talking to the whole time and started dating immediately after we broke up had nothing to do with it). That's fine, I did recognized it was my fault she left (because I'm a man) and in the end I really didn't care (she didn't put out anyway). I learned a lot about myself and women after that by doing some research on the web since apparently I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I sure wished I knew where I was going with this.  Anyway, I was angry when I ex left for obvious reasons (how dare her leave the greatness that is me) but I figured that she thought I was just too good for her and she was doing me a favor. However, once she was out I went into a state of euphoria as the realization of my situation began to have permutations without the ejaculations! Here I was making good money with a cool little apartment and cool stuff and nobody to answer to. This was the closest I came to crying but it was of joy instead of dread and my sex life actually improved thanks to good old Internet porn! I didn't date too much before I met Joanne and the rest is history after that. Now I have a big ole' house, a new boat, a hyper-active dog, a step-son that I want to kick in the arse sooooo bad, and a future wife that has a healthy libido and is not only great at "apple bobbing" (sorry but even better than you...mom) but likes it to boot! She'll probably leave my ass in a few years but the point is stay in school and don't do drugs!

       urlLink   &nbsp;   Whacha doing back there buddy?&nbsp;&nbsp;Nooooooooo!! &nbsp;     &nbsp; A couple of years ago Joanne had a coworker/friend that needed a car and Joanne hated her car&nbsp;(a Camry)&nbsp; so she had her friend take over the payments and we bought a used BMW to replace it. The BMW would have paid for itself in a year and a half which I supposed it did but a few month ago her coworker got laid off and hasn't been making payments. She was always a month behind to begin with but now we get calls everyday from Toyota and their cronies&nbsp;and her ex-coworker/friend isn't answering her phone now. We&nbsp;don't have an extra set of keys so I'm not sure what our options are. Maybe we can just say it&nbsp;was stolen and call it a day.   &nbsp; I'm all for helping people and stuff (not really) but I knew this wasn't a best idea in the world when we did it. I tell you what's a good idea, getting that $15 for a month of movies at Blockbuster (2 a day) and recording all of them. That's like 60 movies you could add to your DVD collection! My bud Pedro is doing that and he's gonna to hook a brutha up wit some vids, yo.

If anyone wants to email me naked pictures of yourself (if you're a chic) or their girlfriend/wife/mother (if she's hot) that might help out allot thank you very much. You can put MCSA across the top of the pics to help remind me that I need to study that instead of anatomy, and by "anatomy" I mean "your mom's hot ass". I'm gonna burn in hell for that one.  People are quitting left and right here at work. If I had a brain in my head I would do the same but I hate changing jobs. I might not have a choice since the layoff rumors are starting up again.

        Three and a half weeks til D-day. We hadn't decided on a date to get married until like 2 weeks ago so we are really rushing things to make sure we have everything done. Joanne's a bit stress about it and I'm sure there are still a few people I haven't even told about it yet. We just happen to get a really good deal at Sneaky Pete's (about 1/4 the normal price) to host the wedding which will be really small and really quick (just like me! Oh snap, that's not right) but it has to be done on that weekend to get the deal. Her last name, Griego (gree-a-go) is cooler than mine which is Dodd (dodd) and so I was thinking of changing mine to her's but it's not really her's, it's her ex-husband's and I'm sure he wouldn't dig that. I just want this shit over with so I can get my wedding band and pick up all the honeys.    Joanne and I have been together for over 2 years now but this wont technically be my first marriage. I made the mistake of marrying someone I had only known for a couple of months about 10 years ago but I had it quickly annulled within a month. She was a whore, and by "whore" I mean "whore" but I had at least thought ahead enough to find a way out in case things went bad, which it did on day one.  If I had really thought ahead I would have shot myself in the face after saying "I do".  This is too gay (and they say the Brits aren't funny).  urlLink Tasty Faggots   G.I.

I'm seeing that a lot lately on peoples blogs and web pages and I don't know who started it but they need to knock that shit off. It's mainly teenage girls who do this and maybe I'm nick picking a bit but I ain't got nothing else to bitch about this morning so shut up.  &nbsp; It was nice and cool here in north Tejas yesterday and even today. I remember back in 1980 when we had like 69 days of 100+ degree temperatures in a row. I ran away from home that summer and ended up puking my guts out from heat exhaustion from riding my bike from Seagoville to Mesquite. Good times.

       urlLink     Don't let this be you.     I see men make stupid-ass relationship type mistakes everyday, and by "men" I mean "me". I could type all day about what people should and shouldn't and all the screw-ups I've done (and continue to do) in my life but it's just easier to point to another site and call you all stupid.    If left to our own devices, we as men always screw up with women so it's important to listen to other people about this kind of thing. Women instinctively play games (though they all claim not to) so we have to understand what they want and try to give it to them even though it may not make sense or feel right to us.  Your emotions will almost always stear you wrong so resist the "follow your heart" advice unless you plan on following it over a cliff.   urlLink The Ladder Theory  - Basically explains why men can't be friends with women (unless they are gay, like you). For women who are too naive to know any better and for dumbass guys that try the "let's be friends first" and think they can get the girl by waiting her out (answer: no you can't).   urlLink AskMen.com  - Good all around site for guys and many topics about women. Read up on the  urlLink dating part  (if you're single-read all of the Dr. Love articles) but they rest will help you understand how the enemy thinks. It was an eye opener for me and I've seen the advice work firsthand.

       urlLink     Free cat   Took Andrew and friends wakeboarding yesterday and got sun burned again, joy. Today we have a meeting with the priest and I need to change to oil in my car so I got that going for me. Add to the fact that Andrew's car is messing up (a cylinder in knocking or maybe a valve and it's overheating) and I'm seeing some small cracks in my tile from the house settling, I'm going to be in such a good mood this week.

      &nbsp; Walked the stupid hyper-active dog again and ran into some neighbors. They have the same blinds as we do and they think they know who is sending the notices so I now have someone to focus my anger towards, and by "anger" I mean "gay".&nbsp; I'm keeping this short today 'cause I'm starting to bore myself already.

I'm really putting up an effort to half-ass it but I'm getting tired and sleepy.&nbsp; I have noticed my arms are getting a little bigger so they just barely look like girlie arms now and maybe after a few more months I wont have women envying my scrawny twigs with hands at the ends.&nbsp; I'm going to try to work out today and maybe even bench press the bar WITHOUT&nbsp;A SPOTTER! Wish me luck! I've been at work for 2 hours already so I'm going to take my first nap now. Nighty-night, biatches!

      &nbsp; Got a call this morning at 8:30 from Andrew saying he has to go to court today (for an accident he had a few months earlier). Guess when he has to be there? If you said 8:30 in the morning then you'd be correct, smartass. So I go pick his ass up to take him there about 20 minutes late but that doesn't matter, they send him home to change because you can't wear shorts and flip-flops to court, go figure. We go home, he changes and we head back. I decide to wait for him being that he was already an hour late I thought it wouldn't take too long. I'm of course wrong and I set there for 2 hours in which he comes back having to take defensive driving and a $90 court fee. Guess who gets to pay for it?   &nbsp; Ordered my ring from EBay because we like buying&nbsp; crap from EBay. It's 18k gold and platinum and looks pretty cool&nbsp;plus I won a bid for Joanne's ring and got a really good deal with it. She says she'll have like 2.25 carats in diamonds with this ring added. Well I still need a tux and a small hand gun to blow my brains out with so back to EBay I go!

      &nbsp; Well it looks like there is just one main person in my neighborhood that's complaining about everybody (we do have a bunch of other colorful characters but they don't directly effect me just yet). It seems my neighbor on my left got a notice about their shrubs and the people across the street have may have gotten one about their basketball hoop in their drive. Joanne says since the "neutral" color of the blinds is not defined in the handbook, then she will consider any wood color neutral and give them the what-for. I'm looking forward to throwing away my third notice on my blinds and finding out who this trouble maker is&nbsp;then having a little talk with him, and by "talk" I mean "beat the shit out of" and by "blinds" I mean "Eskimos".&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the need to have artists, poets, politicians, goths, Eskimos, and French people in the world but they need to understand that there are people like me in the world that hate all their shit. I'll go blogging every now and then and some of the artsy crap I see make me want to barf till I throw up. My shit is dull and is not exactly going to make anyone's lives any better (except maybe those goth bastards since you can't get much lower than that, stupid goth crap)&nbsp;but anyway, my point is I like ice cream.   &nbsp; Damnit, they took the ice cream machine out of the breakroom! I was just going down there thinking I wanted ice cream and nobody was going to stop me from reaching my goal then sure enough, gone. Sweet irony raised it's ugly head and I had to settle for Twizzlers but I got to find out what happen to that machine. This just ain't right, why has Jeebus forsaken me?

      &nbsp; If Andrew (Joanne's 17 yr old pot smoking son) was a hamster, he would have been justifiably eaten a long time ago by mommy and daddy hamster and then mommy hamster would have committed ritual suicide in order to not reproduce anymore offspring. We (against our better judgment) bought him a '90 Mustang GT a few months ago and he's already wrecked one side of it and yesterday bottomed out in it and now it wont run and is leaking what looks like power steering fluid. You might think "big deal, you wrecked your cars when you were young, dumbass" but I PAID for my cars and I didn't cause the constant grief this boy causes. I can write several novels on all the things he's done that my parents would have killed me for but a big chunk of it can probably be found on his juvenile police record so I wont bother.   &nbsp; His best bet is to get his GED and join the military (it help my brother allot though he was a boy scout compared to this) before he ends up living in a box under an overpass with an imprint of my shoe in his ass. In all fairness he is much better than he was a year ago but I don't forget things quickly and he has a long way to go.

       urlLink     Who likes short shorts!   Joanne is a good girl to have; she's attractive, outgoing, smart(ish), thinks she's funny when not, makes almost double what I make, lets me get away with murder, can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch, and is open to the thought of getting larger "thingies". I don't think I could ask for more which is why I am marrying her before I turn gay or something or she sees what a loser I am and ditches me for some drunk biker guy. Friday's seem to be good for her. For the past 3 weeks strange men have been hitting on her on the way home from work in traffic on I-35. I was on the phone with her yesterday when I guy told her to roll down the window and ask if she was talking to her husband and if she was happily married. I wish I was that bold but in all fairness he was suppose to have been good looking so he probably can get away with that sort of thing. I would just get flipped off and then I would go to my corner and cry.  The other day we went to renew our cell phone contracts (we have 3 phones under her name) and they suddenly refused because she has a debt to them (AT&T) from when she was in Denver. She kept her account from Denver and transferred it here when she moved here so it was odd that she would owe money when they never billed her for anything. She called AT&amp;T and ask them what she owed but they couldn't tell her and it was for a number she wasn't familiar with. Mind you she's been under contract with AT&amp;T for like 5 years and now they say she owes them. Dumbasses, I think I'll switch us to T-Mobil or whatever the hell it's called nowadays.

        With the exception of my grandmother and brother who has the potential to be very successful due to him not being a lazy ass like myself, my family is pretty much all over the place. I worry about them sometimes though not too often since I'm so self involved I sometimes forget that there's a world outside my ego. Here are the current problem cases I think about while I'm relaxing in my 15' x 20' master bedroom complete with see-through fireplace to the master bath and 36" TV with surround sound.    I have a slightly younger sister who use to be a meth head and dealer but had to give up the drug life when they tossed her in the slammer for a 10 year romp. She could have hooked up with a successful man earlier in her life since she was (maybe is) actually attractive. No, that would have been boring to her. She prefers to date drug addicts that can't and wont keep a job so she went nowhere in life, except jail. She's doing quite well there and she's learning a trade but I'm afraid when she gets out and find how tough the real world is then she may relapse back to her old ways. I just hope she can tough it through when the time come or I'm going to beat her ass to a bloody pulp.    I have another sister who I don't know too well (she lives with my mother in Missouri) who's 18 with a kid and has nothing to do. There isn't squat in her town so her only real hope is either the military or college but I hear the my mother is pressuring her to move to Dallas. WTF? There's nothing her for her either and she will not be able to support herself for many years since she is starting out with nothing (no college, work experience, no car). My brother moved down here and I let him stay with me but he had just got out of the Army, had a car, had money still coming in from the Army, and had a girlfriend that just graduated college. Even with all of that it still took 9 months before they were able to get their own place and my brother is a very motivated person. I could not do the same with my sister at this time because I would end up just supporting her for what would probably be many years since there is no way in hell she'll be able to get a job making enough money to support herself anytime soon.    My father wants to move west Texas in the hope of saving money but I'm concerned that he'll end up not quite reaching his goals. The new place will cost some money to fix up but anything they do the fix it will increase it's value which will increase his property tax which is something he's trying to avoid. This has the potential of costing him as much to move as it is to stay where he's at so I'm hoping it'll work out for him.    Blah! This is long and boring but I'm posting it anyway.

       urlLink   &nbsp;   Bitch, you got served!    &nbsp; I need to post more pics. When I see a site or someone else's blog it usually has a lot of words but not too many pics. Reading hurts my brain and takes too long but I don't mind looking at pictures (unless it's of ugly people or "scenery"). Since I assume everyone thinks the same as I do (and they should since I'm always right and stuff) then I need to make my site more friendly on the eyes. Anyone have any pics of attractive and maybe nude people that I can post please email me so I can make fun of you and add your pics to my collection, and maybe post one or two.   &nbsp; It's early so nothing's going on yet except that there is a rumor here at work that 2 important floor people walked out yesterday because they got mad during a meeting. This is disturbing since we have put up with allot of crap here recently and I can't image what could have pushed these people over the edge like that. Maybe I need to refresh my resume again.

        I may be getting a Jacuzzi. My father decided to move to San Angelo so he's selling his house and giving me his Jacuzzi if I can move it to my place. All I need now is some sucker to help me move that big ass thing (it has a gazebo with it) in the hot Tejas sun, I wonder what my brother is doing?    San Angelo sucks ass, it's hot and dry and the town he wants to move to has like only 5 families living there. It'll be like 4 hours away from here which will make it a pain in the ass to borrow tools and stuff.    Update:    Looks like I wont be getting the Jacuzzi after all, he decided it will help sell the house. I do plan on getting a kiddie pool so I'll have something to splash around in.

I know what you're thinking "Are you insane?"...well, yes. I want it small and quick (that's what she said! LOL!!11!1oneone...that wasn't funny)so hopefully it'll just be slightly more painful than that root canal I had last year. It might be harder to date being married but I hear lots of chics dig married guys because that are stupid (the chics that is) so maybe it wont be all bad.

      &nbsp; Went to the Dallas Boat Show today and decided we needed another boat. There was this  urlLink big ass Crownline cruiser  we liked for around $75k that we might consider in 5 years or so. Speaking of which, we went on the boat today and nearly got ran over by some dumbass hauling ass straight toward us under the I-35 bridge. I was pretty much at a dead stop because when I saw him coming I wanted to make sure I didn't hit him but he came right at us and Joanne started screaming like a banshee. He turn at the last second (and didn't even slow down) and barely missed us. If I would have remembered that I had a horn I would have been laying on it but oh well.   &nbsp; When we first got out there today I had forgotten to put the drain plug in. We were about a few minutes out when my hat flew off so I had to stop and get it. That's when I heard the bilge pump going so I tried to turn it off but it wouldn't shut off. I remembered that it had an automatic feature to turn itself on if there is water in the boat so I popped the hood and sure enough there was water. We raced back to the boat launch and pulled the boat out and let it drain. Boy, I'm a dumbass.   &nbsp; Well Joanne didn't have the surgery because her crappy ass insurance forgot to mention that we needed to pay $1000 at the time of the surgery. I'm going to be putting her of my insurance next month anyway so we said "screw you, we'll see you next month". Even though Joanne works as an insurance underwriter she has the absolute worse company insurance policy I have ever seen. Her dentist insurance cost a staggering $80 a month while mine cost ~$3.50 a month and mine is far superior than hers. It's cheaper to pay cash for the dentist than to have the insurance and her medical is not much better.

      &nbsp; Joanne is having surgery this afternoon having to do with her girly parts. I'm sure she's told me exactly what and why this is happening but I've since put it out of my mind (and I have trouble listening to women to begin with as Joanne and all my ex's will attest to). It doesn't suppose to be a big deal but that doesn't help her stress level any so I want this over with ASAP then all ask her again what the hell just happened.   &nbsp; Yesterday wasn't so great for me as far as my stocks were concerned. One of my favorites took a major header and a little over half it's value in just a few minutes (when I wasn't looking of course). Something about being investigated for something or other and add to the fact my other stock picks aren't doing so well at the moment I have come to the conclusion of I CAN'T PICK STOCKS! I might get lucky and recover next year when I want to cash out but short turn I suck and suck hard at this I do.

      &nbsp; I originally thought blogging was stupid and just another crappy Internet fad (and I still do believe that in a sense) but now I have come up with a use for it and I found out it was pretty much free. I can now vent my frustrations and keep people who know me up to date on what I'm doing without actually talking to them! I know most people don't want to talk to me and I can't blame them being that I tend to blow people off because they are not computers so now they can see how I run my pathetic life, my bad grammar, and my love of run-on sentences. I'm hoping my friends will adopt similar strategies so I can butt into their lives without having to use up my cell phone minutes. I have to go to the bathroom now.

        After glancing at some of the other blogs on this site I was reminded of all the things I hate about people. Here's a few pet peeves of mine that I seen out there.  1. PeoPLe THaT TyPe LiKe THiS - WTF? Stop FuK'n dOiNg tHat, i hAtE U bItChEs.  2. L33T Sp3@k - This is getting old though I have done it myself.  3. Goths and EMOs - We called these people punks back in the day but they are all the same. It just one more cliché group of dumbass kids like jocks, nerds, stoners, preps, and Eskimos. They all belong to one group in my eye which I call "morons".  4. Spammers. I don't know who the hell Nikki Nova is but there are a thousand blogs here that just advertise her porn crap! I don't want to PAY for porn!  5. Religious nutz - So you are full of Christ love and a big fat Christian hypocrite, you know how boring that is to read? I don't bore people with my love of killing kittens so don't bore me with your love of killing doctors who perform abortions…or breast implants.  6. Negative people like myself - What's worse than people bitching about what other people do that's none of their business?  7.  urlLink Homeowner's Associations  - Useless, you pay people to tell you what you can't do to your own house. Promotes animosity between neighbors and makes me not want to change the color of my blinds.  8. Teenagers - Anyone having to deal with one on a regular basis knows what I'm talking about. Their total disregard for logic or reasoning just baffles me to no end. I remember being a teenager and I thought I was the smartest kid in the world until I hit my 20s and realized what a big dumbass I really was. Why do they think that older people are actually dumber then they are? That's like telling a 16 yr old that a 10 yr old is smarter than them because a 10 yr old thinks that being 16 is old and at 10 they already know everything that there is to know. Oh, and one more thing, PULL YOUR GODDAMN PANTS UP! Why in the hell do they think that looking like a complete jackass makes them cool?  9. Poets - I'd rather raped anally by a bull rhino with salt as a lubricant than to read these painfully gay poems that some people feel necessary to post as a blog. Puke.  10. France    That's enough hate for today but rest assured, I still saved a little for all of you!

Joanne's 17 yr old is apparently allergic to fire ants and had to go to the hospital for a few hours after about 30 minutes of getting there. There were tons of mosquitoes and I slightly bent my prop on the boat (the lake has alot of shallow points) but it turned out alright. I'm still tired from it all so screw this crap.

I gotta remember to take my camera so I can show the world how sad and pathetic I am.

       Just a few more days till D-Day. I try to tell myself that it's no big deal and I'll just truck on through but I can feel the pressure building inside. I have something like a social anxiety disorder or I'm just shy I don't know but I DO NOT like to be the center of attention and this I can't avoid. There is only going to be about 40 people there but that's 39 more than I like (don't correct me on the math, I know what I'm doing) so the sooner this is over the better in my book. I don't have a problem being married, I just don't like weddings.   Andrew is trying to be more helpful and that makes it difficult for me lay the hammer on him. This is a good thing but he still has many problems that till pisses me off. He has to go to court here soon for a traffic ticket and we recently got a notice that 2 incidents related to school haven't been resolved so they may revoke his license. One was "disrupting class" by which he cursed out a teacher and the cop trying to restrain him and he had gotten community service for it but never did any. The other was "failure to attend class" even though he was no longer going to that school and in fact, may had already dropped out of school by then. Each of those is $100 not counting whatever fine he'll get and we can't really afford to pay for his mistakes (he currently doesn't have a job and was a minor when these things happened). He suppose to have an interview today so here's hoping.

       ...for a Klondike bar?   I'm swapping my blog name with the title I used for this post because I think that's funnier plus since nobody reads this crap I'm guessing nobody cares.  My overmedicated mother may be down a day early, gives me more time to make fun of her I guess. So far at work nobody has come down on me for last week which is good but they are giving me a bunch of work to do. I got my haircut and I'm spending most my time at home cleaning now before everyone shows up. I'm not looking forward to feeding 8 or 9 people all weekend and trying to fit everyone on the boat but as long as they promise NEVER to come over again I can deal with it. Let's see, we'll have my mother, my step-father, Jo's mother, Jo's sister, Jo's nephew, Jo's 2 sons, and of course us 2 so that's 9 peeps. Hope everyone likes Mac &amp; Cheese....and crap.  Found out that my Sport Trac has the highest rollover rating than any vehicle. That's super duper! Makes sense though, it's narrow and long and pretty high off the ground which equals high speed turning fun.

        This will be a slow week on blogtown, between all the wedding crap and goofy family members on their way here (there will be a total on 9 people staying in our house by this weekend) I'm not going to have time to be blogging. I know this must upset my reader of Juan (get it, Juan = one! OMG I'm so fuck'n funny!) but you'll just have to suffer for about a week. I got some more stuff coming down the pipe that I can't comment on yet so just you wait, and by "you" I mean "shut up!" since I'm so tired I can barely typo coherent sentences. I need some crack.    Haven't got bitched out for last week yet, of course the day is still young.

       urlLink     One more week till the wedding.   I'm looking forward to the wedding next week, much like I did for my root canal I had last year. Between the wedding, people coming down to stay with me for the wedding, my g-ma in the hospital, JoJo's PMS, and having a crisis situation all week at work I'm started to feel a little stressed. You might say something like, "Rob, that's normal and you shouldn't worry too much about it." then I would reply "Shut the hell up, nobody was talking to you!" and hit you repeatedly until you lost consciousness, then I'd kick you.  Work has been alot of fun this week. It's kind of like the first week in prison with all the other inmates tossing me around to see who's bitch I'll become and everyone gets a turn. It looks like it's over now but I'm sure my boss will want to "talk" to me next week when he gets back from vacation. I should pick up some K-Y this weekend in case it gets ugly.

       urlLink     I got birds up in the hizzouse.     I have a few security cameras in my house (mainly in the bedrooms and bathrooms but don't tell anyone) and the one on my front porch apparently makes a good place for a nest. I've been too lazy to get up there and evict them but now it seems something bad has happened to them so I now need to get off my girlie ass and fix it. If you look closely at the pic, you'll see that the camera and nest are tilted and the occupants seem to have disappeared without paying rent so the camera is pretty much useless, or more useless since it's not pointing at a neighbor's window. Next week should be fun since the freaks, I mean family, will be coming down to eat my food and stress my life out accordingly. I'm looking forward to writing about JoJo's lesbian sister and her psychotic girlfriend, oh joy.

       urlLink     Make my license plate, biatch! (My sister is the middle one)   Ordered wedding cake, got marriage license, and visited my grandmother in the hospital yesterday and it looks like she wont make it to the wedding. Well as an interesting side note, my sister's ex-boyfriend and father of 2 of her kids has been living off her for the past 2 years and is getting the boot, care of my family. My sister is an evil little bitch and tends to only date drug users so I have little sympathy for her or her "associates" but I pity her children for having such loser parents. This guy has now got a decent job now but doesn't want to leave because he may have to start paying bills and stuff. Since my grandmother will no longer be able to maintain the house and pay for all his shit then everyone decided his time is up. Let me tell you a little story about him and my sister to give you an idea of what drug addicts are like.  A few years ago this guy (the same as above) and my sister wanted their own place so they decided to get a new trailer. My grandmother being the saint that she is decided to co-sign for a new one for them and they were going to make payments on it. Well after a couple of years and them NOT MAKING ONE SINGLE PAYMENT my grandmother decided that she could no longer afford paying the lot cost, trailer cost, gas money, phone bills, and food so she said they needed to leave. My bitch of a sister claimed squatter's rights and my grandmother had to get a lawyer to get her out. She got out but not before trashing the trailer and removing all the door knobs (?). Before that there was this one time she asked to borrow her car to go pick up something and she and the car disappeared for a week. My father had to take her to work everyday and he eventually found the car on the side of the road in another town. There are many more stories like that but I've typed enough already. My sister is currently serving a 10 year sentence for selling drugs and a firearm charge and I don't feel the least bit sorry for her.   Being that I grew up in Mesquite and I'm a big computer nerd, I had an interested in the going on's of ID Software (the make Doom 1-3, Quake 1-3 and a couple of other games). We used to drive by their building back in the day and admire their Ferraris and other fancy cars. Anyway, Doom 3 just came out (based on my life's story I might add) and here's a little commercial for it.  urlLink Doom 3 by Fanta!

       urlLink     If they would only teach this in school.   We are in what we call "Hell week" or if you want to use the technical term, "PMS". This is a joyous time when some women (Joanne) become a big bouncing ball of emotions that grows and grows until we can no longer play with it because it crushes our fragile bones. As "empathic" as I am with people "that are not me" I can not begin to compensate for the extra support women need during this time which is probably due to my lack of trying. I simple just suck it up and wait it out and do a lot of "there, there, it'll all work out next week when you're not an emotional wreck".  There is a bit of extra stress this time since the wedding is coming up and people actually think we are going to have a normal traditional wedding and it's really just a tiny thing that we could have done in our backyard. Oh great now I'm starting to get stressed! Thanks a lot people I really didn't need this, I hate you! I'm just kidding, I just really, really, really, dislike you, alot.

       urlLink     City of the Damned    current mood:  anal  currently listening to:  voices in my head  Went out on boat, got sunburned, wakeboarded, grandmother had hip surgery (replaced the ball joint that she "shattered", holy freaking hell that's sick), picked up Joanne's nephew at airport, and missed my mother's birthday (just now remembered it was yesterday). Same old crap I do every weekend.  In case someone wants to come by and harass me by trying to sell me magazines (or kill me) I have included a urlLink  map of my town  with labels to make it easy to find me. My brother has access to a satellite imaging site and sent me a pic of my town. I only ask that you make it a quick death.  Of interest is the fact that there is a  urlLink big ass mansion  down the street from me. I like to take vistors over to see it when they come by because it seems so out of place.
