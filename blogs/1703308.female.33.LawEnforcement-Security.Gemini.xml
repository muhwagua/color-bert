      This past Christmas I read a great book called (The Missional Church). This is a must read book for anyone who is struggling with the current system of doing church in the North American context. For many years I had a sense that we needed to view ourselves as missionaries right here in our own back yard. I was so caught up in the book that I read it in just a couple of days. It is a book that I will hand on to and continue to read and re-read. I also was drawn into the idea of being an embodiement of God's Kingdom here and now. This book was a great affirmation to be moving in the direction of organic church planting that seeks to establish missional communities.

      Look at this two days in a row. I'm on a role!!!  Syndie is away this wekend for a ladies scrap booking party. Great quality time for me and my three kids. Last night and today my older daughter has been sick with a flu bug. So along with all of the regular responsibilities of kids care, I have been cleaning up puke and washing every set of sheets on all our beds.   It has been a great  opportunity to learn more aspects of being a servant to those I love and care deeply for.

      I am still getting into the groove of blogging on a regular basis. :)  ....   Today God has done some incredible things in our lives.          This morning I had breakfast with two guys in my community who are in process to go overseas to work in the 10/40 window with muslim people groups. The coollest part of the time was seeing how we are going to be "runnning partners". Both of the guys need to do training/internship in organic/house church planting before they go overseas. We decided to read and interact with the various trainig materials together. Very excited about this opportunity!! ...   The other awesome thing was my wifes Dr.'s appointment. In the process of sharing her medical history with her new Arab-American Dr. she mentioned that she has lost a considerable ammount of weight. Her Dr. congradulated her on the loosing so much weight and wanted to know her "secret". Syndie told her that she stopped eating for comfort or emotional reasons. She only ate when she was hungry and stopped when she was full. Along with this she said that she had found a close and personal relationship with Jesus Christ that met her at her point of deepest need and allowing her to find transendence, meaning, and community. Her Dr. was very curious and asked questions. It is so awesome to see how God can use everyday moments like a Dr.'s appointment to sow potent "kingdom seeds", when we are seeking to live life the way God intended.   I also just finished reading Wolfgang Simson's book, "House's that change the world". Again it was a book I had for some time but for whatever reason had not read. It is a definate must read for those wanting to be catalysts of organic kingdom church planting.

      This is a swap out from my other blog.[1/14/2003 10:14:32 PM | James Best] This past weekend my wife Syndie and I had an incredible time away to talk and pray. We originally anticipated this was going to be a time of seeking God about our future plans. As the time came to go away God had already leading us and revealing in powerful ways. Our time away was a time of rejoicing in God's plans, futher cinfirmation that we are heading in the right direction, and consecrating ourselves for this unique call. Right before we left someone gave me a card with this on it.   Want to know what God has for you? Answer this question,   "What ignites your heart" ... Max Lucado   More to come. [edit] [1/8/2003 10:53:51 AM | James Best] I had a great time this past weekend catching up with some old friends from California. My friends, Rob, Cara, Conner, and baby to be came to Canton to share with us in person about the stirrings God is placing in their heart. You can check it out there sac mission blog. There time with us was a great time of affermation and direction for what God has in store for us. [edit]  [11/19/2002 4:07:49 PM | James Best] Why would we use a adjective like MISSIONAL? A good article has been written by Todd Hunter that explains this very well.  Todd Hunter Article [edit]  [11/18/2002 9:57:29 AM | James Best] The Exciting Journrey- Jim and Syndie Best are sensing the call of God to begin a new organic missional/kingdom community in Canton, Mi.

      Recently my wife and I have been praying for God to connect us with some people in our area who are on a similar journay as us in regard to missional communities and organic church planting.  Well God has begun to answer those prayers!! Yesterday someone forwared me a email of a group in Ann Arbor, MI who made a transition to a simple church/house church fromat. They have had lots of resistence from the other "traditional" churches inthere area as seeing them as legitimate. I conntacted the group and I will hopefully have lunch with one of there leaders next week.  I also am beginning to get nibbles on the bites my friend Rob Lane got for me at the Allelon Gathering in Idaho last week. Through the "friends of friends network" I have the names of two couples right here in Metro Detroit, and two other contacts on the Western part of the state as well.  I so excited to start networkworking with like minded people here in Michigan.

      Today my family is feeling better. A good friend brought over dinner for our family. He said, "why should families with new babies be the only ones for a helping hand."     I received a very cool email from my friend  urlLink Rob Lane  telling me about his time last week in Idaho at the Allelon Gathering put on by  urlLink Todd Hunter . God did some profound affirmation and teaching in his life. He was able to make many new life long friends.  He also was able to do some networking in proxy for me and got me the names of two people in Michigan that are on a similar journey. I am eager to make contact with and see what develops.  Tomorrow my wife and I have an appointment with a mortgage company to see what kind of home aka. mission outpost we will be able to purchase.

      Sorry it has been a while. :(  A lot has been happing in our family, but as the dust is settling we can proudly say that we are going to be home owners in the very near future!!  God has lead us to a great place for our family and organic church planting needs in Westland, MI. Westland is the next town (east) from Canton to Detroit proper.  This is a big descision but we have an incredible peace from God about it. It was very encouraged this morning as I read Psalm 37. It was just what my heart and soul needed.  I am also happy to report that I made a great connection with Matthew Jones and his house church that meets in Ann Arbor. It was great to talk to a kindred spirit who wants what is happing in other parts of the world and USA come to the Metro Detroit area.   Today we are with my wifes family in Canada. Several people want to talk about American politics because of the impending war with Iraq. Politics is not a topic I care much about. I would rather talk about the inbreaking of the Kingdom amoung us.  Time to order authentic Canadian/Chinese takeout! Anyone else want some! :)  That's it for now.

        Well, We are still waiting for the seller to sign an offer statement from us in order to move this home buying process forward. He called last night and said he would make himself avalible to do it tonight. Hopefully I will good news about this tomorrow.  This morning is had a great time reading some passages of scripture out of the  Message . Here are some of the things that really hit home to me as I read and meditated on them.   Prov 13:7 - A pretentious life is an empty life; a plain and simple life is a full life.    Proverbs 13:9-  Souls who follow their heart thrive.    Ephesians chp 1 - It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. Long before wefirst heard of Christ and got our hopes up, he had his eye on us, had designs on us for a glorious living, part of the over all purpose he is working out in everything and everyone.

      Lots of details still need to come together for our house. Hopefully by the end of today we will have a signed written offer.  This weekend I read a great little book or pamphlet called,  From Brokenness to Community , by Jean Vaier. It is only 52 small pages but worh it weight in gold. It is published by Paulist Press with a copyright of 1992. The author was the founder of the L' Arche Communities. It speaks to the dire need we all have for community in our life in order to live life the way God intened.  Here is an appitizer from page 52-   We feel small and weak, but we are gathered together to signify the power of God who transforms death into life. That is our hope, that God is doing the impossible: changing death to life inside of each of us, and that perhaps, through our community, each of us can be agents in the world of this transformation of brokenness into wholeness, and of death into life.

      The trip to grand rapids yesterday was a great success. I received a lot more money for the used books I sold than I had inticipated. I was able to get some new reading material for the giant bookworm with the money. :)  It was also a good time to to dream and pray with Syndie on the way there. Moments like we had togehter in the van are very precious for us. Many thanks to our friends from small group that looked after the kids while we we gone on the day trip.  Syndie just got back from another Creative Memory neighborhood outreach thing. Just for the purpose of continuing incarnate relationships with the people on our street.  Time to go and order some chinese take out for dinner.

      Today we had a home inspection done on the place that we are planning to buy. The place came through with flying colors.   Made a good early contact with a guy by the name of Chris Marshall in the Cincy, OH area. He is going to be leading a "idea lab" on missional communities at the Off The Map Conference Syndie and I will be going to the first weekend in April. I emailed him and asked him if it would be possible to come and observe first hand what they do at their church/missional community called Ordinary Community. He said he wanted to hook up at the conference and we could set somthing up for later this year. The other cool thing is that Chris and our friends Rob and Cara Lane had hooked up out in Idaho at the Allelon gathering.  Tomorrow I am heading off to Grand Rapids to sell a van load of my books at Baker Books. I am really wanted to simplify and pear down my library to resources that are pertanent to post-modern, simple, organic, missional, Kingdom life. I am hoping to get store credit and buy some books of my wish list. Which includes authors such as- Stan Grenz Miraslov Volfe Thom Oden Ron Sider Stanley Hauerwas Ron Sider Roger Olson

       Our Kingdom B(ig)H(airy)A(udacious)G(oal)   We dream of a day in the not so distant future where the reality of the Kingdom of Heaven is lived out and experienced in the following described community of faith.  ·**A community based on gatherings of 2 to 20 people who meet together in homes (or wherever) in simple and natural ways. ·**A community where these simple, organic groups exist as a way of life so that people experience real and lasting relationships. ·**A community that lives out its faith in an ancient-future lifestyle that draws on spiritual practices from the past and present. ·**A community where discipleship and Kingdom living are woven into all areas of life in a way that is simple, potent and lived out in the context of grace-filled relationships. ·**A community that sees evangelism as a loving pursuit of God’s missing children. ·**A community that is more people based than building and program based. ·**A community where large group gatherings are secondary and infrequent in order that small, simple groups remain the primary focus. ·**A community where leadership follows the servant model of Jesus with the goal of seeing each person equipped and released for Kingdom life. ·**A community where each person is a vital part of “family life” and is expected to contribute and serve as enabled by the Holy Spirit. ·**A community that is part of a revolution of epic proportions as it seeks to birth other like-minded communities of faith in Metro Detroit and beyond.  We give ourselves wholeheartedly to pursue and live out this Kingdom venture and pray for like-minded people to join with us.  Sole Dei Gloria  Jim and Syndie Best

      Well everything will be all systems go on our home purchase after tomorrows home inspection. The seller has signed off on all of the necessary paper work. If all goes well we should be able to move into our new place on March 22. The kids are very excited to move which is good.  Yesterday I stayed home and took care of my 7 year old daughter who was running a temp. It was a good time to spend  with her and I taught her how to play the card game Uno. She really liked and wanted to play it this morning before she went to school.  Monday of this week I made contact with another person who is looking to do organic church planting with 20 somethings in the Lansing, Mi area around the Michigan State campus. We are going to get together and talk when he gets back from the emergent village conf in San Diego. It is so cool to see how God is opening doors and beginning to network.

      Today has been a sunny winter day!!  This morning I was challenged by some passages I read in the book of  urlLink Mark .  Mark 2:15-17- That night Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to be his dinner guests, along with his  fellow tax collectors and many other notorious sinners.  ( There were many people of this kind among the crowds that followed Jesus.) 16But when some of the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees* saw him eating with people like that, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with such scum ?"17When Jesus heard this, he told them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor--sick people do. I have come to call sinners, not those who think they are already good enough."  I jusy felt challenged to look at who I spend time with and if I am putting my self in incarnate relationships with spititually "sick" people.  Lord, make me compassionate to those who are sick and and apart from you.  I am also reading a good book entitled, The Garden of the Soul- Cultivating Your Spiritual Life, by Keri Wyatt.   The garden of the soul needs both the fertilizer of community and the rest of solitude to thrive.

      I am pretty excited because I just got off the phone with Neil Cole with Church Muluiplication Associates in So. Cal. I had faxed him for permission to use the  urlLink core values  that I had seen on the CMA website. He said that it would be fine to use them. We also chatted briefly about the upcoming Organic Greenhouse in Indianna and possibility of becoming a part of the CMA Family as we begin a network of simple churches in the Detroit area. I continue to be excited about the adventure God is orchestrating for us.

      More details coming together for our home purchase. Today, the FHA is doing their appraisal/inspection and the City of Westland is doing a certificate of occupency inspection. The seller confirmed with us that he will be ready for us to move in on the 22nd of March providing all the paperwork from the loan is secured.  I had a very cool phone conversation with a guy by the  urlLink Nathan Kimball  on Sunday afternoon. He is a friend of a friend of some people who were out at the Todd Hunter/Allelon event in Idaho and connected with my college room mate  urlLink Rob Lane  and his wife cara. The church he is a part of in Roayl Oak, MI has a very missional focus. Hopefully we will get together with our families soon so we can encourage each other and cross pollinate.  I finished reading two good books this weekend.  Leadership Is An Art,  by  urlLink Max DePree  and  Missionary Methods- St. Pauls or Ours , by  urlLink Roland Allen . The are both recommended reads. I will give a sample taste from each book.   Leadership is an art-   Leadership is much more an art, a belief, a condition of the heart, than a set of things to do. The visible signs of artful leadership are expressed, ultimately, in its practice.   Missionary Methods-  The work of the missionary is not to call men from the heathen temple into the church of God but to trim the dimly glowing lamp of God in the heathen temple, and por into it a few drops of the oil of Christian doctrine till it shine with a new radience.   I just started reading  urlLink Mustard Seed verse Mc World  by Tom Sine.

      Lots of good things happenig in our lives these days, but it seems like we continue to grapple with three questions for our future life and ministry.  1) " When are you going to start?"  ... This is a hard question because for us this is so tied to a new kingdom lifestyle as much as it is looking to do church in a more organic or missional context. I keep telling people, "we have allready started by reordering the way we do life!" We keep saying that we want to live life the way he intended. There is also a part of this question that continues to raise the issue of transition an how we do move into this. Our current job/church structure has some limitations to fully pursue our dream and vision. But to we adjust our dream? Do we become more realistic? Are to be boldly and confidently go in the direction God is leading?!!  2)  Why a house church?  I'm not sure how we got locked into the form of a house church allready in some people's minds. Our bi-line in our name say's "a network of small missional communities." It really is so much mor to us than steppimg away from the traditional format to switch to a format that is in our house. We dream of being a geographical congregation of missional or simple churches that focus on living out the reality of God's Kingdom here and now. The other part of house church name problem is the notion of being a small inwarding looking group. This is the fartherst thing from our dream! We want to be extremely focused on reaching out to the missing children of God within our sphere of influences.  3)  "How will you support your family?"  I keep telling myself a quote from Wolfgang Simson's book from a pastor in Madras, India. "What God orders, he pays for." But trying to work that out with concerned family and friends that's an other thing. I can be so confident in God's promise in this quote and then I get a letter from my Grandma who would like to consider not sending us a $100 dollars a month because I have a FT church salary at the moment. I feel God has led me to look for a FT job in the market place arena but it is hard not to doubt at times when you have a BA in Bible and not much in marketable skills.  More good things are happenig in the arena of connecting with like minded people in Michigan. Just this past week I made a good connection with two guys from the Lansing area.  The one fellow is named  urlLink Chad Farrand . He is on staff at a EFCA church in the Lansing area. He also moderates an Emergent Village Gathering for  urlLink Mid-Michigan  the third Tuesday of every month. I am very excited to be a part of while my pator schedule will allow, again this is the sort of thing that messes with my head about being in the market place FT.  Please pray for us as we journey into the heart of God to reach His missing chilren around us.

      A lot has happened in the last week for me. Lots of ups and downs as i seek to navigate life and ministry and at the same time follow God's call into new uncharted water for me.  My last blog showed showed some of the deep questions I have been wrestilng with the past couple of weeks. The wrestling has been good because it has strenghting my resolve and my faith in god that I am doing the right thing.  We continue to be in a holding pattern with our closing paperwork for our house. The papers are at underwriting and she be done at any time. If we have not heard anything specific by tomorrow, we will need to postpone our moving truck for saturday.  Thurday and Friday I will be going to the state High School Basket ball playoffs. It should be a lot of fun and be sort of a mini-vacation for me.  We are really looking forward to going to the Off the Map conference the first weekend in April. Syndie and I have both been devoring the pre-reading material that they sent to us.  Here is the link if you are intertested.   urlLink Off the Map Reading List

      Tomorrow I head down to the Philidelphia with Syndie to attend the Off the Map conference. I have been looking forward to going to for some time. It is hard to believe the time is now.  We continue to get settled into our new home and neighborhood. Yesterday we were able to go to the Kindergarten round up at the elementary school on our street which is about four blocks away. Emily and Sam will both attend there next fall. Sam will be in kindergarten and Emily will be in 3rd grade. We are praying that we will be able to be a part of the school PTA and also down the road maybye the school board. We are really positioning our family to be salt and light and operate with a missional mindset.  I would also like to ask for prayer for us. Syndie had a routine physical and they removed a questionable mole on her leg. They are sending in for testing and will have the results in a couple of weeks. She is very sore and they put in five stitches to close the incision.  I will post more we we are back from Philly.

      WOW !! Sorry it has been several days since I have posted a blog. I have been so wrapped up in all of the details of our move to our new place in Westland.  Last Friday we finally sat down and did al the closing paper. It took 1 1/2 hours to sign all of the paperwork because we had a FHA loan.  We our so excited to be into our new place. It has been neat to tell people the story of how God led us through the whole process.  It has also been cool to tell people why this is where we are going to spend the rest of our lives verses the notion of a starter home and then move on to bigger and better things.  We have all of our stuff moved in and unpacked. We are now at the point of hanging pictures and filling drawers.  This Friday we are heading down to Philidelphia for the Off the Map Conference. Please pray that we would have safety traveling down, and we will be able to make some key ministry connections.

      I recently have been sharing our vision and dream of being a missional community in the western suberbs of metro-detroit with some friends. One friend in particular sent me an email that summerizes well what God has placed in my heart.   Hi Jim,   I guess the appropriate focus-group term is "processing" with regard to your vision for this new church work as described last night.  Perhaps it's a reflection of how far I have come in the past few years that I do not simply dismiss your strategy as backsliding, which was what I'd associated with this type of endeavor in the past. Dropping out of "church," leaving "full time ministry" and getting a "real job" would indicate a step in the wrong direction for any servant of God, but you make a compelling argument that has intrigued me like little does, except maybe what to do with my property in (a US state).  I wonder if I may articulate your argument in my own words, like the repeating back technique you recommend for communicating with (wife's name), just so I get it?  First of all, you are redefining terms.  "Church" is not an organizational structure with a payroll, staff, property, or a yellow pages ad.  It is not a distinctive meeting time, place, or system of corporate rituals and traditions.  It is the pure New Testament description of believers getting together informally in each others homes.  There are no committees, preludes, board meetings, or nursery schedules.  There are no Sabbath days, no Sunday dresses, polyester suits, or Easter cantatas.  Everyone knows pretty much everyone else, no visitor cards, membership classes, or pastor's chats.  "Full time ministry" is literally full time, not eight hours a day five days a week, or one morning a weekend.  And a "real job" is just a job, where you are a real person, not a figure to whom folks impulsively stop swearing around or take off their hats to.  Spiritual gifts are not qualifications to fill slots on an organizational chart, but individual expressions of compassion, love and empathy being used personally to meet needs as they arise.  Leaders are not nominated, approved, or elected but simply rise to address occasions as they come up, within the maturity of the individual.    Training is not done in a classroom, during a seminar, or over a weekend retreat but while shopping, doing the yard work, at the ball game, washing the car, or killing time during a power outage.  It is an environment where there is no image management, since everyone knows you anyway.  A safe place away from the world, if only for a few minutes of relief.    Kids do not behave one way at school and another at "church" since their peers are their peers.    Rather than raising the bar, you propose to lay it on the ground.  It would be easy to say that this is simply a knee-jerk reaction to a somewhat frustrating ministry.  Your Dad seems to have had a more or less unsatisfying experience as a pastor, Syndie has chafed under her parents church ideas, you both had the church from hell in California, and neither one of you get a full measure of recognition at CCC.  However, I know you well enough to know you relish lessons experienced during those learning times, and see them as necessary and profitable parts of preparation for a bigger plan, not a string of disasters.  I also realize that pure folly is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  I have witnessed God moving so many people in different directions, myself included, that I cannot begin to fathom the complexity of His master plan.  I acknowledge that God is not "traditional," and He reserves the right to be results oriented as long as His servants are willing to be "obedience" oriented.  Church as we have known it is becoming increasing irrelevant in our culture at large, even as we insist that God is all that is truly relevant.    Pitching the last couple of millennium of church is not going to be easy for me.  When you first asked me to help you with a church plant, I was not very interested.  I can honestly say, this is the most interesting church I have ever conceived.    If this is truly God's easy yoke design, I marvel at how complicated we have made it.     Will it work?

      This morning I had a great breakfast meeting with two kingdom buddies at the Denny's in Novi Michigan. We are trying to get to know each other better and see how we can navigate the post modern waters while we seek to live out and establish missional communities here in Michigan.  Right now I'm blogging from a public library which I think is a good place for a future "office". I use the term loosely. :)  Well this is short and sweet.

Hill, Relevant Books, 2001  Here are a few quotes from the book that grabbed my attention.  One of the biggest problems the church faces right now is spiritual boredom. Why? Because believers were never made for a program or an institution , or a weekly pew-warming ceremony. Christians were never made to be satisfied by a three-point outline that contains just enough advice to get over the "hump" of the week. The human heart was made for passion. It was created for relationship. It was designed for the fullness of God.  S.J. Hill  Can I tell you something? You were made for another world, another reality. Your greatest happiness, fullfillment, and pleasure will only be found in the heart of God.  C.S. Lewis  God, of your goodness give me yourself, for you are enough for me. If I ask anything less I know I shall continue to want. Only in you I have everything. Julian of Norwich  I am also doing a quick re-read of the Celtic Way of Evangelism by George Hunter.  This was a description of St. Patrick's love for the Celtic people.  His love for his adopted people shines through his writings, and it is not just a generalized "Christian" benevolence, but a love for individuals as they are ... He worries constantly for his people, not just for their spiritual but for their physical welfare ... Patrick has become an Irishman.

      Syndie and I had a great time this past weekend at the Off the Map Conf. in Pennsylvania. It was the best material I have interacted and experienced in regard to reaching out to God's missing children. If anyone reading this has not checked out the Off the Map website it is worth it is a must. urlLink  www.off-the-map.org  We also made some great connections with like minded kingdom friends.   I was also very happy to have meet in person Chris Marshal from Ordinary Community and Kevin Rains from Vineyard Central. I am going to take a road trip to visit first hand what each of them is doing with their respective missional community in the Cincinatti, OH area.  It was also a great time to talk and dream and pray with Syndie for the 9 hours each way there. We could not have done it without the help of some great friends from our small group who looked after the kids while we drove there and back.  Tonight there are forcasting six inches of snow for tomorrow.

      Last night I could not sleep so I read a book called, The Insider- Bringing the Kingdom of God into your everyday world.  The vital part insiders play in God's work is still undervalued and marginalized. Insiders are not missionary biography material. They don't eaven make the church bulletin! Yet they are key to what to what God is about in the world today.p.64  We like to think that there are to taking the gospel to the nations of the world. As a society of entrepreneurs it's hard for us to accept the idea that shortcuts might not exist. We believe that if we can just plan a little bigger and can give enough money we can make it happen. But it does not work that way. p.48  Living out one's kingdom citizenship here and now is foundational to one's fruitfullness as an insider. That is because we are sowing seed by giving glimpes of the ways of the Kingdom to the people in our traffic patterns. We are serving notice to them that the eternal has, indeed, invaded the present! p. 35  God intends that every part of our daily life should line up with his purposes, to his glory. We believe this is somthing that is within reach for all of us, not just a gifted few. p.25  Being an insider requires a change in venue. It requires connecting with people where they are, on their turf, and at times when they are availible. p.77

       I would like to share some more thoughts that have caught my attention and made me ponder how I can have this be a greater part of my relationship and life with God.   From The Confessions of Augustine    I came to love you late, O Beauty so ancient and so new; I came to love you late … You called me, you shouted to me, you broke past my deafness. You bathed me in your light, you wrapped me in your splendor, you sent my blindness reeling. You gave out such a delightful fragrance, and I drew it in and came breathing hard after you. I tasted, and it made me hunger and thirst; you touched me, and I burned to know your peace.  Enjoying God, by S.J. Hill, p.21,22   The Divine Romance   You were not looking for a program. You were not looking for am institution. You were not looking for a somewhere by for a Someone. It’s sad that over the years the Gospel has been rarely depicted as a divine romance. The Church’s approach to the gospel has often been to reduce it to nothing more than a formula. Some modern methods of evangelism resemble an IRS 1040 form: It’s got all the information, but it does not take your breath away.   Enjoying God, by S.J. Hill, p.19   Conversation continue with Navigator's. Here is are a couple  of the vision staements they have: Envision Yourself ... ... Living in a city .. not alone .. but with friends who are enjoying God and each other ... and who are partnering together with God in the biggest thing He is doing: * Calling us to a deeper love for Him, * Caring for each other like Christ, * Drawing friends to Himself .. where we live, work, and play.   Living room size teams of Christians "infecting" their neighborhoods, workplaces, the inner-city, social networks, and campuses with the transformational message of Christ.   A small team of friends banding together to bring Christ to those they live near, work with, and play with.  Next week we head to Chicago to celebrate 10 years of marriage. We have been looking forward to this for some time. It will be a time of celebration for all God has done and a time to dream and pray about what God has in store for us.

      Tomorrow we have a meeting with some regional people with the Navigator Orginization her in Metro-Detroit. There have started a new initiative in North America to develop what the call " urlLink Mission Outposts " and a dersire to raise up people to live as  urlLink "insiders"   I also wanted to include some things I have recently read as well.  From The Confessions of Augustine  I came to love you late, O Beauty so ancient and so new; I came to love you late … You called me, you shouted to me, you broke past my deafness. You bathed me in your light, you wrapped me in your splendor, you sent my blindness reeling. You gave out such a delightful fragrance, and I drew it in and came breathing hard after you.

      Well, I just dropped my wife off at the airport to fly back down to Chicago. She is going to be attending the Worship Together Conference at Judson College in Elgin, IL. She is really been lookling forward to this. One of the key speakers will be Brian McLaren.  I will be in charge of all three kids while she is away. It will be fun to focus in on them for a couple of days. Everytime she goes away I think I need to learn how to cook better because it is allways such a adventure when I am in charge of the food preperation. Tonight I promised the kids we would go to McDonalds.  Tonight I am slated to watch the matrix for the first time ever. Yes, I have been living under a rock to have not seen it yet. I figured I needed to hurry up and see it before the sequel comes out next week. My friend Doug has it on DVD and he is going to drop by after I get the kids off to bed. He is sacrificing a playoff came (Piston's/Sixer's) to do this with me. So that is a tribute to friendship or the movie, hopefully both.  We continue to dialouge with Nav and how we can have some sort of symbiotic kingdom oriented relationship. In fact I shared some of our vision/dream material with the regional director and he incorperated it into some of their material in regard to forming Mission Outposts.

      My wife and I just returned from a great week of vacation in Chicago. We were able to see and do  a lot while we were there, and do it in a way that was enjoying and relaxing. We had a great hotel 1 block from Michigan Ave. We only payed $40 a night for it. Priceline panned out for us once again. :)  There were a lot of changes from when we used to live there about 8 years a go. Our old apartment at 869 N. LaSalle was open for rent. It is currently renting for $1,200. It was only $750 when we lived there.  We stopped by our alma mater and filled out the "look who is visiting card" in the alumni deparment. For those fellow alumni look and see if they write in the next alumni news letter.  I was excited to find a book that I have looked at several stores to no avail. It is titled, Birth of a Chaordic Age, by Dee Hock. It was a book highly recommended by the pastor of westwinds community church in Jackson, MI (Ron Martoia). On thursday of last week we holed up in a Starbuck's at North Avenue and Well's Street while it rained and I read several chapters. I will post some quotes from it next time.  Tomorrow my parents are going to arrive for Charleston, IL for a couple of day visit.

      Sorry for the delay in my blog posting. I have had phone problems at home and Internet problems at work.   A lot has happened since my last posting.  I have read my first fiction book in years, {A New Kind of Christian}. I also have watched several movies in the last week or so.  Matrix The Fight Club Castaway Catch Me If You Can Two-Week Notice Matrix Reloaded  It is so amazing that almost all of these movies looked at the question of our ultimate meaning and purpose for living in one way or another. I am trying to do a better job of watching current movies to understand the cultural ethos we live in and have a way to converse with people I interact with.  My wife Syndie is out of town for a ladies retreat.   Tomorrow I am hoping to install a dishwasher in our kitchen with the help of a good friend.  I started reading the sequel to Mc Laren’s book, “The Story We Find Ourselves In”.  I am hoping to do some work on my other web site with a friend so that it is up and running very soon.

      I continue to be unhappy with my ability to log on and post to my blog.  My wife had a great time while she was away. Her favorite thing was a 700 ft zip line over the lake at the grounds. She also had a very cool worship experience in a meadow of flowers on Sunday afternoon.  I continue to feel stretched these days as I seek to finish out my current ministry position with integrity, pray about new employment, and move forward as an organic missional church planters.  One day I will have an encouraging converstion about my future plans, but then there will be four conversations that are negative.   The night before last I watched the movie "Chocolate". It was a very moving experience for me and I saw several parraels in my life as I grew up as a kid and where I am know, and where God is leading me.  I am trying to get all of the details to come together so that I can attend the Greenhouse by Neil Cole in Indianna next week.   May this great God who called you (ME)  ... keep you broken enough to mend others. ... keep you well enough to enjoy others. ... keep you hungry enough to feed others. ... keep you wondering enough to find the lost. ... keep you secure enough to present the truth. ... keep you home enough to enjoy the blessings. ... keep you out enough to see the broken. ... keep you fresh enough to inspire others. ... keep you weary enough to remain anchored to Him. ... keep you blind enough to believe him anyway. ... keep you real enough to be touched by the hurting. ... keep you numb enough to endure the storm. ... keep you sensitive enough to feel other's pain. ... keep you weeping enough to remain dependent. ... keep you joyful enough to continue on. ... keep you strong enough to reach the weak. ... keep you weak enough to reach out to the strong.  And most of all, may God .... keep you growing and changing.  Taken from Dary Northrop - Garage-Door Evangelism

      More provacativenthoughts for me to mull over from the Message.  This is a large work I've called you into, but don't be overwhelmed by it. It's best to start small. 42 Give a cool cup of water to someone who is thirsty, for instance. The smallest act of giving or receiving makes you a true apprentice. You won't lose out on a thing."  Matthew chp 10

      I have been wrestling through this passage in Mathew 7 and recorded in the Mesage.  These words I speak to you are not incidental additions to your life, homeowner improvements to your standard of living. They are foundational words, words to build a life on. If you work these words into your life, you are like a smart carpenter who built his house on solid rock. 25Rain poured down, the river flooded, a tornado hit--but nothing moved that house. It was fixed to the rock. 26"But if you just use my words in Bible studies and don't work them into your life, you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach. 27When a storm rolled in and the waves came up, it collapsed like a house of cards." 28When Jesus concluded his address, the crowd burst into applause. They had never heard teaching like this. 29It was apparent that he was living everything he was saying--quite a contrast to their religion teachers! This was the best teaching they had ever heard.  I just finished reading a book called The Air I Breathe, Worship as a way of life. by Louie Giglo.  Here are some exerpts from the book.  God does not have a church fetish. He probably cares less about the carpet color there than we think. Why? Because he's huge. Creator. Initiator of all things. Way too vast to be stuck in some building all week. Far too interested in our lives to simply watch us drive away from Him. Much more worthy of our time than just one hour of just one day.  Our lives are on loan from God, a sacred trust of opportunities and descisions. And every one of our choices is made on a battlefield  with heavenly ramifications.  We become what we worship. if you don't like who you're becoming, take a quick inventory of the things on the throne of your heart.  Worship is ... our response, both personal and corperate, to God - for who He is! and what He has done! expressed in and by the things we say and the way we live.  God wants our lives to be a seamless cord of worship. God wants our worship to be a way of life.  Everything on earth (except sin) can be done as an act of worship to God. Everything we do is worship when we do it for Him, displaying His face as we go. the question is not what you do, but who you do it for. Your calling is to turn your place in life into a place of true worship. To do whatever you do in a way that will reflect God's heart to those around you. It's to worship ... as you live your life.

      I was catching up on a good friends blog in California and I saw that he took my reccomendation to watch the movie Chocolate and I will paste his corresponding post from his own blog.   :: Wednesday, May 28, 2003 ::  Time to Celebrate This last Memorial weekend was all about celebrating! Our celebrations included mine and Cara's 8th year anniversary, 2 BB-Q's, and just the overall greatness of God!! Also, Cara and I watched the movie Chocolat and it is a must see! Great movie. In fact, Cara and I were so moved by it that we are planning a "Chocolat Party" as our first "official" gathering in our home with several like-minded people that God has connected us with in recent weeks. We are planning to have dinner together, watch the movie, and then discuss how this movie relates to our lives. To top it off, we are having Chocolate Fondue! We are anticipating a cool experience together because we are asking God to unfold His plan for us as people who are desperate about living out the Kingdom of God in our everyday lives and how that includes those in our sphere of influences. To be continued...   It is cool to see Kingdom "spontaneous combustion" happen!!  I had a great talk with my wife Syndie this morning over coffee sitting on our front porch watching our kids play on the front walk. We were discussing recent "kingdom life" seeds we have been able to sow into some lives of people we know. We also interacted with the articles I had put on my last post. I am so blessed to have a friend, lover, and partner in her!!  We are making plans to hold a surprise B-Day party for some friends we are trying to love into the Kingdom. Becky A'Hearn is turning 40! We are going to have black balloons and all sorts of gag gifts. The big gala will be saturday night.  Now that we have been in our new neighborhood for a couple months and the weather is allowing us to be outside I and my family are trying to find creative ways to live on the block together in community.  ... Today I felt led to mow my neighbors lawn while he was at work. I hope the act of love will create a stir.

      I had a great time last weekend at the Church Multiplication Associates Greenhouse Interactive in Winona Lake, Indianna. It was great to meet  urlLink Neil Cole  of CMA and the Awakening Chapels, and Mike Jentes of the  urlLink Quest in Columbus , Ohio. In fact next Thursday I am going to drive down to Columbus and spend some more time with Mike and his tribe in Columbus.  I recently have come across some good web articles that are worth a read.   urlLink Get out of their faces and into their shoes!    urlLink Where do you go to church?    urlLink Kingdom Mentality   I also just bought a book because of its title which I do not usually do, but I loved the title and hopefully it will be a good read.  Stop witnessing and start loving!   .... 2003 Navpress ... Paul Borthwick

      Continuing from earlier today ….  I made it home from Columbus, Ohio in 4 hours. 20 minutes after I got home my wife was off to her birthday get away. I had a not so good time with my 3 kids. My son was on a path of destruction. He broke a snow globe and a couple of other things around the house. My other two were crabby board and whiney. I found myself responding in anger and disgust. Good impressions to make on my kids right before Fathers Day. In the evening I sat them down before bed and apologized and asked them to forgive me. I wanted to be honest about how I had acted toward them and share some of the things that I was dealing with, but also I did not want to justify or excuse my behavior.  I think part of my problems was mulling over the couple I met last night in Columbus. Their names were Mark and Jennifer Palmer and they are the “lead instigators” of a missional community called the Landing Place. They appear to be the same age as my wife and I. The thing that has we wigged out is the fact that Jennifer has an advanced stage of stomach cancer and is undergoing some pretty heavy-duty treatments. They have a very sweet spirit about the whole situation. Anytime I am faced with this sort of thing it really makes me think about the life I am living and why God puts us here anyway. There are asking people to lift them up in prayer in regard to June 30th. On June 30th Jennifer is going to have a CAT scan to see how effective her treatment regime and prayer have been.  I was also thinking a lot about my job search on my drive home. I have been at peace with this for the most part but today I felt frustrated and stuck for some reason. I want to find that balance of trusting God to orchestrate and guide me and at the same time not be presumptuous of the role I need to play as well.  When I checked my email I had this encouraging word from Mike Jentes.   Jim,   Thanks for your learner’s heart.  Don't marry a model...but fall deeply in love with Jesus!  Help others do the same.  Make disciples and love people.  If there is anyway I can help you now or in the future, let me know!   Press ON, Mike  Mike did a great job of sending me home with resources. He helped me fill in the blanks in my CMA Greenhouse notebook from when I had to leave early from the interactive in Winona Lake. He also gave me some cool Quest pens, and sample M2M materials that he uses. He also blessed me with the following list of books/materials.   303 Ice Breakers One verse evangelism, by Randy Raysbrook Jesus with dirty feet, by Don Everts Thinking like a missionary, by Bill Mowry Living like a missionary, by Bill Mowry Are you fishing with a net?, by Randall Neighbor Saturation Church Planting- by Bob Fitts The spontaneous expansion of the church, by Roland Allen  A hearty big thanks Mike!!  Gifts are my love language.  While I was there I got to drive on a sidewalk outside the Ohio State football stadium! And get close up of the playing field, which was set up for graduation. I did not feel right as a U of M fan. Mike had a good time razzing me about the Buckeye victory and wearing some of his Ohio State paraphernalia.  I t was a great time.  I am grateful to my wife and family for letting me go. I plan on wearing my Quest T-shirt to my church on Sunday.

      I just got back from a great visit with Mike Jentes and his family. It was cool to just hang out and listen and learn what they have been up to as God has planted them in the Near North area of downtown Columbus.  I also had an opportunity to meet Mark and Jennifer Palmer of the Landing Place and actually attended the house church meeting that they host in their home.  Many thanks to Mike for all of the goodies and resorces he sent me home with. I also appreciate the material I was missing from the CMA Greenhouse.   I am thankful that God has allowed me to connect with great Kingdom people like Mike and Mindy and look forward to meeting many more in the near future.  Today is my wife's birthday and I sent her away to a overnight get away to scrapbook with her girlfriends.

      Yesterday I went with my wife to "Family Christian Store" and I found a cool book called, Seven days of faith - Every day alive with God. If you would like a free PDF sample there is one avaible from  urlLink Nav Press .  Below are some great morsals for food for thought.  IF I CANNOT FIND GOD IN THE MIDDLE OF MY WORK— WHERE MY CONCERNS AND WORRIES, PAINS, AND JOYS ARE—IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO FIND HIM IN THE HOURS SET FREE AT THE PERIPHERY OF MY LIFE. —HENRI NOUWEN  I now welcome this ambiguity as a challenge to distinguish between the husk and the heart of true Christianity. The husk is the formalized religious apparatus for finding and pleasing God, and for saying one’s prayers correctly and engaging in religious activities. But the heart is the God invasion of our seven-day week with transcendent meaning and irrepressible joy.  Our ministry in the ordinary things of life is to see through them to the God we love, thus making all life transparent to the glory of God.    Tomorrow am driving down to Columbus, Ohio to stay with Mike Jentes and his family.  I also found this cool article about an  urlLink Incubator of Kingdom Growth  in San Fancisco.

      My brother and his wife and daughter were just here for a visit. It was fun for all of us to be together and just hang out.   I having really been mulling over the whole idea of "community" and how I need to reshape my life to experience it more.  Here are some quotes that have been stiring my heart and mind.-  Community is not a means (strategy) to an end (church growth). It's an end in and of itself. (Kingdom of God expressed in the now). Chris Marshal  Community is a wonderful place, it is life-giving; but it is also a place of pain beacause it is a place of truth and of growth - ther revelation of our pride, our fear, and our brokenness. Jean Vanier  We will only stay in community if we have gone through the passage from choosing community to knowing we have been chosen for community. Jean Vanier  There is only the possibility of real growth in a community if people are deeply respected in their personal development. W continually need to have before us the challange of our mission. We are not in a community to just to protect our own little spriritual lives. We're there for the church, for people in pain. We have a message to give, and and we have a message to receive. We have a mission, and if we are not a people of mission, then the comunity is in danger of closing up, and of dying. Jean Vanier  All of these thoughts from Jean Vanier came from the little booklet, From Brokenness to Community.  If anyone who is reading this has any other reccomedations to add to my journey please let me know.  email Jim at  jimlbest@msn.com

      Last week when I visited Mark Palmer of the Landing Place in Columbus and at their house church meeting they did a prayer of bleesing and send off for one of their members that was going to be traveling to Africa. The prayer came from the Celtic Northumbria Community. I tracked it down and here is a link to the Daily Office of Prayers.   urlLink Celtic Prayer   Here is the web site for the  urlLink Landing Place .

      I am still rying to get the hang of all the new features and abilities since I upgraged to Blogger Plus.  I just had a great conversation with my old time friend Rob Lane out in Sacremento, CA. It is such a blessing and encouragement each time I talk with him on the phone.  I am really looking for ward to visiting and hanging out with Kevin Rains at Vineyard Central in Cincy OH. I also just found a  urlLink great online article  that he wrote on his personal journey and experience.  My family is trying to get into a new rhythm now that school is out for the summer. I am finding that I have to come home ready to be "military reinforcements" for my wife who has been immersed in the demands of parenting toddlers.   Next week our family is going to take a week of vacation camping on the west side of Michigan along Lake Michigan. It should be a good time to relax and just hang out as family. I am looking forward to staying up late and sit outside and look at the waves on the lake and talk and dream and just take it all in.

      I just got back from a great week of vacation with my family in Luddington, MI. We were camping at a RV park called Poncho's Pond. Some friends of ours allowed us to use/borrow their 30 Ft camping trailer for the week.  There was a pool and playground for the kinds and it was also a 10 minute ride to the Mid West version of the ocean ... aka Lake Michigan. We certainly were not roughing it! The camper had a microwave, cable tv, and all of the ammenities of home.  It was cool just to hang out and do a whole lot of nothing in particular.   Syndie and I were able to do a lot of talking, dreaming, praying about our journey to plant a network of missional communities in Metro Deroit. This time talking together was catalytic for both of us.  I was able to to read a large portion of the book I got last week from Kevin Rains called, Peculiar People. I also was able to read and meditate on a chapter in Richard Foster's book on prayer called, "Ordinary Prayer".   Tomorrow I am driving to Fort Wayne to meet my Dad and he is going to take Emily, and Samantha for a week with Grandma and Grandpa.

      Excellent Visit to Cincy!!  I had a great time in Norwood, Ohio. I was the guest of Kevin and Tracy Rains of Vineyard Central.  I also was able to finally meet Alan Creech from Kentucky and hang with Chris Marshall of Ordinary Community.  I had this visit planned for a couple of months. As it turned out this Friday night had also been scheduled to be a meeting of house church leaders and people wanting to plant missional communities. Kevin exhoted the group to impart/encourage those who were there.  I had several brothers and sisters lay hands on me and seek to bless/encourage/impart as Syndie and I begin to order our life around Kingdom Life and planting of missional communities. The prayer time was very powerful for me. God spoke to me in a powerful through my new found family members.  Here are some of the specifics prayed into me-  power of my smile to minister the love of God I would have the heart of my Heavenly Father ... Father others Be a runner in the Kingdom for the long haul Teaching ability ... take the complex and break it down Time with God will be like a son and dad on a fishing trip God is well pleased with me Courage to stand Abilty to press on Dream of Kingdom Life will take root in my heart  After the great prayer time went to a local pub called the Dubliner. Everyone had what suited them from a ice tea, Black and Tan, and I had a couple of Schmirnof Ice's  It was a real good time and I hope to came again soon.  Thanks to everyone who listened to my heart and answered my questions.  Kevin also let me snoop through his library and gave me a copy of the book, A peculiar people, by Rodney Clapp.  Tomorrow I am leaving on vacation with my family to do some camping on the west side of Michigan.  I will be back to blogging when I can.

      As you can see I am in the process of redoing my blog layout.  This past Monday night I had a great time hanging out with the Blaylock family in Williamston, MI. They are about a 1 hour drive from our place. It was great to hang out, eat, listen to each others journey and story, and develop a frienship.  Tom Blaylock is planting a missional community called the Journey Church. His story is quite interesting because he was introduced to the idea of missional communities by an article in Outreach Marketing Magazine about Jason Evans and the Church at Matthews House. It is good to have discovered someone as close as he is. We stayed at their place well past 11:00 and did not get home till well after midnight but it was a worthwhile trip.  Tomorrow my daughter Samantha is going to the hosppitol for a small surgical procedure to remove her adnoids and put tubes in both of her ears. I will probably be hanging out at the hospitol for a better part of the day.  Tomorrow I am going to mail off another job application to the University of Michigan.  Time to go and read for a bit before bed.

      A lot has happened in the last week. I have been doing a lot of driving this past week. The vast majority of the driving time was to drop and pick up my kids half way from where we live and my parents in Charleston, IL. My kids had a great time with their grandparents while they were away. There favorite activity was doing arial acrobactics on the trampoline. Now my oldest daughter Emily is spending a week with Gram and Papa in Canada.  On this thursday my middle daughter Samantha is going to have tubes placed in her ears and have her adnoids removed. This will be a out-patient procedure done at the local hospitol. The procedure will help with the cronic ear infections she has had since she was a baby living by the toxic polluter in our back yard in Oro Grande, CA. She is in good spirits about it and it has been a good way to talk about prayer with her. (4yrs old)  The last few days the kids have been enjoying the new pool some one gave us as a housewarming preasent. It is an inflateable pool that is 10ft around and about 3ft deep. The kids are in and out of it constantly. I told my wife it can also double as a "baptism pool" for our missional community.  On a personal leval I have been devoring a book that was reccommended to me by Mark Palmer at the Landing Place in Columbus, Oh. The book/resource is the, Celtic Daily Prayer, Prayers and Readings from the Northumbria Community. I am going to use this book like a set of "training wheels" and learn the "unforced rhyths of grace". I have done a little reswearch on the Northumbria Comm via their web site and I have learned some very interesting things. The people of the community are seeking to live openly amoung people as a "church without walls." Their have three fundamental committments that they live by. 1) vow of availibilityy and vulnerbility with God and people 2) a dogged fidelity to the Sermon on the Mount which they call "a way for living" 3) daily rhythm of prayer  Here is a short exerpt-   If you want to live life free, take your time and, go slowly. Do a few things, but do them well. Simple joys are holy. (p.11)  I also just finished today the book, Leap over a Wall, Earthy spirituality for everyday christians, by Eugene Peteresen. It was a very worthwhile read in my opinion. Here is one of the quotes I have been mulling over a lot. Friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality. It's every bit as significant as prayer and fasting. Like the sacremental use of of water and bread and wine, friendship takes what's common in human experience and turns it into something holy. p.53  Buber (Martin Buber) said that the meeting another was a great thing, but not the greatest thing. The greatest thing any person can do for another is to confirm the deepest thing in him, in her--, to take the time and have the discernment to see what's most deeply there, most fully that person, and then confirm it by recognizing and encouraging it. p.54  I have also been doing a lot of praying about the job search I am on. Last weeks Detroit Free Press said that that jobless in the highest it has been in a couple of years. I am so glad that I am am this journey because of Kingdom Love and Passion and not human logic. If it was a human logic thing it would be scarring the crap out of me. I am seeking to have that balance of being crippled by fear or smugness.  I was also deeply challenged yesterday at the inner city church called New Song in Windsor, Ontario. They was a guy named "Ricky" who danced and worshipped in a God honoring vulnerable way like no one I have ever seen. It was what I picture in my mind when King David danced mightly before the Lord. ... The thing that God confronted me with was the fact that Ricky had Down Syndrome. Why did it take some like him to loose his "cool" inhibitions or whatever to dance and worship like that. Somewhere on my spiritual journrey I erroneously picked up the idea that it is more spiritual to keep emotions and passions in check to keep control at all cost. God continues to show me in many way/peole like Kenny that I need to out of control and undignified for Jesus.   Lord help me morph into your likeness in this area.

Here a couple of things some people I know have put togeter.  1) This some church planting info that is closely tied to the Natural Church Development material at this time there is a free PDF booklet avalible for  urlLink download .  2) Someone else I know has put together an online satieracal news paper called the Holy Observeror. It is very similar to the Onion or the Lark. I am also including the code for a button if anyone wants to link to the site.   urlLink

      This is my new blogchalk:   United States, Michigan, Westland, harry slatkins, English, Jim, Male, 31-35, reading, coffee.   :)  I am feeling a little sluggish right now. My office is a tad stuffy and I had a short night sleep. My in-laws stopped in fro a surprise visit last night and we were up till way after mid-night. At eight this morning I had a chance to connect again with  urlLink Chad Farrand  at Cracker Barrell restaurant. It was good to catch up on whats been going on the last month or so. It is so good to connect on a soul leval with kindred spirits. Maybe a small taste of the "fight club" in cincy thay I keep hearing about. Anyway, it was cool to hear we are embracing and living in commuity via the net, which allows for high tech and high touch. The time was good and creted a thirst for more.  At a staff meeting I was able to share some thoughts on how I have personally benefitted from the discipline of "pilgrimage" this summer. I have experienced and learned so much as I have traveled to destinations such as Cincy, Columbus, Windsor, and Williamston. Again my deep appreciation to those who have hugged, housed, prayed, drank, laughed, cussed, smiled, listened, and loved as I have journeyed forth. This weekend will be espicially neat to go and a pilgrimage again and talk the fam along with. My wife can see that all my "new friends" are not make believe. :) just kidding ;) She wants to meet all of you that I spend time on the net with.  Tonight I am going to a memorial service with some dear friends to love and encourage them as they navigate the emotions of joy, anger, relief, sadness, and hope in a time like this.

      I came across this intersting article entitled "Six ways I quit church" by Chad Hall ...   Here is a snippit from the article   It's counter-intuitive, but we must find ways to disconnect from the church way of thinking, feeling, and living so that the pre-Christians in our community stand a better chance of being influenced by Christ and the church.   the whole aricle can be found  urlLink here   I had a intersting discussion last night with a couple of friends from a local church. The discussion started by the one guy saying he felt like he needed to do something more in the area of "outreach". He eaven sent away for some free kit on how to do kindness evangelism. But as we talked I could see he was more interested in doing something and then checking it off the list and saying, "there that done for a while".  It makes my heart ache to see people focused on this type of evangelism and eaven the passionless approach to checking a list.  My wife Syndie went to the local Moms Mentoring Moms club meeting and has signed up to be an active part of the club to learn, develop friendships, help our community, and be an incarnational presence. I don't know why it is so hard for some church people to see this type of ordinary lifestyle as an key way to do life and "outreach" if you will. Some actually think it is just to ordinary ironically.  Yesterday I did something that I have wanted to do for a long time. I went to a local tattoo parlor and had a celtic cross tattooed on my forarm as a symbol of the missional lifestyle I want to give my life to. It will be interesting to see how some people at our current church will react in the month I have left before I resign.  I am really looking forward to going on a pilgrimage to cincy again this weekend. There is going to be a mid-west greenhouse gathering and a all group plus worship celebration for networks of house/missional communities. I am also excited that Syndie and two of my kids are coming along as well.   Tomorrow I am going to a memorial service for a friend whose brother-in-law just died of cancer. We gave them a butterfly bush to plant in their yard as an ongoing living memorial and a reminder of the freedom and new life in christ as it attracts butterflys.

      This has to be short and sweet. It is late and I am very tired.  I had the oportunity to preach at Crosswinds Community Church in nearby Canton, MI. The pastor there is a friend of mine and he was away on vacation. I shared with the church about our plans to start a "missional community" in Metro Detroit. Several people came and talked with me after the message and three people said they they would keep their eyes and ears open as far as a marketplace job for me which I thought was a kind gesture.  A friend of mine, the infamous Doug Hovey, has helped me put togther a beta web site for our plant.  Check it out -  urlLink New Life Community of Faith   More later...

         Here is a picture a my wife Syndie taking a few moments late at night after kids are in bed to do some "therapy" via her personal  urlLink blog .  I just got back from a cool lunch break with my family. They came by work and picked me up and then we had a picnic lunch at a local park. We ate and played and had a good time with each other. God has blessed me with an incredible family.  Yesterday I got a call from a longtime friend,  urlLink Rob Lane , we have been hanging out since Jr. High School days. It was good to catch up on how he and his family are doing in Sacremento, CA.  Tomorrow me and the family a taking another road trip to Akron, OH. We are going to visit Jim and Brenda Mitchell. Brenda was my wifes roomate in college. It has been quite a while since we have had a visit with them. The visit will also be good because they have also been battling melanoma cancer for over a year and maybye we can be an encouragement to them through our visit.

      Here is a picture from last night with the Journey Church in Willianston, MI.  (sorry i'm having some tech issues)  Journey Church is led by Tom and Sandy Blaylock who we just spent the weekend with in Cincy at the Brownhouse for the Midwest Greenhouse.  It was great for our whole family to go and be with them for the evening. It was great to share a meal of taco's and hear peoples story. Syndie and I commented that the "communion time" with tortilla chips was one of the most meaningful celebrations we have ever experinced. It helped to see the necessity of constantly living with "communion" minset and lifestyle.  It was also very awesome to see a personal breakthrough happen in real time for one of their community group members named "josh". We were reading Acts 7:48 ... which says... "the most High does not live in temples made by human hands. " It literally just hit him how he was the temple and where he was, God was. He had a silly grin like a kid a Christmas. We ended the night with an authentic time of prayer for each other and where we each were on our spiritual journies.

      I have just been going through the job classifieds in the local newspaper. I found to jobs that I am going to make an application on tomorrow morning. I am at rest about needing land a job in the next six weeks, maybye at time to much at rest. I keep reviewing a line in my mind that I read in the book, Houses that Change the World, "what God orders, he pays for."  Tonight my family and I are going to drive over to Williamston, MI to be with Tom and Sandy Blaylock and Journey Church.  We were hoping to take some friends with us so that they could experience a "missional community" first hand, but it will have to happen another time down the road.

      Wow!! ... Me and my family just back from an awesome weekend in Cincy hanging out with a bunch of missionally minded Kingdom Radicals. It was good to get to know new people such as Bean's, Canipe's, Johnson's, Bishop, and many, many, more. I love hearing the story of peoples journey and how God has radically rearranged their world and to be able to share to understanding people where we are as well.  In fact at one point my wife Syndie just sort of felt like she was coming apart for no apparent reason. Within moments we were surronded with people who loved us and cared for us. Many laid hands on her and prayed for her. It was a special moment for her as these new friends loved on her and help lift her spirits.  A reacurring topic that kept coming up for us was the idea that we are going to have to take some time to grieve and process what we have known and done as church to this point so that we can can continue to journey into all God is opening to us via missional community/kingdom life.  We are looking forward to the next road trip to metro-cincy allready.   Thanks to all who shared their heart and experience with us and how you have each had a similar journey as well.  A Big, Big thanks to the Rains for allowing the multitude to invade the Brownhouse and for the hospitality that is allways extended to everyone.  A BIG Thanks as well to Chris and Nicky Marshall who allowed the four of us to stay with them and share their home with us.

      Syndie and I have received a lot of advice lately about how we need to give ourselves some time to grieve as we make our transition from CCC to planting missional communities. We felt like this was good advice but have wondered one actually does something like that. Mike Bishop recommened a book called the Prophetic Immagination. Today was pay day so I hope to go online and order it. ... I felt led to pick up Celebration of Discipline and came across this paragraph.   In contemporary society our adversary majors in three things: noise, hurry, and crowds. If he can keep us engaged in “muchness” and “mayness”, he will rest satisfied. Psychiatrist Carl Jung once remarked, “Hurry is not of the devil; it is the devil.” If we hope to move beyond the superficialities of our culture,   including our religious culture ,  we must be willing to go down into the recreating silence, into the inner world of contemplation. In their writings all the masters of meditation beckon us to be pioneers in this frontier of the Spirit. Though it may seem strange to modern ears, we should without shame enroll as apprentices in the school of contemplative prayer.  Richard Foster p.15 Celebration of Discipline  True contemplation is not a psychological trick but a theological grace. Thomas Merton   Lord help as we seek to jorney with you into this area of reflection and grief that we may be able to go to the new place you want to lead us.

         This is what I feel like hanging around my neck as I enter into conversations as of late.    Here is the latest info on our job searching.   Today, Syndie has a second interview with a company called, "Music on the Go". It is a company that provides music appreciation classes for day care-centers.   Last night I received an email from a friend at a local church saying that he had sent his resume to the Plymouth/Canton School superintendent(a nearby school district). The superintendent said he would talk to the HR department to see what they could do about hiring me to be a FT school custodian. It is nice to know someone who knows someone in this type of thing.   Please pray with us that God would open doors for us and that we would have wisdom as we search out jobs that will provide for us financially and also are places of ministry opportunity.   Thanks for being on the journey with us.   Jim

         oop's I don't know my own strength!    I am taking a few moments to blog while Syndie is at a friends watching a movie and all the kids are in bed asleep.  Today was a staff prayer day again. We have a new rotation of doing it on the 2nd and 4th Monday of each month. I try to spend as much time as possible outdoors in a nature setting on these type of days to think, pray, daydream and read. I found myself musing about the current transition that me and my family are going through during this next month. I was asking God why He was allowing me to remain so calm with so many looming uncertainies. My trained response would be to say I was exercising great faith in this situation, but I did not want to presuppose that. As I thought and reflected on the idea just staring at the Rouge River in front of me a partial lyric came to mind from a old gospel song from my childhood church years. The lyric was something about God's peace being like a river and how it attends to the soul. It was very meaningful to meditate on the partial lyric while gazing at the river before me.   I also spent some time doing Lectio Divna with a passage from Matthew 7   "Keep on asking, and you will be given what you ask for. Keep on looking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened. For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And the door is opened to everyone who knocks. You parents--if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead? Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not! If you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.   I also read some of the book Tipping Point, by Malcom Gladdwell. I am having a hard time concentrating of my reading these days with all that is going on, which is frustrating for me.  I also have recently stumbled on a something called the  urlLink Saint Aidans Trust . I am thinking of taking vows with the order instead of typical denominational ordination.   I also found this interesting:  urlLink A Celtic Model For A Local Church

         Life is precious!! Here is a picture of Paxton Charles Hovey.  Paxton was born last night at 8:40 pm EST.  Congradulations to Doug and Heather and Big brother Parker.  It was an awesome privlidge to be at the hospitol last night with them to welcome and celebrate this new life.   ...  Yesterday after a long period of silence I had someone call me about a job. The local public school district is hiring for their Custodian II positions, which is their basic leval entry position. The job is FT at 9.41 a hour with no fringe benefits. That all could come later if I would be a good employee. While I was out droping off the application at the district office I felt an inner prompting to drop in at a Our Lady of Good Counsel. I worked FT at OLGC when we first moved to Metro Detroit. It was good to catch up with all of my old co-workers and see their curiosity as I explained why I am leaving Canton Community Church to start a network of missional communities. My old boss said that they are looking to hire someone full time their as well in the next week or so, but I'm not sure what the pay would be. Please continue to pray with us for wisdom and God's provision in all of this.  I also picked up yesterday the book, Waking the Dead. Thanks Chad and Kevin for the enticing blurbs! I dove into it and I am about half way through. It is a worthwile read.

      Wow, I am finally able to enter a posting for my blog again.    No news to report on the the job search arena. I continue to hunt through online job archives and classified adds.  I am finding myseld becoming an expert of sarchastic humor these days. Sort of a old stand by to deal with stress. the only problem is that I know it has a dark side called bitterness that if not kept in check will eat through me like a virus.  I just finalized travel plans for our family to go to Chicago on August 15 and 16 for my Grandma Perkins 100th birthday celebration. Every living blood relative of my grandma will be there. It should be the party of a lifetime.  Trust in the LORD and do good.         Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. 4     Take delight in the LORD,         and he will give you your heart's desires. 5     Commit everything you do to the LORD.         Trust him, and he will help you. 6     He will make your innocence as clear as the dawn,         and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun. 7     Be still in the presence of the LORD,         and wait patiently for him to act.

      I have been able to do some good reading lately which is ananswer tp prayer for me. Here are some quotes I have picked up recently.   "Strange how the mind fixates on physical details in order to handle the unchangeable. When we can't handle the truth we handle facts."  Peter Kreeft  The day of the professional minister is gone.  The day of the missionary pastor is here! The day of the churched culture is over.  The day of the mission field has come! The day of the local church is over. the day of the mission outpost has come! Kennon Callahan  In a world of fugatives/The person taking the opposite direction/will be appear to be running away. T.S. Elliot  Many people steeped in religion would rather be "right" than in relationship with anyone they think is in the wrong. Stephen Artburn

      I had a chance to get up slightly ahead of my two youngest kids this morning which gave me a chance to make the coffee and spend some time in silence, prayer, and reflection on our back patio. Once my daughter Sam did get up she asked to watch one of her videos and I returned to savor a few more moments on the patio. Five minutes later. Sam had gone and chaged her clother to match what daddy had on (shorts and sweatshirt) and had grabbed her kids illustrated cartoon Bible and joined me at the patio table. After a few minutes she crawled on my lap and asked me to read to her from her Bible. In was a great time together as we experienced our Father's love together.  Thank you Jesus for special moments like this with my daughter sam.

         Me and my oldest daughter Emily out enjoying our rollerblades!!    I have had an enjoyable couple of last days with my family. I have been able to do some fun things like rollerblading, swimming in our pool, playing games and hanging out in our backyard. On Friday we had a big thunder storm and we all sat on our front portch and watched the storm in all of it's glory. During the storm I felt prompted to read the text of psalm 19 from the message to the kids. It was better than powerpoint.  I have also been able to do a couple of small around the house projects like rehanging the towell rack my three old son tried to use as a chin up bar in our bathroom as well as the standard lawn mowing and sprinkling. I am finding that this type of activities are helpful to give me time to think and process all that is going on these days for me and my family.  I still do not have anything definate for a FT job in September. I continue to be confident eaven though I have nothing concrete as of yet. I made it to the second round of application for the janitor position at the local library and won't know anthing more till the 23rd of August. I talked with a friend today and he said he would talk to the HR department at his company to see if there would be anything I would be able to apply for.  I had mentioned in a previous posting that I was checking into the order of st. aidan. Well I wrote to them and told then a bit of our story and this is what they had to say. ...   This sounds all rather exciting for what you are doing is also what our greater ministry, the  urlLink St. Aidan Trust , is identifying as its primary mission. To answer your question, the commissioning service would be a very appropriate place for the Explorer's Covenant. Because of the work God is calling you to do, I would also ask that you prayerfully consider writing up something of your story for our newsletter publication, The Wild Goose. Please keep in touch and I will ask our community to pray for your mission. If I can be of assistance in any way, please don't hesitate to contact me.   So as part of our departure/commissioning from Canton Community Church will be the profession of the explorers covenant of the order.  I also received an interesting email from randy buist of waters edge on the west side of the state. He had heard of me the day before via Jason evans. Hopefully we will have a chance to connect and share our stories.

          Here is a link picture of me and the kids with Randy Buist of  urlLink Waters Edge  in Rockford, MI at the Rogue River.  Me and my family drove over to the west side of MI to have luch with him and visit a friend who had recently had a baby.  It was very good to make the connection with Randy and waters edge. It is cool to see some connection coming together in Michigan.  This coming Sunday is my last Sunday as the Pastor of Ministry Development at  urlLink Canton Community Church .  It is going to be an interesting Sunday. There are parts of me that are very excited to trasition to the planting of a missional community and there are parts of me that it is is going to be hard to say some goodbyes.  Currently me and the family are on a little jaunt to SW Ontario to visit Syndie's family in Canada.

         Today I received an email from the St. Aidans trust asking me to be a part of a gathering they are planning next year in Denver Colorado that is going to be  on the Celtic way of evangelism. They will be addressing churches, and church planting pastors seeking to reach our culture for the Gospel in new ways.   Then also received an email from Kevin Rains regarding how God is stiring something up in the Mid-West in regard to nurturing and developing organic missional communities. Here is a snipit of his email.-   God's thumbprint all over it. As I think about this I'm coming to see this as God jump starting something that he wants us to run with. Of course he'll still be the wind in our sails and helping us all along but my hunch is that he wants us to have a more active, intentional role to carry forward what he started.    Both of these emails were a great source of encouragement and a critical time for me and my family.

      This was a very interesting past couple of days for me. I was very emotionally unsettled about the Palmers and want to go down to Columbus but it was also my Grandmothers 100th Birthday celebration. I wanted to be at both but could only go to one. We dedided to go to my Grandmothers party in Chicago. It was good to be able to celebrate 100 years of life with her. Every living relative was there from as far East as Conneticut and as far West as California.      Before the party we had a fire alarm go off at our hotel. I am going to email hotwire.com and say that was a little to "hot"of a deal for us. What should we expect for $40.    Here is a picture of me and my son Josiah at Rain Forest Cafe in Chicago.    Still no news o the job scene for me.

We are meeting at Don Pablo's in Grand Rapids on the West side of the state.  God is up to something here in Michigan and I am so glad to be a part of it.  Details of today to follow.

      It has been a interesting 24 hours for us. We have officially had our last Sunday at Canton Community Church and we sent two kids off to a new year of school. This is the first year to have two kids in school. Sam is in kindergarten and Emily is in third grade. Our last Sunday was awkward and difficult. Our departure was a brief 5 minute slot on the docket of the 1 1/2 + service. I was suppose to have gave a final message but I edited to 3 minutes to fit into time constraints. We are slowly starting to process and grieve our departure. Below is sort of pictoral glimpse of the last 24.     This is the cover of a card that we received yesterday from a dear friend, Sharon Turner. The message is very fitting for us.      Syndie playing with the CCC worship band for the last time.      Guitar player Randy Gray presented a card full of Meijer Gift Cards as a thank you gift for her leadership of the worship at a special going away party.      Enjoying some premium liquor beverages at her going away party.     Syndie attemting her hand at Bachi Ball to releave tension.      Emily and Sam on their way to Schweitzer Elementary School and Sam in her kindergarten class.

      Today as I was cleaning the corperate worship space for Our Lady of Good Counsel (temp janitorial job) I found this quote on the floor.  St. Frances de Sales  Do not look forward to what might happen tomorrow; the Everlasting Father who cares for you today, will take care of you tomorrow and every day. Either He will shield you from suffering or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it. Be at peace, then, and put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginings.

      Here are couple more quotes that I have come across in my reading in the last day or so.  There is a simple, straightforward way in which congregations of Jesus’ people can, without exception, fulfill his call to be ecclesia, his “called out” ones: a touch point between heaven and earth, where healing of the Cross and the Resurrection can save the lost and grow the saved into the fullness of human beings in Christ. No special facilities, programs, talents, or techniques are required. It doesn’t even require a budget. Just faithfulness to the process of spiritual formation in Christ likeness exposed in the scripture and in the lives of his “peculiar people” through the ages. Dallas Willard – The Renovation of the Heart  Calling is the truth that God calls us to himself so decisively that everything we are, everything we do, and everything we have is invested with a special devotion, dynamism, and direction lived out as a response to his summons and service. Os Guinness-The Call

      Labor Day-  Today has been a cold rainy day here in Michigan. Not how the kids or I imagined finishing up the summer. We played inside most of the day. Toward evening I was able to let the kids out to run up and down the side walk to let of steam.  Syndie had a chance to go and scrap book with some of her girl friends here in town. It is something that she really enjoys doing and it is even better with friends.  I was surfing last night reading some of the blogs I peruse on a regular basis and I saw that many of my Allelon friends are out in Idaho spending the weekend with Dallas Willard.  Today in between my kid pleasures I pulled a couple of my Willard books off the shelf for a quick peek.  Her are a couple of thoughts that pierced me.  This importance of systems is a main reason that Jesus did not send his students out to start governments or even churches as we know them today, which always strongly convey some element of a human system. They were, instead, to establish beachheads of his person, word, and power in the midst of a failing and futile humanity. They were to bring the presence of the Kingdom and its King into every corner of human life simply by fully living in the kingdom with him. P.15 Renovation of the Heart  The person we know as Jesus is not only running the universe, but also teaching us how to live in the kingdom of God now. To take Jesus seriously in this way indicates that you know longer want to live on junk food, but want to be nourished on the real stuff of life. P.3 The Divine Conspiracy Study Guide  So instead of becoming disciples of Jesus, individuals substitute trying to achieve correctness of doctrine or of practice as defined by some tradition, resulting in a gap—even conflict—between the way Christians behave and what Jesus taught. P.1 The Divine Conspiracy Study Guide

      What’s been happening the past few days?  Wednesday-  I drove to Williamston to meet Chad Farrand formerly from Red Cedar EFCA and Eric Vanderbosh of River Terrace CRC. We drove to Grand Rapids to have lunch with Randy Buist of Waters Edge and Mark Riddle of Emergent/Youth Speciality fame. We chowed at Don Pablo’s on 28th Street. Part of our conversation was getting acquainted face to face and part of the conversation was talking about how to network and resource for organic, missional, post-modern Kingdom work in the beautiful state of Michigan.  Later that night I took Samantha out for a Daddy / Daughter date for her fifth birthday. We went to Mc Donald’s for Mc Flurry’s. I had Oreo and she had M&M.  Thursday-  I went to a job fair for Aldi grocery stores for the Detroit area and them finished packing up my office at Canton Community Church. As I left I wrote a goodbye note to each of the remaining staff members and told them that one chapter of the kingdom narrative was ending and a new one was beginning. When I drove home I had the chance to see something very cool that got my heart racing. As I turned on to my street I saw the neighbor on the corner out with his gas powered lawn edger edging his next-door neighbors yard. One month earlier I had sensed God telling me to mow that neighbors lawn. Last week he mowed the neighbor on the corner grass and now that neighbor was returning the favor. I saw this as a simple beginning of the restoration of social capitol on our street and the simple beginning of Kingdom presence.  Friday-  I rented a carpet cleaner from Home Depot and shampooed the carpet and couches of some close friends who just had a baby. I also filled out an application to have a vending machine route at a local General Motors transmission plant. Then I came home and cleaned our carpet, the carpet on the stairs, and the carpet in our van.   Saturday_  I helped some friends move into a new duplex. I worked hard but had fun doing it. When it came time to unload we were trying to go as fast as we could and in my haste I slipped/tripped down the stairs twice. I wish it had of been video taped and them I could fund some serous missional work via America’s Funniest Home videos.  We also had a birthday party with several of my daughter’s new friends from kindergarten. Syndie had a chance to talk at length with a mom whose brother-in-law just died of a drug overdose. The mom opened the door for further friendship and contact.  Sunday-  I spoke at the gathering place of a local church called Crosswinds. I spoke on “Be fruitful and multiply” how we are kingdom seed with the DNA of passion, community, and mission embedded in us and that we are to be a sign, instrument, and foretaste of God’s Kingdom presence in our sphere’s of influence. After the gathering we went out to Red Robin for lunch. There were 19 in our party. (11 kids and 8 adults) It was wild and crazy but lots of fun.

      Barn Worship Partee!!   Last night we gathered with a group of about 40 friends for a worship party in a big old barn. We worshipped corporately for over an hour with a kicken worship band led by Syndie and a couple of her music friends.  With all that we have been through it was an incredible time of being lost in the embrace of my Abba Father. I experienced a deep sense of release and freedom as I worshipped.  As we were wrapping up a friend called my wife and I up and gave a basket full of cards and gifts. There were gifts and tokens of appreciation from many friends from our previous church. Later that night as we open the cards we cried tears of joy as we read the kind words and saw check after check fall out of the card. The total amount was staggering. It was an incredible affirmation of God provision for us and the journey we are on.  Here are some photo’s…..

      Things are starting to happen.....  Today I was  offered a FT position at my old janitor job at Our Lady of Good Counsel. It will 40 hrs a week with insurance benefits. My shift is M-F 8:00 to 4:00. I am not sure what my pay will be. When I first started as a temp they we paying me $10.00 which equates to about 20K a year. They might increase my pay a bit now that they want to bring me on FT. Not sure how it will play out.  I also got a call from an other friend whose company needs a janitor starting in October paying $12.50 a hour plus benefits, but the hours would be 1:00 to 9:00 M-F. Not jazzed about the hours but the pay is better. Hoping it might be a bargaining chip at OLGC.  I have also already had several good conversations about our plans for New Life with people I used to work with at OLGC. Tying in to good old St. Pat and a starting point in the conversation with these Roman Catholics.   I am also checking some opportunities to do some sales related things to help supplement the income. One is selling mattresses out of our garage and the other is selling web and network related products. Both of the connections are from kingdom friends. So we will have to see what pans out.  I would also appreciate your prayers for Syndie. She has become a member of the Schweitzer PTA and has her first meeting next Tuesday. She has also made a good connection with a another school mom named, "Jennie", in Sam's class. Her brother-in-law committed suicide the first week of school and the whole family is still struggling with the tragic loss.   Thanks for upholding us before the Father.

      Today me and my family gathered together to worship at the University of Michigan botanical gardens. We began by reading the creation account from Genesis 1 and talked about what it means for us as a family to be fruitful and multiply and take care of the earth. We took an unhurried stroll through the gardens taking in the spectacular beauty. We then had a picnic together and went back home. It was a good for all of us.

      Look who is having a birthday.....    My oldest daughter Emily just celebrated her 8th. birthday. It is hard to believe that 8 years with her has allready gone by. I love my Emmy and I am excited to be her Dada.   Da Boy's....   Here is a picture of the "kings of janitorial" at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church and School. This is one of the many coffee breaks we take throughout the day.   I am excited tomorrow after work the whole family is loadeing up and taking a drive to visit Tom and Sandy Blaylock in Williamston. Which is about an hour away. We are going to stay over night so we can have some late night conversation after all of the kids go to bed.

      Home Projects…  I know I am not remodeling a bathroom like fellow blogger  urlLink Chad  but today my wife and I tackled a furniture assembly project of desk for our home office.    Of all the assembly furniture projects that we have dine in 10 years of marriage this was probably one of the easier ones we have done. Syndie only lost her temper and cussed once.    Just kidding         This lead to and all out clean up and tidy of all of our upstairs bedrooms.  I am tired and it is time to go to bed.

      I just returned from the local video  urlLink rental store  with a bag of movies for $4.00. This is our cheap entertainment while Syndie is away at a "ladies scrap book weekend" with a dozen of her friends. We picked up Buzz Lightyear, Bob the Builder, ( for JJ) Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, (for Sam) Three and and a little lady (for Emily) and Gladiator and the Muskateer for me.   The last couple of days have been slow at my janitorial job and I have been able to do a lot of reading. I have been reading through  urlLink Willard's,  Divine Conspiracy. This is the first time that I have read it straight through cover to cover. I have found the reading very stimulating and giving me a lot to think about as we begin to live intentionally as a missional community of Christ's apprentices. I have a feeling that this is going to be a book that I will read and re-read on a regular basis. It is rich as far as teaching and explaining how to pursue Kingdom living now.  I am really enjoying my job at our Lady of Good Counsel. It is stuff that is very easy to do and I have lots of time to think and pray while I work. Last night Syndie and I had another discussion about money and how we were going to pay the bills. The current rate of pay that I am receiving does not cover all of our minimum fixed expenses. Recently we have received some generous financial gifts from some dear and close friends that we allow to be ok for a couple of months. But then what??? I keep saying and praying that if we make God's Kingdom our primary concern he will provide what we need from day to day. I empathic with  urlLink Alan and Liz  and what they have been going through to find decent reliable transportation within their budget.  One of the things that I have been doing as part of my "rule" with the order of St. Aidan is reading through the Sermon on the Mount (  urlLink Matthew 5-7)  whenever I get an opportunity. Below is a section on leadership I have mulled over a lot recently.  Being and Doing 13"Don't look for shortcuts to God. The market is flooded with surefire, easygoing formulas for a successful life that can be practiced in your spare time. Don't fall for that stuff, even though crowds of people do. 14The way to life--to God!-is vigorous and requires total attention. 15"Be wary of false preachers who smile a lot, dripping with practiced sincerity. Chances are they are out to rip you off some way or other. Don't be impressed with charisma; look for character. 21"Knowing the correct password--saying "Master, Master,' for instance--isn't going to get you anywhere with me. What is required is serious obedience--doing what my Father wills. 22I can see it now--at the Final Judgment thousands strutting up to me and saying, "Master, we preached the Message, we bashed the demons, our God-sponsored projects had everyone talking.' 23And do you know what I am going to say? "You missed the boat. All you did was use me to make yourselves important. You don't impress me one bit. You're out of here.' 24"These words I speak to you are not incidental additions to your life, homeowner improvements to your standard of living. They are foundational words, words to build a life on. If you work these words into your life, you are like a smart carpenter who built his house on solid rock. 25Rain poured down, the river flooded, a tornado hit--but nothing moved that house. It was fixed to the rock. 26"But if you just use my words in Bible studies and don't work them into your life, you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach. 27When a storm rolled in and the waves came up, it collapsed like a house of cards." 28When Jesus concluded his address, the crowd burst into applause. They had never heard teaching like this. 29It was apparent that he was living everything he was saying--quite a contrast to their religion teachers! This was the best teaching they had ever heard.  Peace

      Today was a wet and rainy day her in the Metro Detroit area. I was not able to do much at work because of the weather so I was able to read several chapters of a Thomas Merton book called, Life and Holiness. I found it laying on a shelf in the Religous Formation office I was cleaning at the catholic church I work as a janitor at right now. It was excellent reading. I have herad Merton cited a lot but have never had a opportunity to read up till know. What I read was very good. I also was able to read / re-read a couple of chapters from the Divine Conspiracy as well.  I also was mulling over a post of  urlLink Jason Evans  that I read last night as well. The gist of what he was saying is that most "spiritual leaders" create community they don't live in it. That really rang true with me and the last church I was on staff at. I am finding first hand with my family and kingdom friends that community is hard and messy at times but well worth it in the end. As the Ekklesia Project says, "realtionships have power!".

         Here is a pic of chef Tom Blaylock cooking up bacon......  My family and I had a great time with Tom and Sandy Blaylock. It is great to have friends like them a hour a way from us who are on a parraell journey. It is also cool because are kids play together so well too. My Emily plays with there Megan(both are 8), my Sam and their Emily are both 5, and JJ is 3 and their Grant is 4.  We spent the time just hanging out eating, enjoying a bonfire, and catching up and what has been going on in each of our familys lives. Friday evening Chad Farrand and his wife Mel were able to hang out with us as well.  We also talked about how we can get together on a more regularbasis for encouragement, support, ideas, and accountability. We also would like to do some sort of combined Gathering with New Life and Journey as well.  I thank God for partners like Tom and Sandy and so many others I am in contact with whether it is face to face, phone, email, IM, or blogging.  I am am rich in the relationships I have!!

      I just finished reading the book, Everbody's Normal Until You Get To Know Them, by J. Ortberg. It is an excellent primer on the need/place/role of community in our kingdom lives.  Here a couple of sound bites....  "Call it a clan, call it a tribe, call it a network, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one."  ~ Jane Howard   "We were created to draw life and nourishment from one another the way roots of an oak tree draw life from the soil. Community - living in vital connectedness with others - is essential to human life."  ~ John Ortberg   "Human beings who give themselves to relational greatness - who have friends they laugh with, cry with, learn with, fight with, dance with, live and love and grow old and die with - these are human beings who lead magnificent lives." ~ John Ortberg

      I was cleaning out my bag I take to work with me every day and I found a couple of quotes that I saw in a office I was cleaning last week. Both of these quotes come from Mother Teresa.   The fruit of silence is prayer. The fruit of prayer is faith. The fruit of faith is love. The fruit of love is service. The fruit of service is peac e.   "God does not call us to do great things but to do small things with great love."

      Green light for Atlanta……..  Last night before I went to bed I received an email from  urlLink Greg Quiring  confirming the details for the upcoming trek to Atlanta to hang with  urlLink Rodney Clapp  and a bunch of other missional minded Kingdom people. I am excited to go and be a part of this conversation and interact with friends and make some new friends as well. The theme for the week is about we can be the peculiar people God meant his called out ones to be. The hurdles we will be dialoging with will be Constantiniaism, Consumerism, and Constancy/Inconstancy. More details to follow next week.  I also just received a surprise present from my lovely wife. She secretly ordered me a copy of a DVD called “Reluctant Saint: Francis of Assisi”. It is a docu-drama about Francis and what he did. Syndie got the video for me because I have for a long time been fond of the quote of St. Francis that says, “Preach the gospel all of the time and if necessary use words.” I really enjoyed learning more about Francis’s life and the era in which he ministered. The production was from a place called  urlLink Vision Video .  I noticed in the catalog that came with it that they also had a DVD about St. Patrick and a couple about Bonhoeffer. (hint,hint) ;-)

      High up in the sky!!.....      Above is a picture of a helicopter like I took a ride in last night. My neighbor is a helicopter mechanic and he occasionally takes me along on side jobs to help. Last nights job required a test flight after we were through. For more technical info check out the  urlLink web site . It was a very awesome experience.  Today was cold and rainy here in SE Michigan. On my lunch today I ran out and bought Syndie a couple of CD's for a surprise present. I picked up the new Dave Crowder and the new Passion. Both of which she likes very much. Then I made her a dozen mini-paper roses with craft supplies I lifted from the school art room. It was very nostalgic because I did it for her recial in college when I was to poor to buy flowers.   I had an awesome time in Atlanta this past weekend. The best part by far was hanging out and deepening friendships. I met a new friend from the west side of Michigan named Brian Woltheis. In fact they had a special time of prayer for the three guys (Tom Blaylock, Brian Woltheis, myself) from Michigan. Saturday night we had a good time at the Buckhead brewery and I made the winning shot in pool for Tawd and I as we spanked Tom and Creech. (truth) {only that game, not the whole night}  peace

      The whole family and I had a great experience this past weekend in Cincy. It is a very refreshing time for us to go there and hang out and be loved on.   Saturday morning was a powerful time of ministry to Syndie I as people gathered around us to bless and support us in prayer. The prayers were spirt led and they had a huge impact on us. The conversations in and around the  urlLink Brownhouse and St. Elizabeth’s  were great as well.  Our hosts for the weekend were  urlLink Chris and Nicki Marshall . We were the first people to stay in the recently finished basement suite. The hospitality was incredible and the kids did not want to leave on Sunday which is always a good sign.  We had a beautiful warm and sunny drive back up to Michigan and then we gathered in our home with our home group. We had a great meal of taco pie, tossed salad, and homemade cobbler. We had a great time of conversation centered on what is going on in our lives and how we begin to explore together the mystery and vitality of community life together.  As Syndie fell into to bed we said that we are truly blessed!!

      Yesterday, I felt drawn to take and read from the Henri Nouwen book, In the Name of Jesus.  Here are a couple of the thoughts I meditated on as I read throught this little gem.   "Much Christian leadership is excercised by people who do not know how to develop healthy, intimate relationships and have opted for power and control instead."  "Jesus had a different vision of maturity: It is the ability and willingness to be led where you would rather not go."  "Dealing with burning issues without being rooted in a deep personal relationship with God easily leads to divisiveness because, before we know it, our sense of self is caught up in our opinion about a given subject. But when we are securely rooted in personal intimacy with the source of life, it will be possible to remain flexible without being relavitistic, convinced without being rigid, willing to confront without being offensive, gentle and forgiving without being soft, and a true witness without being manipulative."

      I ran across this snipet this morning before I wen to work. It gave me a lot to mull over all day. Hope it gives you something to chew on as well.  Q and A with  urlLink Brian McLaren  from an Article in  urlLink Net Results  September/October 2003   Q- Why would you make people aware, disturb them, and then tell them to do nothing? A- The human brain isn’t made for this kind of rapid change. We have to go inward. We have to hold our disturbance up to God. We shouldn’t react in panic or defensiveness or with a flurry of activity, or we will just make it worse. We must become quiet before God.  Q- Why is leading transformation so costly to the clergy who try? A- A pastor trying to help his church transform to reach post moderns is caught between two constituencies: the ninety-nine who are there or the one who wandered away. Or, I a postmodern twist, now the ninety-nine have wandered away. If we abandon the one to search for the ninety-nine, the remaining one feels really alone. To what degree are religious professionals and to what degree are we missionaries? Do we want a nice carrier or do we want to reach the lost? Missionaries are often martyred.  Q- You are the grandson of a missionary who started 400 churches in Angola and you say your best gift is evangelism. What is the evangelistic mindset today? A- Our faith has become obsessed wit how to get to heaven without loving God or loving our neighbor. Faith is not about crossing a line: it’s about getting started on a lifelong path. We’ve turned the starting line into a finish line, as if crossing that line they are completed in the faith when in fact, they’re just starting. Jesus called for his disciples to be fishers of men. Today people like their fish, but they want them scaled, gutted, filleted, and fired before they have to deal with them. They don’t want the one’s flopping in the bottom of the boat or swimming in deep water.

         Above is a new little piece a good friend did for our updated web site at  urlLink New Life . We also have our domain up and running now as well thanks to the donation of some cyber real estate from my friend Marcus James who hosts The Holy Observor.  Sorry it has been a while since I have posted to my blog.  Last night I saw the movie the  urlLink Italian Job  (2003) version. Suspense, thriller, like that is my favorite genere of movie. I hope that someone get it for me as a Christmas gift.  We had a great time today with our community as we gathered today in our home. We had a great time of food, real life conversation. We talked a lot about what it really means to live and have a life of passion which is one of our DNA values along with community and mission.   Later in the day I had been asked to speak on the topic of spiritual growth at a local church plant called " urlLink relavent church "  They are doing the 40 Days of Purpose. I used mostly material from Willard's, Divine Conspiracy. Things like what it means to be a disciple/apprentice of Jesus. The idea of vision, intention, and means, as well as the golden triangle of spiritual growth. I also contrasted to pervailing cultural values of growth with the kingdom principles of growth. Like this-  World                                                                              Kingdom  Rational                                                                            mystery quick,easy                                                                      hard, slow individualistic                                                                 co-operative  I also met a person who Mike Bishop sent me an email about earlier this week. Mike had a year long dialog with this guy and recommend he contact me as a local person to talk to. So it was mysterious nad cool that he happened to be there and we connected.  Well it's late and I need to go to bed....

      Wow, I am very tired!! My earlly morning starts are catching up with me. I have ben getting up at 5:15 in order to be at work by 6:30 to open up everything. To makes matters more taxing on me today, we were shorthanded two people. I also earned my pay with manual labor like hauling an old avacado fridge out of the rectory basement.  I am home alone with the kids tonight because Syndie in having a Crative Memory home party or whatever you call it. She has four scheduled for this week trying to make some selling bonuses in her first month which is up on Friday. So I will be spending some good hang time with my kids the next couple of nights.  Last night I was a glutton for punishemnt and took atvantage of my grand master key and played some b-ball with some friends. I was tired before we started due to my early wake up but I was exhausted when I was done. To make matters worse in the last game I got kneed in the thigh and it gave me an instataneous charlie horse. I have felt it all day long. I told Syndie it is funny to think that I was a serious contender in high school and know I am an old gimpy geezer after taking a 10 year vacation from basically all sports when I blew my knee out my sophmore year of college. For me the man thing in the commradarie not the athletic ablity.  Here is a cool quote I found by St. John Chrysostom (the golden toungue)   Let this, I say, be our way of overpowering them, and conducting our warefare against them; and let us, before all words, astound them by our way of life. for this is the main battle, this is the unaswerable argument, the argument from actions. For though we give ten thousand precepts of philoshophy in words, if we do not exhibit a life better than theirs, the gain is nothing. For it is not what is said that draws there attention, but their inquiry is, what we do ... Let us win therefore by our life.

      Crazy Stuff happening at my place of employ!!  People are being suspened. People are making threats of lawsuits. Accusations of racial predjudice. My boss is mysteriously on vacation for a week. Policy and procedure is changing on a daily basis. I have no idea what to make of it. I know God has placed me here on staff for a reason so I continue to try be a kingdom presence in a difficult situation.  For the rest of the week I will be at work at 6:30 am since my boss is now on a vacation or leave of absence. I was finally given my insurance paperwork today and had a frank discussion with the Parish Business Manager abot a raise.  Had a good weekend. Had several discussions on some of the material from Clapp Fest in Atlanta. Mostly about how we can be kingdom oriented in a consumeristic society. Then in just happened that the book I was reading had a extended quote from Clapp and Webber on the need to be "diacritical". The book is highly recommended to pick up from ...    Beanbooks.com     Becoming Friends- Worship, Justice, and the Practice of Christian Friendship. By Paul J. Wadell, Bazos Press 2002 ISBN 1-58743-051-7     Here is the info on being a diacritical community....  A diacritical community, however, contradicts and challenges some of the values, customs, and practices of society not only to call attention to something that might be false and harmful but also to point to something much more graceful and promising. A diacritical community, such as the church is called to be, contradicts the world not for the sake of being odd or dif- ferent but to call people's attention to a way of life that is undoubt- edly challenging and demanding but also unabashedly joyful and full of hope. As Clapp and Webber explain, "The critic calls atten- tion to something wrong; the diacritic goes one step beyond criti- cism and distinguishes an alternative. Accordingly, the church intends not only to criticize and contradict the identities and visions of the world, but to present a distinctive, alternative iden- tity and vision."

      New Job ???  Today out of the clear blue I received a call for an interview to a job I applied to about four months a go at the  urlLink University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  The position is a custodial supervisor/manager. So please pray for me tomorrow at 3:30 as I go to explore this opportunity.  Right now we are having a monster wind storm in Metro Detroit. Huge gusts keep blasting the house and trees. The kids are having trouble getting off to bed.  I will post any updates on the job interview tomorrow.

      Sorry for the delay in posting anything new. Last week was very busy on all fronts and I have been intetionally being idle in order to allow my body, mind, and soul room to breathe.  Good news today ....  I had a meeting with the parish business mamnager and I am going to get a raise at work which I am thankful for, but it will still require us to bank according to the Mt 6:33 principle. God has been faithful thus far and I am know He will continue to see us through.  I also received a call from my good friend Doug saying he had performed a verifiable miracle with my old lap top computer and brought it back to the land of the living. I am hoping to be able to take it to work and plug into the school network and do some surfing, emailing, and blogging on my lunch hour. Thanks big time Doug!!   This past Sunday we had a great time of hanging out with our home group. I had the idea to have the kids color pictures of all of the people in the "neighborhood". Their teacher, troop leader, friends, etc. It was a cool exercise for the kids to see who they could thank for helping them, or praying for them and it was a good reminder to the adults about all the peple in their sphere of influence that they interact and influence on a regular basis. Below is a picture that someone impromtu sketched of me.     Today I have spent a lot of time mulling over the DVD I watched with Syndie last night which was, "I am Sam". I laughed, I cried, it was really good. Even as I watched the extra's I really got a good glimpe into see how good movies are a true art form. I hope i the future to use some of the clips to illustrate some vital kingdom principles.    Well I need to go and to a few household chores.  Peace

      Church Planting vs Gospel Planting  Recently I met a national leader of the Navigator's national metro-city ministries. He made a comment about being a gospel planter verses a church planter. The phrase stuck with me and I emailed him and asked for some more of his thoughts. I will post his thoughts below. He is also very curious for feedback so I will pass along any comments to him.   1. Most church planters have something fairly specific in mind  when they go to plant a church, esp. they have cultural forms in mind.  This may limit the the audience they will be able to reach and the extent to which the gospel will flow.  By this I mean the form that is planted may only be attractive to receptive people.   2. Too often church plants focus on gathering displaced or transitioning Christians.  This is a good thing to do, but often diverts attention away from a focus on lost people coming to faith.  Actually, this type of church plant can do a lot towards revitalization of faith for those who participate.   3. Gospel planting on the other hand focuses directly on the lost person and their spiritual needs.  It is sensitive to their contexts and world view.  This is not to imply that church planting can't do this, it just simply means that in my observation it is not the primary concern.     4. Gospel planting seems consistent with what we find in scripture.  Paul clearly stated that he was a gospel planter.  He was equally clear that God caused the growth.  In this way of thinking, we plant the gospel and Jesus builds his church.   5. To make a stark contrast it would seem unlikely that we can plant anything like church as we know it in an Arab Muslim country.  However, I would hope that we could plant the gospel of Jesus and His kingdom in any culture, no matter how hostile.   The bottom line is this.  I am not against church planting in any way.  Rather, I want to be sensitive to promoting the purity and mobility of the gospel of Jesus with no cultural add-ons.  It is only in this way that the good news of Jesus can reach even the most resistent people.  That is my passion.   I would appreciate your feedback.    I am still waithing to here a yes or no from U of M.   Tuesday I went and saw the new Matrix flick with a friend at a local theatre. We were the only two people in that particular screening. Hard to believe. Maybye I will go on Tuesday nights more often.  This weekend the girls are going to be in a local parade with their respective Girl Scout groups. They are very excited to say the least.  Today my boss tried to impose some last minute mandatory overtime on this Saturday. The overwhelming response from me and all of my co-workers was fat chance! Or at least not until the football game is over. I am excited to watch Michigan kick some buckeye bootie on Saturday.

      Job Interview Update-  Thanks for all of your prayers on Thursday afternoon. I felt very calm and at peace as I went into the interview. The interview lasted 1 1/2 hours and I was interrogated by a group of four people. They asked me questions about everthing under the sun. The way it was left is that they would inform me of their descision in a week to a week in a half. I'll keep you posted as it develops.  A lot has been happing here at our house this weekend because my in-laws have been here for a visit. It has been good for us to spend time with them. The kids have done all sorts of crafts and projects with Grandma including baking cookies.     Papa did a whole bunch of house fix up projects which included the big job of moving the half wall/bookcase by our kithchen table. This will give us more room around our kithchen eating area.         Saturday morning we all went and got our hair cut. JJ did not want to do it so I had to hold him down so it could be cut. I turned out good considering all we went through to get it cut.    I also did a wedding yesterday for some people in the comminity who did not have a regular pastor or church home. The wedding was done at a local historical society in a church built in 1844. God's blessing to Joe and Maria and their new life together.    Tomorrow my work schedule is changing a bit. I am going to be working from 10-6 instead of 8-4. But I am hoping to start blogging on my luch on the school network since my lap top is fixed for the time being.  Peace

      Sweet surprise Christmas gift for Syndie!!  This afternoon I drove Syndie downtown to the Fox Theatre for the Radio City Music Spectacular. She was comepletely surprised and we both totally loved it. On the way home we both said what an incredible thing of beauty and worship the performance was. The show finished with a very moving "living nativity".After it was over we grabbed a quick bite at Johnny Rockets. A big thanks to our friend Becky for looking after the kids so we could go.  Here a a few photo's..............

      Good Thanksgiving...  I am just sitting here looking out my kitchen window reflecting on what a great couple of days we have had with my family here for Thanksgiving.  We had a blast just sitting around talking, laughing, playing games like Cranium, performaces by the children, eating great food, and having a good time watch the kids all play together. I burned a CD with 50 digital pics for my mom and dad and my brother and his family.  I also took the advice of several of my blogging friends and rented the movie Whale Rider and stayed up late last night watching that.  For the rest of today we are just going to hang out and chill and do a whole lot of nothing. Later this evening we are going to watch our good friends Mike and Becky daughter, kimberly so they can go out for dinner and celebrate their anniversary. Then tomorrow Becky is returning the favor for us so that I can take Syndie out for her surprise Christmas gift which is tickets to go see the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Show at the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit. This will be a complete surprise for her all she knows is that we are going out for awhile tomorrow. She really like surprise so this should be good.  Tomorrow evening we are going to have a game night and birthday celebration with our missional community friends.  Well I proised to let my kids go to their favorite web sites.

      Changes..  Well, as you can see I was in the mood to make some changes to the appearnace of my blog.  i am upstairs on the computer while Syndie and a girlfried are re-papering the walls of out kithen. Syndie is very excited to get ris of the old wallpaper. It had a spice theme, but she thought it looked like "weed" you buy on the street corner.  I am really looking forward to a short week at work. The holiday time off will be very nice. A large comtingency of my family is driving up on Wednesday to have Thanksgiving dinner with us. This is the first time we have been the host home for American Thanksgiving. A side note. for the last 10 years we have celebrated American Thanksgiving in November and Canadian Thanksgiving in October because Syndie is Canadian.  Last week I git a new wi-fi card for my lap top but the school I work at will not allow me to access the Blogger web site. I was really hoping to be able to do some posting on my lunch by that will have to continue to happen at night as I have time.  Well that it for now.

      Mr. Coffee put on the disabled list!..........  What a wonderful surprise we received first thing this morning. Our best friends Doug and Heather Hovey showed up at our door with a special present for us. It was a ...  urlLink Bunn Coffee Maker !! Which is like the Lexus of coffee makers. I am sitting here sipping a fresh cup of great coffee as I type. Thanks Doug and Heather you are a very special gift to us.  Today we have just been having a low key relaxing day. We went out to lunch at  urlLink Denny's  and then went to the local Salvation Army thrift shop. We scored some great buys. The best thing that my son JJ found was a 3ft tall stuffed Shrek doll.  urlLink Shrek  is one of his favorite movies. He ran around the store singing the Smashmouth song, "hey now, you're an all-star...". It was cute to see. I pick up some good condition U of M sports appearal for next to nothing as well.  Tonight I and my friend Doug are taking our kids to drive through the Wayne County Christmas light display at Heinz Park while are wives attend a Christmas party. After we get the kids in bed we plan to watch the X-Men movie. Speaking of movies we re-watched "Fugative" with Harrison Ford. It is a great movie but the best part is that we used to live in downtown Chicago were a lot of the movie was filmed.  Things have been very busy at work the last couple of weeks getting the regular cleaning and maintainence done as well as all of the Christmas and Advent decorating done at the  urlLink church  and  urlLink school.  On wednesda of this week we had a water pipe burst under the school and they had to jack-hammer half of my closet floor out to do the repair. Yesterday I had a great conversation with the school principle about some ways to improve the moral of those working on the custodial staff. This opened the door to me sharing my story and what we felt God was calling us to do with the establishement of a missional community and how we are trying to be faithful Christ followers in the post-modern context. She was genuinely interested in what I was saying and I am sure it will to more dialougue in the future. Part of the conversation as well yesterday was about my request to go to  urlLink "Not Alone"  on January 9,10. She was genuinely interested in what someone like McLaren would have to say to her and what she is doing at the catholic school.  I have been also doing some great reading this week on my lunch hours. I have opted for reading since I am unable to blog from the school network. The two books I a reading this week are Eugene Peteresen's, Long obedience in the same direction, and Reggie McNeal's book, A work of heart. Both are very worthwhile reads.  Well my daughters are watching a movie downstaires and I must go check on them.

      Tonight we lit the first candle in the Advent wreath with our missional community and talked about what it is to have something to "hope" for. We also read this re-working of I Corinthians 13.   FIRST CORINTHIANS 13, CHRISTMAS VERSION    If I decorate my house perfectly with plaid bows, Strands of twinkling lights and shiny balls, But do not show love to my family, I'm just another decorator.                                                                      If I slave away in the kitchen, Baking dozens of Christmas cookies, Preparing gourmet meals And arranging a beautifully adorned table at mealtime, But do not show love to my family, I'm just another cook.  If I work at the soup kitchen, Carol in the nursing home And give all that I have to charity, But do not show love to my family, It profits me nothing.  If I trim the spruce with shimmering angels And crocheted snowflakes, Attend a myriad of holiday parties And sing in the choir's cantata, But do not focus on Christ, I have missed the point.  Love stops the cooking to hug the child. Love sets aside the decorating to kiss the husband. Love is kind, though harried and tired. Love doesn't envy another's home that has coordinated Christmas china and table linens. Love doesn't yell at the kids to get out of  the way, but is thankful they are there to be in the way. Love doesn't give only to those who are able to give in return, but rejoices in giving to those who can't.  Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never fails.  Video games will break, pearl necklaces will be lost, golf clubs will rust...But giving the gift of love will endure.   Thought for the Day: You can give without loving but you cannot love without giving.

We had a big turkey dinner with the all the trimmings. We also played a gift exchange game and I won two childrens toothbrushes!!  I am my sister and brother in-laws now just hanging out and catching up on ehat has gone on for the last three months. My brother-in-law is mixing up some wickedly good drinks that he learned how to make from a friend who has a pub. They are called Celtic Mist. It is a mix of Baileys, Scotch,Kalooah, milk and crushed ice. Very Good!! I am forgeting my gift game prize allready.  Last night was a lot of fun as well. We had a first annual New Life Christmas Dinner night out. (adults only) We went to Olive Garden in Ann Arbor.  ..... Well I need to go on a emergency Guiness run!! To be continued.....

      House church meeting tonight.....  Just finished up having our home church meeting. Celebrated a meal together and celebrated what is going on in our lives. Congradulations to Doug, who won a "spirit of excellence award" at U of M where he works. They had a special award prsentation and he won a special cash bonus! We also celebrated my daughter Emily being chosen to be the special "apple" in her class for the coming week. We also light the second Advent candle and attempted to sing Oh Little town of Bethlahem. :) One of the best parts of the evening was overheraing a conversation Syndie had with one of the other lady about the change in someones attitude and action in our group. It great to hear other people spot "fruit". This also led to a discussion on what it means to make a committment to Christ. Centering in on the fact that it is more than a one time prayer and then do what you want.  I have still not heard any thing from U of M and at this point am skeptical if I will. I feel God is really asking me to concentrate and focus in on how I can make my current job a place of "ministry". It is so easy to have the mindset of this is something that I just have to tolerate or just get through. I don't have a lot of answers yet but am genuinely seeking them out. I know this is part of God's life-long learning program for me. If any one has picked up some ideas allredy on this please pass them on to me.  Peace

      Blogging from Central Illinois.........  Well we just arrived safe and somewhat sound at my parents in Charleston, IL. We were able to squeeze a 8 hour trip into 10 hours due to an Interstate closure on I-70 between Casey and Greenup. Other than that the trip was great! We came via I-75 through Ohio to I-70 and then West to Illinois. We are here to celebrate my Grandma's 80th birthday tomorrow and Christmas with my family. Relatives are coming from as far away as Portland, Oregon. Syndie is also doing a Christmas concert tomorrow evening at my dad's church. We thought and prayed for all of our friends gathered at the Brownhouse and St. Elizabeth's for the regional all group plus.  It is good to be here with family but I have had a very exhausting week at work. I had to work 12 to 14 hours most days. We had to rip off wall to ceiling carpet that was glued to the walls of the school gymnasium. It was was messy, hard, work.   Well it is time to eat. More later........

      Do little things make a difference?..............  We think so! Tonight, as part of my regular end of the weekend ritual I wheeled my garbage out to the curb for morming pick-up. Only this time we tried to do something special for the guys to do this every week rain or shine. Tomorrow, our garbage men will each find of book of Dunkin Doughnut gift certificates. Our small way of saying we thank you and God cares about you.      Whose life can you touch in some small way this Christmas season?

      the beauty of christmas...........  We just finished up having dinner with allof the families of our small community. it was great to be together again and exchange some loving thoughtful gifts. At 10:00 we are going to go and visit a local Episcable church for a candleligt service.  Today I had to work a half day and I enjoyed listening to some music that I bought with my Christmas bonus. I purchased the following CD's: Sting- Sacred Love, Cold Play- Rush to the head, and Radiohead- Hail to the thief. As I workrd and listened I thought a lot about how God has been faithful to me and my family this past year. He has provided for us in every way. He has also chosen to do it through a string of small but powerful means. Much like the OT widow whose jar of oil never ran out. God continues to help me learn in an experiential way the message of Matthew 6:33. I am so thankful for the reality of Christ's presence in my life this Christmas season.  Peace on Earth and Merry Christmas to all.

      Looking forward to Christmas.............  My day a work went by fast today and i wa abble to come home earlier than I normally do. I played with JJ, my son on the floor with his new fire rescue set he received from Great Grandma for Christmas. We also took my daughter out to get part of our daughters Christmas presents which was getting their ears pierced. They each chose to get earring studs that were there birthstones. Sam was a real trooper and went first and it took like of coaxing to get Emily to through with it. In the end they were both glad they had it done.  I have been meaning to share some thoughts I came across a couple weeks a go from a book called, Let your life speak, by Parker Palmer. He had some very insightful info on depression or deconstruction if you will. What I share below is from his book.  "depression demand that we reject simplistic answers, both "religous" and "scientific" and learn to embrace mystery, something our culture resists.  "depression was, indeed, the the hand of a friend trying to press me to the down to the ground on which it was safe to stand -- the ground of my own truth, my own nature, with its complex mix of limits and gifts, liabilities and assests, darkness and light.  Palmer says that there where 4 things that contributed to this in his life..........  1) being trained as an intellectual...living largely in the head, which is furtherest from the heart  2) embracing a form of Christian faith devoted more to the abstraction of God rather than the experience of God  3) an inflated ego  4) a ethic that was driven by images of what he should be rather than what was true and possible and life giving  I find myself on similar journey and I jontinue to ask God to shape and mold me through all of it.

      Night out with my honey bear.....  I just came back from a surprise night out with my wife. She took me out to TGI Fridays to celebrate my birthday since I will be at Mayhem in Cincy on the day of. We had a great dinner and a eaven better conversations about life and where we find ourselves. We also did some shopping since we were kidless after dinner. I am so thankful that I have a true friend and soul mate in my wife Syndie.  Well it's late and I need to get some sleep. I have had to work a lot of OT this week with all of the MI snow and ice. I don't have to worry about more snow for the time being because it has dropped into the low teens temp wise.  I am really looking forward to Mayhem in Ohio which I leave for right after work tomorrow.

      Happy New Year...................  I have taken an intentional break from blogging over the holiday season to spend more time with family and friends and also try to have some extra time to think and pray.  The whole holiday time was really good. We had safe travels to IL and Canada. Entertained 18 people overnight last weekend and a whole host of other fun things. Last night we made chocolate chip cookies as a family from start to finish. It is fun to make memories like that with my kids.  This morning Syndie I sat together on pondered what things we might try to be more intential about this coming year. Of the things we discussed here are some things that we settled upon. We are going to try and read through the entire Bible from the Message paraphrase and memorize the Prayer of St. Francis. We are also going to improve our exercise and health this year as well. Syndie is going to do lap swimming at the local aquatic center and I am going to try to play more basketball or anything else that won't seem to much like exercise. I am also planning on making a more concerted effort to use the Celtic Daily Prayer for part of my spiritual formation.  On New Years Day I prayed this prayer as an act of commitment to the Lord.  I am no longer my own, but yours. Use me as you choose; rank me alongside whoever you choose; pu me to doing, put me to suffering; let me be employed for you, or laid aside fro you, raised up for you, or brought down low for you; let me be full, let me be empty; let me have all things, let me have nothing; with my whole heart i freely choose to yield all things to your ordering and approval.  So now, God of glory, Father Son and Holy Spirit, You are mine, and I am your own.  Celtic Book of Daily Prayer

      Way to go Emily !....  I am so proud of my daughter. Today she was awarded a special math award at school. She was one of only three kids in her class to do so. It was good to see the fruit of her discipline and persistence. There were times last year when we were both so frustrated doing flashcards for homework, but it has paid off. We went to Red Robin for dinner tonight to celebrate as a family.  Here is Emily and her new math shirt.........     It has been a crazy busy week for me at work due to the snow and ice that we were hit with in the metro-area. I have put in three 12 days with lots of manual labor. Last night I played basketball with friends and did nit get home until after midnight. It is satrting to be very enjoyable again for me, which is the first time in about 11 years.  Tonight after the kids were in bed I read an article written by Neil Tibbott, who I met last week in Cincy. The article was about the life cyle of missional church life. Which he said is submerge, emerge, and converge. You can read it here if I uploaded it correctly.   urlLink Article- Starting Churches Missionally - Tibbott.pdf">article  Web link if that did not work  urlLink here

      Here is a quote from a book I read last year that sums up the time at Mayhem.  >  > Many of us began to make important changes in our lives > when we found a friend who shared our disenchantment. Instead > of feeling isolated by our convictions, we discovered a com- > panion who agreed that there has to be something better, some- > thing more fulfilling, something worthier of our devotion. Often > it is in conversation with our friends that we discover the uneasi- > ness and dissatisfaction we feel about the sovereign narratives > of our culture are not entirely unique. Our friends share our > disquiet and, like us, want to live by a different truth. This is why > C. S. Lewis said "every real friendship is a sort of secession, even > a rebellion," and (hat all good friendships are a "pocket of  > potential resistance." The radical power of the best of friendships is > that they empower us to break free from the destructive  > fantasies and ideologies of our culture in order to begin something > better. >  > Authentic friendships can be centers of liberation and new > life, even acts of hopeful defiance and rebellion, before much in > a culture that is unpromising and enslaving. Friendships give > us space to rethink our lives. They offer us a context for reflect- > ing on the habits and patterns of our lives and what they are > making of us. They offer us the security we need to risk asking > why we really are not happy and to inquire about what might > be missing from our lives. Best of all, they invite us to imagine > much more promising ways of life and give us the courage we > need to embrace them. Such friendships are freeing and full of > hope, but they can also be threatening to anyone seduced by the > narratives of despair. They can be particularly threatening to > people in authority, especially if they are part of institutions that > perpetuate these narratives of despair.  > Becoming Friends- Worship, Justice, and the Practice of Christian Friendship, (by Paul Wadell,Brazos Press, 2002)

      back from mayhem.............  I had a great time at mayhem this past weekend. it seemed to be the right combination of encouragement, dialouging, catching up, and just having fun. One of the highlights was sharing living space with two guys from Seattle. (John with YWAM and Neil with CRM). A big thanks to everyone who worked hard for this all come together. I will post more later. I need to spend some time with my family.

      It's Cold!!!  It has been cold for the last several days here in Michigan. At times I which I was living in Sacramento, CA again. I could drive up to the snow in the Sierra Nevada's in a couples hours but leave it behind when it was time to come home. Oh, we'll. I need to learn to learn to bloom where I find myself planted. The day before yesterday I took the kids sledding at a local golf course. The temp was a balmy 18 degrees. The kids were only able to stay for 20 minutes before they were ready to head home and have hot chocolate.  Yesterday I started my day off on the wrong foot! Quite literally. I got up at 5:45 and took the first step to descend my stairs to the kitchen to make coffee, but as I took that step down I slipped and went airborne. I made a  huge thump as I slammed into the stairs, after my feet went all the way up in the air. Syndie came tearing out of bed and thought I had a heart attack or something. She found me in a pile at the bottom of the stairs. It was one of the moments where I wondered if cussing would make me feel better? I had no serious injuries other that my pride and the knuckle that got caught in the railing. Now a day latter I still feel a bit stiff. Some of my close friends are shouting "JIM CAM" as they read this. They think I have an uncanny knack for doing this sort of thing and if they could strap a camera on my head they would make a lot of money on one of those TV shows. The moral of the story is, watch that first step, it can be a doozy!  On to other things. Things are going well at  urlLink work . Today I was informed that I will be changing my work shift to earlier in the day. Probably 7-3 or 8-4 which will be better than my current 10-6. I am also changing my job description to have some increased responsibilities and some benefits that go with that.  Well I am signing off for tonight............................

      I am sitting her holding my sick son, Josiah.  He has had a temp and a hacking cough fot the last two days. It is sad to see a ;ittle guy who is usually so full of energy and life not feeling well.  In an hour I am off to play some hoops at the OLGC gym where I work. This is becoing a new weekly ritual for me and some of my friends. Hopefully all the exercise I have been getting shoveling snow will give me some increased stamina. :)  Last night I finally had a chance to view, " urlLink U2  Go Home / Slane Castle". I had tried to borrow it from my brother-in-law but it was allways loaned out. Watching it made me think of the time at Moody  urlLink Rob  and I violated curfew to go to the Rosemaont Horizon for the Zoo Tv Tour.  A month a go I bought a cheap MP3 player off the internet. With it, I listen to some talks I downloaded off the internet. Here are a couple of good sites I found.   urlLink Dallas Willard    urlLink John Piper    urlLink Brian McLaren   I have also been doing a lot of thinking at work. It is a nice benefit to pushing a mop, your mind is frees up to be other places. Any way, I am looking for food for thought on "leadership" in missional community. If you have any suggestions please let me know.

      I am getting ready to go out on a date with Syndie. We have not had a date in a while and we are overdue. I am really looking forward to good food and uninterrupted coversation.  Not a lot going on here at the Best house today. Some household chores, reading, playing, scrapbooking just having a relaxed low key day. Which was actually two in a row because there was a snow/ice day on Friday and there was no scool for me and the kids.  I just had an opportinity to write a liitle piece for Next Wave about Mayhem this past January in Cincy. If you would like to see it click  urlLink here.   The time on Wednesday went really well for us and for the couple we visited. God used us to lift here spirits in a big way. It was great to see everbody chip in to play a part. I was unable to take pictures because I temporarily lost my digital camera, but it is found now.  I had a good power nap on Friday to catch up on my sleep. When I woke up I had some thoughts about New Life and some visuals to help clarify what we are felling called to be and where that might take us. If you are interested you can look at it here as well in the near future.

      Here I am am getting rady to go to bed early. I am shifting my work schedule starting tomorrow. I will be working 7 to 3 which I am really looking forward to. it will be nice to be off early. I am going to have to get into a good rhythym of making sure I get plenty of sleep. I will need to be out the door every day at 6:30 or so to make it to work in a care free manner. I find it easier to stay up late rather than get up early but I am going to see if I can tweek that a bit.  Tomorrow after work we (new life family) are going to take some food and encourgaement to a friend that had been in poor health for over three years. Her doctors have ruled out several things but do not really still know what is going on. Our group is making this a real team effort. Peple are pitching in to cook, sing, watch kids, and simple give of themselves on behalf of someone else. I will post some picture latter this week.  I started reading a real good book on my lunch today...........  The shape of things to come ... inovation and mission for the 21st century church     What I have read so far I highly recommend it to you.

       We are in the pooh mate!   That was a quip made by the character Porter Ricks in the movie Flipper.   Today at 2:00 EST that was an applicable phrase for me. I really enjoy my job most of the time but today was on the nasty side. We had a sewer pipe back blow up from the drain in a bathroom floor. When I fist came to check out a complaint of a bad smell I found hunks of poop every where! The smell was worse than my relatives pig farm. I quickly doned my protective gear and started scooping it up. I had done this in a figurative way at my last staff position but today I was doing it in all of it's full sensory glory. The best part of the story was when I went to go tell my boss he was going to have to call in Roto Rooter he was escorting a health inspector through the after school day care area. I was very glad my shift was done at three and I was able to leave the whole situation at work again something I was unable to do a my previous job.  well i need to go and get my kids back into bed for the umpteenth time. :)  I' leave you with a current view of the Detroit Skyline.........

      Beautiful day in Michigan!!  Today was a spring teaser. It was sunny and felt warm to what it has been. All the students at the school where I have my "creative plot" are wound up and ready for mid-winter break. Tomorrow is the last day and then they have a week off. The week with no students gives us time and space to do special projects.  I have just come home from work to hang with JJ while the girls are at Daisy's and Brownie's. It is fun to be here and just hang out. Syndie is feeling some better from last night and she is going to visit the doctor tomorow afternoon.  Tonight I am playing basketball at the OLGC gym at 9:30 and we are also going to a surprise 65th Birhtday party for our neighbor's dad. Speaking of neighbors, would anyone like to be our neighbor? The house across the street just went up for sale yesterday?  Today I was asked by the school principal to do a Lenten Reflection / devotional for the schoool and staff on March 4th or 5th. Everyday at 2:00 at lent there will be someone doing this. So I am looking forward to this.  I also read somthing very thought provoking in the book I am reading called  urlLink Stormfront.   We confess that victory, that hope. It is our gospel-the good news we have to offer the world. The church is built on it. But do we reckon with it? Does the risen and reigning Christ in fact define our reality? Do we cope with the forces in our life and the world around us in the strength of that reality?  What would it mean to us if Easter were to caputure our minds and hearts as thoroughly as Christmas does?   L'chaim (to life)

         I have been driving by this sign every day for months but I never have my camera with me, but today I happend to have it. I love the motto for  urlLink our city  because we feel that God has called us here and this is our place to be and we are really ejoying it!!  Sickness has been making the rounds here at the Best Family. First JJ had a horrible cough a couple weeks a go and then the girls picke it up from him. Monday Emily stayed homr from school becuse she woke up in the middle of the night throwing up. She felt better on Tuesday and tried to go to school but had to come home again after a couple of hours. Tonight I put Syndie to bed at 6:45 not feeling well.  Yesterday, Sam's kindergarten class went on a field trip to the  urlLink aquautic center  and she got into the deep end and had to be fished out she says. I guess it is herditary!

      Friday after Ash Wednesday....  Taken From My Lenten Devotional ( urlLink Renewed For Life )   Don't we look at the many events of our lives as interruptions? but what if our interruptions are in fact challenges to an inner response by which growth takes place? What if the events of our history are molding us as a sculptor molds his clay, and if it is only in a careful obedience to these molding hand that we can discover our real vocation and become mature Christians?  Lord, You come secretly into my life in so many ways. This lent, give me a new sense of vision to notice your ways I had overlooked before. renew me with a special sense of Your presence.     This from the newly redesigned  urlLink Northumbria Community Web Site   Taken from the sight....  If you want your dream to be, build it slow and surely. Small beginnings, greater ends. Heartfelt work grows purely. If you want to live life free, take your time, go slowly. Do few things, but do them well: simple joys are holy.  Day by day, stone by stone, build your secret slowly.  Day by day, you’ll grow too; you’ll know heaven’s glory!     If you have not read this, check it out.................  urlLink Kevin Rains re: Jesus at the Pub

      Ash Wednesday................  I have been doing a lot of thinking anout Lent this year. I have decided to on a daily basis give up my two cans of  urlLink Dr. Pepper  that I usually have with my sack lunch. I was surprised how much that "simple act" would get my attention. In one day I am finding I had a greater preoccupation with the beverage than I ever would admitted.  I am also going to read through and meditate on the Book of  urlLink Isaiah  during the season of Lent as something to engage in.  The little Lenten devotional I picked up at  urlLink OLGC  had this prayer in todays reading.   Lord, God, this Lent help me to do my best to keep my mind fixed on You and Your Kingdom.

If you would like to use it it is here   urlLink kids_at_lent.PDF   We also discusse what things we were going to abstain from and what things were were going to intentionally engage in.  I have decided to read some specific books during Lent this year.         We also picked up a new album. Good music, good cause!

      Today I received an interesting email from a new friend of mine by the name of Neil Tibbott. Neil is looking for some input/help with his D Min project on Missional Communities      Here are some links to there BETA Test Web Site   urlLink Who they are.....    urlLink Mission....    urlLink Philosophy   Here is a paste from Neil's email............  Hi Friends,     I’m starting a Yahoo discussion group to facilitate my Doctoral research at the Northwest Graduate School ( urlLink www.nwgs.edu ).  I thought of you as a possible participant with my research project.  I have selected potential participants based on breadth of ministry experience, theological diversity and possible interest in helping develop a tool for equipping teams and leaders to organize “doable community development” projects.     Here’s what’s involved with the StreetGospel Project.     I’m developing a process, kind of like a blue print, to empower ordinary groups, teams, leaders to organize simple, doable, ordinary community development projects.  Don’t think… Build a hospital, or transportation system for this project.  My aim is to empower street-level, neighborhood inspired projects.  The outcome, I hope will be a greater public expression of Faith, more opportunities to communicate the Gospel and the King’s Renown.  I’ll be sending out a weekly 3 to 4 paragraph email to this group with a short 3 to 5 question survey.  Your responses will help me to evaluate how well each step connects with practitioners like yourself.  The theoretical, philosophical, theological basis, however, will not be included in these emails.  They will become available as I write them for my dissertation online.  Email will only be originated by me.  Responses will only come back to me, but will be posted online for any member to access.  If you want to get email from the whole group as they respond you may configure settings with Yahoo Groups to do so.  Sharing your experiences will be invaluable, though I don’t expect every “step” will connect the same way with every member.  Shorter descriptions are better.  If more clarity is needed we can ask for more by email, and perhaps give you a call.     Your connections are highly valuable to me for this project…  I won’t intentionally abuse your willingness to participate with boatloads of email. And, Yahoo is notoriously tough on Spam.  Actually better than my ISP.  I am looking for more women to participate with this discussion.  If your spouse or a colleague would also find this interesting you may forward them this email with my regards for their input.  Another way to connect:  If you want to participate in a more free form Forum of who specifically church planters are doing to connect with their neighborhoods you may also join the my Church Resource Ministries web forum at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/missioteam.     Thank you for considering helping with the StreetGospel Project and helping proclaim the Gospel in “words and deeds.”     Here’s what to do next:     Go to - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/StreetGospelProject/  Click on – “Join this Group”  Enter your email  That’s it     I hope we can stay in touch, I miss you already…     Neil Tibbott  CRM - Seattle  Email - ntibbott@crmnet.org

      Things went very well last friday when I shared my Lenten reflection with the students and staff at the Our Lady of Good Counsel school where I work. Syndie and I were both praying that God would allow it to be a conversation starter. God answered the prayers big time! I think it was funny to see people reactions that a janitor had some ideas about what it means to be a Christ follower. Thank you if anyone reading this was praying too last week.  two new web sites I found   urlLink The Henri Nouwen Library   urlLink bread for the world      This is a picture of Silent Lake, Ontario where I have just planned a hiking/camping trip in May.

      My family and I just returned from an incredible weekend visit with the Bean Family in Indianapolis, Indianna. It was good to hang out with Bill, Molly, Erin, Emily, Boyd, and Dogger. We ate great food at the Snooty Fox, caught some March Maddness B-Ball on the big screen, reaired flooding water pipes in the basesment with racquet balls, stimulating coversation, and general allround mayhem. The kids did well on the trip there and back. Tomorrow they both get to go to a Dr. Seus celebration at school that is being kicked off with a genuine green eggs and ham breakfast. I am also really looking forwrd to two vacation days this week on Thursday and Friday when I go with my friend Doug to the state B-Ball playoffs for high school. Well that's it for now.

      Celebrations at Home...............  Today Sam lost her first tooth! She has been wiggling it for quite a while. But today when I cam home form work it was just hanging by a membrane and I plucked it out. Sam was very excited to have it come out. She is curious to fing out how the tooth fairy things works. Any how she is a cutie!!     We are also celebrating JJ first tear free haircut yesterday!! He sat in the chair and let them eaven use the clippers!!! This was a major victory for him. As a special reward we bought him a new hockey puck.       I also wanted to mention that U of M won the NIT championship last night.     AP News Story  urlLink Here............   It was really good for me to have a couple of vacation days off last week. I had a lot of fun watching tons of High Scholl basket ball at MSU. The best game by far was on Friday night between Wyoming Park and Detroit Renasance. Big thanks to my friend Doug for inviting me to go and arranging for the tickets.  Work has been going well as of late. Still waiting for spring to arrive in Michigan. I heard a rumor that there is snow forcasted for Saturday. I have been experimenting with the use of the Jesus Prayer while I work. I took the suggestion from an MP3 that I listened too from Brian McLaren on praticing the presence. Throughout my day while I am going about my cleaning duties I simply pray this prayer.  Jesus Christ, son of the living God. Have mercy on me, a sinner.  L' Chaim

      Hey All ~ It's Syndie here this time. {BE FOREWARNED.. I just finished typing this and it's really long... sorry! Didn't mean to be so chatty! )  I figure if Doug can be a "ghost writer" on Jim's Blog then I can too. Actually, Jim has been asking me for a couple of days if I wanted to blog about the events of this week. I've been kinda blowing him off... there's been a million details I've had to attend to. But tonight I don't have that excuse. I'm sitting here in Doug and Heather's house... they have gone to Kalamazoo to celebrate Easter with Doug's family. They invited us a bunch of times to go with them.. and Doug's mom invited us too... but we really needed some time alone. So, Doug and Heather graciously gave us a key to their place and told us to make ourselves at home. We had dinner, I made coffee (BTW, Doug, sorry about the regular water in the coffee pot.. I was desperate for some joe! Forgive me!!) Jim just went out to the store to buy some milk and coffee cream and some "good" water so we can make more coffee!    Yeah, I know I'm rambling. It's easier to write about coffee than this past week. Bear with me... these thougts will be random and may not make a lote of sense at times.  How can I possibly put into words all the feelings, thoguhts, emotions that I have experienced over the last 5 days? I would have to blog for the NEXT 5 days to explain it all. Suffice it to say that I have felt a depth of emotions that I have never thought possible... the deepest terror I have ever known... as I screamed my son's name through the smoke-filled room.. hearing the roar of flames in my ears and the endless amount of time that passed until I found him crouched in a ball behind the door, the anger I felt as it took the Fire Depart ment what seemed like hours to get to our home, the helplessness of watching the smoke billow out the front door and windows of our beautiful house knowing that there was nothing...absolutely nothing I could do... the horror of watching my husband run back into the smoke-filled house in an act of desperation and the girls and I franctically crying and screaming on the front lawn for him to PLEASE come back out of the house... coming out  a moment later he said, "But all of our stuff is in there!". And as I screamed at him as loud as I could..."I don't care... let it burn...there's nothing in there as important as you! PLEASE don't go back in! PROMISE ME YOU WON"T GO BACK IN!!!!' I honestly meant it. I love my house. I have blogged before about how much I love our house but in that moment I really didn't care if the whole thing burnt into a pile of ashes... so long as my family was safe.    We ran out the door with nothing but the clothes on our backs... the kids and I didn't even have shoes on. As we ran across the street to our neighbors/friends house (Pete & April Laitinen - bless you guys!) it all seemed like a dream. We watched the two huge fire trucks roll up and begin their work...I couldn't watch anymore. Jim ran over and told me to call the insurance company. So I did. And then I called Doug and Heather. I knew I needed them and I knew they would come. Heather wanted to, but the boys were already in bed (although she did tell me that she contemplated pulling them out of bed and coming over with Doug!) As soon as Doug understood what I was saying... (I was crying so hard it was difficult for him to understand me) he said, "I'm on my way." He was there within minutes. My kids all but tackled him as he came in the door. He held them each so gently... he was SO good to our family. He stayed for hours. You all know some of what he has done since then... keeping you all updated with blog entries and pictures... thank you, Doug, my friend.   People calling. Dozens and dozens of people calling... how can we help, what can we do... the girls school sent a letter home and people starting bringing in clothes for the kids... tons of them!!! My girlfriends showing up with clothes adn "personal" items for Jim and I... April taking my girls shopping to buy them socks and underwear and shoes...seeings as we ran across the road in our socks! People handing me and Jim cash on more than one occasion, Jim's Thursday night basketball buddies taking him to the mall to buy him a new pair of b-ball shoes... his burned in the fire.  Another friend from school brought over 3 personalized Easter Baskets for the kids... figuring that we'd be a little pre-occupied this week and not be able to put Easter Baskets together.... The thoughtfulness and generosity of people has been staggering. Overwhelming really. A friend who just buried her Mom less than 2 weeks ago coming to the door of the house we were staying in with hugs, a financial gift and offers of help in any way... what kind of people are these?? And of course Pete and April,  who were in the middle of trying to watch a movie when their lives were interrupted and put on hold as the whole Best family then took up residence in their house (like 7 Laitinen's in the place wasn't enough!!! Why not add 5 Best's too!) April just went into action. She got the spare bed ready, pulled out sleeping bags and pillows and got things ready for the kids... the next day she started washing our smoke-smelly clothes, she became our personal secretary as her phone began ringing off the hook, she accepted donations of food for us and found room in her fridge and freezer for it all, she patiently babysat JJ as we had so much running around to do...  Heather has helped me sort through a virtual mountain of donated clothing... what an overwhelming task. Inviting us to dinner, taking JJ to the marshmallow drop even thoguh I couldn't go as planned... Mike and Becky who offered us the keys to their home for this week as they are gogin to be out of town, treating us to dinner, checking in on us daily... my parents who drove over from Canada to take my girls home for a few days. My sister Suzie and her family who have helped take care of Sami and Emily while they are there, my brother Brian and his family who are helping with that task as well, my brother Ben and his wife whom I had to literally had to talk out of coming here the night of the fire. They so wanted to help.. but there really was nothing to do. Jim's bosses as OLGC who gave him the whole week off and then gave him 2 bags of new clothes and an envelope of money to boot!  Pat Hovey coming to sort through the wet scrapbooking supplies in my basement to see what could be salvaged... So many others... so much generosity. Indescribable graditude. Thank you to all.  So where am I now? Depends on the moment.   ~ Feeling tremendous guilt for telling JJ to "get back in your bed" as he knocked on the door after I had tucked him in twice already. The smoke alarm went off about 2 minutes later...  ~ feeling SO grateful that I had put the flame resistant jammies on him that night so that the 11 spots that were burned on hs PJ shirt smotherd out rather than igniting him into flames  ~ so thankful that Jim had changed the batteries in the smoke detectors  ~ Feeling so bad that my children't lives will never be the same again. Will JJ always "freak out" when he sees a smoke detector like he did at the hotel last night?  ~ trying to anticipate what the future will hold.... and trying not to think about it at the same time. Too overwhelming righ now.  ~ incredible graditude that we all made it out safely  ~ struggling with a significant amount of guilt that I am as upset as I am about the "stuff" that was destroyed in the fire. It's only "stuff", right?  ~ absolutely ACHING to sit down at my piano and play...   Okay... time for me to quit. Jim just said, "Are you STILL typing???" I just scrolled back through this. Sorry. Didn;t mean to go on so... I guess I just uncorked!  My deepest graditude to my Savior (with another new dimension to His "saving" ability...) and to all of you who are helping us get through this. Do not miss this fact: GOD IS AT WORK IN THIS SITUATION!!! From the minute we set foot in our home at 1832 Treadwell St. we have prayed that He would use our family and our house to advance His Kingdom in our neighborhood and the school and our relational network. We asked and prayed and looked for ways to connect with people and prayed that God would do whatever He wanted to bring this about. We threw parties, joined the PTA and MOMS clubs  and have watched and waited for Him to bring opportunities. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that He would choose to have our house burn in order to advance His Kingdom in this area, but that's exactly what He chose to do. And so we say, The Lord gives, the Lord takes away BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD! Let Your Kingdom come, Jesus!!

      Tired but Good........  Jim, here. :)  We are very tired but doing good. We have been overwhelmed with love, prayer, and generosity the last two days. We want to thank everyone who has thought of us the last couple of days.  I also want to thank my friend Doug for being my blog "ghost writer" the past few days and who will probably continue to do so because I am computerless for a while.  The biggest prayer request at this point is that we would be able to find adequate alternative housing for our family asap. The initial estimates are that we will be out of our house for 2 to 4 months.  Please be patient with us we have been touched by many and want to eventually respond personally to each of you.  I am also linked the web sites of a couple of the fire restoration companies we are working with for those fellow curiosity seekers or (kings of useless information)   urlLink Belfor   urlLink Huntington Cleaners   Thanks againg from Jim, Syndie, Emily, Sam, and JJ  We are planning to do a documetary of the reconsruction via our foto blog

      Again, this is Doug writing.  I have uploaded some pictures from the house fire on  urlLink Jim's photo blog .    The adjuster is at Jim and Syndie's house right now going through the damage, and hopefully you will be able to tell by some of the images the extent of the fire.  Syndie's parents have arrived from nearby Chatham (Canada), and there have been many friends dropping in to see them.  I know Jim and Syndie would like to thank Pete and April Latenen for housing them last night along with the kids, Bill Bean down in Indy, Mike and Becky A'Hearn, Scott and Jen Peterson, John and Diane Lauch, the guys from Thursday night basketball, Chris and Laura Garvey and a ton of others that I don't know about yet but I am sure Jim will get some "Muchas Gracias" up for them soon.  Keep up the prayers for them  as I know they are working .  I also wanted to note that we could help them out with the deductible on the insurance policy ($1,000).  Bill Bean has a Paypal account setup for this purpose at  urlLink www.paypal.com .  All you have to do is send money to this email address: bestfamilyfund@yahoo.com and it will go directly to Jim and Syndie's account.  A couple other ideas around are:   They are getting clothes donated to them for the kids, but Jim and Syndie don't have any clothes.  Some gift cards to say Kohls would help immensely.  Gift cards to Meijers or Wal-Mart for other incidentals they'll need in the next few weeks would really help too.     They obviously won't be using their home phone and cell minutes are going to rack up quickly so maybe some pre-paid phone cards or perhaps buying add'l cell minutes (bump them up to a plan with more minutes for one month and pay the diff. for them).   Thanks guys and I will keep you all posted!  Doug

      This is  urlLink Doug Hovey  writing, a friend of Jim and Syndie Best.  Jim asked me to update his blog with an update on the events of last night.  On the second floor of the house, a fire broke out in JJ's bedroom.  Although JJ was in his room and the girls were next door in their room, the kids managed to escape the house without  any injury .  Jim, however, was running up the stairs and the bannister came off of the wall as he grabbed it and he fell and put a little cut above his left eye, but he and Syndie are also safe and with the kids.  Jim tried to put out the flames in JJ's room himself, but was not able to as the fire was beyond the power of a handheld extinguisher.  The fire department had been called and Jim wisely closed JJ's door on his way out.  The fire captain later said that probably saved the rest of the house from being completely destroyed.  When I arrived at the scene, Syndie was visibly shaken (as any mother would be), but truly aware of God's protection of her family.  We were able to go into the house around 11:00 last night, and the damage is severe on the second floor from the fire and smoke.  From my own experience in a house fire, I can tell that they will have to discard all of their clothing, bedding, etc. from the second floor.  They have insurance and the adjuster is scheduled to come out today to assess the damage.    I just talked to Jim a couple minutes ago and he told me the kids' school is collecting clothing for kids in the interim and they insist on helping because "this is a community and that is what we do!"  Right now, Jim and Syndie are trying to figure out what the next step is and waiting to see what the insurance company says.  Keep coming back here in the meanwhile and I will let you know what is going on and what they may need some help with.  If you would like to get them a message of encouragement, send it to Jim's email at  urlLink jimlbest@comcast.net .  Thank you to everyone who has prayed for them and offered the help.  This is truly what they envision the Kingdom life being.

      The Family Reunited Again....  I'm typing this from my new internet cafe aka doug and heathers condo. We just went out to dinner with my in-laws who brought back Emily and Sam from Canada. This is the first we have all been together since last Tuesday afternoon. Syndie and I are very glad to have them back. Gram and Papa and the rest of the family in Canada did a great job with the girls. Thanks so much from the bottom of our heart.  We are starting to get settled into our temp apartment. I had a lot of hard work today ripping out a tile floor.  More when we can.  L'Chaim

      Christ the Lord is risen today!! Allelujah  Today I was reflecting on the reality of the Kingdom Life that I am able to experience now because of Christ's ability to conquer death and the grave. I read some familiar passages that ring true in a new and deeper way since our house fire this past week.  Proverbs 11:25  The generous prosper and are satisfied; those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed.  Ecclesiastes 4:9-12  Two people can accomplish more than twice as much as one; they get a better return for their labor. 10If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But people who are alone when they fall are in real trouble. 11And on a cold night, two under the same blanket can gain warmth from each other. But how can one be warm alone? 12A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.  My friend Mike shared this wisdom:   Please enjoy the pleasure of your time with your family and friends; and, above all give thanks to Jesus for allowing us all to share this wonderous gift called life that we all enjoy.  Please give each other a hug and remember to say "I LOVE YOU'. We can't express our feelings to our loved ones enough!   L' Chaim

      Hi All... Syndie here again.  Sorry it's been so long since we updated. Things continue to busy. I'll try and give you all the updates that so many of you have been asking about.  First of all I must say a HUGE thank you to all of you. So many of you have sent cards, letters, emails, & calls expressing your love and prayers for us. We are deeply grateful to you for all your expressions of love and we continue to ask for your prayers. We have indeed felt your prayers on our behalf.  We are fairly settled in our apartment. It is a nice place and we are thankful to have it. It's not without it's drawbacks (not really thrilled about going back to "apartment living" after having been in our own home...) but it's a heck of a lot better than being in the Holiday Inn for months on end!! It's a 2 bedroom which means we have all the kids in one room again. This has been a bit of a challenge... especially with JJ's sleeping troubles. It's closer to Jim's work but further (MUCH further) from the girls school. It's about a 20 minute drive one way to the school. I have to take Emily at 8:00am, drive home, take Sami at 11:40am, drive home, go and pick up the girls at 2:50. This is taking some getting used to since we were walking to school from our home... it was 3 blocks down the street.   This past Monday... after being in our new apartment for all of one week,  things were starting to calm down a bit so I guess my kids felt we needed some more excitement in our lives. They were playing and, long story short, Sami ended up getting poked in the eye with a stick. Like really poked. It started bleeding all down her cheek and she was screaming "I can't see!!! I can't see!!!". So, I packed her up and headed off to the ER for just shy of 3 hours. After some pretty extensive proceedures, they removed a small piece of wood/sliver from her eye and treated the 3 cuts in her cornea. They gave her a prescription for drops that she has had to have 4 times a day for the past week. It was pretty scary. Have you every seen an eyeball bleed?? It ain't pretty!   Thursday afternoon JJ (and I) had to go to the Fire Station for another "interview". It didn't go so well. He ended up crying, I ended up crying, he still wouldn't talk about it. It's been strange... during all of our driving back and forth to school this week there have been a few times  when JJ and I have been alone in the van and out of the blue he'll say something like, "The fire was hot". But as soon as I ask him anything else about it he clams up and won't even look up. It's so sad. It's like he wants to talk about it but he can't. The Fire fighter that we talked to suggested that he see a Therapist, which a couple of friends had suggested earlier as well. So we made some calls and set up an appointment. He went for his first session yesterday afternoon. Typically, he didn't say much about it when asked and he got very upset when I was talking about it to the Doctor (I was crying and this upsets him a lot).  He (JJ) is still having trouble going to sleep at night. Every night is a struggle and he wakes up several times even after he does go to sleep. I feel like I have a newborn again. He continues to act out in strange ways too. Like, just now he walked in the room and threw a box of kleenex at my head.. lots of anger. One of the things that the Therapist said was that I should try and have him do things that he used to do before the fire. This morning I was about to put on some laundry so I asked JJ to come help me. This used to be one of his favorite things to do... he would stand on a stool and put in the soap and fabric softener and help put the clothes in. So he came in and got up on the stool and started to put the soap in and then he totally freaked out and started saying, "Stop the smoke Mama, stop the smoke!!" He dropped the soap thing and coverd his face with his hands and started crying and then he ran down the hall and into the bedroom (where Jim was on the computer). He threw himself on the bed and buried his face in the pillows, crying. Jim looked at me and asked, "What the heck happened?" I told him I was doing a load of whites so I put the washer on HOT and he saw the steam and fell apart thinking it was smoke. Jim tried to comfort him. I went back to the washer and a few minutes later Jim came in carrying JJ. JJ had his face covered with his hands again. Jim tried to tell him that it wasn't smoke, it was steam. He wasn't at all interested, he just wanted away from it. It absolutely broke my heart. I stood there crying, putting clothes into the washer trying to tell myself, "It won't always be like this".   As far as the house, we are meeting with the Insurance Adjuster at 3:00pm on Monday to go over the non-salvageable list, which should be quite an undertaking. Once he approves that then he will meet with the contrator who will give him the estimate on the house repairs. After the bid is approved they will get the building permit and start to work. Jim talked to the contractor about a possible time frame for it to be completed and the guy said that he figured that it will take about 12 weeks from when they start working. At this point (if they start working by the end of next week) that would put it completed by about the end of July/beginning of August. My only hope in this is that they don't run into any "snags" that will delay things too much because my kids go back to school the last week of August. We really would like a couple weeks to get re-settled in our home before that has to happen.   Again, we thank you all so much for your love and prayers. We will continue to keep you updated here when we can.   Syndie

      Just felt led to sit and listen to this song of the  Passion Sacred Revolution CD . I sat and wept as I listened to these lyrics by Matt Redman. As I cried I had a mental image of a cool rain softening a clod of dirt.   Blessed Be Your Name In the land that is plentiful  Where your streams of abundance flow Blessed be your name  Blessed Be Your name When I'm found in the desert place Though I walk through the wilderness Blessed Be Your name  Every blessing you pour out  I'll turn back to praise When the darkness closes in  Still I will say  Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your glorious name  Blessed be Your name When the sun's shining down on me When the world's 'all as it should be' Blessed be Your name  Blessed be Your name On the road marked with suffering  Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name  Every blessing you pour out  I'll turn back to praise When the darkness closes in  Still I will say  Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your glorious name  Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your glorious name  You give and take away You give and take away My heart will choose to say Lord Blessed be your name     Album Info  urlLink here .........

      It has been a while since I have posted anything. I have not been very motivated and have not had a lot of time.  Many people keep asking me how I am doing? If I am open and honest I have to say things like hollow, tired, stuck, powerless.  This past week has not gone very smoothly for me. Tuesday I was hit by a basket ball on the school playgroud and it smashed my glasses. Wedneday I was pushing a rolling table and it hit a door jam and bounced up and gave me a fat lip anf today I killed a refrigerator in the parish office.  I am also frustrated that I am am unable to enage in previous forms of recreation for personal renewal. I sit to watch a movie but I can't connect with the story, I sit and try to read but I am just turning pages and nothing is really sinking in.  The thing that weighs most heavely on me is the inability to help JJ and Syndie when they are having a particuarly difficult time. I know I help by being close by and a shoulder to cry on but as the Dad and Husband I want to depertely be able to calm and reassure them.  Thanks for your ongoing prayers.

      It's Syndie again.  Several people have asked me why I haven't been writing on my own Blog... hard to explain. If you look, the last day I blogged on mine was the day of the fire. For some reason I can't get past that. No, I didn't say it made any sense, I was just offering an answer to those of you who have asked.   This has been a really hard day. I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise since last night was such a hard night. The kids didn't do so well. Emily was fine...slept through the night just fine. Sami was up about 6 times between midnight at 6:00am and JJ was a mess. He told me this morning that he had a dream about the fire last night...like I couldn't have guessed. At almost 1:00am I found him sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor crying. I think he was still asleep. I picked him up and tried to head back to his bedroom and he started yelling, "No, no don't go there". I asked him if he wanted to sleep in my bed. He wasn't making any sense. I took him in bed with me where he stopped crying for a few minutes and then started writhing and screaming, "No!! Get me out.. get me out... get down get down.!!" God only knows the horrors my sweet boy was reliving. This went on (off and on) for several hours before he fell back to sleep. Intermitently in there I had to take Sami back to bed and stay with her while she went to sleep.  This morning after I dropped Emily off at school I drove to our house to meet with the Project Manager. He had asked me to come so I could sign off on the paperwork giving them permission to gut the house and throw out any of the remaining contents. As I came up the block I saw the huge 35 foot dumpster in our driveway. It literally took my breath away. The tears came without warning. I'm not sure why this reaction... I'm not sure of many of my emotions these days.  It feels like just yesterday that we signed the paperwork to buy this house...our first home. There was somthing so wrong about signing a paper that was titled...DEMOLITION CONSENT. A profound sadness has taken hold of me and I can't shake it.

      Another day... I am choosing to put one foot in front of the other today again. It seems to get me to the end of the day somehow.  I guess it's Sami's turn to come unglued. Last night we had some pretty good thunder storms roll through here which freaked her out pretty badly. Both she and JJ ended up in our bed (very crowded!) This morning she was just not herself...very whiney and clingy..she spent most of the morning in tears for one reason or another. I took her to school, dropped her off at her class and started walking back to our van. About half way across the lawn of the school I heard Sami screaming, "Mommy!!!!" I turned around to see her come running out of the school just sobbing her heart out. She jumped into my arms and kept saying, "Please don't leave me, Mommy. Please don't leave me.." I'm not sure how much more of the heart-wrenching I can take. Her eyes were full of fear...panic, almost. I tried to calm her and reassure her that everything is okay and that I would be back to pick her up at the end of the day. When I walked her back to class I noticed that her regular teacher wasn't there...she had a substitute. I'm not sure if that just tipped the scale of "displacement and change" in her little life or what. Oh who am I kidding? I have no idea what it was all about. All I know is that I hate how helpless I feel in those situations.  I'm trying not to be offended but I'm really starting to get a complex... this is the third bag of clothing donations for me that have been really, really big...todays were all 3X and 4x clothes. I have been really struggling with my emotional eating this past month but I didn't think I had put that much weight back on. Maybe I'm in denial. Today I sat and cried as I looked through all these clothes... I guess it's because they were from one of the other Kidergarten moms. When she gave them to me she said that she had a friend who was "about your size" (meaning me) who had gone through her clothes and packed up this huge bag of them for me. Wow. Is that really how I look to everyone?? yikes.  My emotions are still all over the map...somedays I get so tired of crying I could just cry. yeah...that's about how much sense it makes too. For whatever reason I can't seem to make a decision to save my life! I went to buy a hanging flower basket at Walmart and came home without one becasue I just about made myself half crazy trying to decide..."Should I get pansies or begonias? Purple? Yellow? Pink? A 6" pot or an 8" pot? What if it needs full sun and we don't get full sun at the apartment? What if it needs shade and the hook makes it hang in the sun?  What if I forget to water it? Maybe I could put it on the ground so it could get the rain water.. what if the kids get into it on the ground and wreck it? What if...what if.... what if?????? " Oh forget it! Welcome to the world inside my head. What a scary place , huh?  I've never been a good decision maker but now it's especially bad... I guess I just keep second guessing myself after making a pretty bad decision on the night of April 5th....

      The fire was one month ago today (tonight at 9:00, actually). In someways it seems like yesterday. In other ways it seems like a lifetime ago. Sometimes I still think I'm going to wake up and tell Jim that I had this horrible dream about us having a fire... Thanks to all of you for your on-going prayers... JJ has been sleeping much better...thank you Jesus! I'm still struggling in that area. JJ is still having some behaviorial issues and still has a fair amount of sad times... he'll sit and be on  the verge of tears and when asked what's wrong he just says, "I don't know".    We are getting into a routine of sorts... I'm driving for a little over 2 hours a day (back and forth to school) which, frankly, STINKS! That was one of the big drawing cards for us buying our house... it's right down the street from the school and we were walking there. This takes a big chunk of my day but there really aren't a lot of  options.   The house is pretty much gutted. I went through it this morning.. there are no walls left upstairs... the bathroom is empty (toilet and sinks are sitting in the garage... those are about 6 weeks old...)   Much more I wold like to write, however, JJ is having one of those "behaviorial issuses" at the moment so I must go. I'll write more when I can.

      Another day. Thankful for a fairly good night's sleep last night. JJ and Sami both ended up in my bed but at least we didn't have any nightmares like a couple days ago. God is good.  We continue to try and process everything...   Jim and I walked through the house last week before they started the demolition. Jim summed it up perfectly. He said it felt like we were at an open casket funeral. At a funeral you look at this body lying in a casket and say, "Yes... technically that is 'Grandma' (or whoever)". That is their body. But really, it's not them. There is no life. All the things that made them who they were are not there anymore. That's how it felt at the house. Yes, technically we were walking through "our house" but all the things that made it our home were not there anymore. There was no life in it. It was so empty, a shell with nothing in it... it all felt so hollow. It's hard to feel that way about a place I loved so much. A place where every single time I walked in the door I felt this wonderful feeling of comfort and "right-ness". Ahhh, I'm home.   Doesn't feel like that now. Will it ever feel that way again? I don't know. I sure hope so.

      Well, You can see that i did some modification of our blog site. Blogger has made some recent changes to their structure and format and i thought I would take atvantage of it.  It has been a while since I have posted. Lot's happening and I am really trying to spend as much time as I can with Syndie and the kids.  Work has being going pretty well but it has been very humid and sticky the last couple of days.  I have been reading the book of James from the NT Message the last couple of days. Lots to chew on and think over in light of the last couple of months. Below is the passage I find most gripping.   Consider it a sheer gift, friends, when tests and challenges come at you from all sides. 3You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colors. 4So don't try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way. 5If you don't know what you're doing, pray to the Father. He loves to help. You'll get his help, and won't be condescended to when you ask for it. 6Ask boldly, believingly, without a second thought. People who "worry their prayers" are like wind-whipped waves. 7Don't think you're going to get anything from the Master that way, 8adrift at sea, keeping all your options open. 9When down-and-outers get a break, cheer! 10And when the arrogant rich are brought down to size, cheer! Prosperity is as short-lived as a wildflower, so don't ever count on it. 11You know that as soon as the sun rises, pouring down its scorching heat, the flower withers. Its petals wilt and, before you know it, that beautiful face is a barren stem. Well, that's a picture of the "prosperous life." At the very moment everyone is looking on in admiration, it fades away to nothing. 12Anyone who meets a testing challenge head-on and manages to stick it out is mighty fortunate. For such persons loyally in love with God, the reward is life and more life. 13Don't let anyone under pressure to give in to evil say, "God is trying to trip me up." God is impervious to evil, and puts evil in no one's way. 14The temptation to give in to evil comes from us and only us. We have no one to blame but the leering, seducing flare-up of our own lust. 15Lust gets pregnant, and has a baby: sin! Sin grows up to adulthood, and becomes a real killer. 16So, my very dear friends, don't get thrown off course. 17Every desirable and beneficial gift comes out of heaven. The gifts are rivers of light cascading down from the Father of Light. There is nothing deceitful in God, nothing two-faced, nothing fickle. 18He brought us to life using the true Word, showing us off as the crown of all his creatures.   Act on What You Hear 19Post this at all the intersections, dear friends: Lead with your ears, follow up with your tongue, and let anger straggle along in the rear. 20God's righteousness doesn't grow from human anger. 21So throw all spoiled virtue and cancerous evil in the garbage. In simple humility, let our gardener, God, landscape you with the Word, making a salvation-garden of your life. 22Don't fool yourself into thinking that you are a listener when you are anything but, letting the Word go in one ear and out the other. Act on what you hear! 23Those who hear and don't act are like those who glance in the mirror, 24walk away, and two minutes later have no idea who they are, what they look like. 25But whoever catches a glimpse of the revealed counsel of God--the free life!-even out of the corner of his eye, and sticks with it, is no distracted scatterbrain but a man or woman of action. That person will find delight and affirmation in the action. 26Anyone who sets himself up as "religious" by talking a good game is self-deceived. This kind of religion is hot air and only hot air. 27Real religion, the kind that passes muster before God the Father, is this: Reach out to the homeless and loveless in their plight, and guard against corruption from the godless world.

      It's hard to believe it's almost the middle of May already. The kids are really ready to be outdoors.   Thanks for all of your on-going prayers. Nights have been MUCH better! Praise God! We all continue to try and process where we find ourselves and how we're feeling.  I'm really struggling with feeling sorry for myself. I keep thinking, "Our big beautiful backyard... the patio in our backyard is bigger than the livingroom and dining area in this apartment combined!... the kids have a swingset in our yard, and a sandbox, and a pool and a mini-trampoline, and a bunch of outdoor toys and games... And our big beautiful maple tree gives wonderful shade on the hot days... We have a fabulous patio set that we love to use for parties and community stuff....I miss it all so much." But then I think of other people who don't have all this nice stuff and may never have any stuff like this... I should be glad that I have what we do have here. And I keep trying to remind myself that it will all be there next summer when we're back in the house. It's hard though. I want to "be content in whatever state I find myself in" )even if it is Michigan..) {okay, that was a joke...}) I was referring to what Paul wrote in the NT somewhere. I really do want to find my contentment in Christ. So why do I feel so displaced? Why do I feel so restless... like I want to go home? Why can't I just have a happy attitude about things here? After all, we all made it out of the house unharmed , right? Yeah, I know. I should be thankful. And I am. Really. I guess I'm just way more materialistic than I thought I was....

       Happy 11th Anniversary    Today Syndie and I celebrated 11 wonderful years of life together. We just came back from a lovely dinner at the new P.F. Changs near us. A lot has happened in the last 11 years. The cover of the card I gave Syndie sums it up well for me.... "grow old with me! the best is yet to be! Robert Browning.  We also discovered something new after 11 years. We both like Van Halen.   I am not sure why it took 11 years to uncover that fact but I'm glad we finally found out. We had a good ride home listening to "why can't this be love?" espicially the lyric line..."fools rush in... only time will tell. (if you know how long we dated it really fits! :)  Big thanks to mom and dad for keeping the kids.

      Today was another balmy moist day here in S.E. Michigan. I swear it is more humid in the school that I work in than outdoors. With all of the rain I have been doing a lot of grass cutting duty. I have also been expanding my handyman repair skills as well. Three days a go I changed a fouled spark plug on a lawn mower and today I tore apart a weed eater to replace the reel head. I no for some people it is no big deal but these we firsts for me.  Stayed up after we put the kids in bed talking with Syndie. I really appreciate the fact that she is a good listner. We both talked a lot about how we feel stuck,trapped since the fire. We have things we want to do/be/etc but for some reason right now can't so that makes us feel at times we a stuck on a psychotic merry-go-round. We know we need to move on in a sense but it seems hard on some days to get traction.  Thursday I am looking forward to going with Emily on an all day field trip to the Cosi Science Center in Toledo. It will be a nice diversion from work and Emily is really excited that I get to be her group leader.  Lots of excitement this weekend as well. My mom and dad are coming up for a visit this weekend. Have not had a chance to see them since last Thanksgiving. Syndie's parents want to drop in because they have not seen my folks since my brothers wedding a few years a go. I am performing a wedding ceremony, Syndie is going to a wedding of a friend, and we celebrate our 11th anniversary on Saturday.  L' Chaim

       Holiday Weekend Is officially Here....   I am clocked out and ready to do some serious relaxing this Memorial Day holiday. The kids should be home in a couple of minutes from school so I thought I would make a quick post.  We are going to see ShrekII with a group of friends tonight. Five adults...five kids. Then we will hurray home to hopefully watch the Piston's take a 2 to 1 lead over the Pacers in the Eastern conference finals.  After that there is not too much planned out and that is intentiol.  Have a fun and safe holiday weekend.  L'Chaim

      Home from work a bit early today. I have just spent a couple hours running some errands with JJ. Syndie wanted to be a part of a Mom's Club outing to a pottery shop so I took off work early so that she could have some fun with the other moms. JJ I went to Barchester park for a lunch picnic. The we went to the Secretary of State and got a license plate for our Wahoo scooter and the we went to Boric's for us each to get a hair cut. Tonight we are going to the Schweitzer school BBQ. The weather is beautiful today after a couple of weeks of rainy weather.  L'Chaim

      Moetown meets Tinsletown....  Tonight game #3  can't wait!!  Yesterday Sami graduated from Kindergarten at Schweitzer Elementary. It seems hard to believe that next school year we will have a pre-schooler 1/2 day (jj) 1st grader (sami) and fourth grader (emily).  Today after work I did a little demolition in our house tearing out the sofet in our kitchen. It was a great way to blow off steam swinging a sledge hammer and or axe. Making way for our kitchen cubbords.  Tomorrow when Emily is done with her last day we are off to spend the weekend with the Marshall's and the Ordinary Community Family in Metro-Cincy. We have really been looking forward to being with them for some time.  Time to go and pick up pizza.  L'Chaim

       acting like a jack _ _ _    Do men have PMS days? Today I have not been the husband and dad that I should. It is amazing how much damage can be done in brief moment that will take days to repair. I do not want to make excuses but something in me snapped unleashing anger and letting down those who are most precious to me. I think fear,frustration,diappointment all contributed to my combustion. I know that I need to be better at expressing my emotions but this type of display gets a failing grade. I am glad that my family loves me because of who I am not what I do or say.

      Simple Pleasures  Today Syndie and I were able to sleep in till 8:00 before the kids were up and around. This is a pretty rare occurance since two of our three are early risers.  This morning we are going to celebrate our own Father's Day festivities with the kids at our place. Later today we are driving down to Monroe to celebrate and feast to Paxton Hovey as we have a baby dedication with family and friends of the Hoveys. After that we are going to drive to Ontario to spend the night at my brother and sister-in-law (steve and suzie). Sunday we are having a big party with all of Syndie's family to celebrate Fathers Day, Mom and Dad Kivell's anniversary, June birthdays, etc, etc.  Monday and Tuesday I go back to work and then we are goning to head out first thing on Wednesday to Illinois to visit my mom and dad in Charleston. We will also have a chance to see my brother Nate and his family before they move to New York City. I will also be bringing back my new to me pick-up truck that I am purchasing from my brother.  We also had a great little family vacation in Frankemuth, MI this past Thursday and Friday. It was perfect weather and we enjoyed being able to stroll up and down mainstreet enjoying the sights and sounds.The kids really like the paddle boat ride we took for an hour on the Cass River.

      Great Time in Metro-Cincy  We had a real good time this past weekend with our friends the  urlLink Marshall's  and the Ordinary Community Church. It was something that we had been looking forward too and anticipating for several weeks. It was great just to hang out, BBQ, play, watch TV & movies, and celebrate. The best part for the kids was their trip to the Build-A-Bear Store thanks to the  urlLink Ordinary Community . They each were able to build a new friend/pet. Here is a picture of their finished creations.     Syndie and I were also treated to some gift certificates to Old Navy.  Thank you so much Ordinary Community!!  It was also very cool to be a part of Ordinary Communities 3yr birthday party/baptism/baby dedication. They have a great gathering space at a friends house. We were also able to meet some people who were a part of the  urlLink Baptist General Conference  and they we interested in continued dialouge in the future.  Work has been going well for me. School is out so it is a lot gentler pace for the summer. I have been doing a lot of painting the last couple of days and will probably continue with this project for a while.  I have been reading a good book the last couple of weeks called,  urlLink Running on Empty, Contemplative Spirituality for For Over Achievers, by Fil Anderson . He states that people are busy/overloaded and it has it's effects on us. It is usually seen in this pattern:oversheduled at work, undersheduled at home, and unscheduled when it comes to nourishing ones soul.(p29) It has given a lot to think about as what is really needed in this time to be a follower of Christ. In simply speak a quantum re-working of formation/discipleship. More thoughts as we unfold.  L'Chaim

      Well Hello Blogging world! This is Syndie writing again. Been a long time since I chatted here. Things have been going fairly well. The girls finished up school a month ago and we've been on the go ever since. It's good though, it makes the time go by quickly which is a good thing. I need time to go by fast.   I am trying to keep a positive outlook on things... somedays are better than others. Things are progressing on the house slowly but surley. Hopefully we should be in the first part of August. I am praying so. I miss my house so much.  I have heard it said many times and have now found it to be true that "home is where your heart is". We have been at home here in the apartment becasue we have been together. But I still really miss my house and I am very much looking forward to getting back there and making it "home" again. Although, I must confess... I am NOT looking forward to moving back in. After 8 moves in 10 years of marriage I knew I had found "home" when we moved into the house last year. And as I unpacked boxes ( exactly a year  before the fire...) I smiled inside thinking..."I will never again pack or unpack boxes to move. After I am dead and gone my children will sift through all this stuff and question why on earth I had most of it. But it will be them packing and unpacking boxes, not me. I have moved for the last time!!! Ya hoo!!" Well, not exactly. In the next month or so I will, yet again, be unpacking boxes to move into a house. Please, Lord, let this be the last time!!!  I am grateful for the ways that I see the kids healing. There's more healing to come, for sure, but things are so much better that before. Sleeping is so much better... thank you all for your prayers...  I am trying not to be too worried about moving back into the house but honestly, there are a lot of fears that plague my mind. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to climb the stairs without seeing smoke filling the hallway up there. How will I fall asleep there? Will the kids be afraid? Should I ask them now and try and talk through some if it before we get there or should I not even bring it up? Don't know.  This week there was another house fire...right around the corner from our house. One big difference though... in this one, a man died. A 51 year old man is dead. Same fire department responded... same area of town... theirs was during the day,ours was at night. I have been stunned at the number of times all of this has overwhelmed me...the realization that things could have so easily gone so differently for us. Like the one fire fighter said... "Another 60 seconds and the boy would not have come out of there". 60 seconds. A man died. A boy was saved. God, why does it have to be this way? Why not just let everyone have "close calls" so they can look back and reflect on how good You are for saving them? Why would you allow it to go one way for my family and a differnt way for someone elses? Obviously I am so incredibly grateful that You chose to save my family, but why? Was this man older and had lived a full life so it was okay for him to die? What about Jennifer Palmer? Why did she have to die? She wasn't old. She hadn't lived a full life. She had a husband and son who needed her. Waht about the 3 year old little girl who's whose burned down a few days after ours did... but she ran and hid in her parents closet (instead of behind the door like JJ did) and she died there. She hadn't lived a full life. I just don't understand.  There was a time in my life when I never would have allowed myself to even THINK these thoughts, let alone put them on paper (or a computer screen, I guess). To question an all-powerful God?? Who do you think you are to question Him? "Ours is not to question why, ours is but to do and die."   God, thanks for being big enough to allow me to struggle through this without 'offending' You. Thanks for allowing me to question things, understanding all the while that it's coming from a heart that desperately loves You and really wants to know You and needs to see you in the reality of the mess that i find myself in.

      Girls Coming Home!!...........  In just a few short hours Emily and Sam will be returning from a week of fun and Gram and Papa's in Canada. They had a fabulous time but now we are definately ready for them to come home.  This morning Syndie, JJ, and I went for a walk at Barchester Park which has a great paved 1/3 of a mile path. It was great to get out and see the trees and hear the wind blowing through the leaves. We have actually been able to do this a couple of times thins and and plan to continue with the whole family after we are reunited.  Syndie and I also had a great discussioin about how we want to have more meaningful family rituals and cerimonies that will help us celebrate life, each other, and the great thing's that lovely, beautiful, etc. Thnings like birthdays, holidays, dinner time, bed time, etc. Skys the limit to the possibilities. We also think that it we be a attitude and lifestyle as much as it will be planning out things to do. We want to have a balance of making the moments as they come along but we also want to have anticipation leading up to special time and then the storytelling that will follow when we are able to recount the experience together.  We also did some work at the house yeterday. My good friend Mike helped me safely and carefully remove the lower kitchen cabinets, sink, and countertop. We placed it in the garage and will hopefully put it into some sort of tool/workshop arragement later on.  I also loaded up the Wahoo Scooter and brought it to the apartment and I am going to try and ride it to work tomorrow. We will see how it goes.  L'Cahim

       The weekend is officially here......    &nbsp;  Wow! Just one more week of July left. This month has one by fast. Within the hour we are heading over to the Pilgrim Village Pool/Pizza party to mix and mingle and enjoy some free food.    &nbsp;  Yesterday we found that our kitchen cabinets are having "routing probelms" and will not be here till next week. This along will the the rest of un-progress will probably put us back in our house the second week of August.    &nbsp;  Tomorrow we are planning a family outing to the Detroit Zoo. The weather is supposed to be great and the kids are really looking forward to it.    &nbsp;  L'Chaim

      Syndie here again. Sometimes I wonder why things happen.  Yesterday I was at&nbsp;a playgroup that has developed out of some good friendships I have made with other moms of kids in Sami's class at school. After the school year ended we decided we wanted to stay connected through the summer so we get together every Tuesday at Lisa'a house to let the kids swim and play together and us moms have a chance to hang out and talk. Weve' been doing this for about 6 weeks and it is becomming a highlight of my week. Most of my friends at&nbsp; this group are not Christ followers (yet) but we have had some really great discussions about "stuff". It's a very good thing and I'm honored to be a part of it.&nbsp;   Since the fire I have been on "heightened alert" for seeing smoke, smelling smoke... smelling tings burning... like the day I ran the kids out of the apartment because I was SURE I saw smoke coming out of the back of the washer and dryer in the laundry area... I have embarasses myself on more than one occassion saying, "Do you smell smoke?&nbsp; Does that look like smoke coming out of there?" Most of my friends just smile and pat my arm in that "way" and say, "No, Syndie, there's no smoke anywhere. Everything's fine." I have tried to stop asking those questions before they lock me up in a looney bin somewhere.  Back to yesterday... we're sitting out on the deck at Lisa's house talking, laughing, watching the kids play... when I'm sure I smell smoke. Not a lot, but I smell it. Then I look towards the neighbors' backyard and I think I see smoke coming up from their house. I talk myself out of saying anything... "they're probably just grilling somthing for lunch... it is lunchtime after all." I tell myself. Then I hear sirens. Soft at first, then louder and louder... the house was on fire.&nbsp; 50 feet away from where I'm sitting the house was on fire. Of course all the kids had to run to the front yard to see the comotion... Sami and JJ among them. As JJ rounded the corner to the front of the house and caught sight of the smoke and the fire trucks and all the terror in his eyes was almost more than I could take. Then the smell hit both of us. Lisa took JJ as I ran for the bathroom where I threw up and sat crying. I tried to pull myself together for the kids and we quickly packed up and left. I had no idea that this would affect me physically like it did. All the way home JJ kept saying, "Mommy, I don't feel good." I knew exactly how he felt. Last night I ended up with 2 extra little people in my bed for most of the night.   It feels like a scab has just been ripped off of an nicely healing wound and now it's bleeding all over again.  Why?

      Syndie here.  Well, I got a job. Things have become so tight for us that this was the only option. Starting next week I will be teaching music classes at 3 childcare facilities in Canton through a company called "Music On The Go". It's better than retail! No nights or weekends! Right now it will be 3 days a week possibly increasing to 4 once the kids are back in school. My first choice would be to stay home with the kids and just teach piano lessons but I can't find enough students to make enough money at that. So, this was next best thing, I guess.  I had really hoped that somehow things would turn around and that we would be able to move home this weekend afterall. Nope. Not happening. It will be at least another 2 weeks. When the cabinet guys were installing the kitchen cabinets they discovered some plumbing problems that we have to have fixed before the cabinets can be completed. Of course the insurance company won't cover that because it wasn't caused by the fire... who knows how much that's going to cost. Man, if it's not one thing it's another!

      Me again. Frustrated but trying to maintain a good attitude. It loks like we won't be back in our house by the end of this month afterall. They had told us that we'd be in by this weekend (July 31/Aug 1) but that's not happening. No huge problems or anything, just sub-contractors who work on their own schedules and not ours. I talked to the Project Manager yesterday and I said, "Look, I need a realistic estimate here. Not a 'say the right-thing-to-shut-her-up-&nbsp;estimate'.. I need&nbsp;to know!!!" The "new" time line is "about two more weeks". Yeah. Whatever.

      The fire was 4 months ago tonight. It seems like a lifetime ago. I feel like we've been here for years. I fear that we might be here for years. No, not really. I'm exagerating (a little!)   Went over to the house again today to see how things are going. They're not going anywhere fast, that's for sure. They put about a third of the kitchen floor in today (not sure what happened to the rest of it?!?) and the cabinet guy was there in stalling our counter top. Still seems like a bunch of work to be done and nobody in any hurry to do it. Are ya'll tired of hearing me complain? Sorry. Jim is out playing basket ball with the guys tonight. He enjoys that. It's good for him. I worked this morning... taught 3 music classes at a pre-school nearby. It was fun. I think I'm going enjoy this job if I can ever figure out childcare arrangements.

      AHHAAHHAHAHHHHHHH!!!!!!  urlLink !@#$% ^&*() This is me screaming!!! I just got back from the house again to check on "progress". We were supposed to move back home last weekend but "things were't ready". The project manger SWORE to me that "another week-week and a half and you'll be ready to move in." Yeah? In who's world???? The guys who are doing the flooring are there today (for the first time) and he said, "Oh... this is going to take longer than we expected... we were given wrong measurements and there's almost twice as much square footage as we thought there was. This will take at least a week and a half..maybe longer with this humid weather. It takes a lot longer for the floors to dry when the weather is humid like this..." That's just the wood floors. That's not counting the carpet installation, the ceramic tile entryway installation, the electrical and lighting fixtures installation, the tile fixed in the bathroom, the outside of windows painted to match the siding, siding cleaned, the kitchen sanded and painted, ducts and vents cleaned out, final cleaning throughout before we can get an inspection to get a Certificate of Occupency which we have to have before we can move back in!!!!! I don't know weather to scream or cry. I want to call all these different contractors and give them a peice of my mind and on the other hand I want o curl up in a ball in my bed and not talk to anyone for a long, long time.  We had to cancel our camping trip with my sister and her family and my brother and his wife. Our "family vacation".. the one thing we've been "talking up" to the kids and to ourselves to give us something to look forward to. Cancelled.  I am in such a bad mood I can't stand myself. My poor kids... my poor husband... having to put up with me. I am so tired of this.... Okay... here come the tears...

        Hot and Muggy!!........          Today was a warm one for me at work. I think I lost a couple of pounds sweating.          I am home alone waiting for my familys safe arrival from Canada. Syndie's parents are being kind enough to bring them back. I wish I could have been back at Suzie and Steve's pool like yesterday afternoon.          Stopped by the house after work and there was more work being done on the cabinets but no work being done of the floors. Which is ironic because the contractor said the base cabinets absolutely had to be in by Friday night so that the flooring guy to get to it today. Oh well... What is one to do?          We have decided that we need something to look forward too, so we are going to have a party/open house on September 11th. If you are reading this, you are invited. We have more details in the near future if we ever move back in. :)          L'Chaim

       Becoming a Better Handyman?......      This weekend I have attemted and completed several jobs at our house and on my pickup truck. I started out by removing the front grill on my truck and taking out the burnt out headlight and front running light and replacing them with new bulbs and then putting it all back together. Then we we went over to the house and I put a set of caps on the 1/2 copper pipes coming out of the floor in our kitchen. This was the scariest part for me because I did not want to cause any new water damage to our refurbished home. But thanks to the great staff at Northside Hardware I successfully capped it off. I still left the water off just in case, wanting to err on the better safe than sorry category.      After lunch we are heading over to Canada to celebrate our monthly gathering with Syndie's family. This is a time we get together and celebrate birthdays, anniversarys, etc.      L'Chaim

      Well, I just got back from taking Jim to the Doctor's. It's official... he broke his ribs. We had to go get x-rays taken. The Doc. is calling back to confirm how many are broken/cracked and to make sure there was no "damage to the chest wall". They did confirm that his lungs are fine.. it just hurts him to breathe. Doc. says 6-8 weeks before they heal completely. Yuck. So... it looks like we will be moving back in (someday in the next 6-8 weeks) with a "damaged Jim". And all this courtesy of Dave Goff and the Thursday night basketball team!!  Thanks guys! (You know I'm joking, right???) Just so you know... Jim's first question after the "confirmed" diagnosis was... "Can I still play basketball???" What a guy!!

      I'm feeling down today. I was hoping to be packing the apartment starting today in preperation to move back home. Not happening. I feel like my life is in limbo. I desperately wanted to move home in enough time to give us ... the kids, mostly... a couple of weeks to get settled before we jump into the school routine. Honestly, I think we'll be lucky to get in with a week to spare if any time at all.  As much as I'm aching to go home I'm having a fair amount of anxiety about the move back in... Sami was up again several time suring the night last night telling me she was afraid because she thought she could hear a smoke alarm going off.  My job is going okay... it's just training for the rest of this week. The office staff seems a little disorganized... don't know if that's because it's summer and lots of teacher are on vacation or if they're just always disorganized. Whatever.  We watched  The Bourne Identity  last night. It was really good. I've been trying to rent it for weeks but it was always out when I was there. Now I can't wait to see the sequel,  The Bourne Supremacy.      Well, I'm off to try and find the motivation to try and clean an apartment that I don't want to be living in.

        More Progress..............         I am happy to report that today they completely finished the installation of the new wood floor in the kitchen, eating area, and first floor. They also began sanding the wood on the stairs to prep for the staining and urathane.      The project manner said that all the floors should be finished by Friday but we will have to wait and see.      We also met for the first time a neighbor on our street who had a house fire similar to ours five years a go. We shared "war" stories about what we both have gone through. As much as we have not like what our insurance adjuster has done we can't complain compared to this neighbors story and others we have heard. I will be so glad to be able to move back in.
