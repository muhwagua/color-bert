      Today at lunch I was surprised...pleasantly too, which is rare.  There is a guy from my English class that sits with the group of people I sit next to at lunch and sometimes we talk.  About rpgs, and grapes looking like fish eyes, and things of the such.  He is a very interesting person...and perhaps as weird as I am.  But today I think the intrigue was made official.  I told one of my completely stupid, goofy jokes that I always make and no one ever laughs at, right?  Well, no one laughed again so naturally, I started laughing at myself and then he, the guy that I described earlier, played off my joke and said something both witty and stupid at the same time, my kind of funny in other words...and he actually had been smiling at my dumb joke I made...which made me smile...and I laughed at his joke....which was funny...at least to me...I mean, he is definitely not someone people look at and think of as hot...but neither am I.  From what I know, he is smart and apparently funny and really interesting...I'm not gonna say anything except that he is intriguing...but that is a lot coming from me....well, gtg...listening to some Something Corporate....awesome band, listen to their music...I Woke Up In A Car is their best song...in my opinion...but that is just because it made me fall in love with their music.  Which reminds me, I went to their concert and was at the very front but didnt even get to see them come onstage because we had to leave early because of worried parents and icy weather...well, gtg for real now...  lisa

      I wish that I could be as young as my brother again, without really having ever gone through true heartbreak and confrontal with reality....here is an excerpt from our online conversation (he is in the 7th grade). TIMMAH34N: ive only loved 1 girl this year BananaFroggie: oh reallllly well your profile has said otherwise TIMMAH34N: i lvoed kristen last year BananaFroggie: what is love, Brian? TIMMAH34N: when u think about some one 24 seven and you want to be with them for a long time  BananaFroggie: so your saying that thinking about someone 24 7 and wanting to be with them a lot is a sound basis for marriage? TIMMAH34N: and your willing to do any thing for them TIMMAH34N: you cant stand not ebing with them BananaFroggie: Have you ever considered that perhaps it is not love you are feeling, but a form of junior high infatuation? TIMMAH34N: nein BananaFroggie: so naive, thats what i like about you Brian TIMMAH34N: love is a many splendeed thing love lifts us up where we belong all you need is love TIMMAH34N: ok then lisa TIMMAH34N: tell me your definition of love? BananaFroggie:  you remind me of myself at your age TIMMAH34N: smart genious girl BananaFroggie: well for one thing, i highly doubt if true love even really exists, but if it does, it does not come after a few weeks or even months of knowing someone, it comes after you have made that long term, once in a life time commitment to them and when you learn to trust and know someone better than you do yourself. BananaFroggie: but as i said, it prob. doesnt even exist BananaFroggie: you learn that after a few heartbreaks BananaFroggie: just wait TIMMAH34N: well if what u just said is true TIMMAH34N: then the girl that im goin out with right now TIMMAH34N: is in love with me BananaFroggie: oh please BananaFroggie: you have just missed everything i just said then TIMMAH34N: lol lisa ur funny and ignorant TIMMAH34N: ur clueless TIMMAH34N: u might be older but deep down TIMMAH34N: ur younger TIMMAH34N: thats why i love you and i hate you BananaFroggie: oh ok...i forgot that my 7th grade brother is so much more versed in the ways of love and life than i am TIMMAH34N: ive had more experiences TIMMAH34N: :-) BananaFroggie: i highly doubt that TIMMAH34N: ur very weird lisa BananaFroggie: Brian, I am just saying that you might think you are in love...I mean, sure, that is what it feels like, believe me, I know exactly what it feels like, and I know that even after I tell you this that you will not believe it and will just shrug it off as me being "younger" and more "inexperienced" but what you are feeling is not true love...believe me....of course, if your definition of love is thinking about someone 24 7 and wanting to be with them for a long time and being willing to do anything for them then sure, you are in love, and I have been a couple of times...but so far, it has led to nothing more than short-lived promises and relationships that die after about a year so just be careful TIMMAH34N: well it might not be true love TIMMAH34N: but its love TIMMAH34N: :-)  See?  Don't you just wish you could blindly believe in love the way he does?  I know that I wish I could.  I don't even know why I tried to destroy his dreams...I am such a horrible person.  Oh yeah, did yall catch the way he called me weird?  I'm telling you, that's what I am...we had another Key Club meeting today...I don't even feel like a part of the club anymore.  I don't even know why I let things like that bother me...hmm...maybe cuz I wanted to be friends with Lyndsay and Nicole and all them but I don't think that they want to be friends with me.  That is kinda sad, you know? Sigh...but oh well, maybe one day a guy will sweep me off my feet and my brother will come to me and be like, "Me and Lulu broke up, there is no such thing as true love" and I will smile and say, " So naive Brian, thats what I love about you."  :)  Lisa

      Well, these past couple of days I have had a lot of time to think to myself because we were all iced in our houses and everything.  And a lot of thinking I did.  I don't know where people that send out their college mail get their information but I think that they think I am smarter than I really am.  Yesterday I got this invitation to go to some conference this summer and today I got a letter from Yale about their school...but I mean, I don't think that I am smart enough to go to either of them.  I spent a lot of time thinking about my self esteem and if I should just start thinking that I am really that smart.  But, no matter how much I thought about it or tried to convince myself, I just didn't see it.  I don't know.  I think that maybe they think that just because my psat scores were kinda high, that i am some kinda genius person.  cha, right.  But anyways, enough on that subject.  Sorry if I am boring anybody. So I watched Fiddler On The Roof for the first time yesterday....good good story and music....about a small Jewish town on the brink of World War 2 and this man who is the father of 5 daughters is suddenly having his way of life and his tradition challenged by everyone around him-even his own family.  His eldest daughter asks him for permission to marry (instead of just waiting for him to pick a husband for her), the second one asks for his blessing, and the third one asks forhis acceptance.  All three are slowly progressing further and further away from his tradition.  His third daughter marries a gentile so he does not accept them because it would mean bending his faith and he doesn't feel as if he can do that.  I had mixed feelings on the subject.  I mean, keeping your faith is all good and stuff, but at the expense of completely excommunicating your own child from your family and making her cry and beg for you to talk to her?  I think that is a bit extreme.  But it is true that not every country and culture is like ours.  And that is hard to remember sometimes.  I mean, what would our culture be like if we had arranged marriages?  Well, we wouldn't have nearly as many good movies or cds, that's for sure.  But more than that, I think that people would be more focused on their lives and goals rather than who they are going to marry...but then, if our families were so tight knit that we had arranged marriages, then we wouldn't really have the freedom to move away and pursue our own dreams...so it is probably for the best...well, not probably, for sure...anyways, I am just rambling now (hence the name of my site) so I will go.  c ya  Lisa

      You know, most dogs have a chew toy.  And most of the time it is a normal chew toy; maybe a stuffed animal or a ball...or a little piece of rope like those ones they sale at the pet store.  But, my dog?  No, my spastic chiuaua of a dog has to be unique....or uniquer than he already is I guess would be more accurate.  What does he chew on?  A toothbrush.  He just sits there and bites on the thing and growls at the same time.  I don't even know whose toothbrush it is.  Apparently nobody's in our house so I don't know where he got it.  All the plastic is deformed, dripping with drool, and covered with teeth marks.  He gets really defensive of it too.  I tried to take it away from him and he barked at me and then grabbed it and ran under the bed.  One time I saw it lying on the ground and took it.  When he saw it in my hand, he chased me down until I gave it back to him.  Now, whenever he sees me coming while he's chewing on the stupid thing, he instinctively runs away and hides from me.  He chews on it so hard that it's liable to break his teeth one of these days.  I mean, sure, ropes and stuffed animals are all good to chew on, but a toothbrush?  I find it ironic that the one thing that will ruin his teeth is something meant to keep them in shape. Anyways, this weekend I saw How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.  That was one hilarious movie.  I laughed the whole way through.  And Matthew McConaughey was lookin pretty good.  Well, he always does but that is beside the point.  However, at the end it was one of those "true love" scenes with the perfect ending in which the perfect people form the perfect couple and live in a perfect world from that day forward...yeah freakin right....I mean, good ending for a movie and everything...but I'm not buying it.  I wish.  Lisa PS- Ewan McGregor is going to be in a new movie...he as well is not lacking in the good looks part of the gene pool

      Two things to think about today: 1)  When you look at your life, would you consider it a productive life?  I was thinking about that today.  I am not sure if I would consider my life productive.  I don't feel as if I do anything except for school related activities and playing games.  It kind of makes me wish that I did more with my life...maybe got a job or started volunteering on a regular basis...i am trying to get a job but I suppose it would help if I turned in some of my applications...sigh...I just don't want to live my entire life and then look back on it and say What the crap?  Why did I waste my time like that???  And will I ever feel that my life is productive, even if I do become some influential person...I don't know...Do you ever wonder about things like that?  I asked several people today if they felt their lives were productive and a majority of them said yes. 2) Is there really such a thing as true love?  The more I see and the more I learn, the more my answer leans toward no.  There have been a few times before when I thought I had found the perfect guy or true love and it always just ended up disappointing me.  I really don't think that there is such a thing as true love.  I mean, from the time we are little western pop culture bombards us with propaganda after propaganda of cheesy love stories and mushy poetry and music.  I think it is instilled in us to believe that there is a "soul mate" for every person and that if you just have a pure heart then you will find "true love"  What a load of crap.  I don't believe I have a soul mate and I don't believe I will ever fall in love.  And if I do, it will be short-lived because I wasn't made for love.  I decided that today.  I don't think I ever want to get married.  Marriage to me seems to binding and boring.  I would rather just focus on my career and social life...I do believe however, that a select few will find something closer to true love than the rest of us.  You know, in every movie, when two people that are truly "in love" finally over come every obstacle that has been placed in front of them to be together, one or both of them nearly always meets their end in some sort of trajedy.  It would seem that "true love" is characterized by the essential state of being apart and the fact that they will never really be able to be together the rest of their lives.  They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never to have loved at all....is that really true?  Because if you have loved and lost, then you know what you are missing, and that would just put you in more misery than before...I kind of understand I guess how that feels...but it doesn't matter...i gtg now...c ya  Lisa

      I applied to the Texas Academy of Math and Science this year.  And although I know that compared to a lot of other people, my grades are good and my tests scores are high, I do not think that I am as comepletely smart as every one makes me out to be.  I am 4th in my class with a gpa of over 100...but I don't feel like I should be there, that I am that smart.  It seems that everyone else around me that is considered smart fits in a whole lot better than I do with other "smart" people and that they are better than me.  Some of them sure act like it.  Victoria Miller beat me for the spot of editor on Key Club...and although I probably don't deserve to be an officer again next year, I can't help but think that it is because I just don't strike people as a smart, responsible person.  Maybe that is because sometimes I will just completely forget about a homework assignment and do it the period before it is due or maybe it is because I cannot publicly speak worth crap.  I don't know.  But Victoria is annoying.  And from what I know, she is not an extraordianry writer...which is what an editor is supposed to be I think.  But anyways, back to what I was talking about before.  If I do not get accepted into TAMS I think that will be the day I really start believeing that I am no smarter than the average person.  I read all these stories about people who went to TAMS and were all genius-like.  I just don't see myself as that smart.  But at the same time, I really really really want to go.   I observe people a lot at school.  Mainly because I don't really talk to anyone.  It kind of depresses me how I don't really get along with anyone.  I mean, I am friendly with just about everyone.  But I really don't think that I fit in at all.  I am a little too weird, a little too quiet, a little too different from everybody else.  The only person I really talk to and feel as if they have heard and understood is Amy.  And Amy and I are complete opposites.  In every way imaginable.  Perhaps I feel she understands me because we grew up together.  I don't know...latetly, i have been getting very irritated with people easily and being very judgemental.  This is not a good thing.  I don't want to become a bitter person.  I am pessimistic also.  Can you tell?  sigh...anyways, gtg now.  ciao  Lisa

      There is a party somewhere on my street and there are like ten million cars lined up on the sides of my street.  I saw a police officer and I waved to him so he waved back and then like 3 other cop cars came down my street and they all asked me if I knew where the party was.  I informed him that I did not.  I think he was either surprised or annoyed that I waved at him.  I think he thought I was associated with the party somehow.  That amuses me.  Well, I am here, home alone...which kinda scares me.  I have to lock all of the doors.  The other day I was home alone and the door slammed shut.  It wasn't until after I had locked myself in the bathroom for thirty minutes that I deducted that it was probably the wind from the open windows that caused it to shut.  And even then it took me another fifteen minutes to build up the courage to come out of the bathroom.  I never want to live completely alone.  But I don't think I ever want to get married either.  This is a paradox.  Well, maybe not, but still...  I got fourth in writing and 6th in spelling at the district academic meet today.  The writing judges did a pretty crappy job on their part.  None of their comments on my paper made any sense at all.  And they called my friend's paper bigotry....when it was obviously not.  I think they are on something...or something...  Well, I should know about TAMS soon.  I hope that I got in.  I need a change.  I am going to write in simple sentences.  This emphasizes my lack of writing skills.  I need a job.  I cannot find one.  I think Hobby Lobby is hiring.  I can hear the noise of cars leaving outside.  Mest is an excellent band.  You should listen to some of their stuff.  Ok, enough with that literary crap...hey I have some interesting facts here: Amy Wallace on  Notes On The Collection of Transfers  : “This work is arguably the most boring book ever written, and as any bibliophile knows. The competition is fierce. It unquestionably placed him among the foremost ranks of literary eccentrics. Before Sidis arrived upon the scene, there had been a volume entitled  Nothing , by Methelá which contained 200 blank pages.” In 1634, Charles Butler bestowed upon the world   The Feminin Monarchi , a history of bees written phonetic spelling. In 1802, Timothy Dexter’s  A Pickle for the Knowing Ones  made the scene, composed of a single sentence, with all the punctuation on the last page in case you were inclined to re-insert it into the book. And in 1939 came  Gadsby , by Ernest Vincent Wright, which was a fifty-thousand-word novel written without the use of the letter “e”.   Now these people knew how to productively spend their time.  William Sidis is my intellectual role model...he was extremely intelligent.  I wish I could learn an entire language in a day....  I can hear people yelling outside...I'm gonna go spy.  Apparently, the cops broke up the party.  Then there was a parade of people walking down my street and getting into their cars.  But there were so many of them that there was a back up and nobody could get out.  One lady even started freak dancing in my driveway...I found it amusing.  And they all had their rap on as loud as it could be with the bass all the way up so I could hear a loud boom boom boom coming from a number of cars at the same time.  Then one lady started yelling, "I'm going to Wal-Mart!  Meet me at Wal-Mart!" and the traffic finally started clearing away.    I am acting completely crazy today.  I feel relieved for some reason.  Why would anyone want to meet at a Wal-Mart?  Life is confusing.  Lisa  "Hey, I found this egg in the couch.  Is this yours?" "Yes, it's very fragile.  Put it down." "I found what I believe to be a goose egg in the couch." "Thank you Interruptor Jones, that is also my egg.  Now put it down" "Here's a duck egg, a nut hatch egg, an ostrich egg, maybe a dinosaur egg, one of those brown eggs..." "What are you trying to say?  So I got a lot of eggs....and I keep them in the couch..." "There needs to be a better word for weird." -SB & SS

      Applying for jobs is like...asking a boy you like out...in elementary school...it's pointless, stupid, and there is always an inevitable rejection... but you know that if they said yes, you would be the happiest person on earth...  However, now a days I am hearing the words, "We're not hiring" more than I ever heard the words, "No, you're ugly," or "I don't like you like that" back in the day.  Well, I lie...I haven't been to thirteen places yet...maybe twelve...so I am almost there.  So, uh, school is back in...and it sucks...as usual...we had to take the TAKS test today...those TAKS ppl must not be very....intelligent....one of the questions:  Which word best helps the reader understand the meaning of the word poignant? (keep in mind that I already knew it)  a) express b) personal c) today d) violet  Now for the definition of "poignant": poign·ant    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (poinynt) adj.   a) Physically painful b) Keenly distressing to the mind or feelings: poignant anxiety.  c) Profoundly moving; touching: a poignant memory. See Synonyms at moving.   I was like: shuwaw!  What are these people thinking?  I picked personal, just because I figured it had to relate to your personal feelings or whatnot but it is those types of questions that make me sit back and say, "Just how smart are the people that are given the authority to govern us anyways?"  Not very.  Also, who besides me was outraged at Michael Moore's speech at the Academy awards?  I mean, it's fine if you are anti-war and all, but publicly denouncing your president on a program that is being internationally watched and broadcasted on public television?  That is bad taste.  Our troops were watching that...what, does he want them to lose their morale or something?  Stupid and annoying guy, or at least that was my impression of him.  [Transition], Saturday I went to the Bowling For Soup concert...some awesome music...wow....probably the best concert I have been to in a long while.  The Riddlin' Kids were good too...and they are both from Texas!  of course, that's just because out of all the beautiful people in the United States, we are the most talented :).  "And that, as they say, is that."

      I often think that humor is a pretense...something feigned by people so that they do not have to face the grim reality that they live in.  It is a wall of some sort that people hide behind so that they do not have to form opinions on issues that affect the entire world or think about something serious for more than five minutes.  The weird thing is that I am not entirely opposed to this form of dealing with reality.  I suppose I completely understand what they are trying to do.  But instead of using humor to escape from it, I simply try not to think about it too hard and attempt to ignore it.  However, this does not usually work...well, does not ever work would be more appropriate.  I commend people able to make a comedy about the war that we are now engaged in.  I admire anyone who can sever themselves so far from their emotions that they laugh at things that cause other people suffering.  And seriously, I really don't think they are any worse than anyone else.  Because I understand why they do it.  I suppose it does the rest of the world good if it serves as comic relief to anyone.  However, people who pretend that the war with Iraq does not affect them or their generation annoy me.  I know several people around 16 or 17 who simply shrug when the war is mentioned and say that it doesn't affect them or their generation.  Those people are too ignorant to acknowledge that people within a few years range of their age are the ones fighting this war and that even if it doesn't directly affect their lifestyle or their family, there are people suffering and lives that are being transformed, destroyed because of this.  To not care about it because you do not see the immediate and direct effects is selfish....in my opinion.  Sorry if anyone is offended by that statement.  Well, that is all I have to say about this week's political developments, other than that my official stand on it is that while I do wish that we did not have to wage war on Iraq, war is perpetual and inevitable and I support our president in whatever he does, unless it is extremely despotic or cruel.  Enough of that...  My spring break has been both boring and fun...I went to a concert and saw SR71 (great music, let me tell ya), saw both sets of my grnadparents, went rock climbing, learned how to play raquetball, went bowling, and tomorrow I am going to another concert.  I also spent two entire days playing Final Fantasy X, which I have nearly beaten.  I am about to fight sin...but I will not have any time the next few days so I don't know when I will do that.  I have been observing people as of late and have come to the conclusion that a good majority of people are fakes.  They lead you to believe they are something they are really not.  Especially at my church.  People want you to think they are perfect angels and do everything right...but when you get them by themselves in private when they voice their thoughts, you realize that maybe they are not as perfect as you thought.  But the next day, they are back at church, pretending to be as innocent as everyone thinks they are.  Some people are completely honest with you and everyone else, which I respect more than anything...except for maybe modesty...Modesty and honesty are the two virtues I never want to lose, regardless of where my life takes me.  Also, an interesting note....people are never what they seem either.  One of my good friends from my church has told me very recently that for the past 4 months or so, she has had a secret relationship with a guy that her parents banned her from dating because he was Episcopalian (don't know how to spell, sorry)...and she is a preacher's daughter...a sweet one at that...I never thought she would do anything like that.  But that also brings me to another point.  I think it is wrong to limit your child's dating to people of the same religion.  It makes me mad that people are prejudiced against other people like that.  The only way I think that forbidding your child from dating someone because of their religion is justified is if the religion is some cult that could possibly put your child in harm's way.  Otherwise, it is wrong to do so.  That is just my opinion though.  Of course, I also think that forcing your kids to go to church is wrong.  Well, anyways, that is my blog for the day.  All of this has been building up for the past couple of days...so it was a long one.  c ya..

      Oh right, the thing I was going to write about the other night... Well, today I noticed that all my friends play a different role in my life.  Brittany is my rpg buddy, Olivia is my concert/music buddy, Ashley is my history studying buddy, Sarah is my blogspot buddy (j/k)...anyways, my point is that there are many different things that I connect with people on.  That took shorter to explain than I thought.  Good bye school, Hello Spring Break!  Heck yeah...I have needed this for a while.  I really do not have much to talk about so....good bye for now.

      Today I was in history class when my teacher, Mrs. Roland, said she had to tell us something.  She is one of those people that is always smiling, and kind to everyone...someone who everybody loves, you know?  So she starts telling us how she is sorry that she won't be here for our midterm which is tomorrow and she was like, "It's just that, my brother got called overseas yesterday and I want to say goodbye to him" and they way she said it, it wasn't just a simple statement...even though she was trying to smile through it all, she started tearing up ans kept apologizing for being so emotional.  Every time she had to say something about her brother, she would start to cry again.  But, no matter how much we could tell she wanted to just sit down and cry, she kept a smile on her face and tried to counter her emotions by laughing.  Which made me think of three things.  Up until today, I really hadn't thought much about the pending war.  I had heard about it on the news and I had said that I didn't really have an opinion on the matter, but today, I was really impacted by it for the first time.  I mean, I guess I wasn't impacted directly, but seeing how something like that can tear a normally cheerful person up made me think about how if we get into a war, the casualties, whether they are Iraqian or American, will be many and devastating.  It made me feel for everyone who will lose a brother or a father or a friend or a son if it comes to that.  And I hope it doesn't.  Another thing it made me think about was the way that people wear masks.  Not literal masks, but things they do to hide their true feelings.  I heard this story once about a girl who had a fatal cancer and she was in an unimaginable state of pain but until the day they took her out of school, no body even knew about it because every day she would come to school and smile and laugh while hiding the pain inside her.  This reminded me of that.  Even through her tears, Mrs. Roland was smiling.  She didn't want to have to make us watch her cry.  She didn't want to trouble people with her burdens.  I wonder how often she does that... The third thing it made me think about was that she reminds me of Atticus Finch.  I wondered in my last entry if there was really anyone like him.  She reminds me of him with the way she lives with dignity.  You know what I mean?  Anyways, I was going to write about something else too but it is getting late and this is already long enough.  Word of advice to everyone: Buy relient k's new cd.  It will rock your socks off.    ciao Lisa

      To Kill A Mockingbird...I have just finished reading that novel.  I finished the last chapter a few minutes ago.  That book has put so much in perspective for me.  Atticus Finch is by far the best character I have ever read about.  He had wisdom, morals, determination, love...every good quality and yet he was human at the same time.  I think that this book along with The Killer Angels are my two favorite books of all time.  Even though I do love A Separate Peace also.  A Separate Peace had a lot of the same type of themes as To Kill A Mockingbird when it comes to growing up and maturing.  Sorry if this novel talk is boring anybody.  I think it is funny that both of my favorite books have a form of the word "kill" in them.  Anyways, most books have themes about the evil that lives in the human heart and all that.  And I love books like that, especially the satirical types.  Like Kurt Vonnegut.  But there was something about TKAM that both revealed the evil that men could do, but also maintained that there is hope because of Atticus' undying faith in people.  At the end of the novel, even after a man tries to kill his own children, he still tells his daughter that people are nice when you get to know them.  An amazing story...wow...anyways, sorry about this boring entry.  Nothing else new has happened.  Finals are this week.  I can't get past this part on Final Fantasy X because Maester Seymour keeps casting multi spells on me that knock out two ppl at a time...how can I beat that?  This is crazy.  Gtg...bye  Lisa

      You know, it's funny, the things you remember about certain people and certain things.  And what you get nostalgia about.  Every time I hear a certain song, I want it to be summer again, when the guy of my dreams was interested in me and every time we talked, I thought that I would never be happy unless I got to know him more.  And I remember the times when there were a lot of people around, and still he seemed to only notice me.  I remember the way I felt when our eyes met without meaning to and when they did mean to.  And his smile.  I'll never forget his smile.  But as summers also do, this faded away, and after a while, we were nothing more than friends, if even that.  It doesn't seem fair to me that the boy I fall for, after years of putting up walls of defense so that I would never fall for anyone again, is unattainable.  And will be for the whole of my life.  I tell people that knew me back then that I have no feelings for him any longer.  But every time I see him, it is that feeling I got when our eyes met all over again.  And even though he has someone now, who is not me, I still think that his smiles are meant exclusively for me...but then I face reality and realize that no matter how much I imagine or deny, things have changed and I need to move on.  It is a sad reality.  However, most reality is.  I think that if there was ever hope for me finding true love, he was it.  But, as I have aformentioned, he is currently unattainable and will be for quite some time.  I just want to move away so I don't have to face him ever again, him and every body else that lives here.  Sorry about the sad entry.  Lisa

      Things I Hate (And why I hate them)  1)  Make up. Make up is so stupid.  Why do girls wear make up?  To cover up their blemishes?  Well, I have plenty of those so I figure, hey, I'll give it a try...well, putting it on is all grand and all but does the mascara bottle come with instructions on how to remove it without smearing the black stuff all around your eyes??  No!!!!!!!!  And also, this base/powder on the face crap...in the sunlight, it looks like a piece of crap cuz you can see every grain of powder and every line of color change!!!!  I for one do not see the point in make up beyond a little lip color or eye shadow...  2) Everclear Read the below entry  3) Standardized Testing Aw man, we have to take those stupid tests this week.  They are so gay!  And for the math one, they had so much crap from Alg. 2...It was easy for me cuz im in Pre-AP Alg 2 but most sophomores have only gone through geometry so they didnt know half of the stuff on there!  Oh yeah, and they expect us to remember history dates from the 8th grade.  Smart thinking there, not.  These people have no idea what they are doing.  4) Food Ok, ok, so I love food.  And maybe I did say that if food were a person I'd marry it....but...but....it is bad!!!!  Ok, so maybe it does provide the nourishment that I need to stay alive...but I eat too much of it!!!  Maybe the title of this section should be The Good Tastingness and Seductivity of Food...yes,....mmm...chocolate donuts....  5)Everclear Oh wait, I already said that one.  6) Watership Down Never read this book.  Unless you are entertained by annoying, lost, talking bunnies who hop around and get a book written about them.  7) Elise Why?  You ask.  Well, none of you know this Elise I speak of.  She is currently serving time in the penetentiary...man i don't know how to spell.  She is the only person I harbor true hatred for.  She ruined my life, she made my mom file bankruptcy, she stole my brother's graduation money, and she illegally stole thousands of dollars from my other brother.  All of this while pretending to be our friend.  And still claiming so to this day.  I hope she stays in the prison system for the entiredy of her life.  I hate her.  Nothing new.  C ya later Lisa

      I just got back from the Everclear concert and I must say that I was quite disappointed.  I can truthfully say that Everclear is the only band that I like less because of seeing them live.  They must do a lot of sprucing up on their recorded tracks because in real life, that guy cannot sing worth CRAP.  Sorry to break the news, but he sucks at singing.  And he is OLD...you know all those pictures you see of Everclear and it is the guy with the blond spiky hair?  Yeah, that's him....in like the frickin 80s.  This was a middle-aged, graying, balding Alzheimer's guy who seemed to forget the lines to some of his songs sometimes.  He tried to cover it up by fading out and then going, "Sing it!"  But you could tell....his age had gotten to him.  He actually kinda looked like Steve Martin except more annoying and less funny.  They should have a law against old farts trying to rock on with the younger generation...heh, like once all your hair turns grey...And then, for the encore, all they did was invite all these sluts/whores onto the stage to "dance"/ put on a near strip show/ be all over the band members.  It was sick.  I did not want to see that.  I mean, no one did.  Unless they were just like the old fart on stage who probably liked the possibility of having sex with girls young enough to be his daughters.  These two girls even started making out towards the end.  It was so gay.  In a literal and nonliteral sense.  For the Everclear portion of the concert, I really didn't enjoy the music all that much and I didn't have just a whole lot of fun.  However, on a positive note...  The opening band, The Exies, was awesome.  I loved their music and they acted with self-respect.  Plus the lead singer could actually sing and he was not an old fart.  Far from it, in fact.  He was pretty darn hot.  Afterwards, they gave out free posters and were meeting-and-greeting.  I was first in line.  They were all so nice and all shook hands with me and wrote personal notes on my poster.  They acted with humility and class, unlike the idiotic headlining band.  Their music was a lot better too and it had a lot more genuine emotion in the lyrics.  Rather than "They all become Volvo Driving Soccer Moms"  I cannot say how much I don't like Everclear because of this concert.  The Exies however may become one of my favorite bands.  I played their CD on the way home (cuz I bought it up there for $10) and they have some excellent music and beautiful lyrics.  Well, anyway, that was my night.  Still no word from TAMS.  I'll keep you (Sarah and Jennifer, the only two who ever read this) updated.  Lisa

      GUESS WHO GOT A JOB?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  WOO WOO!!!!!  heh, I am ecstatic with joy.  I have been looking for so long and I finally found it, the object of my dreams.  Who cares if I am merely a bagger?  Or that I will only be working 20 hours a week?  Who cares that I will only make 5.15 an hour????  Not me!!!!  CUZ I HAVE A JOB!!! My first, to fill some of you in.  Life is good.  TAMS admissions offers go out this week.  I love it.  I cannot wait until I find out whether or not I made it in...and I dread the prospect of having to find out if it is financially possible for me to go to it...it would be terribly depressing if I could not.  I would work full time all summer if it meant I could go...  I still haven't talked to intelligent/nice/funny boy.  I do not ever see him.  How sad.  Oh well.  Life is good.  Good food.  I like the Foo Fighters.  They are an excellent band.  "And I wonder when I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever  If anything could ever be this good again  The only thing I'll ever ask of you  You've got to promise not to stop when I say when" -Foo Fighters  I love music.  For a complete list of the bands I enjoy listening to, please visit my webpage:  http://www.geocities.com/liawau87  and click on the music section.  If you could go to college for two years when you were supposed to be in high school, would you go? Even if you would miss the academic competitions? Even if you would miss the class rank competition? Even if you would miss the teachers, the classes? Even if you would miss your school? Even if you would miss all your friends, including the people that you know you wouldn't keep in touch with, the people that you come into contact with in your classes and think are interesting people but you would probably not keep up with?  The people that will make you remember your high school years.  The ones that make getting up in the morning worth it.  I will miss all these things.  But I know that what I am missing out on is nothing compared to what I would miss out on if I did not seize the opportunity of going to TAMS.  Sigh...it is a melancholy subject.  Lisa

      So the guy I like... He is such a nice guy. He is so smart. He is funny. He has a very good taste in music. And he looks very nice in dress-up clothes. What more could a girl want?  Ok, so he is not like the typical guy that girls fall over themselves for, at least, I don't think he is.  But he is very nice and he has a very cute smile.  I only get to tall to him sporadically but I really enjoy it when I do get to talk to him.  The problem is that I just don't know how to act around guys I like.  It is pretty crazy.  I wish that I could just completely forget all of my insecurities about myself and just not be afraid to go all out and make an effort to see him more and talk to him a lot.  But I mean, I didn't even talk to him at the NHS induction and he was standing like right there.  Oh the confusion.  Heh, but it is worth it.  I am serious.  I haven't liked a guy in so long.  I love it.  I had a dream last night that I was buried up to my neck in sand and he came up to me and started talking to me in a foreign language.  And then I was at TAMS but it was like a really rich school and really pretty and then he was there for some reason.  It was a weird dream.  I don't know if I will ever have an excuse to talk to him ever again...how incredibly depressing!!!  I will find a way.  I must find a way.  hehe, I crack myself up.  This is so fun.  It's like an adventure.  I wish I could have a relationship.  I have music planned out for each stage of the relationship.  Even the break up music.  Well, anyways, I just thought that I would comment on this aspect of my life.  But I must leave now.  Lisa "Look at me, my depth perception must be off again Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did It has not healed with time It just shot down my spine  You look so beautiful tonight Remind me how you laid us down And gently smiled before you destroyed my life" -Saliva

      I think that I have finally figured out how to conquer my discontent with life.  And it all started with accepting myself...  For the longest time, I thought that I should fight with all of my might against the person I naturally was and condemn myself for everything wrong I did.  I thought that I was a horrible person and that I deserved nothing good.  And its not that I think I deserve good things now but I guess I just see the pointlessness of going around in life believing that your existence is evil.  Unfortunately, many churches encourage such ways of thinking.  I think that I finally understand the meaning of living life.  This past week, starting with the regional meet for ready writing, I have begun to see how teenagerhood and life in general is best lived...Being young is all about contradicting yourself.  You're supposed to be a slacker while trying your hardest.  You're supposed to not care while freaking out if something happens.  You're supposed to like someone that you appear to be completely uninterested in.  If you think about it long enough, you'll see what I mean.  You have to enjoy yourself while hating life.  You have to love your music and want people to love it along with you while hoping it doesn't get very popular.  And I think that realizing this contradicting aspect of adolescent life has allowed me to enjoy it more and appreciate the idiosyncrasies and little quirks that make up my life and the teenage life of our generation in general.    Not caring so much about things has helped a little too.  Maybe this is not what some people would consider a very resposible or smart perspective to have on life...but I try to take a light view on things...you know...in my relationships with guys, I'm not looking for someone to marry or even a long term relationship...in my school work, I am not gonna worry so much about my class rank or my grades...but because I must contradict myself, I will also try my hardest in each class and try to get good grades.  I think that a lot of problems would be solved if people would just learn how to chill out every once in a while.  It would make a lot of mental break downs unnecessary.  Do you see my point?    Well, that is it for my entry.  I love music.  The relient k concert was "Wow" beyond words.  No adjectives in the English language can describe the expressionless emotion of pure raw fun that I had.  Well, bye now.  Lisa

      Ah, adolescent infatuation...I am so glad I'm in high school and still capable of having these crushes...even if they are inevitably leading nowhere.  Heh...That is all I have to write tonight.  Sarah knows what I'm talking about.  :)    Lisa  "Theres something that I can't quite explain I'm so in love with you You'll never take that away And if I said a hundred times before Expect a thousand more You never take that away Well expect me to be  Calling you to see  If your ok when i'm not around Asking if you love me I love the way you make it sound Calling you to see Do I try to hard to make you smile to make a smile  And I will be calling you to see If your sleepin' are you dreamin'? If your dreamin' are you dreamin of me? I can't believe You actually picked...me  I thought that the world had lost its sway (its so hard sometimes) Then I fell in love with you (then came you) And you took that way (its not so difficult) You take away the old Show me the new And I feel like I can fly  When I stand next to you So what if on this phone A hundred miles from home I take the words you gave  And send them back to you" -Blue October

      Well, I have just returned from Lubbock...and I must say, this trip has been one of the funnest of my life.  Three things. 1) Where do you go to listen to a conversation about the superiority of the semi-colon over the colon, a J.R.R. Tolkien marathon 24 hours reading, and people using terms like glossolalia or macrocephaly in their daily conversations?  UIL Regional Competition at Texas Tech.  It is amazing how many people I met or observed that seemed to be as enthusiastic about learning as I am...at least, when school is not directly involved. 2)  The same group of "smart people" that I had always wanted to fit into completely ignored and disregarded me again this weekend...so I have decided that I don't want to be a part of their little group anyways.  It's not all that great.  At first, I felt like this was going to be a horrible weekend because I would have absolutely nobody to talk to but it turned out to not be so bad.  I got to know this girl named Caitlyn and we became pretty good friends...of course, it is probably one of those short-lived friendships that you only have because you have nobody else to hang out with, as demonstrated when I said to her as I was about to leave, "Well, I really don't have a way of getting in contact with you in case we ever want to hang out or whatever..." and she said, "Oh well, I'll see you at school."  Cha right.  She might as well have said, "Oh well, I will see you on Mars.  We can hang out then."  Oh well...it was fun.  We stayed up talking and pulled practical jokes on our unsuspecting neighbors...it was great. 3)  This weekend I also met a guy named Ryan.  Well, I had really already known about him or whatnot because we had gone to the same meets before, but we never really talked.  Anyways, he is the editor of our school newspaper.  He asked if he could read my ready writing essay and I was like, "Oh yeah, sure."  So he read it and he kept stopping periodically and saying stuff like, "Wow, you're a great writer" or "This is a good essay."  and then he was like, "Have you ever thought about writing for the newspaper?"  I kinda shrugged my shoulders and was like, "Do I have to take a class or anything?" and he was like, "Well, not if you know how to write like  this ."  It made me feel very special...So he told me that I can just come by the journalism room and he will give me some style tips on news writing and let me write for the newspaper...pretty cool, eh?  I thought so.  At the end of our conversation he was like, "Well, you're a good writer."  and all I could manage to say was, "Oh thanks, yeah, you are too, I mean, obviously, you did win state last year and all (for news writing or something)."  Point is, I have never had anyone just completely flatter me like that.  It was kinda nice.  He is one of those really intelligent guys that is also very interesting and very nice.  For instance, he used to live in various countries of Asia because his dad is in the army so he knows, count them, five languages.  I mean, wow.  However, he was also kinda flirty with a few of the other girls...so you know...I don't really fit in all that well I suppose.  But the important thing is that I get a chance to write for the school newspaper.  This is going to be pretty awesome.  So I was thinking on the way home, and I kept thinking about how my ending up alone was completely inevitable but also how I don't want it to be.  I keep thinking about how I want someone that I can experience that romantic magic with that everyone is always talking about.  But the more I see how I don't fit in with anyone, the more I realize that I will not ever have anyone to share that with.  And it is kinda sad for me.  So I try not to think about it.  But it is hard.  Now I am starting to get excited about Academic Competitions next year and about getting involved with the newspaper and maybe raising my class rank and now I don't know if I even want to go to TAMS anymore.  I mean, I do, because I hate high school, but in a way, I don't.  Is math and science really even what I am going to base my future career on?  Shouldn't I do something that I am exceptionally good at, like writing?  But what careers are there in writing?  Journalism is the only one I can think of.  But then again, journalism would be fun.  Even if I go to TAMS, that doesn't mean that I absolutely HAVE to major in something math or science related.  I am so confused about my future right now.  I just don't want to think about it.

      Ok so, today was interesting.  This morning I woke up 20 minutes later than I was supposed to because Jennifer was going to pick me up for the first time so that I am not late to school anymore so I hurried and hurried to get ready on time...by 45 after....well, I did get ready by 45 after....45 AFTER 5!!!!!  I didn't even realize that the clock said 5:20 instead of 6:20 when I got up!!!  So I had a full hour of finishing my homework that I had not done.  Jennifer got here around 6:40 and I was ready obviously so I went outside to get into her car...and she informs me that no, we will not be going anywhere because she has accidentally locked her keys in her running car!  Wow, isn't this going to be fun.  So, instead of being late to school, I just went ahead and skipped first period.  We called a lock smith and waited 45 minutes for him to come and unlock her door, which took like 30 seconds, and she had to pay 45 dollars of her money that she had been saving up to buy a stereo for her car.  But such is life.  It was nice to miss first period...of course, I had missed it already yesterday for tennis and will be tomorrow for ready writing.  But oh well.  I got some more homework done during the time we were supposed to be in first.  What we also missed this morning was the mandatory TCC class meeting that we had to go to to take TCC courses next year for dual credit...so we had to go with all the Seniors during second period...so that was cool...we got out of algebra for 45 minutes.  History was normal...all we did was go over the two chapters...and lunch was funny cuz that one guy that Ialways write about put a Mr. peanut mask on his head and called me a retard...actually, he sat there and continually went, "retard, retard, retard..."  ....um, yeah,....it was a bit funny if only a little immature...he is not my type of guy...but anyways...and then I watched Dunja and Nick play their tennis matches...and win them...they both got 3rd in district...that was some pretty amazing tennis I watched today...wow...anyways, sorry this isn't very interesting...I will have more to say some other time.

      I did it!!!  Thirty long hours without food!  I know it might not seem like a lot, but you try it and see how hard it is to avoid food for thirty hours, unless you're anorexic...in which case you would not have any trouble.  But anyways, this was an adventure for me.  You never realize the ridiculous abudance of food Americans have until you try to avoid it and it is just abosolutely EVERYWHERE you are.  And you see pound after pound of food being thrown away and wasted....and then you think about all the kids and people in other country that just don't have anything at all and you just think about how spoiled and pampered we are...I mean, obviously, if you are reading this, you have enough money for the internet and a computer which means that you obviously have enough money to buy your own food and whatnot...but it is sad to think about things like that...I am glad that I am raising money for kids in Africa to eat...and I appreciate every person that donated to me.  Even just a little bit helps, ya know?    Anyways, this week is going to be an eventful one for me.  Tomorrow I go to District for tennis and then Friday I go to Regionals in Lubbock for Ready Writing...I get to go by default...pretty cool eh?  I mean, 2nd place couldn't go so I was bumped up from 4th place to 3rd place.  And Sunday I have a youth council meeting...and then next week is the RELIENT K CONCERT!!!  That will be pretty freakin awesome...My friend is going to (she has seat considerably further back than mine :)) and she is going to wear a wardrobe entirely dedicated to relient k...like she made a belt and a shirt with the name on them and she put their name on her flipflops and she aid something about her jeans...and then she said she was going to have like three different posters and something about a cardboard box car...I just don't saee the point in all that...I mean, isn't a concert supposed to be for the music?  But oh well, whatever floats her boat.  Of course, she also sayd that relient k is the ONLY band that she listens to so I guess she would be pretty excited about seeing them and all but that brings me to another point...ho w can you only listen to ONE band and not any others???  I would go crazy...I need a diverse variety of bands to listen to.  Well, that is really all I have to say...c ya  Lisa  Don't you see, don't you see that the charade is over? And all the "Best Deceptions" and the "Clever Cover Story" awards Go to you So kiss me hard 'cause this will be the last time that I'll let you You will be back some day And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips Will be of service To keeping you away  -Dashboard Confessional

      I am in a melancholy mood.  Please disregard everything I am about to write.     Sometimes I am so annoyed with myself I just want to punch myself in the face.  When I look at my life, I can't help but think how incredibly stagnant and unproductive it is.  I do nothing.  At all.  Except go to school, pretend to be smart, pretend to be involved in stupid activities that I really don't participate in, come home, do stuff that means NOTHING to ANYBODY except for MYSELF because I am so freaking selfish.  I wish that I was a different person sometimes and that I lived a completely different life than I live right now.  Why am I so pessimistic??  I think that the past couple years the only things I have been shown in my personal life is disappointment and frustration and that has made me become bitter, cynical, and pessimistic.  I have even started behaving angrily to my friends that have been my friends forever.  I shut them out of my life and I don't let them connect with me anymore.  I don't even talk to my best friend anymore, save for the thirty minutes I see her at lunch every day.  And I haven't even attempted to make any friends in replacement of them or anything.  It's like I strive for solitude...but it's a solitude I don't want.  And also, according to my church anyways, I have become morally degenerate.  I think I have been slowly losing my faith in God.  Honestly, nothing they say or do at church means anything to me anymore.  I just watch it thinking about how I see church as an excuse for men to have a position of authority or respect in life.  And that is just a bad thought to have.  Nevertheless, it is what I think.  And I sit and listen to sermon upon sermon about not being hypocritical and serving God with every aspect of your life and I just don't care anymore.  I can't even remember the last time I actually sat down with my bible and just read it.  Along with this, I have expanded the music I listen to to include things that a year ago I would listen to once and never listen to again.  I mean, it is not like Satan Music or anything, but some of it has some language and some subject matter that is not appropriate for all ages.  The thing is that I simply don't care.  To me it is not really a big deal anymore.  I like the music, so I listen to it.  Is anyone that knows me and reading this disgusted with me yet?  I could go on.  I don't "witness" anymore and in fact, I get kinda mad whenever people do witness.  Especially when it feels like they are trying to impose their "superior" religion on others.  I don't listen to any sermons anymore because all I hear when I try to listen is a man trying to impress us with his superior knowledge and vocabulary.  I make up excuses to miss church because I find it pointless and boring.  Do you ever feel like you have no emotions?  Because that is exactly how I am feeling at the moment...it is how I have been feeling for a while now.  In fact, I can type all of this stuff about myself with a completely calm face and while eating pizza rolls because I have no emotions.  I am a horrible person...  Lisa

      So, it's around 2:00 am and I am awake on my computer.   Why?   You may ask.   Why, when you have to be at school at 7 o freakin clock in the morning?   Well, let me explain.  Reason # 1)  Recently, my sleeping schedule and patterns have become highly irregular and spastic.  And there is nothing I can do to control it.  Before Spring Break, I had been going to bed at midnight every night and getting a healthy five hours of sleep.  After Spring Break, I fall asleep around 9, wake up at 11, fall back asleep at midnight, wake up again at 3 am, and force myself back to sleep until around 5:30.    Reason # 2) Today, it was more spastic than ever.  I fell asleep around 7, woke up at 9, fell back asleep, woke up at 11. fell back asleep, woke back up around midnight and realized that Hey!  My To Kill A Mockingbird essay is due tomorrow and I have not even written the intro or conclusion for it!  So, I dragged myself out of bed, opened up a diet snapple, and started typing.  Well, now that is done and I still have some math homework to do.  But amazingly I am no longer tired.  I don't know if it is because of the five hours or so of sleep I got earlier, but I know this is not healthy in the long run.  Maybe I need to see a doctor.    Reason # 3)  I tend to think a lot when I am by myself.  Part of the reason I am not tired anymore is because once I started typing my essay I started thinking about what life would be like if I went to TAMS next year and how I would find out that my writing really sucks and how I suck at transitions within my essay (as demonstrated by the judges at the district meet who wrote about my paper, "Your paper is  very  unclear.  I lost track of what side you were on, as it seemed to shift many times...your paragraph transitions added to the confusion, and your lack of focus made the paper hard to read."  and yet I got 4th place...what  are  these people thinking??) and I thought about that guy I wrote about long ago...the one at lunch, remember?  Yeah him, the intriguing one...well, he sits with me and my group of people now instead of the other group that sits down the table from us because they kind of just stopped making room for him (sad I know).  He helped me study today for my history test and was very amusing, as well as helpful.  He also retains a myriad of useless facts...I found it quite interesting.  I am getting off the subject...so...whenever I started typing, I started thinking, and now I am wide awake  Reason # 4) Even if I tried to, I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep.  I have reached this conclusion after nights of laying in bed for hours on end, counting sheep, slowing down my breathing, trying to clear my mind...only after three hours am I able to somehow force myself to drift to sleep and if I did that now it would be useless because I would be waking up two minutes after falling asleep.  Do you see my predicament?  I have insomnia.  I need to see a doctor.  So basically, that is all I have to write about.  Because I have no life.  Oh yeah, I was gonna turn in an application to McDonalds today (because they are hiring!) but then I fell asleep before my mom got home with the car.  I need a car.  That guy has close to $10,000 saved up for a car because he worked two jobs this summer full time and is also working close to full time now (or at least I think that is what he said).  He also turns 17 next week but can't get his license because he says his parents hate him.  I hope no one reads this that will know who I am talking about.  Well, gtg.

      Same Spiral, Different Day And when I say spiral, I mean the spiral of thoughts about whether or not I will ever find Him. And when I say Him I mean, the one, the guy, my one true love...blissfulness.. And here comes the spiral.  I think I live a pretty full life.  I mean, I have a fair amount of people I would consider to be my friends.  I hang out with them occasionally.  I talk about the meaning of life and love with them.  I have a job, I volunteer, I get good grades, I play tennis, I am going to go to TAMS.  All in all, I am satisfied with my life.  I am satisfied just being me, by myself, without someone to be with, in an intimate romantic kind of way...however, every night, when I lie down to go to sleep, there is that feeling of that something that is missing from my life.  It is not something that can be filled by religion or studying or friends...it is that something that can only be filled by having someone you can really talk to (and I mean a guy, cuz it is not the same with just regular friends, and you know it) and be close to...by a relationship is what I think I mean.  But every time I think I have met a guy who I could see myself getting close to, I some how screw it up and the situation gets awkward and silly.  I have begun to think that perhaps I was just not made for this relationship stuff.  If I cannot learn how to open up to someone and tell them how I feel, how will I ever be in a type of life long relationship in which you share everything with your spouse/someone special/whatever? Let me paste you some stuff from an online convo I had tonight with one of my friends:  "anyway, i think that being single when everyone else around you has someone sucks...even if you are satisfied with yourself...and if you aren't, then you'll never be satisfied when you do get into a relationship...its like this quote i heard once about winning an olympic gold medal "If you're not enough without it, you'll never be enough with it."  and if you have to lie about being single, then I do not think that necessarily means you are not satisfied with yourself, just that you wish you had someone which would bring us back to the beginning...oh i dunno...well, maybe it does...i dunno...im no expert."    If you ever find that person to be with, do you know whether you would find yourself wanting more, or do you think that the feeling would be sated?   BananaFroggie: Well, I can only hope...I would imagine that if all this true love malarky is actually real, then if you find that person to be with, then you would be satisfied being with that person forever...and I can only imagine how extremely content I would be...however, that is assuming that there is a person out there that is perfect for you.  I am scared that there is no one for me, but I think that if I never did find that special guy, then I could make do with being single my whole life...if I had enough music, literature, movies, and games...but it wouldn't be the same.  So I am hoping that one day that feeling of wanting the other half of me will be satiated, but as i have previously mentioned, i can only hope.   I think that about sums it up.  Good night (btw there are three new posts tonight)  Signing Out, Lisa

      School is out.  Finally.  After ten months of pointless and tedious torture, it is over.  For me, I will never have to deal with the pettiness of high school ever again.  And, as previously discussed in my blogs, I have very mixed feelings about it.  I am so exited about going to tams that there is really no way to put it into words, which is the way any genuine emotion really is-wordless I mean.  Just the thought of being out there on my own (sort of, I mean, I guess living in a dormitory isn't really completely on my own) and away from my house and family and studying things that actually have some kind of significance with what I am going to do with my life and taking classes that will require more than fifteen minutes of studying the period before to make a perfect score on the final....I just cannot wait.  Plus all the people I will meet.  College and tams people alike, I know that I will finally be able to shed my reputation of being shy and quiet and I will be unshy and outspoken... only to a certain degree of course, because I really value silence sometimes, but you get the idea...  I am excited to break away from my suburban life of high school and boringness.  On the other hand, I am deathly afraid of it all.  I don't think I have to explain much on that one.  And I will miss everyone soooo much.  Even though I hate our school, as I was walking away for the last time, I knew that I would miss my lost two years of high school.  And seeing everyone every day of school...sigh....but enough chat about this college thing....  Summer.  Oh summer.  Fall is my favorite time of the year, but summer comes in at a close second.  Especially the mornings and evenings.  I am not too fond of afternoons however.  Summer afternoons seem dead to me.  Like from 12-3, no one does anything, no one is online, everything is boring and dead and heat-sizzled.  Unless you are working, or out at Six Flags or something, it is just a dead time of day.  Fall however has no dead time of day.  Perhaps that is why I like it so much.  All day the weather is perfect and the air is crisp...ah Fall....but I digress.  Summer!  Yay, it is finally here.  I bought a ticket to Van's Warped Tour yesterday.  Anyone who wants to experience a day of great music and excellent moshing should definitely go.  This past week has been one of the most stressful of this year.  Working and school are hard to do at the same time.  I worked Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday nights and then Thursday night I went to a concert.  The other eight hours of the day I was at school.  I never had time to study for my finals or do my homework until like 11:00 at night.  I think I got only about four hours of sleep per night.  Ha, but I still aced my finals cuz high school is gay!!!  Today I helped my mom move stuff into another classroom for next year.  That is the extent of my summer so far.  Well, anyway, I really have nothing of interest to say.  I just thought I would write something, because I haven't written at all lately because of a lack of time for sleep, studying, or anything really.  There should be more than 24 hours in a day.  I would find ways to fill them up.  Like writing long blogs like this...which I can do because school is OUT!!!!!  Below is a blog I wrote like a week and a half ago but just got around to publishing.  It is basically about Ryan and why it didn't work out and never will.  Lisa

      I was pumped up for this thing.  I was going to talk to Ryan.  I was going to sign his yearbook.  I was going to tell him (if only indirectly) that I wanted to keep in touch with him over the summer.  I was going to look him in the eye and smile.  I was going to FLIRT goshdarnit.  Well, things don't always (or ever) go as planned...  First of all, he got off of the bus wearing his athletic shorts and a t-shirt, bouncing the basketball around like he was "The Bomb" when obviously, he was not.  I guess you would just have to know him to see what I mean when I say that he is not the athletic type of cool jock guy who shows off basketball skills... It made me embarrassed for him.  But you know, i am just as big of a dork when it comes to things like that so I was not going to judge him, you know? So the guys went off to play basketball and the girls went off to play volleyball.  Well, interesting side story here: I was diving for a ball to save the play and the game when: RIIPPPPPP...yup, my pants ripped....in the freakin CROTCH!  (Ok, I know that only guys have crotches, but I don't know what to call it for the girls.)  Luckily, only one guy was there and I don't really care about him all that much.  But he laughed so hard at me, and apparently, he told everyone else about it later on.  Well, I really didn't know what to do after that.  I mean, I just couldn't walk around with a big hole in my crotch all day.  So I timidly went up to our sponsor, Mrs. Anderson to ask her what to do.  And what do you know.  Right when I get there to tell her, the guys decide to end their basketball game and make their way over there. Well, I was not about to let Ryan see me with a big hole in my pants, so naturally, I stood facing away from them and whispered to Mrs. Anderson what my problem was.  She understood, and got a teacher to drive me home so that I could change.  Well, I did change, but in such short notice, the only thing I could find were the UGLIEST pair of shorts I own.  So I changed into those and went back to the park.  He was in the middle of a kick ball game when I got back so I went walking with my friends.  Soon, the game ended and we all headed for the pavilion, where I was hoping to catch him by himself so that I could say hi to him.  Well, catching him by himself proved harder than it seemed because he was CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED BY GIRLS.  But I thought, hey, it is a free country, he is allowed to do what he wants, let him talk to girls, I don't care.  Well, ok, then the guys went back to the courts to play some more basketball.  Except this time they were joined by a pretty, athletic, intelligent, and popular girl named Ashley who is also what some may describe as a hoe.  And of course, she used her powers for evil, not good.  She would wrestle the ball away from the guys who of course were loving it, and every time she did something they liked, Ryan would give her a high-five/hug type thing.  But I thought, Well, this is a game and he needs a way to congratulate his teammate...well, then I noticed that hey, Ashley was the only person he ever bothered to congratulate.  After a while of watching this sick display of public congratulation, I decided to go help pick up trash with a few of my friends.  Now, I am a pretty prideful person so when someone tells me i can't do something, i normally do it merely to disprove them...well, this is what I tried to do when JoAnn told me that I couldn't jump across the ditch. I suck at long jumping. Aw man, the mud smelled horrible, even after I washed it all off.  I smelled like a piece of dog crap.  This whole time i was thiking, Wow, do I ever know how to attract the guys...:). By the time I got done washing it all off, I realize that the entire group was gathered at the other end of the park for a game.  Apparently, for this game everyone had to have a partner.  So I watched as Ryan and Ashley chose each other as partners and were all laughing about it.  By the time I got there, there were no partners left, so I had to sit out and watch.  Past this point in the day, I stopped trying to keep track of Ryan.  I found it unamusing and pointless and I just didn't care anymore.  A while later, it was time to leave.  I got on the bus and watched from the window as Ashley and him walked together, talked together, laughed together, and flirted together.  Then of course, they chose my bus to get on.  I will never know why they chose my bus and I will never know why he chose to sit in the seat directly behind me.  But he did, and he purposely (or so it seemed) ignored me for the entire time.  I was so annoyed with him...but secretly, I was probably more annoyed with myself for even ever thinking that I should go for this guy.  Sigh...oh yeah, and God or fate or whatever has some kind of sense of humor because the next night I was out at the movies with my brother and who do I run into but good ole editor boy.  Heh, he probably thought I was on some kind of date or something :).  Well, he waved at me (probably only because he saw me looking at him) and I waved back at him.  That was the last time we ever acknowledged each other this school year.  Btw, I wrote most of this blog a long time ago but am just now getting around to finish it (it's May 31st now)  so....that is why I say all this.  Well, now for a new blog...

      I am really going.  This is so weird.  I guess it didn't REALLY hit me until just today, when I got the information for the Summer Orientation in the mail.  I am going to college, two years early, and leaving everyone I have grown to love behind.  I didn't really let it soak in before that I am really going.  This isn't just something I casually do on the side and throw on my transcript, this isn't some extracurricular activity, this is going to change my life...this is going to make me independent, this is going to put me in a position where I am out on my own and fighting for survival in the college world!!!  And I am really going next year.  I am really going to move away from this place that I have hated for so long, so long that I have grown to love it.  Do you realize I haven't lived anywhere else my ENTIRE life?!?!  This is going to be a great experience, but I still just cannot believe that I am really going, and that I am really doing it.  I am out there making it happen...And I still don't even know what I want to do with my life...and I still don't even know what I really believe.  And I still don't even completely understand myself.  Is this how all people feel when they move away from home for the first time?  Sigh...I am kinda scared I guess...I mean, anyone would be, but...man, this is just weird to think about...I must stop it.  Anyway, yesterday night my friend Ashley and I were talking out on my driveway and I got her to tell me about the guy she likes.  Well, I asked her why and then she said something to the effect of : "Have you ever felt like you had a connection with someone you hadn't even talked to or that you didn't know well at all?"  and I just stared at her and was like, "That is exactly how I feel." I mean, I know that my nonverbal communication has told Ryan that I am interested in him, because I am so blatantly obvious when it comes to liking guys...the thing is that his nonverbal communication says the same thing, if I am reading it correctly.  He seems almost nervous around me and he is not nervous around any other girls that I know of, of course, I don't really know him that well...When we do talk, he smiles just as much as I do...the first time we talked, his hands were shaking as he was typing up some news writing rules for me...It just seems like he acts much in the same way I do towards him...but I dunno, I could just be getting the wrong vibes from him...but, anyway, I do feel that connection that Ashley talked about...like, even before we ever spoke, I knew that he noticed me and I am fairly confident that he knew that I noticed him and then after we did officially meet, there has always been some tacit connection...but perhaps I just make stuff up.  Yeah, that is probably what it is.  Gosh, I am a retard.  Heh, but I am not afraid anymore.  I know exactly what I am going to write in his yearbook :) . If I ever get to sign it that is...and I plan on doing so tomorrow....ahhhhh.....this is so confusing...oh well, I am going to go now...I will write later, if circumstances permit.  Lisa

      Ok, so, I guess I should update all of you who are just dying to know what is going on in my life (ok, so I am being sarcastic, so shoot me  The last time I updated this was the night of the concert that really sucked.  So I won't write about that except to say that it....really sucked, so there ya go. Saturday....oh what a night...haha!  It was sooo fun!  It kinda sucked at first because we had lawn tickets.  We snuck up to the front but we were caught and almost kicked out of Smirnoff...but oh well.  The Riddlin' Kids rocked....again!  They get better and better each time you see them play live.  MxPx had some mad mosh pits going on that I was a part of.  Talk about getting a work-out.  And talk about the hot sweaty, shirtless guys that kindly help you up when you fall down...heh, good times, good times...the music was amazing during the first two I mentioned, Good Charlotte, and New Found Glory.  Excellent stuff, let me tell ya.    I mean, wow!  Sigh, that night will live in infamy...so much fun...except for the part where some ppl stole our stuff.  I lost a poster, Olivia lost her t-shirt. Sunday morning when I woke up, I felt like a ton of bricks had hit my head, so I slept through church.  Oops.  Then I went to work.  I came home and worked on my gay English project until 2:30 and then went to bed.  I woke up late and still had to print out some stuff but my brother had screwed up my mom's computer so my mom told me to just drive myself to school so I go outside and....our car is missing!!!!  So I was late that morning and my teacher STILL made me get a tardy pass even though I explained to her that I didn't have a FREAKIN CAR to get to school!!!  They have no emotions, I'm telling you.  Well, I told everyone at school that our car was stolen and they were all like, "Wow" Well, I get home to find out that it was gone because my mom hadn't paid some money on it and so they towed it.  Now, we have to move to a cheaper house because my mom has to use her tax return to pay to get her car back rather than pay her property tax...I have such good role models for parents... :)  Today, I did not really have a good day, but I am trying to remain positive so I'll just leave you with that I am extremely tired and have been so for a while now...seriously....I am so tired.  I need sleep.  Well, I must go now and sleep!  Lisa

      Once again, I am in a melancholy mood...and I am so confused.  About pretty much everything in my life.  I am tying to figure out whether or not there is any point in liking Ryan anymore.  Not that deciding there is no point could alter my emotions, but I wish it could.  He just seems so.....well, I can't even really think of a word that I want to use that won't make it seem like some elementary crush...which I guess is what it is anyways, since I have no experience with guys at all but still....someone said something today that really connected with me.  This one guy said that what he liked about the girl he liked was how her personality and her honesty relaxed him.  You know, like to escape from the stress and current of his life, he talked to the girl, and all his problems seemed kind of dim.  Or at least, that is how I took it.  I suppose I can apply that a little to my situation, except that I don't really get to talk to him much.  But just talking to him is calming I suppose.  And he is just so nice and intelligent and still has such a great sense of humor, personality, and taste in music.  Of course, this is pointless and I don't know why I torture myself so.  He probably has a girlfriend, and if he doesn't, I don't see how anyone like him could ever have feelings for anyone like me.  I hold myself in such low esteem...However, I did talk to him again yesterday, and it was cool, although I have a feeling that I was completely transparent about liking him during the entire thing because I was really nervous, blushing, and couldn't stop smiling.  He was smiling too (very cute smile, I might add) but I don't think it was because he found what I said amusing or that he liked me.  I think it was a pity smile, yes, that is it.  It was a pity smile.  God, I'm stupid.  I just feel like screaming into my pillow or hitting myself in the head and yelling, "Idiot!  Idiot!  Idiot!"  heh, and I actually did do that today in the car...Dunja found it rather dangerous... :)   There are other things that I am confused about, but I am sooo tired and I don't feel like getting into them tonight.  I will write later.  Lisa

      I have been very busy lately.  This is why I have not gotten to write for a while.    I keep thinking about whether or not I want to leave next year.  In so many ways, I do.  And I know that I will.  But there are sooo many things that I am going to miss!  All of my friends, all of my aquaintances, my school (the one thing I want to escape from above all others).  I guess it is kind of like being a Senior and realizing that you have to leave your childhood behind...except that I know that I wouldn't have to leave if I didn't want to and...things will go on with everybody long after I leave.  I would be willing to wager that after the first couple of weeks, people would quit asking what happened to me and go on with their school lives without ever thinking of or remembering me.  It is kinda sad.  But I promised myself a long time ago that I would not let my emotions get in the way of me capitalizing on opportunities, so I guess that I am stuck with going...of course, I want to.  I just know that I will miss everyone.  Anyways, enough of that...  My new job is quite exciting.  I have started saying things like, "Have a nice day," to my friends at school out of habit.  But really, I get to meet some interesting people...if not so intelligent.  One time this lady and this middle-eastern guy came through my line and the lady was like, "He's from Germany" and then he was like, "Yes, I am from Germany."  He sounded like Apu from The Simpsons.  And then the lady said something like, "We have come to free the Texas.  They are the least free out of any of the states."  I was just like, "Right....."  They said some more weird stuff and then left, thankfully, because they creeped me out.  Then one time, this old lady came up to me and was like, "What would you do if I said 'Smile!  You're on candid camera!'"  And I was like, "Right....."  I didn't know what to say!  She creeped me out too.  But I get a work out.  I think by the end of the summer, my right arm will be hauss-like.  The people that work there are pretty interesting also.  Let's see...Austin was really quiet the first day but the second day, really talkative and he got arrested a while back for drug pocession...David is a unique individual.  He thinks that I am a good bagger.  That is good.    Oh yeah, and Spencer found out that it was me that rolled his house!  And I don't know how!  Well, I kind of do but I don't know how he got the url to me website or WHY he went there!  He and Matt both saw it on my website when I practically confessed to rolling his house.  I tried to deny it, but I really suck at lying so it didn't hold up for very long.  Well, that is all that has been going on lately.  Bye Lisa

      I got in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry this I took so long to write one of these telling all of you who didn't already know (no one in other words)....but I got into TAMS...I got the envelope yesterday. Anyways, I am very happy and excited...however....   My parents are the most pessimistic people I know (Now you know where I get it from). Because of budget cuts in the state of Texas and the school district that TAMS was in, the cost for me to go to school there next year will be about $4,800 for room and board plus about $1,000 for tuition...which is not a whole lot considering normal tuition for a year at UNT is anywhere from $6,000-$8,000. Anyways, once I get financial aid, I think the cost should be considerably lower AND I am working full time this summer to earn anywhere from $1500-$2000 to chip in. However, all my parents see is the $5,800 total and are being sooooooooooooo pessimistic about it all. My dad was more supportive over all (which is weird, if you know how my dad's mind works when it comes to money) but he still just was so difficult. I explained to him that he wouldn't have to pay that much because the cost would be split between me, my mom, him, and the financial aid people....but noooooooooooooooooooooooo....he just kept saying things like, "Well, you don't understand, this is a lot of money. I don't want to have to put a $400 deposit down if we are not even going to be able to afford it. I told him, "Look Dad, if we can't afford it, I'll make it happen...I'll sell my computer, my stereo, all of my furniture...I'll work two jobs this summer and I'll get enough money to go if you don't think that you can handle the costs!" And he was like, "Well, I know this means a lot to you..." So in the end, after much complaining and about three readings of every letter and form I got in the mail, he wrote out a check for my deposit. I can't say I was mad at him for being doubtful about the money because I see his point. I just don't think he understands how incredibly determined I am to get out of this place and be out on my own. I am going crazy here. The thing that made me mad is whenever he started talking about college...  "You know, college isn't like high school."  "I know, Dad."  "You won't just be able to make all a's and not study that much."  "Yeah, I know."  "Cuz I went into college thinking it was just going to be a breeze and I was slapped in the face...blah blah blah blah blah.....and then I figured out that I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and that I actually had to spend hours studying...blah blah blah blah.....I ended up taking five years to get my Bachelor's....blah blah blah..."  Man, I just wanted to scream, "I AM NOT YOU!" And then he went on to Jason, my oldest brother.  "Jason was just as smart as you when he was in high school and he had a difficult time adjusting to college classes because they were sooo much harder than high school classes and he only has a gpa of a 2.6 and blah blah blah blah blah blah..."  I'M NOT JASON EITHER!!!!! And really, I made a higher score than Jason did on his SAT and I am a freakin SOPHOMORE who hadn't even taken Algebra II when I took the test. And my grades are much higher than his...I am not saying that I am so much smarter than him but I am not stupid enough to let my grades drop below a 2.5....I have to keep them above a 3.0 to stay in the freakin school anyway!!!!!!!!!!!  And then came to comparison to Matthew, the next oldest to me. This was in response to when I said that I would work full time this summer and donate all my money to paying for me to go there.  "You know, Matthew said that he would get a job this year and help pay for his college, but I have yet to see a dime from him....blah blah blah blah....so I can't count on Mom, I can't count on you, I can't count on Matthew....blah blah blah blah..."  I ALREADY HAVE A FREAKING JOB THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT FIFTEEN FREAKIN SECONDS AGO!!!!! I'm getting about 30 hours a week when SCHOOL IS STILL IN...I'll probably get a heck of a lot more during the summer!!! And plus...  I'M NOT MATTHEW!!!!!!! Matthew is a slacker and irresponsible...He is about to turn 19 and he has never even had a job!!!!! He was smart enough to graduate in at least the top ten percent, but he chose to not CARE!!!!!!!!! I AM NOT HIM! AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT MY MOM!!!!!! I am not ANY of my family. Period. I am not, nor do I want to be like ANY of them. That might seem mean, but there are just no traits in my family, save for my brothers' sense of humor, that I want. I can't help it if my mom filed bankruptcy and had her friend steal all of my brother's money. THAT DOESN'T FREAKIN MEAN THAT MY DAD SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST ME!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! !!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So anyways, that is my frustration with being tied to my family.  Oh yeah, and any money that my Dad gives me for this, I have to pay back.  But I don't mind.  I will go to TAMS, if it means taking two full time jobs this summer, selling everything in my room, and begging on the streets for money.   That is how determined I am.   C ya.  Lisa

      Hmmmmmmmm Still thinking about what to think about last night. Hmmmmmmmm  So I woke up yesterday morning and decided that I needed to just relax about the whole thing, I mean, it was just going to be a concert and I shouldn't look like I was trying too hard or anything, so in the end, I just decided on wearing my nfg t shirt with some nice comfortable jeans...very me in other words.  and then I added some of my own accessories.  But ANYway...  Jennifer called around 12:45, wanting to know if I would go to the mall with her for like an hour and so I said yes and we went to the mall and I bought some stuff at The Icing's 10 for $5 sale, so that was cool, and then I went back home and finished cleaning my room and whatnot.  I then made my way over to Olivia's.  The band that we were going to see was one from our school with a lot of people she knew in it.  Her ex-boyrfriend, his best friend that used to like her, and a couple of other guys.  It was like their first show at a real venue or something.  She had decided a while ago that we were not going to drive ourselves, we were going to get a ride with Alex, one of their good friends, so that it would be easier in general just finding the place and finding people to hang out with.  So, we were going to ride with Alex.  Online, an hour before we get picked up, Alex is on.  And he tells Olivia about everyone that is going to be riding with him.  Me, Olivia, Suzanne, and....Ryan?!?!?  What?  When did this happen?  So there is me sitting in Olivia's room, trying to not show that this new information kinda shakes me up, cause you know, I was not expecting this.  Sooooo, I decided that plain old me wasn't good enough anymore and straightened my hair (so it would not look as if it was about to attack somebody :) ) and put on a little makeup (::gasp::) and tried to reassure myself that it was not that big of a deal, which it wasn't, but I make a big deal out of things that are not, soooo....  Alex got here, and we got in the car, and Ryan flashed one of those really flattering smiles, and we all said hey to each other and stuff...it was pretty routine I guess so far.  I of course said something extremely weird and random on the way there, and Ryan just turned around and went, "Huh?"  But he was smiling so it was all good....I think it was something about how if I put eyeshadow on my younger brother and he grew his hair out, he would look like a girl....something to that effect I am sure....  So, Dreamworld.  Big warehouse-looking thing with sign that says "Dreamworld."  Looking around I think, Wow, if there was a bad side of Arlington, this would be it.  And it's on Division Street, so I guess it is in what is officially considered "the bad part of town."  There were many people there from Summit, lots that I knew and for like an hour and a half, all we did was sit around in the parking lot and hang out, talking, listening to some guys play guitar...it was cool...I met some really interesting people and just liked hanging out with them all.  I mainly stayed with Olivia and Suzanne the whole time, but sometimes I would just be by myself with a group of people that I either didn't know, or had just met.  I didn't really talk to Ryan all that much, but...I didn't really have much to say to him, so...how could I have talked to him a lot?  Good question, I know.  I watched him play the guitar for a bit, and he is pretty good I think.  Ok, so by this time, I have already realized that I am not HALF as cool as the least coolest person here, besides myself.  Everyone is so witty and funny, and I am...not.  But it is fun just listening to them and laughing!  Anyway, so the band finally went on at 9:30 ish and played for about 30 minutes and then everyone left again and hung out in the parking lot some more.  At one point, this freaky goth-looking guy came up to me, got in my face, and was like, "Hellooo..." in a really creepy kind of way.  I was by myself, kinda away from the crowd, so I was just kind of like, "Ummm....hey." and walked around him...heh, and apparently Ryan had seen the whole thing cuz he came up to me and was like, "I think you handled that pretty well." "Yes, yes, I thought so too." "It's like...maybe if I don't make any sudden movements, he'll go away..." Heh, yeah...so, I sat with Olivia, and she was getting rather quiet herself, because next to me, she is the one that is most a non-part of the group we are with.  So, we just sat there for a while and then Alex and Ryan came and started talking to us, and then they left, and then Olivia and Suzanne talked about how Ryan had all these girls all over him and how he could probably get any one he wanted, which left me thinking about how if he did, he would never like me, so what is the point of all this pointless pointless CRAP....?  But I digress....  Then everyone decided to go to Craig's house to hang out afterwards.  On the way there, Olivia and Suzanne had to stop by the theatres because they work there and had to request something.  While they were inside, Alex and Ryan were like, "Hey, this is a fire lane, so we can't park here." and so they started driving back and forth in front of the theatre like ten times...it was funny.  Then one of the workers came outside and stopped us and was like, "Can I interest you in purchasing some movie tickets?"  heh.  Then these Mexican duded thought Ryan had flipped them off and so threatened him...wow, that was interesting.  So then we all go to Craig's house.  I don't know much about these people right now, so I am sitting there thinking,  Please don't let this be one of those smoking drinking party-type things...Please!   We get to the front door, and Craig is like, "Anyone want a drink?"  and I am like Crap.  Haha, but then he is like, "We have water and umm....lemonade."  Yessssss...these are all clean people that don't get into that kinda crap.  Even though they are about the funniest people I have ever known.  Oh yeah, sidenote here.  Craig apparently knew me by both first name and last...and I had never met the guy before.  I asked him how he knew my name and he said something about being in uil with me...I felt really bad because I had never heard of the guy before, and he knew me!!!  But how?  Well yeah, UIL, but...I never met him...I never talked to him...so just how exactly does he know my name again?  Hmmm I dunno, but it was interesting I guess.  Right so, more people got there and then we all decided to go out to eat...Steak N Shake is like the only place open at 11:30 at night so we went there...and that of course was very fun.  Because everything these people say is hilarious...I really don't understand how a person can be so funny!!  Maybe it is just because I am the biggest nerd in the world, but I had never laughed so much in one night before.  Ryan as well, btw, he cracked me up so much.  And I didn't crack anyone up...save for maybe Olivia, but that is because we have inside jokes and whatnot...well, anyway, after that, we went home and I spent the night at Olivia's.  She agreed with me that they are a lot of fun to hang out with, but she doesn't feel like a complete part of the group or whatever.  She says that it really just takes time and hanging out with them a few times before you really get comfortable making your own jokes and stuff, because really you are just afraid that no one will find it funny, but really, they are not mean and someone would pretend to think it was funny.  Heh.  In conclusion, yeah I might still like him, but he will never like me, and I should just stop pretending that he might.  See my point?  And I wish I was a witty, funny person now.  Perhaps some day...  -Lisa

      Some days you have good tennis days, and some days you have CRAP...lol, but it is ok because I am in a good mood.  I think the reason I did not play well today is that many things were on my mind and I could not relax and focus on just hitting the ball...so I lost my first match to a girl that I placed above in the last tournament by much...and the girl that got first in today's tournament was a girl I beat in my first match last week...*sigh* but oh well...  So, afterwards, I called JoAnn (after I called Fifer of course....GET HOME SOOOOONNNN!) and she invited me to an outing with her, Naomi, and Bethany (the old group...we are not dead!!).  So we went to the mall and saw Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, something I had never even given a second thought about seeing...but they are all those kinda girly and hyper girls, so it is something they enjoyed...well, except for maybe Bethany, but that is just because she said it is not as "realistic" as the first one (I was like, "Um, the first one was...not exactly realistic itself...").  Anyway, it was fun.  Even though I am not as crazy and hyper as them, I kinda prefer it that way.  I gave a kind of sanity to the group.  Besides, some of it was immature in a way.  Not that I am judging them or anything, just explaining why I wasn't like them :).    We had some time to spare after we bought our tickets like an hour and a half early...so we went shopping a bit.  Now, I wanted to go to the book store, but apparently, all of my friends have decided never to go to the book store with me because I spend "too much time in there." and since I was outnumbered three-to-one, I had to go to Charlotte Russe with them and look at underwear...oh man, was this ever interesting.  Now, I don't want to get too personal here, or give more information than is wanted, but...gosh!  I don't understand how girls can wear thongs and feel comfortable!!!  Furthermore, they are made of an amount of cloth that is worth perhaps a nickel and they are $3-$6 a piece!!!  Is that not the craziest thing you have ever heard???  Heh, but in the end, after many "Oh, this one reminds me of you, Lisa," or "Oh, you like these colors right?  AND it has a butterfly!!" I ended up being conned into buying two.  These people go out like every week and buy tons of them.  Craziness, I am telling you.  Well, after we got out of there, I was like, "So on to the book store!!!!" which was inevitably met with a resounding, "Noo!!"  I need to find some good nerdy friends :) :).  But, anyway, it was all great fun.  They make me laugh so hard, when I just observe them being crazy and hyper, and when I add in my own remarks that are so much in contrast to theirs that they just stare at me in unbelief...a good kind of unbelief, mind you.  And I laugh whenever JoAnn screams every time someone touches her neck, and when Naomi makes dirty jokes (Because I never thought she would!), and when me and Bethany argue about who is fatter.  Plus, JoAnn had Finch in her cd player (good screaming music :) ) and me and her head banged and screamed at the parts where they scream.  Bethany and Naomi didn't know the music, but it was all good, cuz they laughed at us.  Naomi and I talked more about what we are going to do with our dorm room...she read through the handbook and found out that street signs are banned at tams!!!  seriously!!! they have the weirdest rules...but our room will be the best by far.  Oh, and this morning I opened my own bank account!!!  Score, huh?  Well, I'm off.  Big day ahead of me.  Learning standard, getting a tan, going to Dreamworld, seeing Ryan....I feel a long blog coming on tomorrow...longer than this one anyway...

      Wellll...since blogger has been really gay lately (yes, I think it likes other blog-hosting sites), this blog should be like three days worth into one.  However, now I cannot remember all that I wanted to write about so I guess I'll just wing it.  Lessee....  Tuesday I went to Six Flags with Olivia and her younger brother and sister.  That was ok, we were stuck riding the rides they wanted to which were like...the texas tornado (big swings), the sombrero...and such....hmm...but we left there kinda early and then me and Olivia went to see Alex and Emma for free cuz she works at the theatres now.  Then I spent the night at her house.  I had so much fun tho, she is one of the funnest people to hang out with.  It was like 2 AM and EVERYthing made us double over with laughter...it was great...Oh, and we were talking to people online and then Ryan got on and said that he was going to be going to the same concert as us on Saturday, so that should be incredibly interesting...I just hope I don't screw up the opportunity or anything ;).    Wednesday and today I just worked...and I must say, customers have begun to piss me off...some of them are soo....gah, I can't even think of a word to describe them...last night, this guy, Darius told this woman he hoped she had a wonderful evening and she was like, "No, you talk too much and you take too long."   It was so rude, and Darius was just trying to be nice.  And then this other time, this old man came through Jennifer's line and for some reason he was gonna get this cake for free, but Jennifer couldn't read the note that our manager scrawled on it, so she just scanned it.  The old man came back and was like, "EXCUSE ME, I was NOT supposed to get charged for this."  and Jennifer, smiling and trying to be as hospitable as possible said, "I'm sorry, Sir, I couldn't read the note there."  and he was like, "Well, MAYBE they should hire people that know how to read." and left.  I mean, honestly, the mistake would take about five seconds to fix at Customer Service and he has to be all....that word I can't think of.  And then there are always the classic people that are all, "Hey, those were $1.59 NOT $1.55!!!!  GET YOUR MANAGER OVER HERE.  I get those for free don't I?  You had better give them to me for free."  Yes, customers can be very trying sometimes...some are cool though.    Today, one of our floor supervisors, Stephanie, had some blank bags and started making her own store slogans...like "Kroger...You don't care about us, so we don't care about you."  or "Kroger...Where the customers get on our damn nerves."  or or...." Kroger...Where our customers ask 50 million stupid questions a day" One of the first was "Kroger...Our customer service really sucks, and our prices are even worse."  LOL and they were funny because they are so true!  Haha, some of them were sooo freakin hilarious, it was great.  I wanted to get one and hang it on my wall, but I don't know what they did with them...oh well.  Well, that's it...see, blogger sucks...if I had gotten to write the blogs right after the day I experienced them, they would be better....I wonder if the new improved version lets my archives be available...shall check now...  Oh, the word I'm looking for is a mixture of pretentious, anal, immature, and inconsiderate....anyone know of a word to encompass all of those?  Let me know if you do.  I can actually think of a couple of words that might do it....heh...but I won't go there...well, bye.  Lisa

      Sometimes I wish that some things are that aren't and that some things aren't that are...  Today all I did was go to the equestrian center and then go cd shopping with Leah.  The CD Warehouse is probably the coolest place I have ever been.  So many good CDs that are so cheap!  And they buy CDs from you!  CDs I bought today:  The Used The Ataris-Anywhere but Here The Starting Line-Say It Like You Mean It Mest- umm can't find album name Sugarcult-Start Static The Verve Pipe-Villains  And they were all only $38....ok, ok, so I know I said I would not waste any more of my money....but....They were beckoning to me!!!!  Seriously!  How can you be in a place with cheap good music and not buy any???  But, from now on, no more wasting money for Lisa...and someone please remind me of when I said this when I decide to go shopping again so I can leave all my money at home. :)  It is funny how going music shopping can remind you of so many people.  Namely when I found the cd of the band called "Slow Children At Play."  I laughed sooo hard!  Not because of the name mind you, but because that is what Naomi decided to name her band, and it was seriously just a random whim of hers...it strikes me as extremely funny that another person had the exact same random whim and capitalized on the idea.  Oh and then there was Incubus (Fifer) and They Might Be Giants (J-Chan) and Switchfoot (Sarah...your makeout music...LoL)....Anyway, it was tons of fun.  Leah insisted on going through EVERY single cd in the pop/rock section, but it was all good.  We got free slurpees from 7-11 and the lady was really rude.  I think she started cussing at us under her breath...but oh well.  Y'know, I think that gay guys are some of the sweetest people out there.  Now, I don't know if it is all of them, but the one that I know personally is so nice to me.  In the past week he has called me cute, smart, sweet, and strong...all at different times...and it is so random when he gives me a compliment.  He'll just be standing there checking or something and then randomly say something like, "Lisa, you are one-of-a-kind....aw, you're blushing how cute."  If he wasn't gay, I would think he was hitting on me :).  So yeah, that is interesting...I don't even really know why I am writing about this, I guess it is just that there is not much new happening since it is summer...not many people to interact with as there are at school.  I miss hanging out with all of them...I am gonna see Olivia tomorrow and I plan on going to Dreamworld with JoAnn sometime...but I just don't talk to some of them anymore...hmm...I haven't talked to Fifer since like a week ago...I think I shall call her tomorrow.  Now I really am just rambling.  Man, I wish someone was here to tell me to shut up.  Haha, but no one is so I shall continue...besides, this is my blog and I really don't have anything else I could be doing because it is midnight...well, I guess I could finally start unpacking some of my stuff...hehe...Ok, I seriously need something to write about.  Let me look around my room for inspiration...ah, I know...  Amy, my best friend...one thing that has always amazed me is how two people that are so completely different could just click like we do.  We have known each other our entire lives, and although both of us have taken two drastically different paths in life, it seems like we have always stood on the same ground, and have always understood each other perfectly.   However, it saddens me how after the beginning of this upcoming school year, we will probably see less of each other than we ever have before.  I will be away at college, she will be busy having a baby...and getting married...gosh, and it is such a young age for her to do so...but I always joke with her about how both of us found a way to get out of high school early...they were just two completely different ways :).  I like to think that no matter what happens in our lives, we will always be best friends.  But even this year was difficult for us to keep ties with each other.  People just change with time I suppose...hmm...interesting how that works...  Well, I guess that is it.  I really could find more useful things to do like unpack or read or something.  Both of which I have not done in quite some time...  Lisa

      So, today was interesting.  I worked from 7-3 which was kinda fun because the first 4 hours went by so quickly but then my entire body was aching from literally giving everything I had at the tennis tournament yesterday.  After work I went to the horse handling classes at the All Star center.  I really enjoy working with horses.  With dogs and cats, when you talk to them, they usually just look at you as if you are speaking some foreign language or something.  However, when you talk to horses, they look at you seeming to say "Yes, I understand what you are saying, and i sympathize with you."  There is more of a connection I guess.  And it is just really cool working with animals three times my size.  After the classes I came home and hung out with my family for a bit.  It was Matthew's birthday so we all had cake and his girlfriend came over and we watched some Japanese extreme sports or something...it was pretty funny.  Then I went to my dad's house.  I feel really bad.  Tonight his cousin Keith was over there with his 20-year-old daughter, Andrea.  Well, Andrea is gorgeous, and she has been gogeous for as long as I can remember.  She's always had all these beauty pageant trophies and stuff...well, I hadn't seen her in about three years...she had changed a lot.  She smokes now and drinks a lot and has a belly button ring and a tattoo...all of which does not detract from how naturally beautiful she is, but still...well, anyway, back to why I felt bad... When Andrea left, she gave her dad a huge hug and kiss on the cheek and said "I love you." and whatnot.  Now, if you know anything at all about the relationship I have with my dad, you KNOW that I am not like that.  I feel very awkward around him for the most part.  Our relationship never has been so great since I found out in the 7th grade about the crap he did to my mom.  That is when i think I started hating him.  I hated him for like a year before I finally found it in my heart to just forgive him and accept what had happened...but things are still kind of weird between us.  So, whenever I went to leave, he came over and gave me a big hug and I hugged him back, and he said, "I love you."  No matter how hard I try, I have not been able to say that to my dad for as long as I can remember.  Tonight was no exception.  I just said, "See ya later." and walked out the door.  I could feel Keith watching us and smiling in victory because him and Andrea have a good relationship.  I felt bad, but....I just can't do it...and I really hope it isn't because I don't love my dad, because I do...I think...or at least, I hope so...  Btw, Jennifer (not Lemmers in case Fifer or J-chan happens to read this one day) is making me very upset.  She threw a party Friday night and used me for a lot of stuff and THEN she tells me like five minutes before I have to leave to go there that she decided to invite Spencer (my ex) and his new girlfriend.  How nice of her.  ugh, she can be really cool, but she also knows how to be the most insensitive, annoying person.  She was so rude about it too....Must let go of resentment and remember that we are all not perfect...ok, remembering...forgiving...maybe...ahhh!!!!!!!!!  Well, anyway, I am still dead tired and it is late once again...so I will go now.  "the things you make me wanna do I'd rob a quik-e-mart for you" -the ataris  Lisa

      Hey everyone...I saw J-chan's blog and how he put his quiz answers on it sooo....I am stealing his idea because I have nothing better to do and I thought it had some interesting questions.  YOUR NAME (1) The singular boring question: What is your name? Lisa (2) If you had been born a member of the opposite sex, what would your name  have been? I believe my mom told me once that I would have been an Aaron, but I dunno...  (3) Would you name a child of yours after you? Not really (4) If you had to switch first names with a friend of yours, who would you  switch with? Leah.  I like the name Leah. (5) What's the way people most often mispronounce any part of your name?  People often try to pronounce my last name as Wa-oo-ters...I am assuming because of the silent U in there... (6) If you were to become famous, would you drop your last name (like  Madonna, Cher, Roseanne)? I will never become famous.  DEEP THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS (7) Do you believe in the traditional view of Heaven and Hell? What is meant by traditional?  And probably not anymore, to be entirely truthful. (8) Do you think God has a gender? Don't know if what God is could be considered a gender... (9) Do you think science counteracts religion?  Albert Einstein once said, "Science without religion is lame and the religion without science is blind."   Soo, I guess the answer would be...it depends...on what one means by religion. (10) Do you believe in organized religion? Haha, sensitive subject for me.  I am tempted to say NO in capital letters, but I will refrain and just say that maybe there is some organized religion church out there that could defy what I think of organized religion at the present moment in time.  (11) Where do you think we go when we die? Good question.  Maybe heaven.  It sounds like a rather nice place, don't ya think? (12) Do you feel a little funny thinking about the questions in this  section? No not really...I do not think I have fully realized yet that I will one day die...Even typing that gives me chills down my spine. :)  HUMOR (13) How easy is it to make you laugh? I laugh more than anyone I know about the stupidest things. (14) What person you know makes you laugh the most? hmmm...i dunno, everyone is funny in their own way, however, Chris Farley has never once failed to make me laugh, no matter how many times I watch one of his skits...oh wait, but I don't know him...umm...skip this question. (15) Do you laugh at jokes you know you shouldn't? I try not to...but sometimes, I just cannot help it. (16) Do you tell jokes you know you shouldn't? Probably not.  Unless the mathdebate joke counts...(say it three times fast...yeah, I know, it's stupid...GOSH see this is what I mean....laughing at immature things :) ) (17) What words instantly make you laugh or at least smile?  Embrocate!! (18) What do you think is the funniest thing you've ever said or written? I do not recall  MUSIC (19) Do you ever dance to music when nobody's watching? All the time. (20) What is/are the worst song(s) you have ever heard? Pretty much all techno...and most of rap...sorry guys, but I just don't see the point of mechanized music. (21) What song(s) do you wish you could understand a little better? Well, Letter Twelve has beautiful music, but when the guy starts...umm..."singing"...all I hear is a guy yelling...so, maybe those lyrics?  (22) What song(s) are constantly in your head? It varies.  Usually a song that I listened to the previous night.  Today it was "I Remember you" by the Ataris (who else?) (23) What song(s) do you think describe your personality best? Right now, "My Sundown" by Jimmy Eat World...it just makes me think of the future and the opportunities before me and leaving behind my past.  That is directly connected to my personality somehow.  (24) If you were to serenade the object of your affections, which song(s)  would you use? oh, there are a few...lemme look real quick.  Ok, "Do I Love You..." from the Cinderella Broadway Soundtrack, "Love Theme" from Braveheart (even tho it has no words, the music speaks worlds of emotion), and "Come What May" from the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.  Oh yeah, and how could I forget?  "Walking After You" by the Foo Fighters.  Oh, AND "I Wanna Grow Old With You" by Adam Sandler (The Wedding Singer soundtrack)... (25) If the object of your affections were to serenade you, what song(s)  would you hope he or she used? Any of the above :) :)...of course, it would also be nice if said object of my affections would compose/write a song unique to their feelings for me ;)  MOVIES (26) What movie(s) do you love that nobody else seems to? umm I liked the move "Pi" LOL j/k...probably, well, I dunno...I do not think I like any movies that are just absolutely hated by everyone else. (27) Do you agree with the idea that sequels are always worse than the  original? Definitely.  Name one that is not, and I will give you a dollar... (28) Who's your favorite Star Wars character? I always had a crush on Luke.  He was so ambitious...*sigh* (29) What kind of movie do you think there should be more of? Ones that make you think...or cry...or both.  As of today there are only three movies that have made me cry, and those three are my favorites...so, there should be more good movies like that...Oh no, wait, I lied...four...The Lion King also makes me cry. (30) What movie(s) do you simply not understand the appeal of? "Me, Myself, and Irene."  There is a distinction between being funny and being plain disgusting...that movie crossed the line in many ways.  FOOD (31) When eating, are you more concerned with taste or healthiness? Taste.  Although I often look back at the health-quality of the food I eat and feel regretful... (32) What's your favorite kind of cheese? Mozarella (33) What do you think your answer to the previous question reveals about  your personality? That I like Mozarella cheese. (34) If you knew exactly what went into Chinese food, hamburger meat, etc.,  would you still eat it? Yeah, prolly, unless it was like...super disgusting or something... (35) Do you ever feel guilty eating meat? No...although sometimes I do look at a piece of meat and say to myself, "This used to be a living, breathing animal."  But then I just squish my conscience into the back of my mind and dig in.  COMPUTERS (36) Mac or PC? PC (37) How much do you actually care about the inner workings of your  computer? I actually wish I knew how everything worked in a computer...of course, that is probably only because mine SUCKS and I want a better computer. (38) Do you ever begin preferring IMs to other forms of conversation? Haha, seems that way sometimes :) but no, not really...I much liked talking to Ryan better in person than on the internet...so much nonverbal communication that goes on that is soo much funner (yes, I know it's not a word) than "emoticons" (39) Do you find you're different talking through IMs than face-to-face or  on the telephone? Yeah, I am more talkative online and more inclined to try to be funny...but, it rarely works... (40) Have you ever ended bid on something on eBay and regretted it later? No, never got into the ebay thing.  THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES (41) Have you ever wished you could experience being the other gender? Actually, no.  Well, maybe I did when I went through my tom-boy phase, but I never really wanted to be a guy... (42) What do you love most about the other gender? How some of them can make you feel so...perfect...like you could live forever...or that your happiness would never end. (43) What do you dislike most about the other gender? How those same ones can turn around and make your life a living hell.  And make you feel the worst you've ever felt.  (44) What do you understand least about the other gender? ummm....EVERYTHING...but one thing more than all the others....If you don't like me, why do you flirt with me?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  CELEBRITIES (45) Do you sometimes see a movie or watch a show just because a  good-looking celebrity is in it? Ha, occasionally... (46) What celebrity's autograph do you want most? I really don't place value on signatures...but, if I had to choose...oh I dunno...how about good ole Ewan...Star Wars boy...he would be fun to get the signature of. (47) Have people ever said you looked like a celebrity, and if so, who? Nope (48) If there was to be a movie about you, who do you think should play you  (in personality, looks or both)? I think Sandra Bullock could maybe pull it off...if she were younger...and not so pretty. (49) Does it ever annoy you when you know someone is a celebrity but you  can't remember why? That has never happened to me before. (50) If you could enter any celebrity's mind like in "Being John Malkovich",  whose would you enter? God's....haha, just kidding...he's not much of a celebrity...probably Jim Carrey...how does his mind work?? (51) Do you want to be John Malkovich? I have never seen the movie, and don't know who this John Malkovich character is...   NUMBERS (52) Do you laugh when you hear or read the number 69? No.  (53) Were you lying about your answer to the previous question? Nope. (54) Do you actually know your Social Security Number? Yup.  46....wait a sec....ummmm nm.... (55) Do you actually know your IP address? Feeling really stupid now cuz what is an IP address? (56) Do you know what an IP address is? Oh goodie, I am not the only one...NO (57) Do you know the four-character extension on your ZIP code? Nope. (58) Ever thought there were too many numbers floating around in our lives?  I have actually sat down and thought about all of the different numbers we memorize in our lifetime.  Sit down and think about how many phone numbers you know, and how you can connect them in your head to certain people...that alone has got to be a minimum of like 15...and then there is soc. sec...DL #, address, pin number....it is crazy how many numbers define you as a person... (59) Does your head begin to hurt when you think of infinity, imaginary  numbers, irrational numbers, etc.? Not really...although, infinity has me stumped...my mind just cannot grasp the concept of eternity...and that is the same thing as infinity imo. (60) What do you think of pi? The movie?!?!?!?!  Quite disturbing, actually...   LOVE, SEX AND ALL THAT (61) Did you get a little frightened or uncomfortable seeing this as a  section title? Nooooo.  (62) If someone you had no interest in dating expressed interest in dating  you, how would you feel? Sorry for them..in a really nice way... (63) Do you prefer getting to know someone first before dating them or going  in "blind"? I don't know...getting to know them a bit first I guess... (64) Could you carry on a relationship with someone with the same first name  as a family member? Haha, I like a guy with the same name as my best friend's fiancee and brother (oh, they are two different ppl, the brother is not the fiancee).... (65) Have you ever wished it was more "socially acceptable" for a girl to  ask a guy out? Nooo!!  Cause I am deathly afraid of it... (66) What's your opinion on sex without emotional commitment? Baadddd...lol, well, I just think that sex shouldn't just be something that one does lightly without realizing what kind of commitment needs to go with it. (67) Have you ever been romantically attracted to someone physically  unattractive? Yeah.  Maybe it's just me growing up, but I don't look at physical looks as top priority anymore.  The last couple of guys I have liked have just been your average looking joes...maybe a bit less...i dunno. (68) Do you think the opposite sex finds you good-looking? Highly unlikely.  I wish tho.... (69) Would you be willing to give up sex in exchange for an emotional  commitment you knew would last? Well, right now, having never experienced sex, it would be easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I am so not shallow, i would do that any day!"...but then, if I had experienced it, and knew how great it was, then maybe I wouldn't be so willing...I do not know... (70) Do you think the number of the last question was a coincidence? Yes.  POSSESSIONS (71) What is your favorite possession? Toughie...probably...my Pocket Dictionary...or my CD collection...or my library (72) What physical, tangible possession do you want most?

(78) What was the best Halloween costume you ever had? i was Michaelangelo...the ninja turtle, not the painter/sculptor  (79) What was the worst Halloween costume you ever had? In 7th grade I wore a nametag with my friend's name on it and went as her...lol, those were the good days... (80) What holiday do you think has still managed to retain its original  meaning?

The National "Have Fun Like There is no Tomorrow" day.  MEMORIES (82) How good is your short-term memory? Excellent (all tests studied for within 15 minutes of test :) ) (83) How good is your long-term memory?

Sitting in a room on a blanket and there is sunlight shining through the window (85) What is your happiest memory (other than recieving this survey)? The freedom and naitivety of 6th grade...I really thought I knew everything about life and love, and I had so much fun that year... (86) What is your strangest memory? I don't want to say so I will just step it down a notch and say my next strangest memory...I remember how my brothers and I used to cover our floor with toys like completely and three feet tall and then three of us would hide in the "debris from the tornado" and the other one would be the rescue unit and would have to find all of us...yeeeah....we were weird...now you know why I turned out the way I did :)  There are so many things we did that were weird like this...but I won't bore you with all of the stories.

BraveHeart, Gladiator, Moulin Rouge, The Lion King (89) What book makes/made you cry? The Killer Angels, To Kill A Mockingbird, A Separate Peace, The last two Lord of the Rings, pretty much all of Goodkind's books, A Time For Dancing, Night, and so many more...Broken Child for sure.... (90) What song makes/made you cry? Depends on my mood.  A lot tho.  Music has a way of grabbing your soul and running away with it.  BraveHeart music makes me cry...FF7 makes me cry....and many many others..some of Moulin Rouge's music...Gladiator's music...some of The Lion King's music...haha, those are all the movies that make me cry :) (91) What makes/made you laugh so hard you cried? I have never cried as a result of laughing...but I have laughed pretty darn hard before, so maybe I am just weird.  THREE TRULY RANDOM QUESTIONS (92) Would you like to be cloned? Not particularly (93) Do you wish you could be alive when the world was ending, just to  experience it? Nope! (94) Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?

      Today was the first day I have had the internet since...forever.  These past few days have been crazy-like.  Friday I went to the TAMS orientation.  It was pretty fun!  I mean, I don't know if it was supposed to be, but I had a good time.  And the people there are not as nerdy as I imagined them to be.  Some of them were actually really cool.  And a select few even had a great taste in music.  Heh.  Anyways, let's see...Naomi rode up there with me and we talked about the different things we could do this upcoming school year and planned on ways to get around the rule of not being allowed to have a car your first year.  We are probably going to keep either her car or my car (if I ever get one) up at my brother's apartment complex and then walk up there whenever we want to use it.  It should be fun.  Ha, and we had the idea of bringing a golf cart just to get around campus.  When she asked the guy if we could, everyone, and I mean everyone, started laughing and clapping.  It was great.  I met lots of people and they were all really nice.  Well, most of them anyway.  I played hackey sack (sp?) with some of them for a while and that was super fun.  Basically all we did though was sit through extremely boring lectures and speeches, and we had an egg drop competition Friday night.  My roommate for Friday night was a girl named Angel and she was really quiet but we got to talking about how both of us don't feel smart enough to be going to TAMS and how we both like to read.  That was pretty cool.  Saturday I tried to test into Honors Chem but I didn't remember crap from Chemistry since I took it last semester.  Oh well.  All in all, it was an interesting orientation and everyone was really laid back and they were all quite funny in their respective ways.  Naomi and I decided to be roommates and we have lots of ideas for our room in the fall.  *Sigh*  How I wish fall was getting here more quickly (more about that later).  I am finally moved.  I mean, I wish so much that I wasn't, but I am.  And although I kinda like our new house, I absolutely hate it.  I don't know if that makes any sense.  I will miss our old house so much.  I have been through everything in that house.  I went insane (literally) last year from the whole Elise situation and our house was there with me through it all.  My heart was broken repeatedly by Spencer and a couple of other guys whom I shall not name and my house was there with me through it all.  When my parents divorced in the 4th grade and I cried myself to sleep every night, my house was there with me through it all.  I think that sometimes people think that I am kidding when I say that I miss my house.  But I am being as serious as I get.  My room has been there through every triumph, disappointment, challenge, emotion...it experienced EVERYTHING with me....and I miss it.  This new room may be bigger and have its own bathroom, but it lacks comfort, sympathy, and understanding.  My old room had all of that.  I am too emotional.  Tonight when I went to get food (because my mom claims that since I was not home when they ate dinner, I need none) I just drove around, listening to Jimmy Eat World, and thinking.  I went up to Summit (old high school) and drove around the parking lot listening to "My Sundown".  As I was leaving the parking lot, the part of the song came on that goes,  "Good goodbye lovely time. Good goodbye til sunshine. Good goodbye I'll be fine. Good goodbye, good goodnight." Now, you would have to hear the song to get the effect, but it was so perfect for the moment...I have decided that this song is now my anthem for the time being.  Let me quote you some more of the lyrics.  I see it around me, I see it in everything. I could be so much more than this. I said my goodbye's this is my sundown. I'm gonna be so much more than this. With one hand high, you'll show them your progress. You'll take your time, but no one cares. No one cares. I need you to show me the way from crazy. I wanna be so much more than this.  I like the part that says "I need you to show me the way from crazy"  Story of my life right there.  I feel as if a new part of me goes crazy every day.  *Sigh*...so now I guess I need to explain from earlier when I said that I wish that it was fall already.  I am ready to get the hell out of this place and go to TAMS already.  Basically, I am tired of all of this crap and all of the people that make me feel like crap.  Summer has been great so far I suppose, but I wish it was over already.  Except for the Warped Tour.  Ah, that will be fun.  So much moshing to do, so little time...since TAMS freaking banned Deep Ellum from us!!!!  It was the stupidest thing I had ever heard.  Oh well.  I guess it is worth the freedom...and there are other places to go to small venue concerts besides Deep Ellum, right?????  Ok, so I might have to break some rules....nah, I don't want to get kicked out...I guess I will just have to wait until Spring Break and summer to go to any good concerts...Will think about all this later.  Well, I am tired so I will not explain any more right now.  Oh, and congratulations Sarah...haha, and I think making out is classified as whatever you want it to be...so....that is all.  bye.  Lisa

      Today was a relatively good day.  I woke up, went to my old school to withdraw, found out I couldn't do it until Monday, went to the box store, got some boxes for moving, went home, and packed all day while listening to extremely good music.  At around 2:45 I went to my tennis tournament and I won my first match to make it into the semis ( I think I had a buy the first match) and then I lost the next one 8-4.  But it was a good match with many deuces, and we battled it out...she was better and deserved to win, so I am not being too hard on myself.  Afterwards, there was this park nearby and I just laid out under the trees for like ten minutes and relaxed before driving home.  I think I am going to the movies later.  It should be fun.  That is all.  Lisa

      So I wake up this morning when my brother leaves for work at 8:30 cuz I told him to wake me up.  But then I didn't feel like getting up so I went back to sleep.  I woke back up at around 9:30 and was just laying there.  Phone rings.  Tis Olivia. "Get your lazy butt down here!" "Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming..." "You just woke up!" "Hey, for your information, I woke up FIVE MINUTES ago." Our conversation lasts a couple minutes more, and I tell her I will leave in 15 minutes.  But I leave in like 30, because it is of course not humanly possible to take a shower, get dressed, and dry as much hair as I have in 15 minutes. So i get ready and go to watch the tennis tryouts.  I do not know for why I do this, as it will just make me wish I was not leaving in August even more.  But nonetheless, I went.  And it was fun.  Allyn, Shawna, John, Kevinh, David, Melissa, Braittany, Nick, Nick, Taaha, Shaby....I am going to miss them all so much.  Kevinh is prolly the funniest guy I know.  He cracks me up sooo much.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I took Brittany home, and we decided to go to the movies sometime this week, if we can work it out with our work schedules.  Then I came home and went to eat lunch with Ashley (not drill team Ashley).  We got some chinese from Mr. Wok's.  But then she had to go to work.  So I came home and desperately searched for someone to go shopping with me.  Because I told myself yesterday...I said to myself, "Self, you are going to go get some school shopping done tomorrow whether or not you have anyone else to go with." But yeah that was a stupid idea.    A note about jeans:   THEY NEVER FIT like they are supposed to.  At Khols I try on these 13s that are wayyyyy too big for me so i am like ok, maybe i lost some weight, so i go down to the 11s...exact same brand and everything....one pair is bigger than the 13s I tried on and one pair is wayyy too small.  i am like, what the crap is this crap.  So I left Khols with just buying some shorts for 6 dollars.  Lessee then I went to the mall and that was pretty boring.  I looked around in a few stores that didn't have anything cheaper than $30.  My resolution this year is to not spend over $20 on a pair of jeans.  The clearance rack at American Eagle had cheap jeans.  Originally 50, marked down to 40, plus 50% off of the marked down price.  Most of them were stretch though, and I hate stretch, so I only ended up getting one pair.  They fit quite nicely.  Then I went to a couple of other stores and THEN heh...I went into The Buckle.  I had never been in there before because every time I was with someone, they'd just be like, "Oh, they are really expensive." and so we never went in there.  Well, I walk in there and this guy that works there comes up to me and is like, "Hi!  How are you doing today?" and I am just like, "Fine."  This guy is super attractive, btw.  Way out of my league.  And then he was like, "Looking for anything special?" and I was like, "Nope, just looking around." and he was like, "Have you ever bought jeans here before?" and I was like, "No." and so he was like, "Ok, I'll tell you a bit about our jeans.  We have Lucky brand.  (he looks at me) and these are generally around $80.  And we have CKY (I guess thats how you spell it) (he looks at me again).  And those are anywhere from $50-$60."  I was thinking:  bastard!  What, do I look like I can't afford your crappy ass jeans?  You think your store is just "too expensive" for me???  Well, screw you.   So, instead of raising my eyebrows in shock and saying something like, "Heh, I dun think so." I just nodded and looked like I was interested in buying something.  Heh.  What a big mistake.  So I was like, "I'll just look around." and make my way to the wall o jeans.  He follows.  "So, what size do you wear?"  I am just like, "Eh, like an 11."  Their jeans aren't sized like that, they actually have measurements so he found some that matched up and gave me like three pairs.  All the time asking me questions like, "Do you like a big flare, a small flare, or maybe a boot cut?"  To which I would reply, "Uhh...a regular flare?"  Then he pointed the way to the dressing room.  However, before I got in there, he was like, "Now, the only condition is that when you try on a pair, you have to come out and let me see how they look on you."  I was like, ahhh!  Is he hitting on me or am I imagining this??  So I was just like, "Uhhh....let you see?" and he was all, "Don't be shy."  Ok, so I was thinkin, heck I am not going to parade around in front of this guy so he can tell me if he likes the jeans on me...except that the only freakin mirror was outside the supid dressing room!  So, I go in there and within seconds he has three more pairs of jeans thrown over the door and he is talking to me through the door.  I am so uncomfortable.  I mean, talking to a guy while you are half-naked and changing is just....weird.  So yeah, he ends up giving me like 7 more pairs before my visit is over.  Anyway, I come out the first time and he is like, "Oh those look good, but are they too long?" and calls another of the workers over there and so they are both looking at my legs...jeans...whatever...and are like, "Well, what are the measurements?  We can go one smaller."  So the other guy is like "Well, turn around, the measurements are on the back of the jeans." and I am like are you kidding me!!!!  Luckily, I found the measurements on the front part of my jeans and read them to him.  hahahahaha.  I only tried on like two more pairs because I felt really bad that I was wasting all their time because there was no way I was ever going to buy their overpriced jeans.  He even got me a bunch of shirts to try on with the jeans!! I mean, seriously, it reminded me of shopping with my mom when I was a little kid and she would put more and more clothes over the door of my dressing room and be like, "Oh these would be cute on you!!"  Right, so anyways, I finally left and brought the seven pairs out of the dressing room and was like, "Umm...I think I will come back...Saturday....when I have more cash...." and he was all, "Oh well for only 20 dollars you can put two pairs of jeans on layaway and pay for them over an extended period of blah blah blah blah..." and I was like, "Well, the thing is...I am not sure that $50 is worth one pair of jeans.  (Major embarrassment for me right here, because he is just realizing that he wasted his selling skills on me).  He turned around to go do something, and I slipped out of the store before the situation became any more awkward.  I am not going back Saturday.  I hope to never return actually.  :)  Even if the guy was really good-looking.  Then I came home and my brother came in my room to use the phone.  If anyone ever wonders where I get my nerdness from, talk to him for like five minutes.  Phone convo. (Note: This Ryan is not the Ryan that I like)  "Hello, is Ryan there?" (long pause) "Hey, Ryan, this is Matt.  You wanna go to Best Buy with me?" (long pause) "For fun.  You know, just to hang out." LOL....ahhh  second instance of nerdness. ::In car.  System of a Down's Self Righteous Suicide is playing:: Matt (screaming): TRUST IN MY...hey, you know what?  I could play this on the trumpet.  ::Starts moving his fingers on an imaginary trumpet:: ::Lisa hits forehead:: Third Instance... ::Matt is looking for a computer desk for his new apartment:: Matt:  Well, I have got to test it out to make sure it will be ok.  ::Puts hands on imaginary keyboard and mouse, stares intently into imaginary computer screen, and makes explosion noises as if playing a game.::  yes, this will work nicely.  He is so funny.  We ended up going to Wal Mart to get a desk.  It was an adventure.  In other news, STUPID 24-SECOND BOY!!!!!!!  I don't even think I like him anymore because I never talk to him or see him.  But i dunno...the heart works in mysterious ways.  That is all.  I am getting the feeling lately that people are avoiding me.  Call it paranoia...  Ok i will.  bye  -Lisa

      Rarely does a movie really make me think.  And when I say really, that doesn't mean cry a little at the end and long for love, but I mean honestly and seriously challenge what I think and believe.  Tonight I bought tickets to see Seabiskit (I tried to spell that word like five times and could not think of how to spell it...must be the fatigue setting in), but we saw 28 Days Later.  Ok, so this is a British film apparently, enough said....Damn British...lol j/k.  First 30 minutes of movie:  Nude guy wakes up on hospital bed (we see  everything .  Ok, I am thinking, what is this?  porn or movie?!?!)  Luckily, guy gets dressed and looks around hospital.  Nobody is there.  It is eerily empty.  So this kinda creeps everybody in the audience out.  You know...ooo creepy, nobody is there.  5 Minutes later...still checking out empty hospital....maybe something scary will happen now.  5 Minutes later....Nope, still checking out hospital.  5 Minutes later...ooh he left he hospital.  Get ready for some action!  10 Minutes later...oh gee, look at that, the entire city is empty too.  And there has been ten minutes of footage of this guy walking around.  This must be an important part of the storyline.  Can't wait until it gets exciting.  5 Minutes later...it would seem that the movie people think that we (the audience) are too dense to grasp the concept of an entirely empty city.  15 Minutes later...Ok, I think we get the point people.  The city is deserted.  There are no people.  Yeah, I get it.  10 Minutes later....OMG something happened!  There is a car!!!  In the middle of this town square seemingly for no reason!!!  Formerly nude guy approaches car...oo this oughta be good...  5 seconds later...whoop-dee-doo....car alarm went off.  I am almost wetting my pants (sarcasticness).  This movie blows.  Ok, so maybe I exaggerate with how long this whole empty part took...but it felt that long!!!  Now, after this, it actually does get interesting.  And I won't ruin anything for you people who haven't seen it yet.  But this movie ranks as one of the top five strangest and twisted movies of all time.  It was not scary, just demented and disturbing.  And extremely so.  Example:  Background music is nice, soft-sounding Enya-like music.  Movie Scene:  ::scream::  Blood, guts, gun goes off, mass stabbings...."(expletive)!  (expletive)!  GET YOUR (expletive) (expletive) MOVING!!!!"  "GOD(expletive)IT!"  "OPEN THE (expletive) DOOR, MOTHER(expletives)!!!"  Nice, Enya-like music continues in the background....I mean.....What the (expletive) is that?!?!?!?!  One of these Classical music bloodbaths happens like three times.  But, ok, on to how it made me think (finally).  Basically, is there any hope at all for mankind?  Are we really as sick and twisted as this movie portrays us?  Is man's true nature that of violence, selfishness, lust, and domination?  Because really, this movie will scar you for life, and it will challenge what you think of man's inherent values.  Just when the survivors had thought they had found their salvation...it turned out to be their downfall.  Members of their own kind...turning against them...full of the urge to rape and murder...all when earth's entire civilization was in tatters because of people having no will to stop all of that.  Other things it made me think of too, but I do not want to write an entire essay on this movie, which is really no good.  There are parts in there that will haunt me for the rest of my life, just because of how sick and gory and whatnot it was.  Today I woke up at 7:55 (CRAP) and my tabc class started at 8:00....sooo, I am out the door by 8 and get there about ten minutes later.  Nobody really cared.  I looked like I just rolled out of bed, which I had.  So that was a loong four hours.  It was supposed to be five, but she went through it quite fast.  It was so super easy, I made like a 97 on the test to get my license.  So now I can legally sell alcohol to people 21 and over.  So then I went home and me and Fifer went thrift store shopping (one of the most entertaining things to do when you are bored) and she got a couple of t-shirts and I got seven books and a new purse/shoulder strap bag/whatever and wallet...it is so cool.  It has like three different openings to get inside of it so you can get what you want out of the top, bottom, or middle.  And it is really nifty looking.  The bag and wallet together were only $7 so it was an extremely good deal.  I was happy and still am.  Then me and Fifer drove around listening to some good ole Irish punk rock (Flogging Molly) (You rock too Fifer) and I unsuccessfully tried to do a jig and headbang while driving.  I almost rammed into the back of this one car...omg...soooo freakin scary.  I about had a heart attack.  But it was all good, because of my super braking skills, we stopped in time :).  Then we got slurpees and bought some hardcore edible slurpee straws.  And then I went home because my mom needed the car at 6:00.  JoAnn was online and invited me out to eat with her and her mom ( a long-standing tradition we have).  So I did that and then we decided to go to a movie.  We called Tiffany and invited her to come with us because she is one of the coolest people you will ever meet and we hadn't hung out all summer.  Then we saw 28 Days Later.  Hmm...already wrote about that experience.    Well, now I am tired and still debating as to whether or not I want to go paintballing in the morning.  But I guess I will since I already told Chris I would go.  I just hope he doesn't like me.  I hope he invited me as a friend only.  Because I do not feel like rejecting anybody right now.  -Lisa     You're Garnet from the Final Fantasy series.

      Yesterday and today I had to be up and out of the house early so I could get to the equestrian center on time.  Yesterday morning it was 9, today it was 8.  Whhhyyyyy do people insist on doing things so early in the morning during the summer time.  I really just want to sleep in until 10:00 or 10:30 one day this week.  But alas, I have a tabc class tomorrow morning for work at 8:00 AM which means I will have to get up at 7:00 because I actually want to get ready for this one.  For the equestrian center all I do is get out of bed, put on some clothes, and leave.  ahhhh.  Oh right, yesterday after I got back, I went swimming at our swimming pool, in which I had not yet swum (is swum a word?).  My younger brother was there with his new girlfriend, some tall skinny blonde who was actually pretty nice.  My mom went to...Kodak moment haha.  No, it was pretty relaxing.  I brought a book in the pool to read and my brother teased me about that, but it was all good.   Then I went and picked up my brother from work and then went to my dad's where I took a nap because I fell asleep watching my brothers play some video game.  Then I dropped off my lollapalooza money at Fifer's house and ended up staying there for a while, talking to people on the internet, pretending to be her.  Mua haha ha ahahaha.  Then she came back to my house and we hung out here for a while, burning CDs and talking and finding out that our tastes in music are really more different than we originally thought.  But it is ok because people are different, you know?  Anyway, then I fell asleep and woke up and went to the equestrian center.  After that, Jennifer called and I went to the mall with her.  I ended up spending about 35 dollars.  I bought a new CD (Wakefield...just your average punk band, but good) and a pair of really nifty shoes from Payless for 18 dollars.  Then I got some Dip n Dots.  So yeah then I came home and did nothing the entire day.  Except take a nap from like 3:00-7:00 which really was quite refreshing.  Jennifer got off of work at 10:00 and we went and played tennis at Stovall.  Afterwards, we were talking about her little thing she has going with the 31-year-old at work and she wanted to know why I thought it was a bad idea.  I was like, well, it is just extremely inappropriate for a 31-year-old to have a crush on a 16-year-old...I mean, if he had started early, he could very well be old enough to be your father.  She argued back with that it was society that said it was inappropriate but...I just think that this guy has got to be a lot immature to be liking her.  And he has kids.  Another big issue.  I told her that I just didn't think she should get involved with a guy that has kids already.  And she was like, "Whyyy?"  There is no getting through to her.  In the end, I just told her that dating this guy would be like giving up on her teenagerhood, her youth...whatever it is called.  She said she didn't care about that either.  She also said she is not going to go to UNT, but probably UTA.  When I accused her of wanting to stay because of a guy she got all huffy, but I really think that is why she wants to stay.  Crazy.  Run from this town and never return, that is my advice to anyone and it is what I am going to do.  I would never let emotions get in the way of me leaving this place and going to other places and seeing the world.  Anyway, there were also a lot of people playing volleyball there in large groups.  It looked so fun.  Sometimes I wish I had a group of friends that I could hang out with.  You know, like I call a couple people and they call a couple of people and pretty soon you got like 15 people meeting somewhere to just hang out.  I experienced that a little bit with the hardcore rockers at dreamworld earlier this summer, and it was awesome.  But only that once.    So, yeah, that is pretty much it.  I think I am going to go paintballing on Saturday.  Maybe.  Have not decided yet.  Oh yeah, one of my new favorite bands (I have like a zillion of them) is the early november.  the guy has a beautiful voice and it is just really good music.  -Lisa

      Found out that the member of the Starting Line I met was not the lead singer, but rather a guitar player who does not sing....but I am still in love with him. :) :).  I think it is funny how all the bands I like like the other bands that I like.  For example.  In Mae's "Summer" video, the drummer is wearing a Starting Line shirt.  At the concert, one of the starting line members was wearing a Something Corporate shirt.  So yeah...that is interesting.  Today I swam and hung out with Fifer for a while.  I don't really feel like blogging much, just had to say how the guy I met was a guitar player and not a lead singer...  -Lisa

      I finally finished sorting out all of my financial aid for this year.  It turns out that with both my grants and loans, my parents will not have to pay a dime.  My dad will be thrilled to hear this.  I will also be getting just a tad bit more than I need, so I will have some extra money for stuff like getting a yearbook, going on fieldtrips (if we have them ?) and the such.  So, this is relaxing to know.    Today was pretty cool.  I slept downstairs last night on the couch and my mother woke me up at around 9:00 and told me to go sleep in my room.  Unfortunately, when I got there, my brother was sleeping in my bed and so I did not get to sleep the extra hour I wanted to.  *Sigh* am so tired...really need to start going to bed earlier.  Anyway, so I just got on the internet and took a shower and got dressed and ready and then at around 12:30 went to Amy's house because she wanted to hang out with me today.  I just talked to her until around 1:45 when I had to go to my supplementary training class for work.  That was pretty boring except that I sat with this guy that works with me, Matthew, and we made fun of stuff the whole time...quietly of course.  There was this one part on the video we watched where they showed the cashier for like a second and all he said to the customer was, "Would you like some beans with that?"  For like...no reason at all!  Matthew and I just looked at each other and died laughing...it was silent laughter, but I was nearly crying :).  And what made it funnier was that NOBODY else even cracked a smile.  Ahh...it was quite funny.  After that, it was about 4:30 so I went back to Amy's house and then we went to Target so she could register for her baby shower gifts.  So they gave us a scanner to "tag" things.  She went all scanner-happy and scanned like over 100 things.  It was pretty funny.  It is still weird to me how she is pregnant....hmmm  Well, we got back to her house at like 6:00 and there was a bible study gonna happen there so I helped clean up and whatnot.  Leah came to it and I got to drive her home afterwards...that was super fun.  She is one of the coolest people.  She is so crazy, but her parents won't let her do anything because they are the pastor and pastor's wife and such...so she does stuff without their permission sometimes.  They have never let her go to a real concert, even though she would be crazy in a pit, so I told her that one day, when she finally has some freedom, her and I will go to a concert.  And then I mentioned how before the summer is over, I want to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show and she tells me that she wants to go too because she loved it when she went a while ago...so, we made plans to go sometime this summer.  I think it will be fun if me, Fifer, her, and Olivia all go.  If I can somehow work it out.  We also talked about how Bam Margera was beautiful and an excellent choice for a future husband :) :).  And how we are going to have a party at a red light.  After I dropped her off, I went back to Amy's and Mark (her dad) started recommending all these books to me because he knows I love to read, and so I ended up walking out of their house with five books, including biographies on Genghis Khan and Attila ("King of the Huns").  It should make for interesting reading.  I promised to hook him up with some Steinbeck and Hemingway the next time I saw him.  He told me this one story about Genghis Khan that I found extremely intriguing...in a healthy sick curiosity type way.  Apparently, in one of his attempts to conquer a group of people, good ole Genghis could not get into this fort some people were hiding in.  So, he waited until people from his army would die from the plague and catapult their bodies into the fort.  He did this one by one, until the plague had infected everyone in the fort, and they all died.  Genius borders on the line of insanity, eh?  Oh yeah, I cannot believe my freakin house did not burn down today.  I left my hair straightener on for a good 12 freakin hours.  Scared the hell outta me when I realized it was still on at midnight.  Gah...  Also, am starting a new acne treatment regimen today.  Is supposed to work quite nicely.  Only time will tell.  Well, that is all.  Had some nice homemade ice cream as well.  Good stuff it was.  Night.  -Lisa  Bands to check out:  Bottom Line Everydays Monday Don't Look Down  AWESOMENESS!!!

      Ahhh...the stuff that memories are made out of...  Friday I had a tennis tournament and that was ok, in spite of the fact that I lose two out of three matches, was extremely exhausted the whole time, and then locked my keys in my car afterwards.  Southlake is a good 30 minutes away from my house and not all that easy to find and my mom was not home so the only thing I could do was call a locksmith.  So that was $24 and an hour and a half of my life wasted away.  Oh well.  Then me and Fifer hung out for like the whole night.  Saw The Italian Job, got food, ate it, and talked.  It was cool.  I didn't get to bed until about 3:00 or later, I don't even remember.  But I had to wake up around...was it 8:30 or 9:30?  One of the two....felt like 8:30.  But it was worth it because I was so excited about Warped Tour.  It started at 11:30 and Olivia and I planned to leave at 10:30 giving us a good 30 minutes to spare when we got there.  Of course though, we did not leave at 10:30 as planned.  I got over to her house at 10:30 and then we had to go to Jennifer's house to get our tickets and leave her Olivia's cell number, and Wal-Mart to find some kind of a bag/purse to hold all of our stuff in, because neither of us wanted to bring a backpack (Oh, but we will next time we go to a concert, which might be in October...or sooner :) ).  I found one on sale for $5 and it looked to be quite perfect for the job.  Then we got McDonalds and then started out...at like...11:20.  Heh.  Then half way there I realized that I was below the empty line on the gas gauge and so we had to take this exit into Ghetto-Land and get some gas.  We got to Smirnoff around 12:00 and then waited in this long line until like 12:30 and then finally got in.  Of course, it didn't really matter that we had gotten there late because the first show wasn't even until like 1:00.  Anyway, we met up with Olivia's old friend from Texarkana, Brittany and then the concerts started...  1:00-The Starting Line...am sooo excited.  They get onstage and start the chords to one of their songs (GREAT song to start out the day with for me).  The music was amazing, the moshpit was awesome, and I cannot even describe concerts with adequate words so I won't try.  The last song they played was this one that is probably their most popular, even though I have never heard it on the radio or anything.  But at the end, there is this part that is like, "We will kiss, girrrrrrrrllllll." And like everyone sang it and it was acapella, and soooo freakin amazing.  So yeah, that mosh pit took a lot out of me so before the next set, I got some water and relaxed some and bought some t-shirts.  1:30- The Suicide Machines... Actually waited until about 2 songs into the set to join in, but once I did....this one competes with one other I was in for best moshing of the day.  Punks, generally speaking, are very anti-republican and anti-Bush.  It doesn't even matter if they are democratic or not, they are anti-Republicans.  So, the lead singer was like, "How many of you are registered to vote?" and like maybe a third of us have and so he is like, "Comeon!  I know there are enough punk rockers in the United States to vote GW out of the white house!!" and everyone goes crazy and he goes into his next song.  All of their music was incredibly awesome (of course)  2:00- Simple Plan... Actually did not go into this moshpit, as was looking around at the different booths and I didn't think theirs would be too great.  But I listened and they were good of course.  2:30- Mest Oh my God.  This was probably the best live show I have been to in....well, in ever, because I have never been to a live show like this before.  This one DEFINITELY wins best moshpit of the day and the music was awesome and the band was awesome and....wow.  That's all I can say.  Wow.  3:00-AFI Just listened to them because all of us had gotten separated and me, Jennifer, and Olivia were supposed to meet somewhere around 3:00 so.  I know Fifer will kill me because I did not go mosh with AFI because they are like, "the best punk band ever" or something...but, eh, I only know one of their songs anyway.  What I heard was excellent though.  4:00- The Ataris... Was actually kind of disappointed with the lack of good moshpit.  But they mostly played their new music which, although very good, is just a little too poppy for good moshing, you know what I mean?  But other than that, they were awesome.  Then I went right over the the other stage for...  4:30- The Used Wow.  This one was unbelievable.  The half-screaming, half-singingness was aboslutely amazing.  Awesome moshing...sooo fun.  The Used was one of my favorite bands before this, and they have now just climbed my favorite band scale.  At this point, we all met up at our meeting place because we were all separated again.  It was about 5:00 and no one was really playing until 6:00...well, no one we wanted to see anyway.  Olivia had seen Vendetta Red (playing at same time as The Used so I made my choice...and have no regrets...) and she met the guy again and got his autograph.  So since we had nothing to do, we relaxed because trust me, all this moshing in about 102 degree weather surrounded by other people...it makes you feel like you are going to pass out.  So we sat under these things that shot out water and drank nice cold water and then...we look over and the lead singer from Mest is just standing over by this fence!  So we all timidly go over there and Jennifer says hi first to kinda break the ice and then he was like, "Oh hey" and Brittany is all, "Can I take my picture with you?"  and he is like, "Sure."  and so she gets a picture with him...and then I do!!  It was so cool.    6:00- Dropkick Murphys From what I saw and heard, they were good.    7:00- Bowling For Soup... Not as fun as they were before, but still pretty fun.  They do this mix of covers and stuff...it is pretty funny.  Oh! and then there were some people surfing the crowd in between songs and so the lead singer was like, "We got some in-between song surfing!" and they started playing this song that went, "In between song surfing, in between song surfing..." it was soo funny!  Guess you would just have to be there.  7:30...Thrice We made our way over to the Thrice stage, stood there for about a minute until Olivia was like, "I don't really know any of their songs." and I was like, "Me neither." and so she was like, "Let's leave."  And we did.  Sore from head to toe, dead tired, and unbelievably happy and amazed at how incredibly awesome this day was.   But wait!  It is not over!  I wanted to buy a Starting Line poster so I could hang it in my dorm room come fall.  So I buy one and there is the lead singer of the starting line in his booth signing stuff for people!!!  And not many people know he is even there so it is just like me and a couple of other girls!!  ANYway, I asked him to sign my poster and he was sooo nice about it and he signed it and thanked me and smiled and I just fell in love....with this punk rock band guy that is amazingly nice, cute, and well....the lead singer to The Starting Line!!!!!!!!!!  sigh....they are sooo awesome.  Soooooooo awesome.   We smelled though.  Imagine the stench.  We smelled like a mixture of marijuana and sweat.  The sweat being only about 25% from us...lol.  It was so hot and everyone was sweaty and you are just so close to them when you are knocking them around in a pit or just jumping next to them.  Yeeah...so, you get the idea.  Probably the worst I have smelled....ever.  Then Olivia and I went home and got some food, ate, and went swimming around 10:30 for about an hour and then went back to her house where we just hung out until like 12:30 and went to sleep.  My body is sooo sore, but it is worth it.  It is worth it soo much.  That was the most fun I have probably had in my entire life.  Besides Edge Fest, Edge Fest was awesome too...as awesome as this?  I don't know...But probably not.  Well, I have to go now.  Responsibility calls once again.   Lisa

      So I took this test today on this website designed to find you other people that share the same personality type as you or whatnot.  It was called the aeananasumthingram...i don't even remember what it was called.  Anyway, it told me I was extroverted, decisive, and organized.  So I tried again.  I only changed like three answers but all of a sudden I was not so extroverted and not necessarily organized.  So then I used that information to search for the livejournals and blogs of people like me.  Apparently people like me are depressed and alcoholic.  Interesting I think, since I suffer from neither depression or alcoholism :).  Today all I did was work, help out with tennis camp, and volunteer at the horse place.  It was a very busy and full day, if only routine.  I had fun at the equestrian center.  I was talking to Aimee (girl from Summit that volunteers there) and she was telling me how next week she is gonna go on like a four day long trip with the newspaper staff cuz she will be a staff writer next year and so of course, Ryan is going.  And I was just thinking about how if it weren't for tams, i'd be going to that thing....*sigh* oh well :).  TAMS is like a two-year-long camp, right?  :) :).  Work was soooooo boring.  I just wanted to come home the whole time.  Tomorrow is payday.  Yay.  So today I was thinking about why do I think the things I think?  Like when I eat homemade blue bell vanilla ice cream, why does my brain tell my tongue that it is deliciously creamy and...delicious?  And why does my brain tell my tongue that whipped cream is the devil when in reality it is not that far from vanilla ice cream?  And whoever decided that pain was a bad thing?  Pain is merely what your brain tells your nerves to feel, so why does your brain think it has to be bad?  Why are our perceptions on these matters the way that they are?  Why does it bother me when the two stacks of hand held baskets at work are uneven?  Why does it bother me when one bag is fuller than the other?  Do I think that the emptier bag is more lonely?  In the end, I end up using the same amount of bags anyway, so why does it matter to me so much that the bags have equal amounts of groceries in them???  Or like when you hurt one leg, you feel that the other leg is jealous of the other leg so you have to hurt your other leg too so that they are equal.  And it REALLY bothers me that my eyes have different seeing abilities.  One is at like -5 and one is like at a -4.5 (this is contact prescription talk here if you don't understand it).  WHY ARE MY EYES UNEVEN???  IS MY LEFT EYE JEALOUS OF MY RIGHT EYE?  DOES IT SIT IN THE DARK AT NIGHT PONDERING SUICIDE BECAUSE MY RIGHT EYE WAS BORN WITH BETTER VISION??????  Why the hell should an eye have to live with a burden like that?  Now, I feel sorry for my left eye.  And it sucks for my left eye more than it does the emptier bag of groceries because I can even out the grocery bags but I can't do diddly squat for my left eye.  Except for maybe stab my right eye out with a stick.  But that would make my right eye worse than my left eye so I would feel sorry for it.  AND it would cause pain, which my brain perceives to be bad, much to my dismay and bewilderment.  You know what, I do not understand relationships.  Say in a hypothetical situation you have an awesome relationship with a guy at school, just a friend or whatnot but you can have awesome conversations with him.  Deep, philosophical, but also funny and easygoing.  Then summer comes and you do not talk to this guy for like a month.  Then, when you finally talk to him again it is like the magic is gone.  You just don't get along with him like you used to.  And this saddens you. Why did the relationship go sour?  Can a month really change people that much?  Well, I guess just look at me and how I have changed so much this past six or so months.  A year ago, I was a completely different person.  I rather prefer the person I am now.  Much more open-minded I am.  Change is an interesting thing.  We dread it, and yet, without it, life would be terribly dull.  I mean, I love summer and wish it would last forever, but if summer lasted forever it would lose its appeal, its ability to seem magical and free.  Infinite....  Ever since I brought up that word with Fifer I have been thinking about it a lot, what it means to be infinite.  It is the feeling you get listening to an acoustic guitar while driving into the sunset....it is sitting in a group of your favorite friends talking under the stars...it is laying down in the middle of a field and looking up at the sky for an hour...its hanging out with people and listening to music...its laughing while completely forgetting that a grim reality awaits you when the laughter is over.  It's everything that the good stuff in life is made out of.  That is what feeling infinite really means.  Our childhood is infinite....our teenagerhood is infinite.  While we may grow older and die, it will never fade away.  It will live in our minds as the best years of our lives.  And that is what it truly is.    It is time for bed now.  I downloaded much good music today.  I am only to the fs though.  Tomorrow I will get further.   Goodnight, goodnight.  Sleep well and when you dream, dream of me. (West Side Story)  -Lisa

      Okkkk so.... one of my friends that works with me has a crush on another guy that works with us.  The only problem is that he is 30-years-old.  And she is 16.  No, but wait.  You haven't heard the best part.  The sick part is that he also likes her.  And they both have told each other and have admitted they want to date each other.  AND she is stupid because she is like, "I don't care that we are 14 years apart.  But its illegal so we really cannot do much about it."  I am just like...gah, yall are freakin retarded.  And then she asks me how to stop liking him, and she is all, "I need your advice!"  I just looked at her and was like, "You want MY advice on how to stop liking a guy?!?!  Are you crazy?"  I mean, comeon now, since when have I pretended to know anything about how to get over a guy.  It takes me months and months.  So anyway  This morning I helped out with Summit's summer tennis camp.  This week it is for kids from like 5th grade to 8th grade.  It was pretty fun.  I actually felt really good at tennis compared to these kids.  Heh.  And they are really sweet.  Coach is being really nice too.  And Nick, Nick, and John were being really cool.  I am gonna miss being on the tennis team as well.... :(  I am gonna miss everything goshdarnit!  Oh, and today, I flirted a lot with that guy at work, Daniel.  He is so funny, it cracks me up.  And he is really nice, to me anyway.  When I say really off-the-wall stuff like.... you have a dining room and I don't so I am going to egg your house, he just smiles and laughs and you know, says something to contradict or challenge my weird thinking.  I love it. :)  Of course, this is just a flirting thing, and it is not like I am leading him on or anything.  At least, I hope I am not....  So that is it.  Tennis camp, home, shower, worked for eight hours...that's about it.  I'm off.  Toodles.  (hehe I said toodles)  -Lisa

      I just got back from hanging out with Ashley and JoAnn (my drill team buddies).  I went to Six Flags with Ashley around 4:30 or so and then went back to hang out with JoAnn but then JoAnn had gone to some guy's house so we went to Ashley's house and then JoAnn gets home so we go back over there but then my mom calls and says that I have to pick my brother and his friend up from Hurricane Harbor now and so I go and do that and they want to go to some place to get applications and all they know about how to get there is "it's off I-30" so I try to go down that for a while and we don't spot anything so we go down the other way for a while and still don't spot anything so we ask for firections and the freakin thing is at Hurricane Harbor but THEN HH is closed for the day.  So I spent two hours on the road.  Accompanied with good music, of course, thanks to my adapter :) :).    Spending the day with Ashley was fun, but kinda weird.  We've been friends since the 3rd grade and were best friends in 5th/6th grade, but then started not talking to each other so much.  The only reason we started talking this year was because we had history class together.  So at first, it was awkward trying to make conversation with her but after a while, it was cool.  We talked about many things...and brought up our...interesting...past a couple of times.  I was like, "Ok, remember that time that I spent the night at your house the day I started going out with AJ?" and then she'd think for a couple of seconds and come to a realization of what I was talking about and go "Ohhh yeah....heh.  We were pretty stupid.  Can't believe we did that."  It is nice to have someone that you have history with.  It gives you a sense of your past and where you came from.  Hmm...  Well, that is all I really have to type about.  Maybe I would have more, but I am just soo extremely tired and I have a lot to do this week.  I work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  I am helping out with tennis camp those days also and Friday I have another tennis tournament.  And then Saturday is....WARPED TOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am just a bit excited.  I wish I could get online at earlier hours though.  I miss talking to certain people whose parents make him....i mean, him or her...get off at like 10:30.  I didn't get home tonight until like 12:30 cuz we were talking and laughing and whatnot at JoAnn's house.  She is so crazy.  I read Fifer's blog and then she said something about me missing my precious ryan-san....and it is true, I rarely get to talk to him on the internet because I wait so freakin late to get on. :(.  Oh well.  Well, I guess I should email her now...Fifer I mean, because apparently, she has been trying to get ahold of me all day.  heh.    -Lisa

      If I could express my emotions entirely in song or verse, I would do so.  The most amazing feeling in the world is hearing a song, or a line of a poem, or even just a sentence from a story and thinking  That's it.  That is EXACTLY how I feel.  I could not have expressed it better myself.   But, I do not think I am talented in the area of poetry or song writing.  I think it is because I think too much about it.  The best poetry comes when you just write without thinking, and let your thoughts speak for themselves without having your mind censor what you say.  And I wonder where these dreams go When the world gets in your way What’s the point in all this screaming No one’s listening anyway -Acoustic #3, the goo goo dolls  I have fallen in love with this band the past couple of days.  It's like acoustic guitar and emotion.  I love it.  Anyway...  I had this beautiful, thoughtful, inspirational blog typed out but then my internet went all gay so I lost it.  I really don't feel like writing it all out right now so I will do an abbreviated version.  Wednesday- Thrift Store Shopping with Naomi, Work  Thursday- Activated debit card, got PIN number, deposited $190, talked to Amy for like two hours, went to see Pirates of the Carribbean with Olivia and JoAnn, drove around for a while, went and played basketball at Stovall at like 11:00, met three guys who we played three-on-three with, Jonathan met us up there, we hung out with him for a while, he cracked me up....went back to house  Today- Ok, this is where I pick back up normal because I had not typed today out yet.  I got about three and a half hours of sleep and woke up at 6:30 because Olivia and I had to go to our tennis tournament.  We got there ok, but then got lost in the parking lot :) :) but we kept driving by the swimming pool to watch the uhh...lifegu...I mean, cool slides they had...  First match I played like crap (naturally) and the second match was pretty much crap too.  The third match is when I really started actually playing.  I lost the first 5-8 and won my second two to get consolation again.  Olivia got 1st place.  So we dominated.  :)  I have so much fun with her.  We laugh so much and can talk about serious things too.  It's cool having a friend like her.  Got home and was bored...did not have stable internet connection as internet is gay.  So Fifer called me and I told her to come over to my house and hang out with me so she did and just watched TV but then my mom got back with the car so we went to CD Warehouse and I got two cds, one of which was a single but I didn't know that until after I bought it.  Ohhhh well.  Yeah, then we went to the mall and to best buy where I got an adapter for my mom's car so I can listen to CDs in the car now because... "its plain to see that the radio still sucks" (theres my life in lyrics again).  Sooo that was all fun and then we went and ate at Wholesome IHOP.  There was this guy there that I knew and he ended up being our waiter.  It was fun.  At one point he just randomly went, "Hey, is that your parking job out there?"  Me and Fifer look and burst out laughing because I had parked like on the line between two parking spaces and it was just hilarious because I suck at parking and we hadn't even realized we had done it.  Good times, good times...then more driving, more music, and then more movie watching at my house, and then I drove Fifer home and then my internet pissed me off.  I really do not feel like elaborating on much tonight.  Am thinking much tho.  Much more than usual.  Well, I have got to go and finish chatting with my internet buddies.  Tonight I'm tangled in a blanket of clouds Dreaming about you. -Foo Fighters  -Lisa  PS- I got a commenting system!!

      Have decided that room is being overrun by ants...probably from outerspace as would explain the giantness of them and the way they attack me everywhere in my room.  And some other stuff from my past....  Other than that, nothing is new...             PSYCHE!!  I woke up today and called Olivia because we had planned to do something today so I could be rescued from the inevitable boredom of having nothing to do.  So I call her and she says she'll call me back so i then go upstairs and get online.  And then, after a while, who else gets on but J-chan!  So I talked to him for a bit, because he is a really interesting person, and while I am in the midst of a highly intelligent conversation (umm just go along with it), Olivia calls and asks me to go play tennis with her.  And this guy named Patrick.  And Ryan.    Fifer is right.  In her geniosity, she has developed a theory that maintains that if you believe that you will never see the guy/girl of your dreams ever again, you will, inevitably, see them unexpectedly before long.  This has been tested and proved.  QED.  Lmao...  ANYway, so then I kinda started freaking out, because although I had decided not to like him, that was a bunch of crap that I told myself so that I would not be so...insane.  So, I turned to J-chan for advice, and he gave me some that helped me calm down and see that this was really not a big deal, which it wasn't.  But, as I have written before, I tend to make a big deal out of things that are not.  Big deals I mean.  So, I calmed down and continued talking to him for a while and learned that he is at the top of his class, literally.  I didn't know that, and apparently Fifer did not either.  I guess he just never talks about it...which shows great humility...hmm...well, anyway, on with my day.  So, I get ready and then go to Olivia's and pick her up and we make our way to Stovall, because like, all the really cool tennis players play tennis there. :) Oh, and that thing happened again.  The thing that happened with Craig, remember...where he knew me but I had no clue who he was.  Well, so, this guy I met named Patrick, who was funny and kinda cute....Olivia was like, "This is Lisa," and he was like, "Oh yeah, I know her." and so I naturally was quite confused and he was just like, "Oh, I've seen you around and I've seen your picture somewhere before."  So I asked him where he had seen my picture and then...hehe...Ryan goes, "In my wallet."  hehehe....he was kidding, of course...:)   So, yeah, we played tennis, and it was really fun.  Ryan was kinda good.  Patrick was horrible, but it was funny.  He had never played before.  Patrick had to leave at like 3:30 cuz he had to work at 4:00 so then it was just Olivia, me, and Ryan.  We played tennis for a while, and then we played basketball...well, I attempted to anyway, but since I have a major lacking in the hand-eye coordination department, maybe not so much.  That was fun.  All we did was shoot (or try to shoot) baskets and talk.  Then these guys were playing a game of basketball on the other court and trying to look all cool so I told Ryan he should go and show them what was up so he went and played a game with them.  Me and Olivia watched.  They all had their shirts off ;) so we discussed in a very logical and organized manner which of them had the best body.  We decided that it was between Ryan and Nice Pectoral guy in the blue shorts.  Nice Pectoral guy won though because he was really tan and Ryan is just...WHITE beyond belief...lol.  So after that, I took Ryan home (he lives in a yellow house btw, it is quite amusing...) and went back to Olivia's for a bit and then left there and went to the mall by myself because I needed to buy a tank top and...some other stuff...but uh, a guy reads this sometimes so I won't go into details on the other things I bought.  It was nice just being there by myself.  I got to go into the book store and look around for ages because I did not have anyone with me saying "Ok Lisa, we've been in the book store for 45 minutes now.  It is time to leave." and I never really get to do any real shopping when I am with a group of people.  I got to think a lot too, about many different things.  Mostly how I am gonna miss everyone and everything when I go to TAMS.  I am starting to have second thoughts....but I musn't.  *Sigh*  It is just that...I listen to people like Jill and Rachel talk about everything they are going to do with their Junior year...and I won't be there with them.  Oh well.  I am sure it will all make up for itself in the end.  On the way home, I was at a red light, looking at the sunset, and the sky was just gorgeous.  The clouds were mixed with a dark and pastel blue that when put together just took my breath away.  And then, at that very moment, "Name" by the goo goo dolls started playing.  That song is so beautiful.  And the lyrics...the lyrics were amazing.  The red light seemed to last forever and the sunset with that song playing was so...perfect.  I don't even know how to describe it.  It was like everything I had been thinking about resolved itself, and I was at peace with everything.  It was an amazing feeling...  Home:  I ate chalupas and then got on the internet only to talk to Ryan for a long time again.  This time we had things to say to each other.  And when he left he said, "See you later.  Had fun today."  and I was like, "Yeah me too." and then he said goodnight, and i said goodnight...and, as I said to Fifer earlier today, I think my crush just went up a few points...because it was so fun just hanging out with him today.  I have no idea how he feels, but it is nice just being friends with him, if nothing else.  I am content with that.  Well, I am off.  So much thinking and reading to do, so little time.  And even though the moment passed me by I still can’t turn away I saw the dreams you never thought you’d lose tossed along the way Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away  And now we’re grown up orphans that never knew their names Don’t belong to no one that’s a shame You could hide beside me maybe for a while And I won’t tell no one your name I won’t tell em’ your name  Scars are souvenirs you never lose , the past is never far Did you lose yourself somewhere out there , did you get to be a star Don’t it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are  You grew up way too fast and now there’s nothing to believe And reruns all become our history A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio And I won’t tell no one your name I won’t tell em’ your name  I think about you all the time But I don’t need the same it’s lonely where you are come back down, And I won’t tell em your name -"Name", the goo goo dolls  -Lisa

      Today, today, today...  Hmm...went to OVERPRICED Barnes and Noble, then resorted to buying frappucino and giant, delicious to point of dying happy sugar cookie, and then made my way over to the cheaper, more comfortable Half-Price Book Store...all of this with Fifer, of course...showing me the ropes and whatnot of Half Price and teaching me how to judge a book by its cover...lol...so that was like an hour or so of her showing me how uninformed and unexposed to American underground/nerd culture I am and me trying to find books that Half Price does not sell.  I ended up buying two books...forgot titles....hmmm  Then we went back to my house with my theatre-like living room (ha) and watched SLC Punk...very interesting movie.  It used humor to show how a life of "anarchy" and partying and drugs is pointless and not very smart.  Even though it was mainly a comedy, there were some deeper messages in there I think.  VERY funny tho.  Ahhh lmao..."One time, when he was drunk, he decided that all the cars on his block would look better without windows..."  ::nerd guy starts bashing out windows with baseball bat:: hehehehehehehe....good times, good times...yeah, so I was late for work about 15 minutes because I wanted to watch it all, but it was worth the $1.50 or so that I lost... :)  It taught me the meaning of being HARDCORE...heh.  Then Fifer went home and was attacked by neurotic bird.  And I went to work...hehe, work was sooo fun today.  There is this guy, Daniel...I've mentioned him before (the grape-thrower)...anyway, he is so funny and I kinda liked him a bit so today I started bagging for him like most of the day and we flirted A LOT.  It was super fun....hehehe....he has a cute smile I think.  I mean, you know, it's not like I have a full-blown crush on him or anything, but it sure is fun talking to him and working with him....speaking of flirting, btw, I think that I have developed a liking for it.  I flirt with pretty much all the guys at work now :).  Harmlessly, of course, just in stupid ways...like making corny jokes and whatnot...but it is fun.  Lessee....Daniel, Jonathan, Eric, and Jason...yup, those are the main ones that I like to flirt with...cuz they are funny...or interesting.  Whatever, the point is...I don't see why I didn't see the fun in this before!  Heh, of course me flirting is probably nothing like other girls flirting...I'm all nerdy-like and whatnot...but its all good.  Oh yeah, I also got to start checking (cashiering) for like an hour and a half to get practice because I start next week :) :).  I am moving up on the Kroger ladder.  Last night I passed the test and today I pretty much finished training.  I think I got most of it down.  Jason and Jonathan trained me :) :).    So, yeah, work was fun...I also made friends with all the girls btw, I am not just boy-crazy.  Joseph, the guy that is gay, is really nice to me also.  Man, I love everyone at work now.  It is gonna suck having to leave in August :(.  Well, I am off.  Not much new as you can probably tell.  -Lisa

      I love the way that time at my grandmother's house seems to almost stop.  I spend a day there and it feels like its been a week...but in a good way...not like how a four hour detention feels like eight.  I wish I could record the conversations that go on there.  My family is so weird!  I am the normal one there, which may be because I do not say much, but even if I did...I'd have some pretty tough competition.  LoL, my aunt and Paw Paw cussed each other out spelling it out because my aunt's three-year-old daughter was right there.  It was like "B-I-T-E me!" and he was like  "B-I-T-C-H you!" They were kidding, but it was very funny.  Kayla, my three-year-old cousin spent Friday morning running around yelling, "I'm butt naked!" (which she was).  Cody, her 7-year-old brother, went around swearing at everyone and telling his mom how he peeked in on her and dad when they would go in their room to "talk."  Sooo weird, I am telling you.  My Nanny (grandmother) let me drive her car home from the grocery store.  I was in shock.  I was like, "You're not going to let me drive your car home." and she was like, "You want to?" and I was like, "You won't let me." and then she threw me the keys.  It is a very nice car AND it was raining.  And it amazes me how every relative has the EXACT same questions to ask me. "Lisa!  Have you lost weight?" "So, Lisa, tell me about this college thing." "You're so pretty!  You must have a boy at home. Do you have a boyfriend?!" "Haha, this book is named  The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide .  Hey, you are not planning on hitchhiking anytime soon are you?" and then questions about Amy's pregnancy and when she is due.  After a while I resorted to shaking my head to the yes-no questions and giving a one-sentence explanation about TAMS.  The highlight of my day came when I got to take my little cousins to the movies.  Cody, 7...Everett, 12...and Elizabeth, 15 (who might as well be an 11-year-old because that is how she acts).  We actually just met Elizabeth there.  We saw Sinbad because I did not feel like sitting through Finding Nemo again and that was the only other one rated low enough for Cody.  I was expecting it to suck (as was everyone else there, including Cody, but we couldn't do much about it.  I think Elizabeth maybe wasn't expecting it to suck but ANYway) but it actually surprised me.  I love stories of redemption and finding out that you can be more than you expect from yourself.  Sinbad ultimately has a choice to make in the end.  Run away and live in paradise, allowing Noble Prodius, his childhood best friend, to die, or return to the city himself, which would mean forfeiting his own life.  He has been repeatedly told throughout the movie that he has no heart and that he cannot overcome what he inherently is...but he overcomes what he is told and returns to allow Noble Prodius (noble isn't actually a part of his name, but whenever I refer to him in my mind, I always say Noble Prodius because he was...very noble that is) to live.  And even though the love story was kind of corny and rushed, it was important just the same, and made me wish for that kind of love all over again...*sigh* but then, every movie does that for me just about.  So, yeah, after that, we went back to the house and ate a big 4th of July dinner (hamburgers, sausages on a stick, and potato chips) and played some of our traditional Family Bingo with prizes from the local Dollar Tree.  Then we all went out to one of my cousin's house and shot off many, many fireworks.  I insisted on using the lighter instead of the little stick that is meant for lighting fireworks (the name of it just escaped my mind...) so the tips of my fingers hurt a bit from being burnt so much :) but it is all good.  I am supposed to go shoot some more off tonight after work with Naomi.  So, that will probably be around 11:00.    Ha, and I listened to some of Jeff Foxworthy's "You might be a redneck if..."  A good number of them actually applied to my family (we're country folk) :)...so, that is all.  I enjoyed being around my family, although I think they think I am too quiet...but oh well. I've got work today 2-10...  Ohhh I almost forgot.  Darn you Sarah for making me rethink my decision!!! "Haven't you ever heard the phrase "Opposites attract"? Come on, I KNOW you have......so what if you have nothing in common.....so what if you think you have nothing to talk about......lately, Paul and I have had nothing to talk about online, what does that mean? And since you think you are so non-commonly compatible (um...something like that), why not talk about the different things that interest each of you. Find out about some of these differences. You give up too easliy....lol. J/K If you really wanna forget about him, by all means go for it. Work on getting used to forgetting about guys. I'm sure this skill will be plenty useful later. ;)"  Yes, I am sure this skill would be useful later, if it were possible for me to learn it.  Hmmm...yes, opposites attract, maybe...I wouldn't really know.  Oh well...I guess I will just see what happens, but I am definitely not worrying about him anymore.  If anything is going to happen, it is completely up to him from now on.  Yeah, I do give up too easily, I should probably work on not doing that...hmmm well, this really is it.   -Lisa "In the hands of an expert, a good knife has 1001 uses."

      Ok, this is my second post today, but I feel as if it is necessary I get this off my chest.  I am forgetting about him!  That's it!  It is over!  I am not gonna like Ryan anymore!  Now, you might be thinking something to the effect of  What the (insert word you would use)?!?!?!  You are a spaz!!  How can you like him one day and then the next decide you want to forget about him?  What happened?   Well, let me explain.  Today I began reviewing the facts in my mind.  And reviewing fact after another, two things became blatantly clear. 1)  We have little to nothing in common. 2)  Even if by some miracle, we ended up dating, we would never get along in a relationship of that kind.  I mean, upon first glance, it may seem as if we have lots in common...we both love writing and academic competitions...we are both in the NHS, we are both aquariuses (don't ask).  But really, beyond the academic stuff, we are nothing alike and we work on different levels.  My sense of humor is more...quirky and random-like while his is more the kind of humor you would find on say...that one TV channel that is meant for guys.  Which is nothing bad, I think it is very funny...but I do not believe he finds mine very amusing.  Another difference would have to be how he has girls all over him, and he probably enjoys being all over girls, and I am just not like that with guys.  I don't think that we would get along in this respect.  I don't know...I guess I realized this today when I tried to hold a conversation with him online and we really just had nothing to say to one another.  Just like when we saw each other in person.  We have nothing to say to one another because I don't think we click like that.  Furthermore, I am so much more of a nerd than him...he wouldn't stay with me for very long even if we did ever get together.  What is the point of holding onto a crush that is utterly pointless?  I don't know why I didn't just give up on the idea altogether a long time ago.  I realized these same things on the NHS fieldtrip and I just ignored them.  So, thanks to myself, Dunja, and Something Corporate for inspiring me to let go of the crush.  It is time I started moving on anyway, since in the fall I will probably never see him again as I will be living in Denton.  Yay!  Well, this is all I have to say.  Must go now.  Goodbye.  -Lisa

      "Probably not so possible nowadays, but still worth a try, is to go out and purchase a garden bench. It can then be carried to the local park where you and a friend can perch comfortably until a policeman passes by. Take the opportunity to pick up the bench and run out of the park with it. You will almost certainly be chased by the policeman. When he catches you, you can protest your innocence and produce the receipt for it. If this is carried out enough times then eventually you will not be chased and every park bench will be yours to take, as they will think that you have got a receipt.."  Hehe.  Yesterday, I woke up and went to the Equestrian Center.  For the 11:00 class I sidewalk for a boy named Christopher, who really cannot communicate much at all with anyone and who cannot really do much of anything.  After the class was over, I asked his mom how old he was.  17.  He was seventeen years old.  I don't know why, but that just blew my mind.  Probably I had always just assumed he was like 11 or 12 years old and he can't do anything for himself.  It was just weird, that's all.  Well, after I got home, Jennifer was already there burning cds on my computer.  She had apparently gotten there when no one else was home and just let herself in (because we don't lock our doors) and just got on my computer...then I called Fifer and invited her over to hang out because I hadn't seen her in like two weeks because she went to San Antonio and FORGOT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT :) .  But it's all good.  That was fun.  We watched a movie and ate macaroni and cheese, and talked about...Craig and Ryan...hahaha....we could go on double dates....writing news articles and BUILDING ROBOTS!!!!!!!!  Yes!  Haha.  They are good friends, and we are good friends.  We just need the hookup...ANYway...  So, Jennifer just stayed up in my room the entire time on my computer, which really really annoyed me because what is the point of going over to someone's house if you don't hang out with them???  Well, I had to go see Olivia around 4:00 to see what our plans were so then they both left my house while I took a shower.  In the shower, there is an ant that is like 3/4 of an inch long.  It was crazy...I took one of my old razors and killed it so it would not eat me alive, like the roaches in my dreams...  So I go up to Bowen, find out that our movie does not start until 9:50, and that I am not meeting Olivia at her house until 6:30 or so.  Then since I do not want to go home, I drive to Naomi's house because she called me earlier and I had not seen her since the TAMS orientation.  So we went out and got Chinese food.  That was pretty good...I like Chinese food.  We talked a lot.  It was cool.  I was with her until about 7:00 when I made my way over to Olivia's.  Over there I ate a brownie, played tetherball (and won :) ), and talked to people on the internet.  I accidentally left my nametag in Alex's car on Friday night.  Oops.  :)  We left there around 9:00 and met everyone at the theatres around 9:30 (everyone consisting of three guys that work with Olivia- Mike, Mike, and Stephen).  We saw Legally Blonde 2, which really was a let-down even though it had some funny parts.  So after that, we went and tried to play tennis at like midnight, but midnight is when Stovall closes so that didn't happen.  Soooo we just got some Taco Bell and came home and watched some more movies (that is like four in a day for me...crazy..)  We watched 8 Mile (it was ok...) and Jackass (HILARIOUS and shocking).  It was great fun.  Great, great fun...hmmm...well, that is all.  We were up until 4:00 which I haven't done all summer, and I woke up at 10:00 so I am kinda tired I guess but oh well.  I am about to go spend some quality time at the g-rents for the 4th of July...  -Lisa  PS- In my past life, I was a transvestite monk who was both gay AND lesbian... You can't beat that!!

      So the past couple of days have been uneventful.  I have worked for 16 hours, slept for 16 hours, so that leaves...16 hours unaccounted for....hmm that was probably spent by me in the shower...or eating...or watching a movie...or being on the internet....yep, that about covers it all.  I work too much.  Last night JoAnn came over at like 11 and we burned some of each other's cds.  I got Finch and Simple Plan.  When she comes back from her drill team officer camp, I will burn Nirvana, Audioslave, Trapt, Breaking Benjamin, and another one I forgot the name of...yes, they will be great additions to my already great musical collection.  Oh, and Fifer is gonna burn me Taking Back Sunday, cuz even tho I know some of their songs, I have not heard their cd.  Oh, JoAnn told me about some stuff her, Naomi, and Bethany did the other day.  They are really weird in some not-so-good ways sometimes...I'll leave it at that.  So, yeah, that is pretty much it.  Work is pretty...boring...and slow...there is this one guy that keeps treating me like he is my baby-sitter or something in that he acts like my mom...I used to think it was flirtatiousness but now I see that he sees me as a little girl or something which really irks me because he is only a year older than me.  Today he thought I had cussed or something and he was like, "Oh, I thought you said some very, very bad words!  I was about to tell you to watch your mouth!"  I was like, "Umm...ok...."  No one else treats me like that, just him.  And it isn't like he said that because he has something against cussing, because I have heard him use some very colorful language himself before.  Grr...and so what if I want to...it's not like there were any customers around...geez, I hate it when people that are not my elders pretend to be.  Daniel still cracks me up.  He throws grapes at people and then denies it in an indignant way...that guy is great.  Oh, and Matt came up there to see me tonight.  I only know him from English class but he is pretty cool.  It is weird how he remembered where I work.  Gosh, see how boring things get around here.  Ok, I am going to stop writing now.  Wish that someone interesting would get online...like...anyone because no one is on right now...*sigh*  Good night  -Lisa

      Tonight's concert was great.  Great bands, good music, much craziness.  Everything  you could ask for in a concert.  Only a little moshing, at least for me.  Because I didn't want to mosh with the little 14-year-old friends of Restricted and then I realized I had flipflops on so that kinda "restricted" (hahha I am ever so clever) what all I could do.  I eventually disregarded that though.  Lessee...The Euphony...I really, really liked them.  They were good.  And the bassist...well, let's just say he reminded Jennifer and I of Halston.  I should hope that by now you know what that implies. :p Anyway...yes, yes, very good...I really liked them.  But I think I already mentioned that.  Josh something or another...too lazy to look up his name.  He had a really pretty voice and like a combed over mohawk...or was that just his band member?  Hmm I dun remember.  Oh well.  Yeah, they had some pretty weird instruments in that one.  Restricted.  Awesome.  Very, very awesome.  ESPECIALLY for being as young as they were.  They were all 15 (or about to be) and that is just crazy-like.  They sounded like they had played together for quite some time and they were the first band to get the audience into it.  But WoW, were they ever awesome.  I consider myself a fan.  Clover St....ahhh...They have gotten so much better than last time and last time they ROCKED so what did they do this time??!?!?!  ROCKED HARDER!!!  Hehe.  Yes.  It was so much fun.  Got into the moshpit a little bit.  Towards the end was really into it and lost one of my flipflops so I had to just go without it until the end of the song.  I found it though :) :)!  They were so much fun.  Why did they not have any CDs to buy?!?!?!  The world will never know.  Hmm...the ride home was interesting.  Jennifer makes Hannibal seem sane.  I ended up chasing her with my car down the street and telling her to get in the car but she wouldn't...so after like five minutes I turned around and started leaving but then she was like, "Noooo!  Don't leave me!!" so I, being the good friend I am, went back and got her.   Then I dropped Fifer off and then me and Jenn went and bought tickets to The Starting Line's concert.  That is Sep. 19th.  Can't wait!  Will be so much hardcore fun.  I had some chicken nuggets for dinner after I took Jennifer home.   That is all.  -Lisa   PS- For pictures, redirect yourself here (It's Fifer's thing, so her comments...) http://www.angelfire.com/nm/fiferland/083003/index.html

      Hahahahahahahaahaha last night was so fun and +ny.  Fifer and I laugh so hard sometimes that I think I burn more calories with her than I do working out at the gym.    If you really want to flirt with a guy, just act like a retarded kangaroo!! ::hops around in retarded kangaroo form::  Or um...my hypothetical, nonexistant, hot, passionate make-out sessions with um...people.  And of course, who could forget the familial, platonic muscle feeling?!?!?!?!?!!  JUST FEEL HIS MUSCLES, GAH!!!!!  Umm...  I think I am crazy.  Of course, Fifer doesn't help any with her unsaneness and all.  So I got home yesterday and then called Fifer and after dropping off my brother at the Summit football game, I went to her house and we ate dinner and talked/laughed our asses off a lot.  And then we went to Kroger so I could say hi to Jennifer and she totally freaked out.  I was like, "Yeah, I need some Marlboro Light 100s" and showed her my college ID.  It was pretty funny.  No, I don't smoke...I was just being stupid.  So, she said to come back at like 11:30.  Sooo then we went to pick up my little brother but uh.....was distracted...by sprinkler systems....mua hahahahahahahahahhaa.  Got there though and picked up him and his friend.  By this time I was feeling particularly hyper and crazy so I think I kinda scared his friend.  I was all, "Hey!  Are yall HOT???" and they were like, "Yeah, I guess..." and so I was like, "::evil laugh:: Roll down your windows!!!" and then we made another cameo at the sprinkler system party.  :) :) Brian was all, "Mom is gonna kill you!" (laughing of course) and I was all, "Well, only if YOU TELL HER."  Hahahaha,.....  So after some jamming and driving, I dropped those two back off at home and my brother was being all crazy hanging out the window and stuff so i was like swerving so he would fall out...but he didn't...so I TRIED to get Fifer to feel his biceps but noooooooo.......LOL.  This was all very exciting.  Then we went back to Kroger and talked to Jennifer for a while.  Then Fifer had to go home because she had a midnight curfew....awww... oh well.  And I just went and chilled at Jennifer's for a while.  I had to buy her some Parrot Ice first though and I didn't know where the place was so I was kinda late getting there.  I only stayed there like an hour, and we got caught up on stuff and watched this messed up horror movie.  It was pretty fun.  The Dashboard concert is this Thursday and she is going to help me convince my brother to let me borrow his car.  Right so today I went and spent some time with my mom.  It was pretty fun.  First I had my eye appointment.  I am always afraid to go though because I don't want the eye doctors to find out how irresponsible I am when it comes to taking care of my eyes...like...umm....stretching a 6-month supply of disposable contacts to last 2 years....heh...heh....and you know, I don't really ever take them out when I sleep either...heh...heh....but my optic nerves are good, Doctor: "You have beautiful optic nerves!  Any guy ever tell you that?" Me:  "Ummm.....no....."  My eyes have gotten considerably worse since two years ago.  No wonder I couldn't see things very well.  My right eye used to be -4.5...now it is a -5.25.  My left went from a -5.0 to a -5.5.  I am seriously almost blind I do believe.  It sucks not having good vision.  He put up the letters and was like, "Ok, what is the smallest line you can read?" and I was like, "Well, actually, all I see is a white blob."  I'm not sure he gets many people that say that...hmm...Man, I have been wearing contacts for what...going on seven years now....WoW.  Haha, at least I don't have to wear those huge glasses that covered half of my face that I had to wear in 1st grade...hehe...I looked like a geek.  Ok, ok, I was one.  So SUE ME.  Then we went and ate at Chic-Fil-A and then we went to Target and she bought some stuff for me and my dorm/college life...It was pretty fun hanging out with my mom (Is that weird??).  Must go now.  An adventure awaits.  Ciao!  -Lisa

      Ok, the last time I posted was Tuesday morning...what has happened since then?  Lots.  Tuesday...MISSED MY FREAKIN BIO LAB!!!!  How??  Well, people told me that all of the Chemistry 3-hour labs were cancelled this week and for some reason, when I read my schedule, I was totally convinced that I had chem lab that day and not bio so I DIDN'T GO.  Translation:  a 5-point doc my first week.  Gah!!  Oh well.  I was really freaking out right after I realized what I had done.  But, I talked to this guy in my lab and he said all we did was go over safety procedures so it was ok.  At least I didn't miss a lab.  Tuesday was also the TAMS Student Activities Fair.  All the clubs set up booths and you could go around and sign up for whatever you wanted to be in.  The main ones I signed up for were newspaper, yearbook, MHA (it is like a group that represents the dormitory on campus...all the dormitories have one), and the TAMS version of Key Club.  There were a few more that I signed up for too, but I do not remember them all.  Heh.  The Pool Club and the Ping Pong club were two others I signed up for.  Oh, and I think AfterProm too.    Wednesday...the day of five classes.  And the only time I have a break is right after Biology.  I have begun to take a nap in between Biology and Pre Cal...it is like an hour and I am really tired.  I am definitely not a morning person.  Nothing really interesting happened after classes if I recall correctly...After our wing meeting, I did talk to this girl about playing tennis with her and to this other girl about sharing mp3s over aim (because kazaa traffic gets lowest priority in our dorm).  Then Naomi and I went to this SWAT team meeting (SWAT is just an acronymn for Students Working at TAMS) and we are gonna build a deck for some project or something.  Thursday...only one class because my chem lab really was cancelled this time!  I spent only two hours in the library tha day as opposed to the three hours I had spent in there Wednesday.  I actually took a nap in there Wednesday for like 30 minutes...it is so quiet and peaceful...and secluded...so once you lay your head down, you can't help but close your eyes... Then we went to some UNT Pep Rally to get free flipflops but they ran out when we were like five people in the line from getting them :(.  Oh well. Then...my first TAMS dance.  I have mixed feelings, very mixed feelings.   Ok, for math and science geeks, this party was krunk yo.  Err...it was really cool.  Mostly rap.  A couple of techno songs (they actually brought out the little glow-in-the-dark sticks and did some raving stuff), and a few swing-dancing songs!  Those were the only ones I knew how to dance to but I did not have anyone to dance with...soo....  There are some crazy-good dancers here.  Osato being one of them.  And this other guy named David...and this Asian named Kevin...I just watched them do their stuff a lot of the time.  Kevin could break dance pretty well and David did this backflip that was hellatight (ahahahaha hanging out with Osato is teaching me some ebonics yall).  Osato could do all the moves.  The foot one and the shoulder one and everything.    I felt left out simply because everybody paid attention to Naomi and didn't give a crap about me, and I was feeling lonely for a while so I came up to my room, but I got over it.  There are a lot of things I just need to get over sometimes.  At around 11:30 we all went outside to look at Mars because the Astonomy club brought out their telescope.  It was pretty cool.  You could actually see the polar ice cap through the telescope.    Today I just went to classes.  And now I will be leaving in just a bit to go home for the weekend!  Yay!  It feels like I have spent a month here, as opposed to just over a week.  It is certainly different, and I do not have as many friends or as close friends as I did before, but I am working on it.  I hope things will start to change soon.  Despite feeling lonely sometimes, I really like it here.  It is pretty cool.  Well, talk to all you guys later.  -Lisa

      Hey everyone, only read this if you have a lot of spare time on your hands because this is pretty long, seeing as how I haven't been able to post in a while.  Enjoy!  Sunday Morning...  Well, the internet is down so I cannot post any blogs right now, but I really need to blog, so I guess I will just start writing on WordPad and just publish it later for you guys...  The past couple of days have been fun but there is still something that really bothers me about myself.  All the girls on my wing have begun to form groups I guess and have all made friends with each other.  All of them I should say, except for myself.  And I have no idea how to really.  I mean, I have made a few friends but it seems sometimes like they are just mainly friends with Naomi and I am just tagging along.  I suppose I am a bit jealous of her.  She is so outgoing and friendly and can just make friends on the spot with anybody without even trying or thinking about it.  I have never really been jealous of a friend before, and it isn't everything about her that I envy, just the way that everybody knows and loves her already...and it has been less than a week.  I can't help but feeling like the girl everyone will know as "Naomi's roommate" and that's not what I want to be known as.  She already has a lot of Senior and Junior friends calling our room for her all the time and a guy that I am pretty sure will pursue a relationship with her and I do not have nearly as many friends...but, in a way, I think I prefer my way.  Instead of just having lots and lots of friends, I tend to make my friends slower and get to know them really well.  But still, sometimes I cannot help but wish I was a little more outgoing and that I had more...what is that word?  Charisma?  The thing where you walk into a room and everybody wants to say hi to you, everybody notices you.  That is what she has.  But oh well.    So Friday morning we all did our community service and had a "Victory over the Vines."  They gave me a pitchfork ;) and I was just plowing down the thorny vines...it was great.  It was this looooooong stretch of fence that had fallen down because of all the vines that had grown on it and around it and it was all standing by the time we finished.  It was a pretty cool feeling.  Then Naomi and I met this girl named Starr and we all went to the new Rec Center to work out.  This place was so huge and nice.  It had an endless supply of biking and running machines, the weight room was so big, there was an olympic-sized swimming pool, a hot tub that holds up to 40 people, and a lazy river.  Not to mention that there is a running track upstairs and about ten basketball courts.  In the PE center, there are a lot of raquetball courts...I want to take up that as a hobby.  It is so fun.  Saturday we started off the day by running a mile in 7:50 (Holy cow, that is fast for me) and then ate some breakfast and then just went down to the Union to hang out with some people.  Osato and Johnathan are the guys we usually hang out with, and they had a couple of friends with them.  One was a 14-year-old pool prodigy...or perhaps just a prodigy in general.  He made a 1350 on the SAT in the 8th grade...and he has finished all the math courses through Algebra II, which is why I guess he was admitted to TAMS, but I mean, wow...I have decided to adopt him as my younger brother, since I miss mine so much.  ANYway, he was awesome at pool.  He kicked all of our asses.  He was pretty good at ping pong too, but I think he met his match at that sport when he played me :).  We had some looong rallies.  It was pretty fun.  I just can't believe he is skipping out on all four of his high school years.  He is going to college two years earlier than the rest of us who are already going two years early...He could be done with college by the time he is 18 if he so wished.  The other guy that we met was Alex.  He was a really, really quiet guy that was kinda creepy.  Out of all of us that were there, he had the highest SAT with a 1490 or something like that.  He couldn't play pool or ping pong worth crap, because he would always play in a jerky motion...it was kinda weird.  I mean, I guess he was nice but eh...Ok, listen to this.  I was talking about how I had tried to test into Honors Chem but didn't remember anything from my class so didn't and he was like, "Do you like chemistry?" and I was like, "Uh, yeah, I guess, I liked the class." and he was all, "I have recently aquired an interest in chemistry.  It just fascinates me how different substances can react with each other so differently.  Just imagine everything you can make knowing chemicals!" and I, jokingly, was like, "Yeah, drugs." and then he was like, "Bombs."  and I was like, "Heh, you are not going to grow up to be one of those guys that blows up a building or anything...?" SILENCE!!!  Note to self:  Be kind to Alex.  This one guy, John, that we went on our Wal-Mart run with had a 1600 on his SAT, and he is only 16....I wish I could make a 1600 on the SAT :) oh well.  Let's see...we had some boring seminars..  And then they had a DDR machine set up downstairs!  Apparently EVERYONE here has one and they bring them down for all the LAN parties.  Anyway, it was projected on the wall and then there were two little squares hooked up to the playstation right?  It wasn't like the kind you find in the mall.  Naomi and I tried it (it was my first time) and I sucked soooo bad!!  I honestly don't understand how people can be so good at that!  I got a C and a D...Naomi got an A and a B.  I want to start learning how to be good at it.  Oh and then last night was Frog Night.  Basically they pair a Junior up with a Senior and turn them loose for the night and hopefully the Junior will get to talk to the Senior about some of their questions or concerns.  They have sheets to fill out with your interests that we filled out at orientation.  They did a good job with my match.  It was this guy named Steven who, from the back looked EXACLTY LIKE Ryan Essex.  It was kinda creepy.  Same blonde hair, same haircut, same body build...but his face, and his personality, were nothing like Ryan's.  I mean, for one thing, he wasn't stuck on himself.  Anyway, their pairing in the music department could not have been better.  He had a mix CD in his car.  First track: Phantom Planet, California Second Track: Smile Empty Soul, Bottom of the Bottle  and so on.  He had The Foo Fighters, The Ataris, The All-American Rejects...basically EVERYTHING that I listen to.  It was amazing!  And he was a really nice guy.  We were with a group of people and we all went to Grapevine so I didn't really talk to him until we were all eating but he just talked to me about the classes, and the studying and then his friend Louis came over there and we all talked about movies and whatnot.  Then we all went to see My Boss's Daughter, which was alright.  Some parts really cracked me up.  Others were really stupid.  But oh well, I guess that is how it is with nearly any comedy.    The two Juniors I hung out with for a majority of the time were Jennifer and Jalissa, and they were pretty cool.  I went back and hung out in Jennifer's room for a while after we got back, but I didn't have anything to say really.  I think that is the problem with me making friends.  I never have anything to say.  And I am the kinda person that if there is nothing to say, I'd rather not say anything.  I do get talkative when I have stuff to say, but that has only happened a couple of times so far these past few days.  Classes start tomorrow.  I think Naomi and I are going to go scout out our classrooms sometime today.    I guess my overall feelings about this place is that it is really great, but I just hope that I can make a few friends that I can be close too, because I really miss being able to talk to everyone...*sigh* I was laying down the other night trying to read and all I could do was look at all your pictures and think about how much I miss everyone :( but it is cool :), it really is very, very cool here.  -Lisa   ----------------------- Monday Evening...  Internet is still down.  Today was the first day of classes.  Biology was pretty interesting.  This is like the signature TAMS class so our entire Junior class has the class together and then there are like 3 or 4 regular UNT students.  One of them happened to be Nic.  I got his attention at the beginning of class and said hi.  It was sooo funny.  He didn't even realize he was surrounded by 16-year-olds and younger.  When the professor asked who was not in TAMS and like two other people raised their hands he just started looking around like crazy looking all confused.  It was hilarious.  :).  He was trying to make fun of me afterwards with, "Well, I am not in high school...I have to go to class.  I have 17 hours."  and I was just like, "Oh.  I have 16."  Haha.  That shut him up right quick it did.    then I had a whole HOUR before my next class!  So I went back to my room and took a nap.  My next class was Pre-Cal.  That one was pretty interesting too.  Both Osato and Alejandro are in my class, so that is cool.  Other than Naomi, those two are probably the two that I talk to the most.  Sidenote here:  You see the most interesting pair ups here friend wise.  Today I saw a Muslim girl in a full hair wrap talking to another girl in full punk wardrobe with a mohawk.  That reminds me of that commercial I wrote about in my other entry...Only at TAMS.  Ha, and then there is Aarron and Johnathan.  Aarron is like 4'11 or something (the 14-year-old) and Johnathan is like 6'7 or something.  They are always together and it is pretty funny watching them walk together.  And they weren't kidding when they said this was a multi-cultural school.  It is so weird seeing all these different people hanging out that would have never hung out together in high school.  Very extremely awesome imo.  Anyway, back to my day.  Chemistry was next.  This is the first class I had that was comprised mostly of regular UNT students.  There were only like 3 or 4 of us youngins in there.  Nobody really notices though.  Unless you tell them, or they freakin see your ID.  Instead of the word Student under our name it has TAMS!!  How much does that just scream NERD!!??  But oh well, I am one.  I admit it :).    Then I had an hour that I ate lunch during with some random girls and then I went to Writing about Literature, which I was really excited about, but it is pretty boring so far.  Tomorrow I only have Pre Cal and a Chem Lab for like three hours...Crazy right?  Pre Cal is going to be my hardest class I think.  It is every day and we have homework every day and he actually grades it for 17% of our grade.  That class is most like high school out of all of them, although it is still way different.  I spent soo long on the homework today.  Osato and I worked through it together and a lot of people joined and left us during our study session.  It is cool.  People just hang out and study, but have fun at the same time.  I can tell I will like this year.  I felt really in place too because I got to help a lot of people with their work.  I love helping people understand something.  When it clicks with them, and you can see that, it is so amazing I think.  Even though it was difficult, I love having math homework again...  Does that make me weird?  Ahahahahahahahahahaha.  I am glad school is in.  I am excited about this year.  I am gonna study so hard.  4.0 BABY!!!  That is my goal.  Then Naomi and I went and worked out at the Rec Center and then we went to Clark Hall and got some dinner.  We made it back like 8 minutes before curfew.  It feels like I have been here forever, and it has been less than a week.  Maybe it is because the internet is down, but I feel so disconnected from my old life, and so connected here.  Sometimes it is hard to remember that only a week ago I was sleeping in my old house, talking to my best friends, saying my goodbyes...I am going through Internet Withdrawal btw.  It is one of the most difficult experiences of my life...j/k :) but really, I hope it is up soon.  Of course, I am still extremely busy here without the internet, but it would still be so great to talk to all my Arlington buddies.  So, yeah, I am beginning to make friends.  Slowly but surely.  The people I am really getting to know well are...hmm...Osato and Alejandro...and...Aarron (14-yaer-old), and Johnathan.  And Naomi of course but I already knew her.  Jennifer is pretty cool; I talk to her sometimes.  Starr is nice too.  I met this other girl Casey, tonight, that told me I should hang out with her and her friends.  She is another loud and outgoing person like Naomi, and she was pretty nice.  A bit on the vulgar side...well, a lot on the vulgar side...like every other word.  But I really don't care.  She like analyzed me right when she met me.  She was like, "You are one of those people that is kinda quiet but then makes a remark that is hilarious and no one ever hears it except for the people that are close to you." and I was like, "hmm...I guess..."  So yeah that was interesting.  They all are.  I wish all of you could meet these people.  They are some of the funniest and weirdest people ever.  Not as funny as yall are to me of course ;) because I miss yall soooo much!!!!!!!!  Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, gtg read up on Biology... (Yes, you actually have to READ the textbook to survive here)  Hope the internet is up soon so I can post all of these!  -Lisa

      I am too tired to blog completely...all I have got to say are little details about today.  1) Finally met Alejandro in person!  Yay.  He was pretty cool.  I didn't know what he looked like but from what I knew about him, I deducted which person was him.  I saw a tall Mexican with an Anti-Flag shirt on and was like...it's gotta be him.  I think we may hang out a lot...it would be cool.  2)  I met four Asians while I was playing pool.  Now I met a lot of people, but I just think it is funny how their names are Paul, Tim, Lucas, and Kevin.  If I had said that I met four guys named Paul, Tim, Lucas, and Kevin, would you think they were Asian?  Lucas was definitely one of the cutest Asians I have ever personally met.  Keanu Reeves is like one-fourth Chinese....  3)  When the time came around when Naomi and I were waiting for our ride to Wal-Mart, I pulled out the Chess in a Tin.  Oh yeah baby.  We had a freakin crowd!!!  They were like taking bets, and commenting on our moves.  They kept telling Naomi she could put me into checkmate within three moves and Naomi is like, "Really?"  We are not hardcore chess players.  But then I would make a counter move and they'd all be like, "Ooooooo, that was a good move too.  Good move!  Good move!"  It was so fun!  And I couldn't help but thinking, Only at TAMS.  That should be like their slogan.  Commercial:  While hanging out with your friends, have you ever felt the urge to program a calculator? Do you often find yourself counting in binary instead of sheep when you cannot sleep? Do your nightmares involve a world without math class?  Come out of the closet. Only at TAMS.  Aw man, I would have sooo bought into it.  This really is awesome.  I really cannot describe how awesome this is.  Maybe I will hate it a month from now, but wow...I mean, WoW.  The collage on my walls is looking pretty impressive.  I will have to take a picture and post it on here sometime.  I have like a bajillion posters.  Yup.    Ok, now on to something that really annoyed me today. So Naomi and I were walking and talking, and out of the blue she goes, "So I see you have your "rocker" friends now" (Yes, she actually did the little finger quotation marks...) And I was like, "Uhh...I guess.??" and she was like, "Yeah, I never really understood how people can just sit and talk about music and concerts like that is all they talk about." and I was like, "Actually, we talk about a lot of things." and she was like, "Well, yall just seem so fake.  You try so hard to not conform."  and I was like, "I don't try to not conform or conform, I am just myself." and she was like, "Well, it's kinda stupid." and I was like, "Well, you wanna know what I think is stupid?  STEROTYPES."   That put an end to that conversation.  I think she is just jealous because the most she will ever get into the good music scene is Simple Plan and Bowling For Soup.  Both of them, even though they are very good bands that I like, all only the tip of the iceberg and do not even begin to offer everything the music I listen to offers.    So, yeah, I hung out with Alejandro, Katy, MiMi, and a couple others that dressed like "rockers."  (LOL)  But they are nice and fun and smart (obviously).  And are just cool to hang out with.  Soooo, whatever...I don't care if Naomi does not "approve" of them.  It may be because she heard them cussing too...hmm...oh well.  But they were not the only ones I hung out with.  Quite the contrary.  I do not limit myself to a certain number or kind of people. I hung out with some Asians, a black guy, and other people too.  I am telling you, white is the minority here, it is CRAZY!  There are mostly Asians and the such, all the cultures from the east side of the world.  Well, I suppose they only make up about 50-60% BUT since they are a minority everywhere else, then it seems like a whole lot.  It is cool with me though.  I did so much today.  I am so tired and tomorrow will be just as busy...hmm...well, off to bed.  Am going to read.  Peace out yo.  -Lisa

      OK yall, here it is.  After months and months of anticipation, I am finally bringing you what you have been waiting so long to read.  I call it...  "Lisa's Good-bye Blog"  Ok, ok, screw the months of anticipation...let's get on with it.  I am packing my computer up tomorrow morning, and I have no idea when I will have it up and running to talk to all you people.  It could be as soon as Thursday evening, but it may not be until Friday or Saturday.  I know this does not seem like many days, but in internet/blogging time, it is FOREVER.  Well, I suppose I never thought this day would come.  At the beginning of the summer, I told myself I had two and a half months to spend with my friends.  It seemed like it would last forever.  But, as Robert Frost so eloquently put it, "Nothing gold can stay."  And so, after two and a half months of the best summer of my life, spent with the coolest people I know, I have to go away.  At first, when I think about it, I want to cry, and stay here, and refuse to leave.  I just want to stay here and be able to see everyone every day like it has always been.  But then I realize that if I am not strong enough to finally capitalize on an opportunity, then I will never be strong enough to make something of myself.  We all have to move on.  I was talking to a good friend of mine and he put it somewhat like this.  Even if we refused to move on and away, the people around us would, and we would be stuck in a place without the people or reasons that we originally stayed for.  Life is all about change, and constant motion and new experiences.  Without change, it would be terribly dull and stagnant.  Without new experiences, we would never learn anything, and never fully appreciate life.  The constant motion is necessary to keep us from boredom, a fate which I would consider worse than death.  I may have mentioned to some of you before that my biggest fear in life is that I will end up to be a jobless, mediocre, suburban stay-at-home wife.  Before yall get defensive saying that your mom is like that, I am not saying that it is a bad thing, or anything like that at all.  Some of the nicest, most caring, most interesting people I know are just that.  However, I know in my heart that it is not for me.  I have always wanted to see the world, learn everything there is to know, meet lots of people, fall in love (Well, don't we all?), and then live my life with a career that helps people while still always trying new things, travelling, and always meeting new and interesting people.  Going to TAMS is the first step I have taken.  I just cannot believe I am finally taking matters into my own hands and DOING SOMETHING with my life!  Until this year, it is just like I went where the current took me.  Elementary school, Middle school, High school...they just all came one after the other, and me, powerless to have any influence on where I went in my life, went along with it.  And it wasn't bad, just...I need to be independent.  I hate asking people for help, and I think that from Thursday on, I will finally have the independence I have wanted for so long now.  Maybe I am just being too optimistic about this whole thing, and it will end up not being such a great experience after all, but I can always hope.  And "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies" (-Andy Dufresne, TSR)  So in the end, even after the sadness of leaving this place forever, and all my friends and family along with it, I KNOW that it is what I HAVE to do.  I will literally go insane if I do not.  Now that that is out of the way.  Here are all my thoughts and words to my friends.  You can just skip down to your part, if you wish, since this last part ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated.  Amy-  Has it been 14 or 15 years now?  However long it has been, I have always had you, and you have always had me.  It is hard to imagine life without you, because for as long as I have been alive, you have been a part of it.  We have been through EVERYTHING together.  Your 22 or so boyfriends, Drew, David, the situation of last year, your pregnancy this year!  And with me...my parents' divorce, Spencer, learning about my dad, Elise (The only person I truly hate)...as I said, everything...We have done some stuff we are not proud of, sometimes together, sometimes not...but no matter how disappointed I would be in you or vice versa, we were always best friends.  And even though this past year we have both changed drastically, and didn't get to see each other as much, when I did see you, I felt like I could talk to you about pretty much anything, and that you would listen with all your heart.  I thank you for that!  Jennifer (Erwin)-  5th grade was it?  Yes, yes, I remember.  5th grade because YOU HATED ME!!!!  Haha, j/k, j/k...that is long in the past and we have both grown and matured together since then.  The one thing about being your friend that I love more than anything else, is how stupid and crazy and bold, and WEIRD I can be and you are always just a little bit more so and therefore, when we hang out, it was ALWAYS fun.  Class with you was entertainment, an adventure, rather than just boringness....Geometry with Chris Jardieu (the scratcher LOL), Tennis with Sharpe ( "Can anybody play in the tournament tomorrow?" Jenn and Lisa: "Oo! We can!  We can!"  Coach: "ANYBODY????") and Mercer (Ahhhhh!), English with Matt and Mrs. Quesenbury (You were sooo in love with Matt), Algebra with John and Will and Mrs. Benton (who was awesome).  Thanks for always giving me rides to and from school when I needed them!  And for also always being there for me, even when I was a crappy friend.  And I have always, ALWAYS, enjoyed complaining about our families to each other, while mine has gotten better, yours has just gotten worse, but you can always talk to me about it whenever you want.  I'll get you my number ;).  Jennifer (Lemmers) (alias: Fifer)-  IT WAS THE MAGIC MARKER IN MADAME BAUMAN'S CLASS!  We saw each other and it was like we both realized that we had just met the only other person in the room who was not a complete idiot!!!  That nine weeks was great because making fun of stupid people is always good, wholesome fun.  This year was awesome too.  Without you to hang out with me at the UIL meets, I could have quite possibly gone insane from a lack of people to talk to.  EMBROCATE!!! LMAO!!! That was HILARIOUS. (Wow, a lot of this is capitalized...)  Oh wow, and the UIL Banquet...Chess in a tin!!! Christian!!!  Us having to go on stage to give Jeff Hoffman an award when he didn't know either of us!!  And this summer...hehehe...all of our thrift store shopping was awesome.  We got some hardcore shirts, man.  The soccerfields at like midnight with the creepy car waiting for us...The Italian Job (with the kick ass algorithms!!), Lollapalooza, sprinkler systems, you always thinking you were going to die because I was driving...I really got to know you well this summer, and it is going to suck having to leave you!  You have been an awesome friend that I can talk to about pretty much anything.  You had better come to UNT for our 80s movies nights!!!  Olivia-  AKA My concert buddy!!  And now a whole lot more.  I do not remember when exactly we became good friends.  We met of course at the beginning of last year, but it took us some time to get to know each other.  Sometime after Christmas, that is for sure.  But you are so awesome!!!  Hanging out with you this summer has been the ultimate blast!  I remember writing in your yearbook at the end of last year that I dubbed this summer "Master Summer" and it lived up to its expectations.  In a major part thanks to you!  You made every time we hung out or spent the night together unforgettable fun!  Warped Tour was AWESOME, playing tennis was soo much fun, all the movies that we saw together (geez I can't even name them all), playing basketball with random guys at Stovall at like midnight, the techno party at Johnathan's truck afterwards with the couple coming out of the bushes!!, Wiener Schnitzel (I STILL can't pronounce it!!), Colby, Brent, and Jordan!!!!, Dreamworld (2 out of 3 times), everything...so many of my summer memories involve you...You are definitely one of my closest friends, and everytime I come down here, I will definitely want to hang out with you, because I know it'll always be exciting and fun!!  I can't wait for Cancun baby!!!!!!!!!  Sarah-  Do you even remember the first time we really talked to each other?  I do!!!  It was that night when a bunch of us went out to eat and it was like me, you, Jon, Brett, and Philip, and we talked to each other because we were the only girls there!  Yup, I still remember!  And then Jon stole the knife and named it...LOL, I don't even remember what.  These past three or so years you have been an AWESOME friend.  I could talk to you about soo many things.  Especially when we would just walk around the track after running and just talk.  I always loved those mornings, they were great.  Camp was so fun with you too!  We won first in Bible Trivia!!! Yesss.  Of course, David carried the team, but I sooooo gave the answer that won us that last game.  What was the answer??  I don't even remember!!!  But I saved the day!!!  And you were awesome too, with your Moses Coffee Bean...wha?  I dun even remember anymore.  And our song!!  The CD!!!  Renaming you Babe...ahahaha, good times, good times...and we had better not stop having them.  It was you who inspired me to start blogging, and I am very grateful for that.  You have also helped me find myself these past few years.  In February, when I had that breakdown, it was you that consoled me and went to Braum's with me for hours and just talked to me about it.  That helped so much, you were always a great friend.  Thank you so much!  JoAnn-  In 8th grade, when I showed you my project in English...that is when we first became friends.  And it was ever so fun.  History....Ahhh that class was fun.  "Excellence knows no...JoAnn!"  LOL.  hehehehe.  I really got to know you well that year.  Hanging out at your house every Monday, scrapbooking, volunteering at Mission Arlington.  It was great to have a friend like you.  Last year was fun, and this year too.  I will ALWAYS remember tping Spencer's house...ahahahaha and now silly stringing Kyle's!!!  You are one crazy person, and you are a very very awesome friend.  I can talk to you about pretty much anything, and it is great having a friend like that.  EdgeFest was so fun!  and seeing Everclear at the Bronco Bowl!!  And those disgusting whores that got on the stage and tried to have sex with the band members (Or so it seemed...lol)!  And the one or two ready writing meets that you actually participated in!  They called your paper bigotry!  And you were like, "Um, no."...haha, the judges were gay, I am convinced.  You have always been an awesome friend to me, and I will definitely miss you a lot.  Good luck with you and James and I know you will make a great First Lieutenant (that is what you are, right?...sigh, drill team politics...)  Ashley-  We have known each other since...3rd grade?  2nd?  Haha, and the first time I ever went to your house was in the 5th...but after that, for the next couple of years, we were inseparable.  Just how many times DID we go to Six Flags together the summer after 6th?  Or better yet, how many times did we go to the Skatium??  I was such a whore, but it's ok because so were you.  We each picked up a couple of guys at Six Flags...I picked up AJ (ewwww) at the Skatium...ha, THAT was an interesting day.  We had so much fun back then.  We did fall out for a while after 7th/8th grade, because in 9th we hardly ever even talked to each other.  This year, starting mainly with History, hanging out with you has been great FUN.  The project at the end of the year with the Chariots of Fire song and the slow motion race...sitting on my driveway afterwards.  Even though that was only a few minutes, I always remembered that, because I felt like I had a real conversation with you for the first time in ages.  Six Flags yet again (with you almost passing out), the movies with JoAnn, watching mall rats, going to the mall, playing Final Fantasy together!!!  It was all great, great fun.  I know that if I was staying, we would hang out together more this year than we have the past couple of years.  You have always been a good friend of mine though, and I hope that never changes.  Good luck with David, woo!  I think that is all of the people I want to say bye to that will ever read my blog...and I am not even sure about a couple.  If you are my friend, and I failed to mention you, it is not because I do not consider you a friend at all, it is merely because I tried to say goodbye to the people I know that read this.  I will sincerely miss you guys, with all of my heart.  But I know that this is the right decision for me.  All of you will graduate high school and go to college and live great lives, and I hope to always keep in touch with all of you.    "Goodbye may seem forever, farewell is like the end, but in my hearts of memory... in there you'll always be." (sappy quote from The Fox and the Hound...but I don't care if it is sappy!  I feel like the fox...or the hound...no, the fox, because he is the one that had to leave.  The hound stayed.  I hope you all don't feel like hounds...)  Your saddened, but excited, friend, Lisa  PS- The next time you talk to me, I will officially be a COLLEGE CHICK.   Yes......KEGGER!!! Lmao, that one was for you, Fifer.

I did put the shower message up for a reason though!  See, I was taking a shower to get ready to go to work, but then I forgot to change it!!  So, yeah, all of you people crack me up!!  So today I tried to attempt to pretend that I was packing/cleaning but...what I really did was get on the computer, tell ppl I was going to go pack, Look at my room for five minutes deciding that I didn't know where to start, and get back on the computer.  Oh, but I didn't always just get back on the computer.  I also did things like pouring a bowl of cereal or watching pointless TV shows.  At one point, I think I even DID SOME MORE LAUNDRY.  The latter could count towards helping me pack, I suppose so Hurrah!  Victory is mine!  I really do need to start packing.  On a good note, work was quite fun today.  I think there is this guy there that kinda likes me or whatnot because he is always leaving his checkstand to come bag for me and now that he knows I am leaving he is all, "So you are going to come back next summer and work here, right??  You had better!"  And then this one time he asked me if I was going to give him my number...hmmm....but I didn't.  This other guy who just graduated was talking about how he goes to the Rocky Horror Picture Show sometimes and he told me that I could go with him and his friends when they come back here for Christmas break.  So that was pretty cool.  The black guy, Thornton, was all telling me I was pretty and stuff.  To which I replied, "Riiiiiiiiiiiight."  Oh!  And Coach Averyt came and said bye to me one last time!  He is one of the coolest people I know.  Jennifer also came and said bye.  Her hair is black now!  Or at least, extremely dark brown.  And shorter.  I think it looks cool.  She had a crappy day.  So did Olivia, apparently, judging by her profile.  I always thought that first days were the best, but I guess Summit has a way of screwing that one up :) :).  At least Fifer seemed to have an ok day.  I haven't really talked to anyone else about their days, so I don't know how they all went.  It is still weird that I am leaving!!  -Lisa

      Mmmm....listening to FF Music at the moment...orchestra style....could listen to this and bask in memories all day...that's weird...memories about a video game...hmmm...  Wal-Mart would be THE coolest place for a happening partyhouse/club.  Man, me and Fifer went there at like 10:30 and still couldn't find a parking space.  Not to mention when Olivia and I went there at midnight and were hit on by some guys...hmm but it would be so cool...I would definitely hang out on the vegetable aisle....hahahahahahahah NOT.  That would be the sex aisle.  And I don't want to have sex in a Wal-Mart.  Right, well, anyway...  So I got Amy's baby shower gift which was like $40 and then two dvds in the sale bin so I spent about $50.  The checkout guy was funny.  His nametag had flipped over so that his entire name was showing and then it flipped back over to where it showed only his first name and I noticed that his last name was Strange, and that happens to be the last name of this other guy I know.  So I was all, "Hey, are you related to Gary Strange?" and he was like all confused looking and looked down at his nametag to see if I knew his last name from that but it was on the first name side so he was like, "My last name is Strange." and I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Yeah, but I don't know a Gary Strange.  That is weird."  and then me, like the big dork I am, replied with, "Yeah, it is  strange ."  ahahahahahahaaa..ha..........hah..heh.  cough.  I am pretty stupid, I think.  So yeah, I got Joan of Arc and A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Yay.  Then we went to Barnes and Noble and I found me an FFX strategy guide that I glanced at before leaving.  Psh, it didn't even tell me anything I couldn't have figured out on my own.  Oh well.    Then we were gonna go to 7-11....hahaha but I was distracted by the elementary school with their sprinkler system on.  So I had to go crash that party.    Well, we then went to 7-11 but they DIDN'T HAVE ANY SLURPEES (sign that the world is ending #4) and so I just bought some starbursts.  Yummm those were good.  And then I dropped Fifer back off at her house.  Well, I wanted to listen to my Moulin Rouge soundtrack that I had burned customized to my song preferences at the beginning of the summer because I had never gotten to listen to that the whole way through in my car.  It is so cool too, it has all the good songs from the first and second soundtrack, but none of the crappy ones from either.  ANYway, I put it in and realized that it was a completely different mix of songs I had made and I just labeled the CDs wrong.  But it was all good because it was a mix of songs that I liked because they helped me think about life.  So they was an inspirational hour of my life that I spent driving aimlessly around the Dallas/Fort Worth/Arlington/Mansfield area.  Every song...was amazing.  It was a variety too.  Saliva, Jimmy Eat World, Gershwin, Nicole Kidman, John Williams, and Hans Zimmer to name a few... I still think my theme song of the summer is "My Sundown" by Jimmy Eat World.    I wanna be so much more than this.  Today I went to church to say goodbye to all of those friends of mine...I will definitely miss Leah, Jon, and Sarah.  Then I went to Amy's baby shower, at which I saw more people to say goodbye to.  Then I went and visited Olivia up at her work and she hooked me up with a free ticket to see Freddy vs. Jason so I did that.  And then I just came back here and am chilling.  My brother cooked us dinner tonight!  I am so proud of him.  And not just because he cooked dinner, but because I think he has really become a great guy.  He has matured a lot over the past few years I think.  I know it is too late to turn back and I know that I do not really want to turn back, but sometimes I have moments where I seriously think that I am stupid for leaving everyone.  Hmm...  Well, I am off to eat dinner.  -Lisa

      I am saying goodbye to my past a few friends at a time. Thursday night JoAnn and Ashley wanted to do something so we went to the mall and then to Stovall Park and after deciding to all spend the night at Ashley's house, we had the brilliant idea of silly stringing Kyle's house.  Kyle is an ex-boyfriend of JoAnn's that has been a real jerk to her.  So we each got two cans of silly string and totally covered his bushes.  None of us wanted to go to the other side of his house because it required walking by his window which happened to be lighted, but JoAnn ended up doing it.  Ashley and I started walking away because we were both out of string and it was kinda suspicious looking ( :) ) and then Kyle's dog freaking went crazy and started barking as loud as possible.  Ashley and I just bolted.  JoAnn followed.  Aw man, it was fun.  Once we got back in the car and sped away, we couldn't stop laughing.  And then we drove back by his house twice to empty the rest of the cans, and to see what it looked like.  Hehehehe.  It was crazy.  Then we went back to Ashley's house after eating all the food we bought at Wal-Mart (pizza, ice cream, goldfish, buttery kettle corn, and candy!  Healthy, no?), Ashley and I played Final Fantasy X while JoAnn tried to work on her summer reading.  Ok, so I hadn't played FFX in like 3 or 4 months.  Ever since before summer started.  But I still clearly remember the story, and it was a good one.  Well, Ashley was on a boss that she thought was the last of the game and she couldn't get past him.  It was Sin Part II.  I had never tried to beat Part I more than once because I stopped playing.  However, after warming up a bit, I am proud to say that I have not lost my touch.  I not only helped her defeat Sin Part II, but also the guy after him, Seymour (for like the 8th freakin time!!) and then he was finally sent.  Then we finally did get to what I believe was the last guy of the game.  Jecht, the main character's father who had become Sin (looong story) to help save the world.  So you have to fight him, right?  Well, he doesn't look so intimidating until he falls into this thing and comes back up like fifteen times bigger and all firey and scary looking.  We didn't beat him our first try, and it was 3:30 by then and both of us were trying to sleep, so we just turned it off.  I think during the three days next week when everyone has school except for me, I will definitely beat the game.  I woke up at 7:00 because my mom told me the night before I was to have Brian up at the school for football by 8:00 so I went home and he is not even there!  Hours of sleep wasted for nothing!  Oh well.  So I picked him up at 12:00 and then...hmm...did nothing...and then I....did nothing some more.  That was fun.  Oh and then I....did nothing!  But at around 4:00 I went to Grapevine to watch the tennis team play their tournament and I went out to eat with all of them afterwards just to say bye to all of them. That was sad/fun.  Heh.  Oh!  And then while we were in Wendy's, eating...all the power in that part of town went out and so everyone was like, "Ahh!  It is like New York!"  and I was like, "The world is ending, you know." and they all said I was depressing, but ok.  Look at the facts with me will you.  1)  Just LOOK at all the rain we have been getting lately.  Didn't the last time the world supposedly end have something to do with a lot of rain too?? 2) Big blackout along the northern US and some of southern Canada.  People could actually see THE STARS.  If this isn't a sign of the apocalypse, I don't know what is. 3) Avril Lavigne's Sk8er Boi movie. ....nuff said.  As you can clearly see, we have but a mere while to say goodbye to everyone we know and get ready for the "end of the world as we know it"  Do you feel fine?    Ok, I'm done with that now.  So ANYway, then I went to Dreamworld because Olivia invited me to go see her boyfriend's band play there.  It was Alex, Ryan, and Will...Hansen!  When I had heard that their drummer's name was Will, I had no clue that it was that Will.  So afterwards I talked to him.  You know how I am doing the TAMS thing to get out of high school early?  Well, Will decided he didn't need a fancy program or whatever, so he just dropped out of high school and got accepted to a college simply because his SAT score was high enough.  So he is going to just go to college without ever having to get a high school diploma.  That is crazy!  He tried to tell me that what he was doing was cooler because it is not a program like mine, but then I got him back with that he is going to UTAH out of all places, and I said that was clearly a gay state...ahahaha.  So that was funny.  He is leaving Monday.  Oh right, I got his IM sn so I can talk to him about college and stuff.  So that was interesting.  I didn't talk to Ryan at all.  Thank goodness.   hahahaha, can't believe I ever liked him.  Oh well.  So 9 Volt Nova (their band) was pretty good and the next band (Censored) was awesome!  They were ska and did a lot of covers that I recognized but could not for the life of me remember the name of.  The Punks Unite song...gah, who was that by?  Oh well.  They were awesome.  Then we all just talked in the parking lot for a while.  You know, it kinda sucks how I am leaving when I am finally starting to make friends...oh well.  There was this one guy that I was kindof interested in...but its not like I will ever get to see him enough for anything to ever happen so that's it for that.  Well, for some reason, no one decided to hang out afterwards so Olivia and I just went to Blockbuster and rented Ghostship, which was scary.  It didn't completely make sense or explain everything, but oh well.    So that is it.  I have work in 45 minutes, so I had better go.    -Lisa

      When Jennifer told me that Ben had died, I was in shock.  You know how on all those tv shows when people say things like, "Oh there must be some mistake"?  For a moment, that is what I thought.  I thought that she had to have heard something wrong from somebody and that it was just a sick result of a twisted telephone game.  I was at work, in the middle of a small rush, and all I remember thinking is oh my god.  and all I remember feeling is this sadness.  I suppose I never was close to him.  I mean, we never saw each other outside of school, we never talked to each other save for the occasional greeting, but he was always there, for as long as I can remember.  Since I first met him when I was in the 7th grade and thought he was cute.  The second thought I had was one of how unfair this is.  He seriously was a nice guy.  I know people always say that about people who have died, but he really was.  And as far as I know, everybody loved him.  And he had had such a hard time this past year with his father dying and then his grandfather...and yet he pulled through it all and stayed in school and was still involved in school activities...he probably enjoyed his summer, he was going to be a Senior, he was probably looking forward to it...and then it all just ends.  Just stops.  It's over.  If there was ever any injustice in the world, this is a prime example.  He did not deserve to have his life cut off short like this.  He had his whole life ahead of him.  Graduation, college, marriage, children, a career.  EVERYTHING.  So why the hell does God or fate or whatever decides this stuff decide to CUT IT SHORT?  WHY?  I think the answer is perhaps simple, but not always easy to accept.  I do not think there is a reason.  People die every day, it is just a matter of who and how many.  Why is not important in the scheme of things.  And yet, no matter how many times I tell myself that, it does not stop me from being mad at whatever higher power or being decided to allow this to happen.  Even if there is not one.  Even though I did not know him well, every time I think of him, it will be of him smiling and talking to me after school when we both went to T.A. Howard or him filling me out a tardy pass in the mornings for me to get to class.  It will be of the nice guy that I never heard anything bad about.  I am perhaps not as sad as most, for I probably did not know him as well as most, but I am sad just the same.  And I am left wondering about the why.  Our lives are more fragile than we like to admit.  Because we're young, we like to imagine we have some kind of immortality flowing in our veins because of our youth.  Not one of us believes that we will meet death before finishing school, getting married, and living a full life.  We know that one day death awaits us, but we do not really believe it.  It is too far away, we are too young, there is too much of our life ahead of us.    The truth is that every day could be our last.  Tomorrow you could wake up in a state of nothingness.  The last thing you said to your best friend could be the last thing they ever hear you say.  Tonight could be the last night of your life.  It makes one think.  Are you doing something meaningful with your life?  Do you make the most of each moment, do you live it to the fullest?  Are you surrounding yourself with love and people that love you and people that you love?  Are you living like tonight is the last night of your life?  No one knows without some kind of a doubt what lies beyond our realm of life, although we would like to believe we do.  The only thing anyone knows for sure is that we are here now, living life.  That we live it right is the only thing we can be sure of doing.  The only hard part about that is finding out what living right means to you.  It is a personal meaning that only you can define.  That way if the injust forces of the Universe decide to take you before you have established yourself in the adult working world, you will have enjoyed life to the last drop, and really experienced it before you went.  It may not matter in whatever comes next, but at least you will have not wasted your life.      Today Fifer and I went to Collins Park thrift store and got some cool t-shirts.  I am wearing my element shirt right now.  Then we went to T.J. Maxx and I got some jeans for $15 (Woo!  Have not yet gone over my $20 jean spending limit).  Then I drove her to Summit and she got her schedule fixed.  She has a family development class, hahahahaha.  We wanted to see Mrs. Lands, but she was not there.  Then I went to work.  Jennifer visited me around 9:15 and waited for me to get off at 10:00.  Then we went and played pool at sparetime lanes.  She almost made me cry tonight because she was talking about how she will miss me so much when I go away.  She told me that I am her only and best friend and that things are going to suck when I won't be around.  I told her I was going to cry and she said that I should.    I think I am crying now.  I am gonna miss all you guys so much!  But, I must refrain.  This is not yet my good-bye blog.  I will save this for later.  I need to go to sleep now.  I am in a melancholy mood.  -Lisa

      Eight days until I leave.  I really don't think it has really set in yet.  I mean, I realize that I will be moving away from the Arlington/Mansfield area for the first time in my life and that I will no longer be able to see all of the people I have grown accustomed to seeing, but at the same time, it is like...it hasn't hit me yet.  It may not be until I am away and living on my own that it finally does hit me.  I am still not sure what is the best decision to make, but I have made one, and I am sticking with it.  Besides, I think that this will probably be one of the best experiences of my life.  Hopefully.  So I bought our mini-fridge yesterday.  99.99 plus tax, but it is worth it I think.  I still think that I got the expensive side of things what with having to get a 100 dollar fridge while Naomi gets a 40 dollar microwave but oh well, it matters not.  I had totally forgotten that I had told her that I would go look for a refrigerator after work yesterday so I had already told Fifer I would call her and then Naomi called and reminded me and then said that she had gotten me a ticket to the Rangers game that night.  But it is cool because everything was sorted out in the end.  Well, the game ended up being cancelled because of the storm so Naomi's friend who had invited us invited us to hang out with him and his friends so we went to this random guy's house.  His name was Toby.  So there were about fifteen people there.  Most of them were seniors and there were a few juniors.  They all went to the same school or church or something.  I dunno.  It was fun I suppose, but it is always weird going to someone's house you don't know and hanging out with people that you just met and they are all friends so you are just kind of the outsider.  Naomi was outgoing and whatnot because she had met most of them at some church camp she went to.  At one point, when I was not talking much, she started explaining to people that I was really quiet.  I HATE when people do that.  It is almost like they are talking about you like you are not even there and on top of that, they act like they are apologizing for your behavior.  But oh well.  I just honestly did not have anything to say.  And they were all quite interesting people so for the most part I just enjoyed listening to their conversations.  After a while we all ended up playing Catchphrase.  That was pretty cool.  They seemed like they would be a great group of people to have as friends.    So that was my night.  This morning I woke up to my mom yelling at me.  "Remember to pick up Brian from football!"   "Yeah, yeah, I know, Mom..." ::Looks at watch.  It is 6:00.  Moans and drops head back on pillow:: "And remember that your eye appointment is today at 3:30." ::Bolts up:: "I work at 3:30 today!" "Well then you had better get someone to fill in for you, because they do not have a spot open for another two weeks." ::Falls back down and sleeps::  Yeah, the only person I have the number of is Jennifer, and she has church today.  And she already has more than 40 this week so that is kinda impossible.  So this sucks.  Why couldn't she have told me I have an appointment today at 3:30 before TODAY?!?!?!?!  Oh well.  It matters not.  So then I picked up my brother and got some donuts/sausage rolls and then I came home.  Then the neighbors asked me and my brother if we wanted to go "lift" with them.  My brother does this all the time so I went and hung out in their garage for a bit and watched this guy nearly kill himself lifting over 200 pounds.  That was pretty interesting.  And then I came back here.    On an ending note, I would just like to say that I have a lot of fun with Fifer!  She is one fun person to hang out with.  Seriously, we have fun together because we are just crazy like that.  It is like Fun Inc.  open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Ok...I am done now.  -Lisa

      I love life so much.  I think I will die from happiness overload.  Cowboys was so incredibly fun.  Yay!  Who knew that you could meet such nice 18-year-old guys?  Or that you could have fun playing pool with them?  Or that you would be sitting at Friday's with them an hour later drinking milkshakes?  Not me, that's for sure.  I bet Ashley and JoAnn never did that!!!  hahahahahahahhahahaa.  Not that I am rubbing it in their faces, lol.  I mean, it is not their fault that they thought I was too boring of a person to take clubbing with them...:) :) :).  Oh well, I am sure that next time they will be thrilled to go with me!    So happy about TAMS.  Naomi and I had so much fun tonight and TAMS will be awesome.    Well, I am off to sleep on my balcony tonight, under the stars.  Today I was thinking that if I don't want to be a doctor, I could always be a medicine researcher and help just as many people in that way.  Good idea?  I think it might be.  Hmm...well, bye for real.  -Lisa

      Yesterday was really fun.  Hehehe.  After work, Naomi picked me up with Bethany and we made our way to Dreamworld.  The only problem is, Naomi swore that Abram turned into Division (the street that Dreamworld is on) and sooooo to make a long story short, we went so far down Abram without running into Division and then turning and still not finding it that we made this big loop around Arlington and hit about five cities in 20 minutes.  Mansfield, Arlington, Grand Prairie, Fort Worth, and Pantego.  That took about 30 minutes and then finally we stopped at this gas station (and they made ME get out lol) and we figured out the way to Division.  Not too long after that we got there, finally.  But let me tell you, getting lost with these two was fun, not stressful like it might have been with other people.  We constantly found things to laugh about and such...like the guys in this truck.  We stopped at this red light and these guys were all staring and waving at us, so we were waving back.  They were pretty cute too ;).  We had this flirtatious thing going on for a few miles and then we had to turn left.  But it was ever so funny.  So we got to Dreamworld, and the band that Naomi knew someone from was on.  They were a scream-o band (lol, I saw that word somewhere last night and that it was HILARIOUS.  Emo...screamo...Get it!??!?  Haahahahahahahaha)  and they were pretty good.  The guy that she knew was the bassist and she wore a shirt that she made that said "I   Naomi was driving, so of course, we got lost.  We drove around for like 30 minutes past 360 and into Grand Prairie, but not any of Grand Prairie that I had seen before.  Finally we turned around and I instructed Naomi how to get home from 360.  Then we went to Bobby V's and ate.  That was a lot of fun too.  Naomi and I decided to go to Cowboys tonight....it should be mui, tres (accent grave, correct?) interesting.  I got home ten til midnight and Olivia called like five minutes later, because she was done with her date and was coming over.  After my DVD player was being gay (it wouldn't play Moulin Rouge for some reason...we have issues right now.  I am not talking to it.) we decided to just get on the internet (because that is what all the really cool people do).  Well, it all started with "I Will Always Love You" and us singing our freakin lungs out to it...well, for that one actually it was more like me singing and her watching...but for the rest of them...hahahahahahahahahaha it was sooo fun.  We started downloading all these old pop songs and singing our loudest to them.  It was a trip down memory lane :) :).  Wow, you have no idea how much fun we had.  And then we rated pictures at hotornot.com.  Keep in mind people, if you ever want to put your picture on there, that it will inevitably be met with one of four reactions. 1) Laughter. 2) Awwww.  I feel sorry for him. 3) Eh.  He is ok.  Pretty cute. 4) OMG he is so HOT.  It is completely look-based and so people will give you their opinion entirely based on your appearance, and not your personality.  That was great fun too.  I think we got more of the first reaction more than anything...lol...  Oh and then we went to  this website .  It was very interesting.  But you might have to turn up your volume a little bit, because it is hard to hear at this one part...  Right so we were up until 5.  And then I got up at 10:30.  So I guess I should be tired...but...I'm not!  I can't be...I'm going to Cowboys tonight!!!  If JoAnn reads this, YES I AM GOING WITHOUT YOU.  That is what you and Ashley get for refusing to go with me.  I resent that :) :).    Well, that is all.    -Lisa PS- Hello by Lionel Richie is so beautiful.  I hope someone sings it to me one day...

      Lollapalooza was pretty cool.  I felt kinda bad because I just wasn't as excited about the concert or seeing Incubus as Fifer was, and it was kind of hard for me to get into the music but oh well.  I now have a newfound respect for girl punk bands lol.  I had just heard that one song by the Donnas on the radio and I really hated it, but seeing them live was pretty cool.   I liked Burning Brides because their music was good, and they had a hardcore girl bassist.  If I could play in a punk band, I would sooo do it.  That would be so fun.  Out of the four headliners, I liked Queens of the Stoneage the best.  And then Incubus.  And then Audioslave.  And then...Jane's Addiction.  Funny how that also happens to be the order they played in.  I swear the lead singer of Jane's Addiction dressed like he was gay, but Fifer won't admit it, mua hahahahahahahaha.  It was like a body-tight blue space suit!  I dunno, Jane's Addiction was prolly my least favorite of the night.  That guy's voice just annoys me for some reason...  We saw Shayne, Colin, Heather, Amy, and....JESSICA!!!!!!!!!!!  I really really really really can't stand her.  She was flirting with Shayne, but I have it on good authority that he is not interested in her at all.  She got free tickets apparently and that is the reason she went.  Why couldn't people that actually like the music get free tickets?!?!  That is some messed up stuff.  So, what else happened?  Hmm...oh yeah, at the first set we went to, a drunk guy came up to me and put his arm on my shoulder and was talking to me...that was pretty scary.  I guess the reason I really did not enjoy it as much as I did Warped Tour is that I hate having to be so far away from the stage, that just doesn't get me into the music enough.  Warped Tour's stages were all small ones with no fancy lights and no seats...just the stage, the band, and the crowd.  And that suffices for me.  Plus, I was tired for some reason.  Oh well.  I had fun.  Great, great fun.  If I go to Lolla again, I'll be sure to get pit tickets :) :).  I'm off to a night of bathing and reading...preferrably at the same time if at all possible.  -Lisa

      So I just got done doing most of my dorm shopping, and let me tell you, I am beginning to be very optimistic about the upcoming year.  I mean, I thought that hanging out with Naomi would be kind of hard without getting annoyed, but once I am past some of the stupid things she does, she's not that hard to hang out with.  I actually enjoyed myself.  And we got to talk a lot about our feelings about leaving and how we are excited but nervous, and how we are going to miss everyone but will be glad to leave the high school system and finally be challenged!  We went to Wal-Mart and Target and got everything fairly cheap.  I mean, for about $100 I have everything I need for my room save for the refrigerator.  It is all dark red and blue, we are doing a color scheme type thing...it's going to be pretty cool.  All of you people will have to come up there sometime and see it.  We ate at an Italian place afterwards, and it was really good.  So that was fun.  Hmm...I am excited (but nervous) about leaving in two weeks!!!   "You knew they were there, didn't you?" Kahlan asked in a hushed tone as she leaned closer.         Against the darkening sky, she could just make out the shapes of three black-tipped races taking to wing, beginning their nightly hunt.  That was why he'd stopped.  That was what he'd been watching as the rest of them waited in uneasy silence.   The first two paragraphs of Naked Empire by Terry Goodkind!  Ok, don't ask me why it is named what it is.  I wish it had a cooler title like the sixth book, Faith of the Fallen...or the fourth book, Temple of the Winds...or any of the other books.  But, regardless, it will be an awesome story, as they all undoubtedly always are.  All 7 of the previous ones and now the 8th!  I speak of The Sword of Truth series, if anybody is wondering.  I wandered into the book store today and saw it and had to get it...I had been waiting all summer for it to come out, and it finally did!  But, it sucks because I don't want to start reading it while I am in the middle of Hitchhiker's Guide...so...hmm....will have to read quickly :) :)  Well, that is all.  -Lisa

      It is funny sometimes, how when you think something will be completely unpleasant and horrible to deal with, it turns out to be not nearly as bad as you thought it was going to be.  I really thought that my dad would freak out and be furious with me for getting in a wreck.  But...he was cool about it.  So cool that for a moment I thought that I had gotten another "David" from Information Services.  I feared his wrath.  But I think that perhaps my fear was unjustified.  I don't know.  And this morning, my mom was not really mad anymore, just...a little weird acting.  But I think that maybe all of this will be okay in the end, and I was not expecting things to be cleared up so easily.  In fact, I am actually starting to feel like myself again.  The past couple of days I have not felt quite like I was living my own life, but rather the movie version, if that makes any sense.  I was actually convinced for a few moments after I woke up that I had dreamed the wreck.  And yesterday morning when I woke up I was actually convinced for a few moments that I had dreamed the night before, that is, until I realized Olivia was at my house.  And really, when I look at my life in a certain perspective, I can't believe it's my own.  It's a weird feeling...  "Almost as weird as going to Kroger at midnight and realizing they don't sell Maxi pads, but that they have a section for 'Men's needs'" -olivia  haahahahahahahahahaha.  Sorry, I had to put that :).  When I listen to music now, I feel like I am in it....  The music encompasses me, and I am lost in it.  Maybe that is why I love music so much.  I went and got an estimate today for my mom's car.  The lady said it would be about $1700!!!  For this dent in the corner of the car.  It hardly seems worth it, but as my dad said, "that's why you have insurance" (in a calm and reassuring voice...I'm telling you, it's weird...maybe space aliens have pocessed his body and are experimenting on him).  Of course, half of the cost is labor costs.  It was like 30 hours at $36/hour or something like that.  Personally, I don't think that it would take 30 hours to fix it, but whatever.  I think maybe I will get another estimate just to see if I am getting ripped off.  Well, I'm off to my dad's and then to the skating competition!!  I'll prolly write more later...oh, and just in case none of you know what I am talking about, just read the entry below...it explains a lot.  -Lisa

      I hate driving, I hate driving, I hate driving.  I really hate driving, I really hate driving, I really hate driving.  I wish I could crawl into a hole and never come out.  You know that feeling when your parents get mad at you, but its not for something like not cleaning your room, but something like getting into a wreck with their car?  Oh my God, I HATE driving.  I am such a horrible driver, and I feel like crap.  It's like one minute your driving down Green Oaks on your way home from work like any other normal evening and suddenly you realize that the car in front of you is stopping just a little too quickly and you are following just a little too closely and you know you are not going to be able to stop in time.  So you swerve to avoid a collision but still hit the car with the corner of yours and pieces of metal and glass shoot out and you stop dead in the middle of the road, freaking shaking and crying and feeling like you want to be dead.  Then a car that was behind you drives by you and flicks you off/cusses you out.  And the car you hit drives onto the side of the road and just...waits for you.  And so you drive by and roll the window down and profusely apologize because it was entirely your fault and the person you hit turns out to be THE FATHER OF ONE OF YOUR CO-WORKERS DRIVING HIM HOME FROM WORK.  And nothing is really wrong with his car except for a scratch or two and then he is like, "Well, you better look at your car.  That is what I am worried about."  And then it hits you.  HOLY SHIT.  My car...my car...my mom's car...crap crap crap crap crap crap CRAP.  So you get out of the car and you see the huge dent in the corner of your car.  SHE IS GOING TO KILL ME are the only comprehensible thoughts in your head as you sort out the final details with the guy and drive away, and you can't stop shaking and you are on the verge of tears the entire way home and then when you tell your mom about it she just gets really angry and silent and walks back to her room, leaving you to cry out on the driveway and you know that you have screwed up bad and you just want to crawl in a hole and die somewhere.  And then your brothers have no emotions and try to tease you about it when really, that just makes you want to cry even harder.  And then you realize that you have to tell your dad the next day and face his disappointment and anger and lectures and you'll probably put all of your money that you have been saving for TAMS towards fixing the freakin thing and you want to cry even more and it is like why does one of the best nights of my life have to be followed by one of the worst?  This is the worst I have felt in a long time.  Last night was like a dream, tonight is like a nightmare.  I would have tons to write about last night if it were not for this overshadowing the good time I had.  I HATE DRIVING, holy freaking crap.  I cannot even describe how spectacularly crappy I feel at the moment.  Last night I just hung out with Olivia, Colby, Jordan, and Seth until like 4 in the morning.  It was sooo incredibly fun.  But it matters not now.  God, I can't believe how stupid I am.  I feel like such a horrible person.  -Lisa PS- My brother fixed my computer.

      Hey Everyone Just so yall know, if I am not online at all anytime soon it is because my computer is being gay and is broken and refuses to start up.  All that happens is a blue screen comes up and says some crap about how Windows cannot be started because of something that was improperly installed and I need to uninstall it but how am I supposed to uninstall it if I cannot get on my freakin computer???   So yeah, I hope this is fixable, because that is the computer I was gonna bring to TAMS.  It would suck so much if I could not bring a computer there.  Sigh...Whyyyy does my computer have to start sucking now????  So, yeah, that's why I am nowhere to be found!!  -Lisa

      So yeah, I have just been working the past couple of days.  Oh, and I bought some shoes this morning.  I like them.    Jennifer's reaction:  "Yes, they are very Lisaish." Olivia's reaction:  "Yeah, they look like just about every other pair of shoes you own."  Ok, ok, so I don't like to change my style.  Jeans, t-shirts, and tennis shoes til the day I die!  Lessee, then I worked after that.  I got off at 7:15 though so I had time to actually enjoy my evening.  First Olivia and I went and ate dinner at Wiener Schnitzel (heh, it is funny trying to pronounce that when you say it like 5 times in a row...) and then she left to go somewhere with Alex (her soon-to-be boyfriend) and I went and visited JoAnn in her groundedness.  I hung out with her and Victoria for a while and then I went home, and upstairs, and got on my computer.  Olivia is supposed to be coming back over around midnight so we can watch movies and whatnot...maybe go swimming, I dunno.  Sooooo, that is my life.  Interesting, no?  Wednesday will be fun.  I get to go to the skater competition!  And then Friday is Lollapalooza.  Yay.  Peace, Lisa

      So I keep having this recurring dream and it kind of freaks me out.  A lot actually.  So I am in this movie theatre type thing with a crowd of people.  I mean, it is crazy how many people are in there with me and this guy comes in there and locks all the doors so no one can get out and then he hides and he is like, "The first person to find me, I will either spare their life or kill them, but I will not tell you which."  So no one knows whether or not to look for him and everyone starts running around in a panic.  Then this one girl finds him and he is like, "This decides what happens.  Either I kill you and everyone else here lives, or I give you this match and this key and you walk out but you have to strike the match and throw it on the ground (which happens to be doused with gasoline...I dunno how I knew that, but dreams work in strange ways)."  Up until last night/morning, I had never remembered what she picked or maybe my mind just didn't dream it, I don't know....but she picked something last night.  It makes you wonder doesn't it?  What would you choose?  I mean, of course we would like to think that we would choose to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of 100 people or so...but I guess you do not really know until something like that actually happens, which is about 99.9% unlikely.  It is like that one story, The Lady and The Tiger...the princess has to choose whether or not her secret lover chooses one door with a tiger behind it so that he is eaten alive, or the other door with a woman behind it, that he would marry and be with for the rest of his life.  Would the princess let her jealousy go so far as to let her lover die so that he would never know the love of another woman???  Do I just think too much?  My dreams are crazy, especially as of late.  -Lisa

      Wow, yesterday was so fun.  Almost unbelievably so.    After the tennis tryouts that I watched in the morning (wrote about those in the last entry), Olivia and I went shopping for a little while and that was really fun.  She was going to use my no-rules house to come to after a late date with her "friend" Alex, but she decided not to in the end.  I got another pair of jeans for only $20 and avoided The Buckle, lol.  But I saw the guy again!!! I was like, "Olivia!  Hide me!!"  It was funny.  After that I came home and my mom said that Jennifer had been calling me all day so I called her and she says she wants to do something tonight and I was like, "Well, me and the other Jennifer are doing something tonight, so we can all go."  and she is cool with that, so yeah.    Jennifer's sister is a big fag.  She hates me for absolutely no reason at all, save for the fact that I am her sister's friend.  And she is just a big whiny fag.  Ok, enough said.  Victoria had an away message that said something about the concert she was going to at 8:00 so I thought that would be fun to go to, but Jennifer's mom wasn't answering her phone so she couldn't ask her to go, which was ok because we decided to try and find the skatepark that Nick had told me about.  I don't think any of us really expected to find it, especially after the directions we got from the guys at the gas station, but we did, finally.  In the middle of nowhere.  All the guys there were kinda young and no one was spectacularly good.  There was this one guy that was pretty cute and me and Jennifer watched a lot.  But he ended up being a jerk.  When Jennifer waved to him and tried to say hi or whatnot he moved to the other side of the park and started totally avoiding us.  Soooo, whenever we left, I drove up to this big opening and we just sat there watching him.  He was kinda freaked out, and then Jennifer honked the horn and the turned around and was all, what the...?  Ahahahahahhaa.  Then we left.  I think Jennifer, Fifer, and I were all dying from laughter.  Twas great.  Then, HOOTERS!!!!  I was just curious.  I mean, I had never been there before, and I knew it wasn't like a strip club or anything.  Although, I guess it was kind of strange seeing three girls go in there without any guys.  But oh well.  On our way in there were three guys hanging out outside and they were all, "Hello ladies" and I was like, "Hi." and then one of them was like, "Do you work here?"  hahahahahahahaha.  I laughed and was like, "Uhhh, no."  Fifer was right behind me laughing too.  But it raised my self esteem!  A guy thought that I was as pretty as the girls that work there!  (Which I don't think I am, but whatever...he prolly wasn't paying attention to face/hair/whatever else is above the chest....lol)  Anyway, the food was actually really good, and our waitress was really nice.  The only thing different in that place from a normal restaurant is that the clothes that the waitresses wear are just a tad more skimpy than regular clothes...heh.  The only freaky part was when these old men started talking to/hitting on us.  I am sooo inspired to get a job there...lol...ok ok, I am like 75% kidding, but seriously...think of the tips you would get!! You'd be rich!  So anyway, after that, we went to Kroger for a bit, and Jennifer talked to her old man crush, and I talked to Daniel a bit, although I have decided that I don't have a crush on him because....well, just because.  As of right now, I don't really have a crush on anyone.  It's kinda nice, kinda not.  Heh, I wonder if I'll ever be married.  Then I dropped Jennifer off and me and Fifer went to my house.  We both fell asleep pretty soon after the movie started because I was really tired.  Today all I did was swim and then go to work.  That was boring.  Oh well.  Lisa  PS- 18 DAYS!!!!!!!!  (Am I excited or dreading the prospect of leaving???  It varies on a minute-to-minute basis)

      so these last couple of days have been interesting.  Wednesday I went with Jennifer to Burgers Lake because it was Kroger's company picnic thing.  I was like, "You know, Jennifer, there aren't going to be people our age there with Kroger.  It is going to be a bunch of 40-year-old men and their families playing horseshoes and eating barbeque."  Well, I was right about everything but the horseshoes.  Except for this one guy, Cody, that was there with his mom and little brother.  He was absolutely beautiful and he was playing with his little brother who was like 2 or 3.  It was soooo cute.  He was probably 17 or 18.  And then there were all the guys that went there just because it was burgers lake.  Jennifer somehow convinced me to jump off of the tallest diving board....I don't know how she did that.  I hadn't jumped off the diving board since...umm....6th grade?  7th?  Gah, it's been so long, I don't even remember.  And then we did a lot of swimming in general.  It was fun.  Afterwards we ate barbeque with the old folks and then played some volleyball.  That was a lot of fun too.  I think Jennifer and I kind of made our peace.  I had been really annoyed with her for most of the summer, but we talked some things out and I think we're ok now.  So that is good.  When I got home, my brothers and I all went swimming until around midnight.  That is about it.  Thursday I worked and then Olivia and I went to a midnight showing of American Wedding.  That was really fun.  There were a lot of people that showed up.  A lot of the workers and their friends.  Most of them were cool, except for a couple of them.  The movie itself was hilarious at parts and disgusting at others.  There were parts that made me just shudder and gasp in shock.  I guess I should be glad that I am still capable of being shocked and not desensitized to everything.  This morning I got up and went to watch the tennis tryouts again.  I brought donuts for everyone.  Still trying not to think about how much I am going to miss everyone and everything so much.  How many times have I written that before?  I don't know, but I know that it is true.  Last night I had this dream and I do not even remember exactly how it went.  All I know is that it had to do with a couple guys I know.  Anyways, I woke up this morning with that weird awkward feeling that you get after you do something that makes you feel guilty or stupid and then you have to see the person that saw you do it.  Like a "I wanna crawl into a hole and die" type feeling.  And it's really weird, because I still have it, and I am not even sure why.  Hmm...interesting the way the mind works, eh?  Well, I am off.  Going shopping today, woo!    Lisa

      Mua ha.  We just got docked for quiet hours.  Hehe.  I was sitting on my bed when I had the vague suspicion that something was wrong.   Oh wait ...I thought... is that my saline cracker...moving?     Yes, yes it was.  Or more accurately, it was the WORM on the cracker moving.  And we were all eating them (the crackers, not the worms).  The announcement of my discovery was followed by a rush to the bathroom across the hall to rinse out our mouths and much screaming and laughing (from shock).  Apparently, we were being very loud, so our RA said she was going to doc us.  Hah.  We deserved it though, although it was well worth it.  Ugh.  Can't believe I was eating those crackers.  Disgust.  I went and tutored high school students today.  At first, I was afraid that they would hate us, because we are their age or younger, and helping them out.  But, most of them were pretty cool.  I mainly helped out this guy with electronics (I don't know why he took this class, because he didn't seem to have a desire to learn about it.), which I did not know anything about, so I was kinda teaching myself the chapter as we went along, and I helped him step by step do this problem.  So, I now know like four or five electronics formulas!  It was interesting, I should take it as an elective sometime.  Hmm...and another Sailing Club/Team meeting.  Signed up for my second practice.  Should be fun.  Am excited.  Woop.  English was only like 5 minutes long today.  Sooo cool.    On our way back from eating, Naomi, Rebecca, and I were doubled over with laughter.  I seriously had to stop in the middle of the parking lot because I was laughing so hard.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  Not since I have been here, for sure.  It was fun.  So, yeah, today was definitely a good day.  And now I am off.  Bye!  Lisa

      So I just finished my last pop ice.  It was banana flavored.  I think I am addicted.  But, it's all good.  At least I am addicted to pop ice and not like...glue sniffing...or antifreeze...or something.  So, the weekend, while very relaxing, was also unproductive as far as studying goes, although I did manage to drag myself through the 2 and a half hours worth of Pre Cal homework he gave us.  Yesterday I was kinda bored all day because Naomi, Rebecca, Laura, and pretty much everyone else was doing something all day, and so I didn't have anyone to hang out with.  At some point, I hung out with Jonathan and Osato in Smitty and beat Osato at pool and this other guy at ping pong.  Then I...did nothing, I think.  Naomi and Rebecca got back soon and we all decided to go to 7-11 and Jack in the Box and that was really fun.  All the college people were all yelling and getting drunk because we had won the game.  Then, we went and played soccer, just the three of us, and we were joined by this one guy later on.  It was pretty cool.  Today it was so pretty outside that I "studied" outside for a little over two hours.  When I say study, I really mean that I did five Pre Cal problems over the course of two hours and spent the rest of the time thinking, enjoying the beautiful scenery, and listening to my autumn CD that I burned today.  I burn one of those every year.  There are just songs that need to be listened to in fall weather.  Then, I ate with a bunch of people.  Then, Naomi and I went and played tennis for two hours.  We went into a three-setter.  It was some hardcore stuff.  We played some nice points.  I won 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.  Then we played a set of doubles with these two guys that I am pretty sure were gay.  That was interesting.  That is about it.  It was a nice weekend, I suppose.  Ciao amigos.  Lisa

      So, apparently, sailing is a sport.  No, I'm serious.  You get a semi-workout!!  At least for your muscles.  Today Laura and I were talking after English and she tells me how her, Lisa, and Gilda are all going sailing with UNT's sailing club this afternoon, and she invited me to go.  I was like, "Sure!"  We rode with this guy, Zach, who is practically professional when it comes to sailing, and he was....nice...but...he is one of those guys that like....has no apparent sense of humor.  Everything is informative to him it seems...but I dunno...maybe we just had different senses of humor.   His choice of music was country.  And ok, as much as punk rock is my passion and soul as far as music goes, there will always run in my veins country blood.  My entire family is diehard country folks.  I know almost every song out there, and listening to country sometimes just relaxes me and reminds me of how time at my grandmother's house seems to stand still.  Life is so relaxed and pleasant, and country people have attitude.  I love it.  Like, there was this one song, and the chorus was basically, "Screw you, we're from Texas.  Screw you, we're from Texas.  Screw you, we're from Texas.  We're from Texas, Screw You!"  It was sooo funny, because that is how the hardcore small town Texans are.  They aren't Americans, they are Texans.  I love being from Texas, it is great.  Sailing itself was soo fun.  We went to this lake about 45 minutes away and it was really beautiful.  First, I sailed on this one called a "Sunfish" and that was basically just a one person boat.  It is kinda confusing knowing when to pull the sail in and let it go out, and tacking is kinda confusing sometimes, but I got the hang of it after a while.  However, the really fun part was sailing the 420.  That is a two-person boat.  Twas Zach and I.  He was the "skipper" and I was the "crew" which means that he steered and did all the complicated stuff while I took care of the front sail.  I got to hike, which was fun, and tacking was really fun, and after a while, it gets tiring.  But, it is really fun.  I felt soo stupid though.  Sometimes I should just not talk.  He said something about regattas and I was like, "Oh, you do races?"  (Looks at me like I am dumb)  "That is all being in sailing club is about."  :)  Oops.  Haha.  But it was really fun.  I think I am going to go next week.  I should take this up as a hobby.  After that, I chilled for a while, eating and whatnot, and then it was off to Argentinean Tango!!  It was really fun as well!  My first partner was Kyle, and he really wanted to learn, which was good.  I think we had good chemistry as far as dancing goes.  We got the hang of it after a while.  My second partner was this other guy I don't know the name of.  Then I danced with this other guy named...Raul??  Something like that.  And then I danced with Carlos...the roommate of Kenney, the guy that I thought I liked for a while but then decided I didn't.  Carlos was a pretty good dancer.  We did one of the more advanced moves.  Twas pretty cool.  I dunno, it was different from what I thought it would be.  I guess real tango, at least the Argentinean kind, isn't like what they show on movies and stuff.  You don't get all close to your partner and stuff, although our insructor said you could do whatever after you got the basics down.  But, the basics include staying about a foot apart from each other, with the guy's hand on the girl's back, and the girl's hand on the guy's shoulder and the other two hands holding.  I'll have to show some of you people some time.  I am going to start doing that every Friday too :).  Then Rebecca and I walked around a lot and talked, and went to 7-11, Sack-n-save, and IHOP.  I had a really fun night tonight.  Yes, quite fun, quite fun.  :)   Well, we are having a Moulin rouge party in my room after curfew so I'll go now.    -Lisa

      Hmm...interesting night...  So, I have this picture of the moon on my desktop now, right?  And so everytime I get on my computer I feel like I am WALKING ON THE MOON.  It is pretty mind-blowing, if I do say so myself.  If you are not interested in why money stresses me out, skip the entire next two paragraphs...  Ah, where do I start?  Oh yes.  Money.  I went to the financial aid lady today.  I thought that I was going to have everything covered with my loans and stuff.  Well, she told me that I could get a room and board scholarship for about 75% of what it is, but that I would have to unaccept all the loans I had already accepted and you know, it would be better because then it is free money that I wouldn’t have to pay back and whatnot.  So, I unaccepted them, and I don’t regret that decision.  I mean, I don’t want to start out my life with over $2,000 in debts that I didn’t have to have.  So, yeah…that scholarship still only covers 75% and with my grants and such, that would be almost perfect…I would only have around $33 to pay each semester to go to TAMS.  However, this year, with budget cuts and all, we have to pay about $1000 in tuition and for some reason, we have to pay it all this semester.  We cannot split it in half and pay $500 next semester or anything.  My loans, had I accepted them, would have covered that and room and board.  Basically, what it comes down to is that I have to come up with $1100 this semester.  That is like impossible.  She said I could reapply for loans after I get my room and board scholarship, but then it is based on only what money need I have left, and the loan people don’t figure in the $1,000 I pay of tuition because I pay that through TAMS, and not the university.  So she said that will only give me about $250 more this sesmester which still leaves me with around $850 to pay!!!  I don’t think my parents can really pick that up.  I mean, I don’t know for sure, but I know I don’t want to make them pick it up.  So, I don’t know what I am going to do.  *Sigh* Stupid budget cuts.  She said that every year before this, the students didn’t even have to pay anything, TAMS would just pick up 100% of their need.  Oh well.  I guess I will just have to deal with it.    How?  I don’t really know.  I guess I could try to get a job over Christmas break and then pay my parents back with the money I earn then.  Because I may be able to call Kroger and ask them if they need any extra help for the holidays, since those are extremely busy.  But, once again, I don’t know if I could get hired for a month or not.  Geez, things are confusing.  I wouldn’t be so reluctant to ask my parents for that money if I thought that I would be going to a college that accepted all of the college hours I earn during these two years.  But, for the most part, private universities rarely accept more than 12 to 16 transfer credits…hmm…I am checking into Boston University, but I don’t know for sure.  I think that right now, that is the school I want to go to the most.  That or George Washington in D.C.  That one looked pretty cool as well.  I mean, I will apply to a couple of Ivy Leagues just for the heck of it, but I don’t know if I could get in.  Of course, it may end up that I will not even be able to go to a private school, since they cost so much.  But that is where I would want to go, if I get enough scholarships and financial aid.  It kinda sucks how much money my family doesn’t have.  I am thinking that once Jason graduates in December next year, it will be less of a financial strain on my dad, but I just don’t  know!!  Why does education cost so much?  Dunja used to tell me how in Croatia, if you made really good grades, and you were smart or whatnot, the government just paid for you to go to school where ever you wanted to go.  It should be like that here.  Oh well.  I need to stop thinking about this money situation or I will go crazy.  *END OF FINANCIAL BORINGNESS NOW*  Tonight was pretty fun.  I went to Clark with Sarah and Sal and ate.  That was pretty cool.  And then I went to watch karoke.  Man, TAMS is the home of some of the funniest kids.  Ever.  Haha.  It was really funny.  I have just hung out with Naomi and Rebecca a lot.  It was great, great fun.  Much laughing, many jokes...ah, every night is like a sleepover.    Except for the night before a bio test, of course.  Er yeah, Jaison IMed me tonight and was like all inviting me to get drunk with him.  I can't tell if he was being serious or not because he is weird like that sometimes.  Hmm...I am gonna have to talk to him tomorrow.  Well, That is all!  Lisa

      Oops, haha, my first tuition payment of $500 was due on September 10th.  Eek.  Oh well, :).    So I got a good grade on my biology exam...one of the highest in the Junior class.  Hmm...I was excited about that for a while.  But, you know, I am just in one of those moods when I don't really have an opinion on all too much, except that I am really tired of math.  Urg.  So much math I have to do the next two years.  Calculus next semester.  Calc 2 and something else (Calc 3, Linear Algebra? Economics?) next year.  Too much.  I think I had better teach myself to love it.  Step 1) Forget that I hate it. Step 2) Convince myself that I like it. Step 3) This will develop into love.  I guess sometimes it is ok.  I actually like doing problems when it isn't like 20 or 30 problems that I have to do in one night.  *Sigh* oh well.  We go into trigonometry (sp?) sometime this upcoming week.  Yay.  I also have to write an essay on this poem that makes absolutely no sense.  I mean, I guess it could make sense if you looked at it in a certain perspective, but it is just messed up.  "Portrait of a Child" by Corey Marks.  I mean, what the crap, where do these people come up with this stuff?!  Hmm...Blah.  That is kinda how I feel.  Just blah.  Sometimes, I miss home so much.  I miss Olivia, Fifer, Jennifer, Amy, my little brother, JoAnn, Ashley, my mom, my dad, Leah, Jon, the other Ashley, and Dunja...and everyone at school.  And I mean everyone.  I miss everyone that I grew up with.  I mean, here is great and everything.  I have tons of fun and there are lots of really cool people that I am friends with, but I just miss everyone so much.  I often find myself wondering what this year would be like had I stayed at Summit.  I was just fitting into a group of friends when I left, and I kinda wish I had gotten to see how that turned out.  But at the same time, it is a good thing that I came here.  Going back to high school right now would be hell.  Just because once you are used to this, there is no going back without realizing how much high school sucks.  Hmm...so many mixed emotions.  In other news, I kinda wish Osato would stop hinting at stuff and then not telling me any straight facts.  Like today. "Me and Jonathan stayed up talking about you for like 30 minutes last night." "Really?  What did y'all say about me?" "Just stuff.  It was good stuff, don't worry." I asked him a couple more times, but he refuses to tell me what he is talking about, as usual.  I dunno.  Sometimes I think he is just making stuff up, but why would he make stuff up like that?  Wow, this is a really boring blog.  I should probably try to make it more interesting now.  So, on Sunday, Naomi cut off all her hair to give to Locks of Love, which is basically a foundation that makes wigs out of real hair to give to cancer patients and the such.  I thought it was a really cool idea and a really generous thing of her to do.  She cut off about 16 inches in the end, what with trimming and all.  It was pretty crazy.    I think I need to get some more opinions.  I am so non-opinionated.  Especially when it comes to politics.  I need political stands, don't ya think?  I mean, I don't even know whether or not I like GW as our president.  I talk to a lot of people who are so pro or anti something and I am just like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever floats your boat."  Hmm...I guess some things just don't matter a whole lot to me.  So, tomorrow is the season premiere of Gilmore Girls.  I am very excited.  Apparently, Luke is supposed to have gotten married on the cruise he took with that one woman, but she is stupid, and I think I also heard that they are gonna get divorced asap.  They had better.  Luke and Lorelai all the way!  And I am Pro-Dean as well.  Isn't it sad that I have more adamant opinions about a prime time television show than I do the state of our president/government?  I think it is pretty messed up.  Oh well.  Being in an apathetic mood and all, I guess there is not much I can do about it.  Well, I am off to try and decipher this stupid poem.  Wish me luck.  au revoir lisa

      I know it says Sunday, but it is Saturday.  And I know yesterday's says Saturday, but it was really Friday.  Today I was awakened by Fifer calling me at 7:30.  Her:  Hey Lisa Me: rrriasffjrigdjfkdgirr Her: Oh, I’m sorry, are you asleep? Me: hmm not anymore…  I went and helped out with “Denton Kids” for a while.  The kid I was helping out was kinda rebellious.  He kept trying to steal all the prizes, and then when it was time for coloring, he decided that the paper was too boring to draw on, so he started drawing on the tables.  So, I was like, “Ok, Edward, the tables aren’t for drawing on.”  And so naturally, he started drawing on me.  *Sigh* I don’t know if I could ever handle having kids.  He was bearable towards the end because I distracted him with tic tac toe, which he liked for some reason.  When we were driving back, I looked out of the window and saw Mrs. Lands!  I was all, “Hurry up!!!” and so I ran over there and said hi to Fifer and Mrs. Lands and Ruchi.  It was interesting while it lasted.  Then I went thrift shopping for a while, but it wasn’t like a real thrift store, it was like a fake one, and it really annoyed me.  They sold the kind of really random shirts that aren’t really random because they are made at factories to look random and they were selling for freakin $12 a shirt.  That is not thrifting!!  What are those people thinking?!  Then I read/slept for a while and then Rebecca came and got us and we all went out to the fields and played a little soccer between the three of us.  It was such a beautiful day outside.  We all were laying on the ground talking for a while.  It was great.   Hah, and tonight was the annual Screw Your Roommate Dance.  I wore a non t-shirt (gasp), and some nice jeans that I have only worn twice before.  And I actually put on some makeup, which is weird for me.  My date ended up being…..Jonathan!  Haha.  That guy is hilarious.  And he is pretty cute too…  Him and Osato are roommates, and so, for the dance, Jonathan wore one of Osato’s “pimping” outfits and Osato wore Jonathan’s all-American white boy clothes.  It was soooooooo-------------- funny.  They are the funniest pair.  So, yeah, it was pretty interesting, I guess, that Jonathan and I were matched up.  He was #2 on my list and I don’t know if I was on his.  The first time we danced, it was somewhat awkward, but after that, it was cool.  He is so much taller than me though.  I was all looking up at him.  Hmm…he had to leave early though because his parents insist on picking him up really early every Sunday morning and he is one of those guys that has to have lots of sleep.  I also ended up dancing with Osato, Mordechai, and Alejandro (my goodness, why can’t they have normal names?!)  Mordechai talked to me about how he likes Naomi, Alejandro didn’t really talk to me about anything, and Osato talked to me about…Jonathan.  I think he is trying to hook us up.  He was all, “Sooo, you and Jonathan got to spend some quality time together tonight?” and I was like, “Uh, I guess so.” and he was like, “Yeah, he is a nice guy, you know?” and I was like, “Yeah, he is.” and then he was like, “And he has a cute smile…right, right?”  It was like he was trying to get me to say that I liked Jonathan, and it isn’t the first time he has tried to do that.  I don’t know if I would go for Jonathan.  He is, as Osato pointed out, a very nice guy, and he does have a cute smile.  And he is quite hilarious.  But, do we get along in a way that would be good for dating-wise?  I don’t know.  I guess  I won’t try to decide anything right now.  I don’t think that he would ever like me anyway, so I guess it would be pointless to decide to develop a crush on him…ANYway…  On an unrelated topic, I feel really bad.  Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut.  Last night and today I had convinced Rebecca that Sal liked her, and she liked him, so she was all happy.  I got her hopes up, and then tonight she found out that he told Naomi that he did not like her.  I felt crappy.  From now on, I will not try to convince anyone that the person they like likes them in return.  We went outside for a while though, and just sat talking about things.  Here is my deal:  I feel so behind other people my age.  I mean, I haven’t ever really had a real relationship.  I haven’t ever had my first kiss.  Sometimes I just wish I could have already.  I want to experience all that, I really do, but at the same time, I am not desperate, and I don’t want to just get together with any old guy that comes along.  You know?  I want my first kiss to be somewhat special.  I want any relationship I have to be because we both like each other, not because one of us needed a boyfriend or girlfriend for the week.  And for some reason, guys don’t like me.  I mean, I don’t think I am ugly.  I’m definitely not all that pretty, but I don’t think I am ugly, and I am friendly around guys and the such, but they just are never interested in me…and it has always been that way.  I don’t know what I do wrong.  Gah.  I just see all these couples together and it depresses me.  What do I want, anyway?!?!?  I don’t freakin know.  I am so confused.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  The End  Lisa

      Today was the first day of true fall weather.  And I absolutely love it.  I woke up this morning primed and ready for the biology test.  This first biology test is the one everyone talks about.  It is supposed to be the "wake up call" for most Juniors, it is freakin hard, there are only a few select A's.  In short, it makes or breaks you as far as biology goes, which is one of the most stressed Junior classes we take.  It goes into stuff REALLY in depth.  Chapters 1-5 were a review of stuff I should have learned in High School biology, had I taken it.  We tested over Chapters 1-6.  It was crazy.  Keep in mind that last week I didn't know the difference between a cell membrane and a mitochondria.  Today I can tell you that and then some and then some and THEN SOME.  It is amazing how much I have taught myself about biology (utilizing the book, of course).  So, I studied hours upon hours, days upon days, and yes, I was prepared for this test.  I woke up an hour early this morning and was in a very good mood.  When I went outside and smelled the crisp, fall air, I was in an even better mood.  It was a bit chilly, so I went back upstairs and got my letter jacket.  It made me feel all warm, fuzzy, and...lettery.  The test was...almost easy.  It would have been hard if I hadn't studied.  It is weird because this is the first time in my life that I actually had to work hard and actually do hardcore studying for a test.  It makes me feel good inside.  After that, I had an awesome day.  I went to two more classes, went out to eat like twice, and then a bunch of us watched 36 Crazy Fists in our room.  It was soooo funny.  It was this old Asian kung fu movie with really bad english dubs.  Aw man...sooo hilarious.  It was all, "Return my hand!" ::Guy gives him his severed hand back:: "Mua hahahahahahaha."  Maybe you would just have to see it to understand the hilarity, but it was there, let me tell you.  Then, Rebecca and I wrote our news article about roommates together.  It was the first time I have ever cowritten anything.  It was pretty interesting.  It turned out to be...er...something.  Haha.  Next issue I am going to write some real stories or editorials I think.  Naomi decided to go out with some of her guys, so it was just Rebecca, me, Sal, Osato, and Jonathan that went to play soccer and they wanted to play indoor for some reason, which turned out to be not such a hot idea.  We were playing with all these 20-sumthin-year-old-guys that thought they were all good, but really they were just ball hogs and would not pass Rebecca or I the ball because we were girls.  Ok, so the ball was really high up in the air so I went to head it and then the RETARD in front of me decided he was going to do a bicycle kick to get it into the goal (even though he was not good enough to do it).  He kicked me as hard as he could under my jaw.  There was a burst of pain, and then blinding white light, and I hit the ground.  Osato rushed to my rescue I guess you could say.  I was crying because of the pain and I couldn't move my mouth.  He just escorted me off the court field thing and then he just ran back out there wanting to play some more.  So, I just proceeded to leave by myself.  But, Rebecca wouldn't let me so she came with me.    My mouth was full of blood and my jaw is disaligned (I think I just butchered that word and I am not even sure it is a word...).  For a while, it felt as if my ears were bleeding too, but that faded after a while.  I cried for like a minute and then stopped because I HATE crying in front of anyone.  It is just not me.  By the time we were out of the rec center, I was laughing at myself again, despite the constant pain.  Other than that, my evening was grand.  Rebecca and I hung out for the most part of the evening.  We battled it out on DDR (I am actually developing something that resembles skill at that game).  It was so fun!  And then we baked cookies, and hung out with people.  It was pretty fun...  Tomorrow will be a busy day.  I think I get to see Fifer (Woo!) and then I am helping with Denton Kids and then the Screw Your Roommate Dance is tomorrow night!  I wonder who my date is.  Ah, the suspense is killing me.  You know, sometimes, when I look at all these other couples being all happy, I wish I had a guy.  I just...haven't really met anyone I am really interested in yet.  *Sigh* I just dunno...I just...don't.  Lisa

      Fifer, I am not avoiding you!  I promise!  After my test Friday, I will prolly be an internet addict just as bad as ever!!  Ok, so the past couple of days I have been really busy.  Basically, I am teaching myself an entire semester's worth of biology in a period of about 5 days.    And I don't think I did so hot on my Pre Cal test that I took yesterday.  I get the grade back tomorrow, and I am mui afraid.    In other news, I sliced my head open on a nail today but it didn't hurt after about a minute so I just went about my business and then I realized I was bleeding but I didn't think it could be too bad...and then I started getting very sleepy all of a sudden...  After Naomi woke me up, she examined my head and was like, "Oh my gosh, it is like an inch long and is really deep...and bloody.."  Ah, I had a good laugh about that, let me tell you.  I don't think that is still affecting me I mean I haven't passed out yet or anyth,;vl;k

      OK, I honestly, honestly, honestly do NOT understand the male species...and YES, they are a species, a completely different one from the Female SPECIES.  Nothing as simple as gender could be the differentiating factor between two organisms that share NOTHING in common (save for the fact that we are both human, which is of little to no importance).  And NOT just when it comes to the romantic side of things, even when it is just concerning the day-to-day platonic friendships you hold with them.    FOR INSTANCE.  Today, everyone who had been playing soccer was racing back to the dorms to beat curfew when I tripped (as I do fifty million times a day) and totally wiped out on the cement.  I writhed in pain on the ground for a few seconds and Jonathan stopped and was all, "Oh my gosh!  Are you alright?  Do you need ice?  Are you alright??"  and I was just like, "CURFEW!!!" and jumped up and sprinted inside.  Once inside, we examined my bloddy knees and shins and he was all being concerned and sweet about it and kept asking if I needed ice for it and everything.  He was just being really sweet.  Ok, so I call him and I thank him and I am like, "I just want to say thank you for stopping to see if I was ok and all that." and then said some other stuff.  Him:  "Yeah, ok."  END OF PHONE CONVERSATION.  Maybe I am just making a big deal out of something that is not a big deal, but does anyone understand it?  And Osato, who for the past four or five days has been kinda ignoring me and being rude to me sometimes gets all concerned all of a sudden and calls me up to make sure I am alright.  The first freakin time he has really talked to me in a week and he acts like we are the best of friends...I just don't get it.  And Jaison.  I mean, really.  Don't know what to think about him.  Last week he called me like three or four times, talked to me a lot.  Now...nothing.  Do guys just get tired of being friends with certain girls sometimes or WHAT!?!?  I don't understand.  I would hate trying to understand a guy if I were ever in a relationship.  Maybe I will just never get married.  It would save a lot of confusion on my part, that's for sure.  Maybe it is like they say in Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.  Men are like rubberbands.  They get all close and then they pull away and then THE CYCLE STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.  Why can't they just make up their freakin minds?  Ok, that is my rant of the day :).  My apologies go out to the guy and/or guys who read this.  -Lisa  Scene from my dorm room tonight: Lisa is on computer talking to Naomi over AIM BananaFroggie: aye that she does ::Naomi jumps out of the chair and starts spazzing out on the floor:: Lisa:  What the heck are you doing?!  ::Looks at computer screen:: supertomatoe: rofl Naomi:  You can't say it if you don't mean it. ::Lisa can't stop laughing for minutes on end::  College life is the greatest.

      So the weekend was cool.  I slept in both days until really late, but it was good since I did not go to sleep until around 4:00 both Friday and Saturday night.  I had a nice, relaxing weekend full of soccer, movies, and Pre Cal studying (our first test is Tuesday).    Saturday night I watched Say Anything with John Cusack and thought that it was really cute and then I went to the coffee haus thing, which is just like an open mike thing for anyone.  There were some pretty WEIRD people that got up there to talk.  This one girl did this speech that didn't make any sense at all, and I think the only reason she liked it was because of how many times it let her yell a curse word really loud.  Rebecca and I were just like, "Riiiiight."  Haha.  And then there was this guy that was like, "We got any Douglas Adams fans out there tonight??" and I was all, "Wooo!" but I was the only one ;).  So, he read a passage from one of his non-fiction books that was pretty interesting.  After a bit of that, a group of us went and played soccer.  It started out just being Rebecca, Naomi, me, Osato, Sal, and Norton but we picked up a few regular UNT students to play with us so we got a pretty good game going and played for a couple of hours.  It was pretty cool.  After that, Rebecca and her roommate, Jennifer, hung out with us for a while and we all watched some Strong Bad.  Hmmm...and then, after they left, Naomi and I stayed up and talked for two hours straight...until 4:00...and we had some really good conversations.  Today I basically just studied and hung out in my room and then played some soccer again tonight with some random UNT students.  It was pretty fun.  It brings me back to the ten years I spent obsessed with soccer.  Select, practice, games, everything...there is an entire soccer culture out there, but it can get tiresome when all they care about is winning.  That's why I like this better.  It is more fun when you just get to play for fun, no worries, you know?  I think I really want to go to college in Massachusetts somewhere.  MIT, Boston University, Harvard...I want to go somewhere over there.  If I want to get into MIT or Harvard, I had better start working my butt off, because it will take a LOT of work (and that is not to say that getting into Boston University would be a breeze either).  And I will have to get many, many scholarships, financial aid, grants, and loans...I looked up a lot of scholarships today and there are some I think I could get.  There is this one for Boston University that I might look into, if I get admitted there.  There are a lot of essay scholarships that I could try to get.  And there was one I was looking at that was up to $50,000 for first place and it was an essay that you wrote and then recorded or something like that...anyway, I am going to start looking into those now, if I want my dream colleges to be a reality.  Well, that is it, I suppose.  Tomorrow I have classes, yay.  I think I will get the grade I got on my Chemistry test back, but I am not too worried about that.  Heh.  Watch me get a lower grade than I thought.  Peace.  -Lisa

      Today I woke up to the sound of Naomi screaming, "OH MY GOSH IT'S 8:15!!!"    We both jump out of bed, break some kind of record for getting ready in the shortest amount of time, and run to biology, but it was too late, they had already taken attendance.  So, we will be docked for missing class, but only like 5 points, so it is really not that big of a deal...but still....it ruins my clean slate since they never docked me for my first bio lab.  Oh well.  I guess now is the time I back up and explain why we woke up so late.  Around 10:00 Thursday night, Rebecca, Naomi, Sarah, Jennifer, and I all went to the rec center to play indoor soccer, but the court was already being used by a lot of people so Rebecca was like, "Well.....we could always play outside."  Mua hahahaha.  So we all went outside, took off our shoes, and played soccer...excuse me...TACKLE soccer...in the mud.  How many times can a person say the word fun in a sentence?  I could answer that question if I felt like describing that experience.  Eventually, we ended up just chasing and tackling each other in the mud...forget the soccer lol.  We left at like 10:45 COVERED in mud, from head to toe.  It was kinda embarrassing, so we all ran as fast as we could up the stairs and jumped into the shower....er...separate showers, mind you.  So, ANYWAY, due to the irresponsibility on my (and Naomi's) part of ditching homework for funness, I did not start my Pre Cal homework until around midnight...and I had sooo much.  I didn't finish until around 2:00, and then I couldn't get to sleep until around 3:00.  I promised myself that I would fight the insomnia and go to sleep earlier but ahh!  It is so impossible.  *Sigh* is this a mental thing or what?  Yeah, so, missing biology put me in a kind of bad mood, even though I did laugh at myself to keep from being annoyed with myself.  And then I got a crappy homework grade in Pre Cal, so that kinda made me feel more crappy.  AND then I had a test in Chemistry that I had not adequately prepared for.  But in the end, that turned out alright, since I have taken it before.  I remembered more than I thought I remembered.  I'm pretty sure I got an A on that one, so that is good.  After my last class, Writing about Lit, Naomi and I went to Maple to eat and ran into Jaison (yeah, there is an i in his name, isn't that weird?).  We hung out with him for a while, saw his dorm room and such, and then we went to these little soundproof piano booths, and listened to Jaison play the piano/sing in really ridiculous keys lol.  He was really good.  When he did play and sing seriously (instead of singing Enrique's Hero in a really high voice), it was so beautiful.  I could sit here and try to explain how much I am in love with music, but I don't think I could adequately describe it.  Piano, guitar....it all conveys messages that words or thoughts never can.  Naomi thinks Jaison has a thing for me, and then the Jennifers said that they thought so too, but I don't think so.  I think he is just a friendly guy and he is like that with a lot of girls, but whatever... :)  Jennifer picked us up around 5:45 to go to the concert.  I showed her and Fifer my room, and introduced them to some of my friends, including the girl that has my name, and then we all left.  My friend and chem lab partner, Laura, went with us too.  She is really cool.  The concert was AmAzInG.  I think that is some of the best moshing I have ever been in.  It was fun, crazy, awesome, crazy, loud, rough, crazy, fun, and a little crazy, too.  I was feeling particularly crazy today, and so I acted particularly crazy.  And it wasn't just one band, it was all of them.  They were all so extremely awesome...mm....so awesome...This concert vies with Warped Tour for being the best concert experience of my life.  The only thing that may have ruined the perfect concert experience was when a guy passed out at the end of the starting line's set.  He literally fell on Naomi and I, as we were jumping up and down.  We thought he had just fallen down, so we grabbed his arms to help him up, and then I realized that he wasn't conscious.  So, a bunch of us made a big circle around him and waited for the management people to come and get him.  It made me really sad.  After that, I wasn't into it as much, even when tsl did their encore.  I just watched.  It seemed....wrong...somehow to watch someone look like they are dead on the ground (he wasn't dead though) and then go back and act like nothing happened.  So I sat the last couple of songs out.  They were the only ones I sat out on though :).  The Starting Line did this thing with confetti that was Soooooooooo cool (hardcore).  During their last song, at the climax I guess of the song, when the entire audience was singing along, and it was an emotional moment, confetti went everywhere.  It was so awesome.  Unfortunately, that was during when I was protecting the guy on the floor, so I didn't get to enjoy it that much :( oh well.  So, anyway, I got another free cd, and then we went back to Arlington, and my mother gave Laura, Naomi, and I a ride back to UNT.  She was less than thrilled, that is how I will put it.  We made it back with ten minutes to spare until curfew.  But it was so worth it, because it was so extremely fun.  I think that Naomi now understands why I have concert withdrawal sometimes.  Haha.  I also think that Laura thinks I am some crazy, hardcore moshpitter.  Oh wait, I am!  LoL.  No, I am not completely hardcore.  I mean, I haven't even crowd-surfed yet!!!  (Note to self:  Update List of Things to do Before I DIE).  Sooooo, that is that.  I was drenched in sweat.  Literally.  My hair, my clothes...and I smelled so bad, but it's all for the cause.  That's what I told Naomi and Laura when they had to take off their shoes and go barefoot in the moshpit (ouch) because they kept falling off.  It's all for the cause.  Which cause, I don't know, but that is what it is all for.  Ate some food, and am about to go take a shower.  I am so detailed in these things, it is amazing.  -Lisa  (I am waiting for an explanation from a certain someone on why my name is so cool. :) )

      Today is September 11th.  It is weird how many connotations of sadness and hurt this date has.  Just remember two years ago.  I was in my freshman geography class...  So, today and yesterday have been really weird for me.  I don't even really know why.  I suppose I have just been thinking about a lot of things.  There is still that something I am trying to think of, but it isn't coming.  I have the feeling it might be important.  Gah, I confuse myself so much.  Another reason I am feeling kind of weird is that I don't know what to think about certain things anymore.  Yesterday when I was sleeping in Chemistry (JoAnn, the saga continues), I had this dream that was really weird and today it almost happened in a way.  I just don't know what to think!!!  I am so confused, it's crazy.  And the insomnia is getting worse.  The past few nights it has been around 2:00.  Tuesday night it was around 3:00.  Last night it was around 4:00.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I slept later in the morning, but I don't.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  Grr.  I hate my sleeping patterns.  Last night I went to this recycled book store with Alejandro and Josiah.  This place was so cool.  It was three stories, and FULL of books, as well as movies and music.  It is like Half Price except so much bigger and with so many more books.  It was amazing.  It is like a library and a thrift store put together.  Haha, just my thing.  On the way back, we heard a garage band practicing and this one guy just playing the acoustic guitar.  I got really emotional when I heard that one for some reason.  I was trying to explain to them how I just thought it was one of the most amazing feelings to sit in the dark and listen to someone play their emotions on a guitar.  They were just like, "Oh yeah, sure...it's cool."  Music is so powerful, it amazes me.  So, the annual Screw Your Roommate Dance is coming up and Naomi and I have a truce not to screw each other over.  The thing that sucks though is that I know that I am not on any of the lists of the guys that are on the list she made for me.  I know this because Osato told me who all is on his and Jonathan's lists and Kenny is someone I hardly even know, so neither him or his roommate will think to put me on his list.  I will probably just end up with some other random guy who didn't get put on any lists.  :) oh well.  I guess I should be happy that other people don't think of me as someone to screw their roommate with.  Haha, that sounds dirty.  It will be interesting.  The other night, I talked to Ryan for the first time in a long, long while.  Hindsight is a funny thing.  Looking back, I don't know how I didn't see what kind of a guy he is, that is, how shallow of a guy he is.  I suppose the thing that made me realize how uncompatible we are is when he said something to the effect of, "Oh yeah, she really wants me to ask her out but I think she is really annoying.  It's just like shutup and let's go screw."  I was so shocked, I nearly fell out of my chair.  How can someone have an attitude like that??  How did I not see this?  I feel really stupid.  People constantly amaze me.  Sometimes in good ways, sometimes not.  This was definitely a big not.  It is rainy today and I am listening to a song about rain.  This is a random coincidence; it is just on a playlist.  Hmm...rain is awfully depressing.    Tomorrow night is the Starting Line/Allister/Homegrown/Early November/Senses Fail concert.  I think it will be great.  I am hoping it will be great.  Maybe it will end all of this weirdness for me.  It could be that I am just changing as a person.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Well, there is maybe more that I could write about, but I really can't think of it and I know that I am probably rambling as it is.    -Lisa

        Neutron -- You don't take sides, you just sort of hang out and blend into the crowd. If someone lets you loose though, you can cause some serious damage. If you are arround too many other neutrons you get bored and start to decay.    urlLink   What kind of subatomic particle are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So, I was ecstatically happy when Naomi's mother came over Sunday morning and fixed my internet.  She had to like totally reconfigure my entire connection.  I don't even know how it worked for as long as it did.  So, out of gratitude, I made her her very own backdrop for my computer.  I would put a picture of it on here but unfortunately, I have no idea how to soooo....you know how it goes.  I can tell you that it is a red star on a black background that says, "Nopei is a computer genius."  I don't know how long it will stay there, but I am really grateful so it could very well be a while.  So, I am like the employee of the month or something on my wing!  I got to fill out a little survey and everything and it will go on our bulletin board.  So that kinda made my day.  Our wing date was tonight.  It was pretty fun.  Naomi, Rebecca, Sarah, and I all hung out together for the most part.  We just went to Putt Putt and played golf and rode go carts and played games.  Naomi and I wanted to battle it out on a DDR machine but the only one they had was like an off-brand or something and instead of the regular squares they had like...criss cross ones...it was really weird.  But, we decided that most every one has one in the dorms anyway so we'll just do it another day.  And then we went to Sonic and all talked some more.  Rebecca and I planned out how we are going to write our first article together.  It should be pretty cool.  So basically, I made two really good friends today.  It was pretty awesome.    Tonight I was watching some Seniors reminisce and be all best-friendish and I was just wondering if by next year, I will be like that with people.  I think probably so.  You know, I honestly cannot think of one thing that I have a legitimate reason to complain about.  This is a good thing.  I am so glad I am out of high school, you have no idea.  Naomi is having boy troubles.  I suppose I kind of knew that it would all get messed up in the end.  Hmmm...I also had a productive conversation with her about my beliefs not being hers.  She is really accepting of it though and I think that is a good quality to have.  Her and I are becoming really close.  I mean, I suppose we would have to be, since we do live together and everything...  You know, they say that college is a time where you find things out about yourself that you never even knew.  I think I am beginning to really understand myself better.  Maybe.  There is something I am trying to say, trying to think, and it is on the edge of my mind and my tongue, but I can't seem to find the thoughts or the words to say it.  It's there, but I can't completely grasp it.    -Lisa Dianne Wauters

      OK, gotta type fast cuz the internet goes off in a while.  Today was sooo fun.  Wowness.  OK.  First off, more guys hit on me here than ever did back at regular high school.  Today, three things.  1) There was a note on the dry erase board on my door that said, and I quote, "Lisa, I have a crush on you.  -Mr. Crush"  Umm, something tells me it is a joke, but still...and I am not sure I would want a guy that called himself "Mr. Crush" hitting on me ;). 2)  This guy, Josiah, was like kinda hitting on me, as far as I could tell I think.  He was all, "Ok, tomorrow we are gonna go do blah blah something something." and I was just like, "umm, ok." and he was all, "Well, actually, I am just trying to find an excuse to hang out with you again." and I was just like, "Ohh reallly?" and then he was all, "Hey, do you have AIM?" and I was like, "Yeah, you can get it from Alejandro." and he was like, "Ok, I just wanna talk to you cause you are really cool."  To which I replied, "Actually I am a big dork." 3)  I was hangin out with Osato and he was like, "Oh yeah, one of my homeboys was telling me how cute he thought you were."  and I was like, "One of your homeboys?!! Who?!"  and he was like, "I can't tell you.  Code of honor.  The only way you'll ever know is if he has the balls to tell you." I begged him to tell me for a long time, but he wouldn't!!  Ahhh!    Right.  Today I went out to eat with a bunch of people.  (Aaron, Darlene, Andrew, Ed (real name:Jordan but I call him Ed because he looks and sounds EXACTLY like Edward Norton), Kyle, Ian, and two other people that I can't think of...)  We went to The Tomato, reallly, really good pizza place.  Then when we were leaving, Russel, Alejandro, and Josiah walked in so I sat with them while they ate and talked to them about how they had watched anime all day the day before.  And then we went to CD Warehouse and I got a Warped Tour Compilation with 50 songs for $9!!!!  The music is so good, you have no idea.  And then I went back up to their room and they showed me some of their anime.  It was really fun.  They are cool to hang out with (this is the part when Josiah starts to hit on me).  At one point, the room across the hall starts blasting rap so Russel whips out his Death Metal and plays it so loud...it was frekain hilarious.  We were all doubled over...ahh...so after about three hours of anime watching, Osato kidnapped me from their room (literally, he tried to pick me up over his back and everything) and we went to his room to work on our enormous amount of Pre Cal homework.  He played some of his hip hop for me, lol.  And thennn...  At 10, visitation was over so I went back to my room and went to talk to Rebecca about her idea for an article for the newspaper (she went to state for newswriting last year and I went to regionals for ready writing so we have decided to collaborate) and got invited to play some cards sooo me, her, Sarah, Katie, Andrew, Kyle, Ankit, Stephen, and...uhh...some other people, all started playing Go Fish, black jack, and Group War (that was interesting).  At 11:00 we all went to play soccer.  That was pretty fun.  There wasn't much of a soccer game going on, because it was like a ton of people, so it kinda ruined it, but it was fun just the same.  I got some breakaways and had an assist.  There was this one annoying guy that I pushed down a couple of times because he was really annoying.  After every goal we made, Naomi and I would run up to each other yelling and like beat the crap out of each other.  After the game like three guys came up to me and told me good game.  It was cool.  And this other girl was like, "hey, i am trying to start a TAMS girls intramural soccer team.  You should be on it."  I was like, hell yeah I should.  Ahh, guys are so funny.  It's funny.  Back at home, I made friends with girls easier.  Here it seems like most of my friends are guys.  Except for Lisa, Rebecca, Naomi, Jennifer, and some others.  But yeah, it is great fun here.  I like it.  Tomorrow is convocation and I need to study some more.    Time for some Kidman and McGregor.  You know what that means.  Mua hahahahaha.  Just kidding.  I wish ;)  Lisa  pS- Did you know that they have an Anime Convention?!?!

      Ok, right now is actually Friday, but it will show up as Saturday because it is past midnight and all.  Anyway, to add to my day.  It got a lot better.  6:30 went to see a movie at the Magnolia with some people.    Went out to eat at IHOP afterwards with some funny, funny people.  Took a walk to 7-11 at midnight with some more random people to get a refill on my 1.5 liter mug for slurpees.  Am now back up here so that I can read.  Tonight was really fun.  Ok, am now going to go read.  Read the one below if you haven't already.  Peace and much love, Lisa

      I had a lot I wanted to write about, but I forgot a lot of it...oh well.  Last night I talked to a guy on the phone just for the heck of it for the first time since...well, a long time.  I think the last time I did that was back in freshman year, when I still liked Jon.  It was just to Jason, the guy that Naomi was going for the first week (because he liked her) until she met Josh (who was introduced to her by Jason) and decided she liked him.  He was actually calling for Naomi, but she wasn't there so he just talked to me for a while.  Just about boring things though...like classes and homework and all that fun stuff.  When I told Naomi how long it had been since I had talked to a guy on the phone (for conversations sake), she thought I was weird and I guess it made me realize that I know absolutely nothing about how to have relationships with guys.  Hmm...oh well.  Osato cracks me up so much.  Today in Pre Cal, we were doing something with the inverse of some function and we got two answers instead of one (which isn't possible) so our professor was asking if any of us knew how to determine which one was right, so Osato spoke up and was like, 'Well, according to the definition of the inverse of a function, which states that the graph of the inverse is a reflection of the function over the line y=x, then both of the proposed answers are necessary to complete the reflection in question.  Therefore, one can tell that it is both the positive and negative number."  Then he paused for a moment and was like, "Who's your daddy?"  Well, our professor just pointed to something on the board that made everything Osato had said completely irrelevant, and so he was like, "I don't know who my daddy is anymore."  It was sooo hilarious.  That boy cracks me up.  I guess you would just have to be there though.  That is pretty much it.  Oh, I wanted to post a speech from the play I just finished reading, The Lady's Not For Burning.  It is lovely.  JENNET.                                     I am interested In my feelings.  I seem to wish to have some importance In the play of time.  If not, Then sad was my mother's pain, my breath, my bones, My web of nerves, my wondering brain, To be shaped and quickened with such anticipation Only to feed the swamp of space. What is deep, as love is deep, I'll have Deeply.  What is good, as love is good, I'll have well.  Then if time and space Have any purpose, I shall belong to it. If not, if all is a pretty fiction To distract the cherubim and seraphim Who so continually do cry, the least I can do is to fill the curled shell of the world With human deep-sea sound, and hold it to The ear of God (Fifer), until he has appetite To taste our salt sorrow on his lips. And so you see it might be better to die. Though, on the other hand, I admit it might Be immensely foolish.  See?  Isn't it great?  I can't put into words why I like it because I can't explain how things impact me sometimes, I am weird like that.  Hmmm...  All I can say is that I am glad I am a banana, and not a kiwi.  That would be horrible.  ;)  Lisa

      Things are looking up.  I found my motivation I think.  It came from Tolkien...and Something Corporate.  I guess I was still in summer mode or something, and did not want to be serious about school but...now I am I think!  Heh, hopefully this will last.  But anyway...my day...  I had Biology at 8:00 and I am still kinda lost in that class because I am in Honors and that is building upon High School Biology...which I NEVER TOOK.  I am beginning to regret skipping to Chemistry...oh well.  I told Naomi she would have to sit down and explain to me the rules of cytoplasm, mitochondria, cell membranes, and all that jazz.  And organelles.  I don't know how those work either.  But I am learning a whole lot about amino and nucleic acids or something like that.  Must look over notes....hmmm...  Then I slept an hour before Pre Cal.  That class was the same as it ever has been.  He gives us an assignment and then gives a lecture but doesn't really teach so we are left to figure out the chapter on our own.  Homework takes forever, but Osato, Casey, and I have formed some sort of a study group for that.  Chemistry...was interesting.  We got lectured on how to name and distinguish between ionic and molecular bonds and things of the such.  It was all stuff that I had learned before, but it is always good to touch up on it, ya know?  I am talking to the extremely shy guy next to me...he is so shy, he makes me look outgoing.  But he seems like he would be pretty cool if I got to know him.  Then I ate lunch and ran errands with Naomi and then I went to English.  We discussed the play in small groups.  We have to present our answers to the questions about imagery and language and plot and all that on Friday.  My group was pretty cool.  Four of us ended up walking back together after class and we had a semi-philosophical conversation and I was invited to the Modern Philosophy Forum tomorrow night.  It sounded really interesting, I think I will go.  After that I mainly just did Pre Cal and went to club meetings.  First was Academy Players...mua hahahahahahaha.  TAMS Theatre.  Why?  You ask.  Why are you in the theatre club when you obviously have a shyness/stagefright issue?  I have one word for you:  Tech.  I love doing the tech side of things.  Sounds, backdrop, lighting.  That is my thing.  I am the person behind the scenes.  And also because the people in that club are Hil-ar-i-ous.  I think I will have fun.  A while after that was the Ambassadors meeting.  We are basically the people that run interview days, preview days, tours, Spend-a-Days....all that stuff.  That was pretty interesting I guess.  And then I went to the Pool Club meeting.  mua hhahahahaha.  I had to have one "Drifter" Club, ok?!?  I am in a lot of clubs, I think.  Like 7 or so.  I may have to drop a few.  Last night was Yearbook and Key Club.  Tomorrow night is J-Board and newspaper...  Yeah, I will probably have to drop one or two.  But not until my busy schedule forces me to!  After that, Naomi, Osato, and I all played tennis for a while.  It was the first time I have played tennis in like a month.  It was great.  When it was just Naomi and I playing, we got really coimpetitive and we played a nice match.  I beat her!  We hadn't played in over a year and back then she was a lot better than me.  So I think I have improved...Yay.  That was super fun.  Then we had our Wing Meeting.  We had it downstairs with one of the guy wings because Monday we are all going on a "Wing Date" to Putt Putt.  Haha.  I looked around for....prospects...hehehehe.  It should be great fun.  Well, that is about it, I do believe.  I will go now because I want to do some Chemistry and I think I only have 2 classes tomorrow.  Yessssssssss.  I am beginning to really like it here.  I didn't for a while, but I guess it is true what they say.  It takes a couple of weeks.  Hmm...  Bye!  -Lisa

      Two things:  1) Amy had her baby this morning!  Karen called here around 8:00 and said that they had been there all night and that by noon Heather will have been born!  Well, it is 3:00 now...so...this is exciting!  I hope they call later!  2) I got my Letter Jacket on Sunday.  It is so pretty.  And new.  I smelled it like a million times and wore it a lot even though it is really warm outside.  Tacky to wear on a college campus?  I don't know...but I will wear it somehow or another...  So yeah, my computer is being gay (again).  The internet is connected, but the explorer and AIM do not recognize the fact.  They think that I am still offline and so I can't really use it at the moment.  It kinda sucks.  I am on Naomi's computer right now.  I don't think she minds...hmm...  I am so not motivated to study or do school work.  Someone please motivate me.  I just look at my books and know that I have no motivation whatsoever to actually study them.  When my first tests come, I will die.  *Sigh*........  Hah, I sat in the wrong Bio Lab room for like 15 minutes today and there was this really foreign lady who I could barely understand.  She was giving a history of the metric system or something and was all, "blah blah blah during the French Revolution.  But they were too busy killing other people so they forget about metric system, yes?"  It cracked me up...on the inside.  Then I was redirected to the room I was supposed to be in and that lab was really boring, but we are supposed to have some sort of a quiz over it next week but I have no motivation so I don't know if I will be studying for it.  I think I need to find some way to motivate myself.  Like...no internet until I am done studying.  But wait!  I already have no internet!!!  Oh well.   "Down" by Something Corporate is so lovely.  So I saw four movies this weekend.  Two in theatre.  Both practically for free.  I saw Real Genius on tv (which was really interesting), Uptown Girls Sunday afternoon with Olivia (it was ok, but some parts were really stupid), The Faculty that night at Olivia's (it was weird seeing Elijah Wood minus the hobbit look), and Jeepers Creepers 2 (just as gay as the first one, but at least it provided some good laughs).  Yeah I pretty much spent Sunday and Monday with Olivia...but in weird intervals...hmm...and now I am back here.  This blog is very poorly designed.  I jump around from this morning to Sunday to today to Sunday and Monday...oh well.  I am sure all you wonderful people will understand.    We have so much food in our dorm now...mmm...food...  -Lisa

      I'm in one of those moods...the kind where time seems kind of slow, in a good way, and everything is nice and peaceful, and I just kind of...float...from place to place.  Like I am on a cloud!  If that makes any sense...  These past couple of days have been interesting.  I saw some things I never thought I'd see...my grandmother crying being one of them.  Completely broken down...not even caring that people heard her call her Momma...I just can't...relay what it meant to me.  Some things don't need to be marred with words, like the rest of the funeral.  I'll just leave you with that...it was sad, yes, but beautiful in so many ways.  So many thoughts I am having...or I have had...and I don't think I could put them into words.  It's weird like that...I suppose...  Yesterday, before I left, I was in a horrible mood.  I was angry, sad, frustrated...and I just didn't want to deal with people.  When my mom first picked me up, I think that she and Brian could see that I was in a bad mood.  But after a while, they cheered me up, I got better, and I realized why I miss my family so much.  My brother, for one.  He is so adorable, and he is only a year younger than me.  He is really goofy or silly, or whatever he is...and he made me laugh so much.  My mom talked to me about a lot of things, and I just got to tell her about school and the such.  It was nice.  My grandmother.  She is such an amazing person.  I hope I never have to see her sad again.  I got to talk to her a lot yesterday and today too.    The way my family came together and supported each other just made me thankful to have a family like them.  We may not see each other just a whole lot, but everyone is there for each other when they need to be.    Sooo, anyway, in some other ground breaking news, I went to sleep at 9:30 last night.    9:30  !!!  I don't even remember the last time I went to bed that early!  Certainly not sooner than about 7 months ago.  The last time I went to bed  before midnight  was at least 3 months ago.  I woke up this morning, and I wasn't even tired!  And I had a thought that maybe this was how I was supposed to feel every morning...it was nice.  I think perhaps I will start trying to go to bed earlier.  So, tonight I am going to the haunted house at Bruce (where all the music majors live) and then tomorrow it's back to Arlington for the weekend!  Wooooooo!    -Lisa

      So  yeah pretty much my day went ok.  I had to write this essay by 8:00 and I printed it out with about ten minutes to spare.  Went to play soccer, but Zahir didn't look at the game times right, so we went back.  Had some funny times today, as I do every day.  They never get old :).  In sadder news, which is why I really wanted to write tonight, my great grandmother died today, and while some of you have lost most or all of your grandparents already, this was still really shocking to me.  I knew she was getting old, and I knew her health was deteriorating, but I guess I just never expected her to pass away...  I think one of the things I'll remember the most is that even after like two or three strokes, and being so very old, she always remembered all of our names...and there is like 15 of us (cousins).  And there has got to be a whole other set of great grandchildren that she remembered the names of too.  Back in the day, she could even remember all of our birthdays.    I dunno, I don't even feel like thinking about it right now, because I know that I will become sad, and start pondering my own mortality and the such, but I need to think about it, and get my feelings out.  Ben dying this summer got me thinking about death, and it just amazes me how someone can be there one second...and gone the next, never to return, never to make an appearance ever again.  She was affectionately known as the "other Nanny."  My Nanny loved her so much, I know she is taking it bad.  And she has a lot on her plate to deal with.  I should call her tomorrow.  "Other Nanny"...one of those family constants...always there...always loving...such an amazing person...  I think I am taking off Thursday to go to her funeral, but I don't know if the tams police will let me go.  Hopefully, because I really need to go.  I really want to go.    -Lisa

      It's cold!!! Finally!!  I was worried that the semi-summer weather would last through Halloween, and Halloween is just not Halloween without cold weather.  So, nothing happened this weekend.  Well, except for the Star Party Saturday night.  It was pretty fun.  We made s'mores, and me and Sarah did some climbing on the playground because it was one of those crazy maze-like wooden ones with many climbing possibilities.  Naomi, Rebecca, and I were all wrapped up in this blanket for a majority of the time.  It was at this park by the lake that was really pretty.  And then Saturday night we watched Good Will Hunting and Sliding Doors.  I had never seen Sliding Doors, and was a bit disappointed to tell the truth.  I mean, it was ok I suppose, but not as good as I was expecting.  It is funny because Naomi and Rebecca think that I know everything there is to know about movies and music.  Probably because I have seen ten times more movies than they have, and know a whole lot about a whole lot of different genres of music.  But, my knowledge of these things compared to Fifer's...it is not as detailed or vast :).  I mean, today I couldn't even point out Michael Moore in a picture.  Sad, ne?  Today I ate and attempted to study.  Urg, no concentration.  Hah, Rebecca is so innocent.  It amazes me.  Today she was all, "What is an orgasm?"  I just couldn't stop laughing, and it wasn't in a mean way, it was just funny.  So, she went into her room and looked it up on dictionary.com and sent me the definition.  That made me laugh harder and then she came into my room and was all, "What is lamow?"  and I was like, "What?"  And she was like, "You know, l-m-a-o...what you said to me after I sent you the definition..."    Laughter is good for the soul.  She makes me laugh so hard sometimes.  Arts and Crafts night was at 7:00 and we made some pretty nifty stuff.  I have on my toothbrush bracelet right now.  And then me and Rebecca went running.  I think we ran about 4 miles.  We ran all the way to the QT and then past my brother's apartment complex.  It was so crazy.  But, yeah, that is about it.   It's a funny thing when I'm running.  Sometimes, I feel like I can't go any further, like I am burned out, like my lungs are about to burst.  But then, I focus on a stop sign or something and I tell myself, "Just to the stop sign, Lisa, you can make it to the stop sign."  So I get to the stop sign and then I see a big tree up ahead, and I tell myself, "Just to the tree, Lisa, you can make it to the tree."  It continues like this, until I am finally done with the course, and I look back on it, and the distance between my landmarks are much longer than they seemed when I was running.  I just have to take it a little at a time, and soon the little distances add up.  I think that maybe I look at life like that.  Last year, I was like, "Just until the end of this year, Lisa, and you'll be at TAMS, just until the end of this year."  and now I am like, "Just a year and a half, Lisa, and then on to Boston, just a year and a half..."  And maybe all these distances will add up, and before I know it, my life will be over, and then...whatever comes after.  Maybe the cool down.  We are running, and running, and running in life.  Maybe in the afterlife we will finally relax and start our cool down, and things will be good.  Funny quote of the day (from an old creepy man talking to me and Rebecca from his car as we were running): "What are you girls doing?  It's colder than hell out there!"  Just ponder it.  Colder than hell.   Colder  than  Hell .  Does anyone see how funny that is?  Aw man.    -Lisa!  "So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written.  Michelangelo. You know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right?   But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.  You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Seen that....  If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times.   But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.   I ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more into the breach, dear friends."   But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, and watched him gasp his last breath looking to you for help.   I ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet.  But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable...known someone that could level you with her eyes. Feeling like God put an angel on Earth just for you..who could rescue you from the depths of Hell.  And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, and to have that love for her be there forever. Through anything. Through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.   You don't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.   I look at you and I don't see an intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky, scared shitless kid." -Sean, Good Will Hunting

      Putting on a Haunted House takes so much work, time, and effort.  From now on, whenever you go to one, scream, have fun, and don't mock, no matter how stupid it is.  It makes the people feel good inside.  We spent so much time decorating and we all had matching costumes because our theme was a "Jail."  The inside joke was that it was a TAMS jail but we just said it was a jail and we all had black and white striped costumes.  I looked hella scary with my makeup on.  I will have to post the pictures sometime this weekend.  I would have them tonight along with the other pictures I want to post, but I used the yearbook camera and Cathy doesn't want me putting them on my computer before they are loaded onto the yearbook database thing.    So, our wing really bonded, we really had fun, and we won first place!!!  We had the highest points for creativity and presentation or something like that.  Naomi and I put on a "scene" of sorts with arguing and fake stabbing (of me by her).  Rebecca laid like she was dead on the ground and popped up.  Starr was at the end of the hall with our skeleton in a noose, and would yell, "BREAK OUT!!" (cuz we were in jail) at the end and everyone would chase the people down the hall, yelling and screaming.    Some of the other wings were pretty scary too.  The one above us had people popping out of boxes and a tunnel of mattresses to crawl through.  And, yeah, more about Steven.  Hah.  He dressed as this boxer, but not like a scary one, like a funny one and he had these huge blow up boxing gloves.  Anyway, me and Naomi walked downstairs and he was playing with this one little girl, like pretending to fight her, and she was giggling and having a fun ole time.  It was probably one of the sweetest/cutest things I have ever seen.  :) :)  Oh, and then I made this really cool cookie after all the kids left because Lisa and someone else made all these cookies and let the kids decorate them with all this icing and m&ms.  Sooo, I made a pumpkin!  It was my pride and joy!  And then REBECCA tried to destroy my creation, TWICE.  She PUT ANOTHER COOKIE ON TOP OF IT, SMEARING the cheerful yet mischievous grin.  AND THEN she smeared it AGAIN with her finger! LoL, but it is ok because I repaired it as best I could.  And then, since I am "obsessed" and apparently a "psycho" (according to Rebecca), I took a picture of it.  I hope it gets into the yearbook. :)  I feel as if there is more to talk about, but I can't think of it at the present moment in time.  Life's good.  You know?  Seriously.  I like it.  And I think it has a whole lot to do with how I am not letting things get me down anymore.  I get melancholy sometimes, when I think about how I don't think I will ever find "true love," but you know, I think I have learned to shrug it off.  If I find it, I find it.  If I don't, oh well.  I can be happy living a life of solitude :).    Tomorrow I get to play some tennis and go to the Star Party and maybe, just maybe, get back in time to complete our mission.  Mua hah.  Well, am going to go now.  And start my Pre Cal homework.  Byyyyye!  -Lisa

      Ok.  I told myself I would post something before the internet turned off soo here it goes.  This week has been so weird.  Monday and Tuesday were pretty messed up, as Rebecca had stopped talking to us over the weekend and then Naomi got really upset for a while and for a few days, I just don't know what happened.  Everyone was so...depressed.    Now, it's ok.  We are back to the closeness of before, probably better though because we are more separate from each other, I think.  And we understand each other's limits better.  Me and Naomi have gotten along really well today.  It is amazing how fast relationships change when you live with the people that you have relationships with.  I mean, family of course, but that is different.  Just because...they are not your friends, you know?  Sooner or later, everyone burns out, everyone reaches that low point.  Sometimes, people don't want to talk, they just want to be quiet.  And I think that is what happened.  Ever since we got here, it has been like camp.  Now, it's just normal.  And this week was just the first big burnout.  Being around people 24/7 and having almost no privacy can take a toll on people.  It is nice sometime to just take a walk by yourself around here, to just think, just be by yourself.  I usually do not get my time alone until the wee hours of the night/morning...since I rarely get more than four hours of sleep.  I like to take a book out in the hall at around 2:00 or 3:00 and, if I am lucky, no one is being obnoxious or loud, and I can just read, and get caught up in the story, in the fiction, in the unreality of it all.  Because sometimes, escaping from reality is the only way to deal with it.  Wednesday night we won our second soccer game.  Am loving the team feeling we have.  It is quite excellent.   I have slacked off a whole lot this week, mainly because of how I studied my arse off for the bio exam that one night and all the other midterms I had last week.  It is nice to slack off, even though I do it a lot.  Sometimes I wish I could just throw all my responsibilities down the drain and just be a penniless musician living on the streets of New York.  The only problem is that I can't do anything musical.  That, and I don't want to not get to live out my Boston dream :).  I was thinking again about how much I love music the other day.  I just can't express :).  My days are pretty full though, for slacking off.  I can't stand sitting around and doing nothing.  Today I had some classes, I wrote an article for The Scoop, I went to eat with my brother, hung out with Laura and some people, watched Jonathan and Stephen (different Stephen) have an ice cream eating contest (now  that  is what I call entertainment), went shopping for our haunted wing that we are decorating tomorrow, and went to the GA.  Oh my gosh, the people here are so freakin hilarious.  Guys left in a dorm together always produces some form of hilariousness I guess.  They just taped a bunch of pranks they pulled on people.  Lucas and Tim...squating on the bathroom counter...holding bowls of water over their heads...and the look on their faces...priceless.  Mua hah.  And then Kevin, one of the admin, made a couple of Seniors think that they were gonna get arrested for stealing cars so they secretly taped the conversation in his office when he told them.  Aw man, I laughed so hard I nearly cried.    Steven didn't have a very good day though, and that made me sad.  He is cute.  And just a really sweet guy.  Nice style too, I think I've mentioned this before.  I just wanted to make him feel better.  :).  Oh well.  I think there are like a million guys named Steven/Stephen at this school.  I know of at least four.  There are probably more.  Is that not crazy?  Oh, and I got to talk to Amy on the phone!  I can get the really pretty dress for her wedding for only $131!  I was excited.  I miss her a lot.  Hmm... I also heard Cody is gonna propose (To Courtney, not Amy) so that is exciting.  Ok, I am done rambling now.  I plan on having pictures up soon, so that everyone can match some names up to a picture when I talk about people.  I am trying to get the yearbook camera to take pictures at the Halloween Extravanganza tomorrow, so maybe I will get pictures of everyone that you need to know or something :).  Ok, well, bye now.

      88 on the biology test.  Average is now a 92.  Urg.  Will be harder to keep an A in that class now.  Oh well.  I suppose I am happy with my grade, you know?  Today Pre Cal was cancelled and we didn't have lit so I only had two classes!  Joy.  And tomorrow, I only have Pre Cal and bio lab.  But then after that I have a super busy day.  Tuesdays are always the busiest.  We had our first soccer game tonight.  5-0 baby.  wut wut.  We fit like ten or eleven people into a mini van and that was our transportation there...it was so fun.  I felt like a team :).  It helps me to deal with missing my tennis team so much.  Zahir is so crazy...he is like our coach I guess and he gets so excited.  Omg, I was rolling on the ground laughing, seriously.  That guy cracks me up so much.  Then, after curfew our wing got to escape the jail we know as TAMS.  For a whole hour dawg.  Is that not the coolest?  Taco Cabana has really good food.  Yeah, everyone is really depressed today.  I was going through blogs and realized that everyone was sad about something, or pondering melancholy things.  And with my blog earlier this morning, and the conversation Rebecca and I had over lunch, I am thinking that is was a universal thing.  What is it about today anyway?  People's emotions are very fragile, and I think sometimes we don't realize how much the things we say and the things we do affect other people until it is too late.  That is all.  I am too tired to elaborate on this much more.    So tired...so exhausted....I have gone...more than 48 hours now without sleep...I think probably like 55 or so.  I mean, my eyes feel like they are lead.  And my body feels like a ton of bricks has hit it and is permanately in the state of hitting me.  My bed looks really inviting...and yet, I can't sleep.  What is wrong with me?!?!  That is it, I am making myself go to sleep.  NO MORE INSOMNIA FOR LISA.  Sometimes I really do wonder about getting some kind of medication for this.  I know it cannot be healthy.  Well, I am off.  Lisa

      Lisa + night before bio test she hasn't studied for + two loads of laundry + Pre Cal homework that she hasn't started + Double Shot of Starbucks Expresso with Cream = a sleepless night of sleeplessness.  Oh, but it was fun.  Everything seems so weird right now though, like I am living in a dream or something.  Hmm...must ponder on this some.  I am so annoyed with certain people right now.  And I am a tolerant person.  Pet Peeve #1:  When people ignore me for no reason and act like they are above talking to me.  Pet Peeve #2:  People that only like to talk about themselves, and won't shut up about it.  I mean, seriously, I don't usually get annoyed with people.  But, right now...  Man, the frustration is building.  I need some good screaming music.  Ahh...Senses Fail...a mixture of emo screams and good music...and emo music...and emoness in general.  It helps a bit.  Just a bit.  But it helps.  Ah if it weren't for music.  How insane I would be.  There is a lack of good music junkies here.  I met one last night, and she was really excited about meeting someone as in love with music as she was.  Said something about a band being like The Cure only with a bad case of PMS.  Oh, it was great.    Ok, the frustration is ok now.  I think I may be ok.  I just had to vent.  Stupid people...stupid people...stupid people...I'm good though, I'm golden.  Evenly golden soil, yo.  Definitely not blowing chunks in the big house.    Maybe I was just being harsh on those people.  Prolly so.  See?  This is why I am so tolerant.  I always think people deserve second...and third...and fourth chances.  People are inherently good at heart, right?!?!    Ok, well, so I won't debate with myself about that last statement, I will leave now.  Ciao ppls.  -Lisa

      Only at TAMS line of the day "Dude, Terrell I saw this girl the other day...on the learning channel." LMAO Zach is so funny.  You know those days you have that you finish and just say, "Wow, that was nice."  Today was definitely one of those days.  And yesterday for that matter.  Even though nothing significant happened, I feel as if I have tons to write about.  :)    Friday after classes I don't know what I did.  At one point Naomi, Rebecca, Sarah, and I all went shopping at the dollar store and had tons of fun.  I went to eat at Bruce a couple of times.  Then we decided to go play soccer, but were distracted by the fireworks and the huge bonfire.  Sooo, we walked over to the bonfire and watched that and the show that went along with it.  It was basically just one big pep rally.  We met up with Hudgens and hung out with him for a lot of the time.  I loved just sitting there on the edge of the lake with everyone, just looking at the fire.  It was hypnotizing in a way that made me think.  Sarah is so fun.  Sometimes we just sit and analyze people, what they might be like.    So, I came back and then was invited to run with Steven, so I went and did that.  It was like 1 1/2 miles or something crazy like that.  In fact, I hung out a lot with Steven these past couple of days.  But, we'll get to that later.  We went to sleep after I studied for a bit, without actually studying.  Like, I didn't soak any new knowledge in.  Tomorrow all I am doing is studying.  Haha, Naomi said that at around 2:30 (AM), I sat up, looked around and said, "Who gave him my email address?"  and she was like, "Lisa?"  and I screamed like I was mad at someone and laid back down.  She does a really funny impression of me.  haha.  I didn't know I talked in my sleep, but I guess you learn something new every day.  This morning was the PSAT.  Hmm...I don't know how I did.  I finished all the sections this year, as opposed to last year when I didn't finish two of them.  I just needed to raise my score a little bit...I really hope I did.  After a short nap, Naomi and I went out to eat with Steven at this place called Thai Cuisine.  It is soo cool.  I love it.  It is really small, and the prices are super cheap.  It is $1.30 per Chinese dish you get.  So like, if you got some fried rice and sweet and sour chicken, it would only be $2.60 ( I am a math genius).  Is that not awesome?  And it is really good food!  They had this back porch to eat outside on...the atmosphere was just soo cool.  And they had little flowers on the rails.  Twas great.  Lunch was just random conversation and eating.  Steven tried to get me to go to Houston for the tbs concert, and I told him to just stay in Dallas.  So, yeah, lunch was nice.  Then, I wanted to see my brother march, so I went to my first UNT game.  And guess who I went with.  Hah.  Yeah.  Naomi didn't want to go so I was gonna go by myself (and we had this huge fake roommate fight, it was cool) and I went downstairs and Steven's all, "Yeah, I guess I am going by myself."  and I was all, "We should go by ourselves together."  So, that is how that happened.  We walked there together and then met up with Christina and some other people.  Left after the third quarter because it was boring.  I studied Bio for a bit but was then distracted when Laura told me she was gonna go play volleyball.  So I went and did that for a while.  It was about 12 of us.  Really fun stuff that was :).    And then Steven and I went running again.  He is just a really cool guy I think.  I mean, as of yet, there aren't any sparks, so I guess I don't really expect to become anything more than just friends, but that is super cool.  Out of my crush that I had this past week, I gained a new friend and a running partner. :).    That was around 10:30 but wait!  My day isn't over yet!    So, then, Naomi and I meet up again and we go play some frisbee game with Colin, Terrell, David, Hudgens, and Zach.  That was soo super fun, especially when we played "Dead or Alive" which was basically tackle frisbee.  Oh man, it was so cool.  And then we watched Terrell and David do all these matrix tricks and break dancing moves.  It was an experience just sitting outside on the grass until around 1 in the morning, hanging out with some of the coolest kids I've ever met.    And a thought occurred to me.  They are all Seniors, and all best friends.  They must spend night upon night doing things like this.  They're seniors though.  In a few short months, they have to leave all this behind, and start over again.  It made me sad.  In less than two years, I will leave tams.  And while I do complain about the restrictiveness of this place sometimes, it is true that I have grown quite attached to the people and the experiences here.  It is different than I expected, yes, but...I am not sure whether or not it is different in bad way or a good way.  Most of the time, I think good.  Let's see.  I think that's it.  I really have to go study.  Bye guys!  -Lisa

      And so ends a stressful week of near impossible Pre-Cal and studying for midterms last minute.  Urg!  Math is so frustrating!  Chapter 7 is crazy mad hard.  Analytical Trigonometry can die for all I care.  They say it gets easier after this.  I sure hope so.  Bio Lab midterm I am pretty sure I got a high a on.  English was more difficult but I am pretty sure I got at least a 90 on it.  And I think I just BSed on the essay, but its all good because.....I don't care!  Sooo enough about school.  It is the weekend.  Yell Like Hell baby here I come.  Tomorrow morning the PSATs!  Exciting, right?  I am excited.  It will be one big PSAT Party.  Oo, that reminds me of something that we talked about at dinner Friday.  Steven said something about having a college app party and I was all, "BYOA!"  I am such a dork, it was funny.  Hyper I am, yes, hyper I am.  Must study for Biology this weekend as our midterm is on Monday.  Erk.  I am scared of that one, I am.  I know absolutely nothing about biology.  Last night we played some acoustic tunes on Naomi's guitar.  Ahh it was fun.    Well, guys, Motion City Soundtrack is playing on my computer and I just got finished eating lunch and acting like a big dork...the weekend is just starting, the weather is perfect, it's 3:21 and the day is calling.  I must be going!    Loveeeeeeee Lisa

      Why do parents always try to make things more awkward than they really are?  Ok, so I am talking to my dad today on AIM (my whole family has it...I even have my MeMaw's sn now :) ) and he asks me to come see him next closed weekend and I am like, "Ok, I prolly will." and he is all, "No, I don't want no stinkin (yes, he did use the word stinkin) prolly, I want a yes." so I was like, "ok, Yes, I will come see you." and then he is all, "I miss you."  Awkwardness.  I mean really.  In the first place, I didn't see him any more often when I still lived in Arlington, and he never made any attempt really to talk to me more then.  Secondly, it's like he is trying to guilt trip me into going to see him.  I was going to go see him anyway.  And it's not like he actually misses me.  We have never really had any sort of a relationship, and certainly not one where there is missing involved.  I remember the year that he didn't even remember my freaking birthday and just handed me some money- no card, nothing- a month after when someone said something about it and we were all at his apartment.  It's stupid.  Sometimes I really don't understand him.  I feel bad, because I don't really miss him that much, but it is just because he was never really in my life, if that makes any sense at all.  Maybe he is just trying to repair our relationship, I don't know.  All I know is that I don't want anyone telling me they miss me when they don't mean it.  And I don't think he meant it.  I think he just said it because it is one of those things that every parent is required to say to his children.  On a lighter note, I had a good day today.  Erg, my resolve did not last very long.  Hehe.  Crap, I am developing a crush again.  Oh well.  He is super cool, and I already wrote Fifer about this....but...He is like a whole frickin case Underground.  And probably 750 packets hardcore.  And he is a little quiet and shy...it's so cute.  Ahhh boys.  They are crazy.  I am crazy also.  This is not a good thing.  I am shy too.  I saw him at lunch and was all ::shy wave:: "Hey" and he was all, "Hi." and then I started blushing so I left.  I was already on my way out anyway.  Ok...soo...that is the end.  The End.  La Fin.  Oo, that reminds me of the shark fin, which reminds me of that one commercial, which reminds me of CAKE!!! LoL.  Some people are crazy.  And no two people are not on fire.  The End for realz this time, guys.  -Lisa Oh yeah!  For those of you who care, I finally made a list of my favorite songs at the moment.  For all of you who have courageously kept a p2p service on your comp, you should dl the following tunes and check them out.  187 by Senses Fail Sunday Drive by The Early November The Closest Thing by The Juliana Theory Seventy Times Seven by Brand New Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional Cute without the E by Taking Back Sunday I Remember You by The Ataris The Classics of Love by Common Rider Hit or Miss by New Found Glory I Woke Up In A Car by Something Corporate Leaving by The Starting Line Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me? by No Use For A Name In Love With the 80s by Relient K Pretty Girl by Sugarcult Buried Myself Alive by The Used L7 (Medication) by Wakefield The Freshmen by The Verve Pipe  I think that's all.  Not that everyone cares all too much, and I feel I have left off many a good song, but this is what grabs my soul and runs away with it at the moment.  Ciao

      It occurs to me that things will never change.  At least not in the way I want them to.  Last year, whenever I thought of how much I just wanted to escape high school, I thought of TAMS and how next year it would be ok because I would be here.  I get here, and escape my high school, but now find myself wishing sometimes that I had never left.  It's times like those that I think about Boston and how in less than 2 years, I could be living there.  I always look at pictures of the buildings and wonder what it is like to go to college there.    At night, the buildings light up with an array of colors against a black velvet night.  In the morning, there is a blue harbor with a gold ribbon of sunlight reflecting off of it and an orange sky giving a backdrop to the same buildings that were lit up only the night before.  The weather would never be ridiculously hot like it is here.  It would snow in winter.  A lot.  It would be by the water.  I could go out on a Sunfish, sail for an hour, and think about my life.  I could find an underground coffee haus that has guys serenade the place with acoustic tunes every Monday and Wednesday afternoon.  I could wear a sweater every day.  I could get a job at a small shop on the corner of some street and talk to everyone that came in.  I could volunteer at a Children's Hospital and get to individually know each of the kids, and make them feel better about whatever they were in there for.  I could go to all of the east coast concerts and be crazy with other crazy people.  I could find myself a nice east coast guy and finally experience love and all that jazz.  I could have a small group of friends that I did everything with.  We could all know each other better than we know ourselves.  Every Tuesday, after classes, I could go to the local tennis center and play some hardcore tennis in the cool Boston weather.  Thursday evenings I could go to my weekly Yoga class and get in touch with my inner feelings while also getting in shape.  My weekends could be spent with my friends at comedy clubs or with my guy, cuddled up and watching a movie together.  I could finally have a passion for learning and studying.  I could find out what I want to do with my life.  I could spend my night dreaming of Texas and TAMS and all the people that I had to leave behind to go to Boston and feel all nostalgic about it.  I could live in Boston.  But, something tells me that it would be like now.  I would finally get to Boston, and it wouldn't be as perfect as I imagined.  Like here, there would be no guys interested in me.  Classes would be like here.  There would be no small bookshops with weird obscure indie rockers that are obsessed with Tolkien and Douglas Adams.  There would be no coffee hauses with aspiring Jeff Buckleys.  The children's hospital would already have enough volunteers, and a Sunfish would be too expensive for me to buy.  And I would want to go back to where I had left.  But, I wouldn't, because that's not me.    Sometimes, I wonder why I came here, and what it would be like if I hadn't.  I just...I don't know...I am a sap.  I love this place most of the time, but it's like...not what I imagined.  At all.  And I miss everyone so much.  So incredibly much, sometimes, you have no idea.  I miss Arlington and Summit and the tennis team and Kroger and all of my friends.  I miss being third in my class and not feeling mediocre.  But, more than all that, I miss Boston.  And I haven't even been there yet.  So I just tell myself 2 years, Lisa...no, less than 2 years....and you could be living there.  -Lisa

      Underground is my new word.  Hardcore=overused and out.  Underground=my new word. And packets.  The measure of everything is in packets.  1000 packets=1 case. Lisa=approximately 850 packets underground. Fifer=approximately 999 packets underground.  If you don't understand, don't worry.  This is a whole case of confusingness.  So, I finally got Naomi to start her own  urlLink Journal .  It reminds me a lot of my  urlLink first entry (scroll down to the bottom).  I think blogging is an art.  Throughout the existence of your blog, you mold it and shape it until it really reflects your own style and what you are trying to communicate.  Just look at the difference between my first one and now.  Craziness, eh?   urlLink Rebecca's  is cool too. :)  Well, that is all.  I don't have a whole lot I want to really write about.  This is like a crap entry.  Crap, I tell you. 50,000 packets of CRAP.  Bye!  -Lisa

      My week was really pleasant.  I know there were some things I wanted to write about but I forgot about all of them now so I guess I will just wing it.  I think it was Thursday that I got kinda down because of certain things and I was in a woe is me mood but I hate when I get like that so I got over it pretty quickly (like the next morning) but you know, there are still the remnants, and I still get melancholy for a few moments whenever I think about it.  Oh well :).  I am a happy person.    Friday night I went swing dancing for almost three hours.  It was so fun and I learned so much!  I had a lot of different dance partners and I got to dance with like four of the instructors so they taught me a lot of different moves.  There was this one really creepy guy I had to dance with during the actual lesson because we don't really get to choose our partners and he was super creepy, but after we switched partners again, it was all good.  Wow, swing dancing is so incredibly fun.  When I get a boyfriend or get married or whatever, I want to go dancing with my guy.  Maybe I should change that when to an if.    Today I was actually in Mansfield for a while because I went to JoAnn's birthday party.  We got there at around noon and then ran around like crazy.  Me and Rebecca went to Super Cuts and got our hair trimmed while Naomi went shopping at Kroger and then we met up and went back to her house and made three cakes and then went to the mall to get Jo's present and ended up getting her some really random things.  We went back, ate dinner, and finally got to JoAnn's house 30 minutes late.  Oops :).  In between all that, we also did three loads of laundry.  Yeah, my hair sucks.  :) (why I put a smiley there, I don't know)  The party was ok.  I got to see Ashley, Tiffany, Victoria, and JoAnn (obviously).  I was thinking about how all my friends that are friends together became friends separately and it just so happened that we all knew each other.  It is pretty crazy.  I met Ashley in the 2nd grade, Naomi in the 6th, Tiffany in the 5th, JoAnn in the 8th...and JoAnn became friends with Naomi after I did, without me introducing them, and then with Ashley in 9th grade, without me really doing anything, and then Tiffany last year, once again without me really doing anything.  Jennifer and Ashley did that too.  I dunno, maybe it doesn't sound like much, but it is pretty cool I think.  So, that is it.  Oh yeah, and I met a pretty cool guy on Friday.  His name is Stephen and he is really smart.  He had an interview with MIT today.  And he likes Taking Back Sunday (is going to their concert in Houston Nov. 1st), and he has the whole thrift style down, he has really cool hair, and we both say plethora the same way.  I was all, "Yeah, I should interview you for the newspaper," because he is the committee head for the Halloween Extravaganza and I am writing an article on it.  Cool, ne?    But, I dunno, I am still kinda interested in Jonathan, so...my options are open.  I don't have a really big crush on anyone really right now.  Until a guy shows me how amazing he can be...I don't want to get attatched.  Are you understanding?  You had better be, because I am going to go now and  actually study , since I have failed to adequately prepare for the past couple of tests I have had.  Well, this is the end I suppose.  -Lisa "The Lisa" Wauters PS- Fifer, I wore my "FINA AIR TEAM" shirt today.  Mua hah.  It was soo cool.

      Sooo, yeah, I am pretty stupid, I think.  I mean, what good does studying for a test do if you can't read directions?  Yeah, that's right.  Pre Cal...the highest I can get is a B because I found the area instead of the perimeter of this one problem and on this other one I thought it said the one-to-one not the inverse of a one-to-one...  And I knew it all!  I could have gotten an A!  And a high one at that.  Urg.  Sometimes I feel like punching myself in the face.  Oh well, at least I know it all.  And deep down, I know that grades really don't matter that much anyway.  ::Punches self in face::  ANYway.  In other news, I met my BUGS mentee today!  Her name is Micaela and she has red hair, freckles, and braces.  She is so adorable!  And she is smart for a fifth grader.  We went to this presentation by the Physics team.  It was really interesting.  We volunteered to do this one thing where they had a bed of nails for us to sit on to show the distributed pressureness of it all.  It was fun.  I am gonna be studying a lot this week for midterms next week, so I may not get to blog as much.  But, you will just have to take a deep breath and relax.  I know it may be tough for some of you, and you may experience some symptoms of withdrawal, but I promise that in the end it will be ok.  -Lisa

      This weekend was absolutely amazing.  I wish I could have individually blogged after each day because then you would get the full effect, but you'll just have to deal :).  So, after class on Friday, Matt took Naomi and I home, and that was really fun.  We got pulled over by the cops and it was exciting because they made Matt get out of the car and everything.  Hah.  I get home and walk inside and...  it is spotlessly clean.  If you know anything about my house or my family, you know that my house is NEVER clean, and certainly not spotlessly so.  And my mom had already converted my room into a guest room.  It was so freaky.  It was like, this is what it would be like if I did not exist.  Well, almost.  There were still remnants of me.  She had packed up most of my library collection, but put a few stacks on the book shelves (I assume for decoration).  And My yearbook from last year was on the desk.  My room just seemed so empty and blank without all my crap.  It was weird...  So, right off the bat, I call people.  I confirm my homecoming plans with Olivia and call Fifer.  After much begging, her and her mother decide to take me to get food, and they end up paying for me!  Double score.  The food was extra good, cause it was from Quiznos and then I just hung out at her house for a while.  We have good conversations, we do.  And she understands music, and the passion for it.  I have met only a few people just as or more passionate than I about music.  It is the blood of the veins of life.  Homecoming was...eh.  It reminded me of why I wanted to escape Summit so much.  People are so fake and...what is that word I am looking for?  Heartless?  Shallow?  Nah, not all of them...but...superficial is definitely another word that comes to mind.  I was with Olivia, Alex, Suzanne, and Travis, and they were all really cool.  We left after half time because we wanted to go see School of Rock.  Jack Black is so hardcore.  That movie was great.  On the way to Olivia's from the movie, after we dropped off Alex, we were driving down Harris with the windows down and the something corporate cd just starting.     standing on the edge of morning...   and with the cold october air blowing on our faces...almost like ice...and the beauty of the music...and the feeling of driving into the night...I just wished it could have lasted forever.  I didn’t want to use the word infinite again but…  Saturday Amy, Heather and I all went shopping for Amy’s brides maids dresses.  Heather is Amy’s month-old baby.  Oh my goodness, I am in love.  She is sooo adorable and cute and everything you could ask for in an infant.  And she fell asleep on my shoulder…on more than one occasion.  *Sigh*  it was great.  Anyway.  I am the Maid of Honor, so I get to kinda pick the dresses, but it is really Amy and I together picking it out.  There was one we saw at David’s Bridal that was so beautiful and we both loved it.  It was $175 though.  Ouch.  Lol, but I guess all dresses like that are expensive.  For lunch, we went to Pei Wei Asian Diner and the only reason I mention this is because it had the air of a coffee haus and served the best Asian food I’ve ever had.  Then we saw Wendi and Robert with their children.  I have only one thing to say about them.    “So, since you’re in college now, you probably get drunk all the time!” “Er no, I don’t actually.” “Oh so, you don’t do drugs or anything?” “No.” “Well, then, what  do  you do??”  Anyone with the misconception that the only fun things in life are getting drunk and doing drugs have OBVIOUSLY not spent a Saturday night with Fifer, Jennifer, and I.  Mua hahaha.  I could have a whole blog just on that night (but this is already long enough so I will cut it down a bit).  Me and Fifer went thrifting for a while, and then to B&N (I love the smell of books), and then went and hung out at Jennifer’s.  I was trying to figure out what we could do until midnight, but Arlington is somewhat boring sometimes, so I was stuck.  We went to Kroger for a bit and that was not unboring. ANYway, to make a long story short, we ended up at the elementary school again….mua hah, sprinklers are fun.  And then Summit.  Their sprinklers are funner.  I was lying on the ground with Jennifer after we had all ran around for a while, watching the mists of the water against the light of the lamp against the blackness of the night.  And Fifer was talking about the helicopter that was spying on us and we were all laughing.  Infiniteness.  Why can’t moments like these last forever?    We get back in the car, only to realize that the car we thought was vacant was driving around the parking lot.  Apparently, the person in the car had been watching us.  Creepy, ne?  So, he goes around the field house, and I go the other way to just play around with him and then Jennifer honks the horn and we drive by all quick-like and then he starts following us and then his friend shows up and they are both chasing us throughout the parking lot and we got trapped like twice but thanks to my super driving skills, we got out of the sticky situations and then we escaped!!  And then we taunted them some more, so they started following us down Turner Warnell and Matlock !  It was super scary/funny/exciting.  We lost them in the end because they are stupid and went in front of us.  Aw man, it was so exciting.  I don’t even know how to describe.  Fifer and Jennifer are really fun people.  Hmm…graded some of my mom’s papers and went to bed.  Sunday morning:  Went to Woodland West, saw lots of people for the first time in like a month.  Me and Jenn left early cause I had shopping to do.  Bought lots of dorm stuff.  Then I visited Amy’s.  It was like two summers ago.  Me, Sarah, Amy, Ryan, Cody, Brett…all hangin out.  It was like the old days.  It was the first time I have really talked to Cody since…well, since he left for SFA in January.  I didn’t even think he remembered who I was, since he did always call Jennifer “Lisa.”  But oh well.  Sarah is so funny.  She was all showing us the formulas for girls and guys evilness.  Hah.  Funny stuff, maybe I'll post em tomorrow.  I got back like ten minutes late though and couldn’t find the keys to my mom’s car so I didn’t get to go to Brighton Beach with Fifer.  But I guess it was alright in the end because I had so much laundry that I was putting on and switching loads non stop until around 7:00.  I watched Old School.  Will…why give up on being super hilarious??  Curious George?  The Elf?  *Sigh*  what  are  you thinking?  It feels weird being back here on campus.  It’s good though, I like it here.  It’s just that after a weekend of awesomeness, it’s weird being back here.  I miss everyone again.  Hmm…I guess it is a never-ending cycle.  I am off to bed I suppose.  G’nite, don’t let the bed bugs bite.  -Lisa PS- Cds I got this weekend (either finding or getting them burned) Motion City Soundtrack (Thanks, Fifer!) Jeff Buckley (Again) Wakefield (Thanks, Mom, for finding it!) Vendetta Red/The Juliana Theory (yay)

Fell asleep instead. Went and ate stir-fry at Clark with Naomi and Rebecca. Scoop meeting. Work out. Am going to go sleep now.  Ooo, our newspaper sucks soo bad it's not even funny.  It's not even like a newspaper, it's like a bunch of paper stapled together.  And the content...wow...when they joke about this not being a school of english and whatnot, they're NOT KIDDING.  Heh.  Me and Rebecca have a lot of work to do. I got two new assignments though.  I need to ask Ryan how to get actual newspaper paper and printing.  Tomorrow is closed weekend!!  And Summit's homecoming!!  I get to see everyone again!  I am very excited.  !! :)  nite yall Lisa

      (Wednesday)  So, nothing too terribly interesting happened today.  Um, I actually don't think I have anything to write about.  But, for some reason, I feel like writing.  Hmm...  So, I woke up at around 7:30 and proceeded to straighten my hair and get dressed.  Breakfast was a breakfast burrito, a waffle, and some malt-o-meal that I enhanced with a few packets of sugar.  Bio was bio.  The prof lectured about nothing...or at least, nothing that meant anything to me.  Some really annoying kids tried to sound smart and tell her she was wrong...but eh she has the PhD so what can they say?  I mostly half-slept through that one.  Then, I went back to my room and took and hour-long nap before Pre-Cal.  Pre-Cal was Pre-Cal.  I was in a really pissy mood for...um...no reason at all...cough.  Ahem.  ANYway, so Josiah commented on my tired appearance and that really set me off.  Maybe it wouldn't have if he had rephrased the way he had said it.  But, noooo...he was all, "Man, you look high.  Are you high?"  Maybe it doesn't sound like much, but that in addition to...no reason at all...really pissed me off.  So, I didn't talk to him the rest of the class.  Not that I usually talk a whole lot in there anyway.  Oh, and afterward, I got to ask Dr. Allen when Casey, Rebecca, Osato, and I can all come over to his house for a movie night.  hah!  I don't know if there are any plans set in stone as of right now though.  :)  Then, I had chemistry.  I don't remember much from that class because I think I semi-slept through it all.  Chem Lab lecture was next.  We don't actually listen in that class because no one has any idea what he is ever talking about, so I just did my Pre-Cal homework and entertained myself by watching Kenney doodle in his notebook.  He is a pretty weird guy.  He drew pictures of people hanging from nooses and the such.  Oh, and then he drew a picture of our biology professor holding two guns and labeled it, "Dr. Elrod is THE BITCH.  And she hates TAMS students."  Mua haha.  If I hadn't been in class, I would have laughed mui hard.  Yes, so, he was a form of entertainment.  Lit was after that.  What did we do in that class?  Oh yes, we discussed The Tempest...again.  For how uninteresting that play was, we sure talk about it a lot.  It was around 2:00 after that, and I ate my second meal of the day then.  I had two chicken strips, some mashed potatoes, a salad, and an ice cream cone.  Let's see.  I came back here, got on the internet for a while, was entertained by CiDi and Betsy who both played the guitar.  CiDi played some Green Day and Alkaline Trio.   Betsy...attempted to.  At some point, Megan brought in the cookies that her grandmother baked her, and oh my gosh, it was like I was in cookie heaven.  If such a thing exists.  Where do cookies go when they die?  The world will never know.  Naomi, Rebecca, and I went to Clark and ate dinner.  Pizza.  Yum.  Oh, and a salad.  And then I came back to the dorms and finished Pre-Cal in Rebecca's room with her and Osato.  Around 9:00, Rebecca and I went to go work out.  10:00, we came back for the AfterProm meeting.  10:15 we went back with Naomi and worked out again.  According to the machines, I burned 700 calories.  That is all, I do believe.  I had a wing meeting, and heard a funny story about the gay guy that talks about porn all the time, and then had an interesting conversation with Jaison again about him getting drunk.  Then he was all, "No, no.  I am really a good kid, I don't do any of that stuff."  and I was like, "Ok, a minute ago, you were inviting me to take a travel weekend and spend it at your dorm so I could go clubbing with you all weekend.  And you sounded like you knew what you were talking about."  But, whatever.  We ended up having a somewhat nice conversation, in which he told me I was a superb young woman or some crap like that.  Hmm...  Yeah, yeah, that is it.  Goodnight.  -Lisa "I believe in you so much, I could die from the words that you say." -Dashboard

      Sometimes I forget how much it hurts to have a friend rub something in your face or to have someone you consider a friend brush you off, like you are just a nuissance.    Oh well.  Actually, I think that's all I have to say.    I went to our first BUGS (Bringing Up Girls in Science) today and found out the name of my mentee.  She is either in the 4th or 5th grade, I don't know which.    Gilmore Girls was on tonight.  It was pretty good, I suppose, although lately it has not been as entertaining as it used to be.  Amy's wedding is in December.  Does that not just blow your mind?  My best friend is getting married...hmm...everything's changing.  Oh, and we are going shopping for dresses this Saturday.    Why am I in a non-good mood?  I mean, I wouldn't consider it a bad mood, but its definitely not good.  Probably the friend thing.    Yeah, definitely.  -Lisa

      So I don't even know why I am in such a bad mood.  I guess it could be just because my brothers managed to get on my last nerve today...or it could be because of my insomnia problem that is getting increasingly worse.  But whatever the problem, my nerves or my sleep, I really really really cannot think of a word to rhyme with sleep that would make sense in this context.  Wow.  Do you see how out of it I really am?  I don't feel like being back here already but I don't feel like being back at home either.  In fact, I just don't feel like being.  I wish I could curl up in a ball and sleep for 72 hours straight.  Oh well.  I guess it doesn't really matter.  I don't know how to make myself sleep.  The past two nights I have just laid in bed for two hours in the pitch black, trying to make myself go to sleep.  Or rather, let myself go to sleep, because the exhaustion in my mind and my limbs are telling me that I need to sleep, that I want to.  But, I can't.  I try to sleep, I try to clear my mind, slow my breathing, count sheep.  Nothing works.  Nothing.  I don't understand it.  As a result, I haven't gotten to go to sleep until past 4:00 the past few nights.  And I wake up like regular...7-9 AM.  More often 7 than 9.  It is really getting to me.  I just feel like screaming...well, primarily I want to sleep, but secondarily I want to scream.  AND IF I HEAR ONE MORE WORD OR STATISTIC OR ANALYSIS OR ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL I WILL GO INSANE.  I swear.  My brothers are obsessed.  Watching game after game.  NFL, college, IMAGINARY LEAGUE GAMES ONLINE.  Playing game after game.  Madden after Madden.  Sitting in front of the playstation for hours on end PLAYING A FOOTBALL VIDEO GAME.  And then and THEN in the car instead of being like normal people and listening to music we listen to people ANALYZING football games THAT HAVE NOT HAPPENED YET or people analyzing games that have ALREADY BEEN PLAYED and lost and/or won.    And the arguments.  The incessant, loud, yelling arguments about the most insignificant details about teams, players, coaches...Gah.  I just can't take it anymore.  Thank God I am not around people obsessed with football anymore.  But I make it seem like my vacation was all bad.  When in all reality, this is just my current mood.  Seeing my family getting drunk and trying to play games like Win, Lose, or Draw and Taboo was exceptionally amusing.  I saw American Beauty, Joyride, Death to Smoochie, The Matrix:Reloaded, Finding Nemo, and Old School.  The first four were my first time to see them in their entiredy.  American Beauty was such an amazing movie.  I mean...WoW.  I really loved it.  Wednesday night I hung out with Fifer and Jennifer and we had a blast.  Woo Woo, great fun.  Thursday night I went to A&M's yell practice.  That was really, really fun.  You don't know school spirit until you've been to an A&M yell practice.  Friday night was the night that my family got mind-blearingly drunk.  Man, my cousin, Adam, who is just a year older than me, comes in with a beer in his hand, and sits there and drinks and gives his 15-year-old girlfriend wine coolers and his parents don't even care!!  He walks out the door with like five of his friends and my brother was all, "You aren't going to be drinking or anything, right?" and he was like, "Yeah, I am."  and his parents did not care!  It was interesting.  I can't imagine living under the authority of parents that don't care whether or not I go to parties and get drunk all the time.  They are all country people though so maybe it is different for them.  Saturday night I went over and chilled with Amy until around 1:00 in the morning.  Oh, and I watched this really interesting documentary on UFOs that was showing on the Discovery channel.  Amy will always be my best friend.  I know a lot of people think she threw away her life because she has a kid and is getting married already, but the way I see it, just because she didn't achieve what the world perceives as success, doesn't mean that she has failed or thrown her life away.  I think she and Ryan will be very happy and she will be content.  Whatever makes her happy, you know?  My dad sees success in terms of salary.  He said so much stuff tonight that was basically saying that if you don't get good grades, you won't make a lot of money, and if you don't make a lot of money, you are not successful.  He seems to think that I will be making "six figures" by the time I am 25.  I highly doubt this, and I don't even want to be rich.  If I am, I will donate so much money and help out with so many charities.  He said something about if my brother doesn't start getting serious about school, he will be "digging ditches the rest of his life." I dunno.  I don't see success and happiness in terms of grades and money.  At all.   But he did help me out financially.  I think I will definitely have enough money to buy everyone Christmas presents now.  Yay.  :).  And to pay my tuition, as an afterthought.  On the way home, after I finally snapped and made my brother turn off the sports talk (which he listens to as if he is deaf), we tried to sing the 12 Days of Christmas and that was extremely interesting.  We couldn't remember all of them so it went something like this.  "12 maids a milking, 11 maids a milking, 10 maids a milking, 9 maids a milking, 7 swans a swimming, 6 geese a laying.  FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!  4 calling birds, 3 french hens, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree."  the end Lisa

      Why is it that lately I feel as if my RA secretly hates me?  Or at least strongly dislikes...hmm...maybe it is all in my imagination...  So, apparently, a lot of people here are pot smokers and go out and get drunk every weekend.  I did not know this.  I naturally become friends with all the clean people.  I mean, I am friends with some of the people that are not so straight edge, but not close friends.  It really surprised me to hear about some of them.  People let things get to them here a lot more than they should.  I just feel like yelling at them to cheer up and not worry so much!    So, I studied for about six hours today for my Pre Cal test tomorrow...Hopefully, it helps...  Had fun today...Had some not so fun times as well though...but mainly had pleasant times :)  I think that is all...I guess I didn't really have any reason to write this after all.  Lisa  I'm still in love, but I'm one of the million hearts you'll some day break. Close my eyes,  but still i wont give up. Still i wont give up

      Aw man, guys, sometimes I just love life.    Last night was the FACES camping trip and I had so much fun.  There were about 20 of us, and we all stayed the night at Turner Falls Park in Oklahoma.  This place is huge and it has miles of forest and hills and rocks and caves...and, wow, I had so much fun.  There was this old, fat cop that was on duty until midnight and he was really lonely so he volunteered to take all of us on a tour of the cool places in the park.  We got to tour this old castle that was built in the early 1900s, modeled after Old English architecture.  It was sooo incredibly cool, and it was closed to the public, so we got special priveleges.  Also, it was in the dark, so that added an element of creepiness to the whole experience.  We got to hike to three separate caves, and that was definitely fun.  We saw this waterfall, and it was soo beautiful.  I have come to two conclusions. 1) I want to travel a lot, and go backpacking a lot, and see all of the beautiful natural things of the world. 2) I want to live in a castle.  After our tour, we came back and ate s'mores and then, since it was a FACES sponsored event (FACES is a club that focuses on political and cultural awareness type stuff), we had this deep discussion around the camp fire.  I didn't speak up, but I enjoyed listening to everyone else's views.  They started talking about the Iraq situation, but it turned to American politics in general, and then on the Asian minority power in America, lol...that part was mainly Josh (Liao...AzN guy).  Then David said something about the new Blink 182 CD being good (*coughselloutscough*) and I was like, "Riiight.  Since all they did was copy other bands."  Laura and I tried to figure out whether Blink or GC are the bigger sell outs and we concluded that Blink were the bigger sellouts, but Good Charlotte wasn't far behind.  It's funny how this all works.  Then a bunch of us explored Ankit's (Ankiana Jones he calls himself) "Fort" which was just a path...with a cool looking rock wall...and then Josh was all, "My biggest fear is sliding down a giant cheese grater and landing in a pool of alcohol."  and Stephen thinks that sliding down a giant razor blade would be worse, but Josh is all, "Nah, man, those things would rip you up."  and I was just thinking about how I thought I was the only one who ever cringed at the thought of sliding down a giant cheese grater, but I didn't tell them that.  After that, it was around midnight, and I got my sleeping bag out, and Laura, Kelly, Hudgens, and I all laid out under the stars, looking for shooting stars and talking...I don't even remember what all about.  There were so many stars, it was absolutely beautiful...in the city, you see maybe five stars in the sky...but when you get away from all of that, there are millions, tons...and they speckle the sky...it's so lovely.  I pondered how weird it would be to be watching the sky and then all the stars went out at once...Hudgens and Laura started talking about how if they were a Captain Planet person, they would want to have the power of fire and Laura is all, "If I had the power of fire, I would be so much cooler." Chris (Hudgens) was all, "Yeah, I'd probably talk to you a lot more."  It was amusing.  Eventually, around 1, I fell asleep, along with them...but we woke up later, and went back into the tent.  I didn't sleep very well, just because I was cold and I was on the ground...but I got to sleep, and the dreams were nice.  Let's see...what else?  Oh yeah :).  Zahir was trying to be a pirate all weekend.  He insisted that it was his goal in life and he put this bandana around his head in a "Pirate Fashion" and tried to get the drunken pirate walk down...he's so crazy. "Did you see Pirates of the Carribbean?" "Hells yes!  Johnny Depp is my role model.  That was a tight ass movie!"  And David climbing all the rocks..."It's not a real camping trip unless somebody gets hurt."  as he is climbing across the face of a 50-foot cliff.  I got back, and have been hanging out with Naomi, Rebecca, and Sarah a lot.  I got this pair of plastic glasses and was wearing them and then Rebecca and Sarah tried to wrestle them away from me...then Rebecca, Naomi, and I tried to fly a kite, but we couldn't figure out how to get it to work (How many tams kids does it take to make a kite fly? lol ok i'm a dork) and then we laid out, once again, under the stars, and talked about all sorts of things...I love the conversations I have gotten to have with people these past couple of days.  I have really been thinking about what to do with my future...I just don't know exactly what to do...  Then, we went out to eat with Kenil, Kevin, Norton, and Nic.  They are one funny bunch.  That was a lot of fun too.  I also ate some of the best pizza I have had in a long time.  As I said, I love life sometimes.  I am completely happy right now.  And glad I came here...there are a lot of things I am learning, and a lot of experiences I am having...just because I came here...and so I am glad.  Before I came here, I didn't think that Naomi and I would be really close friends...but we are.  She is a really good friend to have.  Rebecca as well, I am so glad we are friends.  And Laura.  She is awesome.  And the other Lisa.  And Sarah.  And so many people, I love them all.    But, I love you Arlingtoners just as much!  Will be in town in a few days.  Will hang out with everyone.  Yes, Fifer, we will go out and be hardcore, because we are naturally hardcore people.  And Amy, I will definitely hang out with you too.  And Sarah :).  Because I miss you all, even though I think I am finally getting to where it almost feels like home here...but I think that is what should happen...since I do live here and all...:) :).  I want to live in a castle. -Lisa

      I should really stop having dreams.  They are good, but not good...and confusing.  But, interesting...so I dunno...hmmm...  So, today was pretty darn cool.  I woke up and went to Pre Cal, then ate with a bunch of people, then I am pretty sure I took a 2 1/2 hour long nap.  That was really nice.  Full of lots of nice and pleasant dreams.  Went to chem recitation...that was...chem recitation...and then chem lab.  My TA was really nice.  I was supposed to have to do the last lab because I had already missed one (for my great grandmother's funeral) but she was just like, "Oh well, you can go."  and I was like, "Are you sure?"  and she was like, "Yeah, it won't hurt your grade."  and I was like, "Score."  So, I left.   And then...something unprecedented in the history of Lisa's studying here at TAMS...I started my homework before curfew...and WELL before curfew at that.  I started at 4:00!  It took me 2 1/2 hours (Induction is tricky stuff, it is) but that is not bad, considering some people took up to 4 hours to do it.  Sooo, around 6:30, I went to eat with Laura and Lisa and Sarah.  And this is when my day gets interesting.  Bruce was holding their 12 rock bands in 12 hours deal...from noon to midnight...and there were some pretty good bands, too.  The one that was playing when I got there was doing an Alkaline Trio cover and then they did Weezer's Sweater Song, which was pretty funny, because the guy was super goofy.  I went and ate and then came back out and this band called By Starlight was playing.  They were indie sounding...kind of...anyway, I was hooked.  I stayed their whole set (about an hour) and then the next band's set...and then the next band's set.  I must've spent 3 1/2 hours just listening to people play music today.  There was this one guy who just got up there with his acoustic guitar and sang all of these beautiful songs...and this one band that was super hilarious with their cover of the Proclaimers' "I Would Walk 500 Miles."  And they kinda made fun of an Eminem song...great, great fun.    Fifer, it was something you would like.  College students sitting around in Bruce's lobby, listening to people play music.  It was by far the most hardcore thing I've done on campus so far.  So, I came back here and took a study extension so I went down and chilled in Mac for a couple of hours...studying for my chem test tomorrow some of the time...some of the time just talking to Laura and Katie and Kai and Osato and the other Katy...I dunno...was cool.  I had a cool day overall.  Very good.    Oh!  And Laura and I figured out what our Goldcore project will be!!!  It is going to be awesome.  That is all.  -Lisa :)

       "I say never be complete.  I say stop being perfect.  I say let's evolve.  Let the chips fall where they may."   This has been the leading quote on my aim profile for a good four or five days now, and every day, it holds more meaning for me than the day before.  I don't know how to put this without sounding...like I am trying to make excuses for not being as perfect as possible or making the grades that I wish I could be making, but the past few days, I have seriously been thinking that being imperfect should be embraced, not something that should be remedied or escaped...  So many times, I think that people see what others have labeled as "perfect" or the "right thing to do" and they just mindlessly try to attain everyone else's goals.  They strive to go to the best school, have the best grades, be the most talented, have the best personality, do the most, have the most possessions, have the most money, have the most stylish clothes...be better than everybody else...  To quote Ed Norton's character in  Fight Club  (the movie the initial quote is from)  "You buy furniture.  You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life.  Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled.  Then the right set of dishes.  Then the perfect bed.  The drapes.  The rug.  Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you."  And it doesn't just apply to materialistic things either.  The superficial dreams for things that you don't  really  want...the superficiality of it all, actually...it ends up owning you.  Everything you do is under the authority of the materialistic or superficial thing that you want or you strive for.  Bottom line:  Do what makes you happy.  Have a passion for something and immerse yourself in it...feel alive.  Don't pursue things that society or other people have told you will make you happy.  Don't go to college just because it is "the thing to do."  Don't get married just because it is expected of you.  Don't buy that shirt just because you think someone you are trying to impress will like it.  Don't let the things of your life own you....Own them.  Own your own life; be the final and complete authority of your life.  Do things that will make yourself happy.  This is not to say that you should forsake your morals just to selfishly make yourself happy.  There are other peoples' feelings to take into account and how your actions will affect others.  Just because owning the latest Britney Spears CD would make you happy (although I can't imagine why it would :) ), that does not necessarily mean that you have the right to steal it from a friend and claim it as your own.  You have to incorporate a system of morals into your life and take responsibility for your actions, otherwise, happiness is not necessarily something you deserve.  And even though your morals may not be the same as everyone else's, as long as you stick to what you say you believe, and don't behave in a hypocritical fashion, your morals are yours to follow and hold yourself accountable to.  But, I digress.  Perfection leads to unhappiness, I am convinced.  Most every "perfect" child I have ever met, has been without personality, on the verge of mental breakdowns...most have little to no social life.  However, making perfect grades and going to the perfect college could very well make someone happy, and there are a few that truly want to do that with every fiber of their being.  It makes them happy.  "It's only after you lose everything, that you're free to do anything..."  When we are not afraid of losing our reputation as the smartest or the richest, when we are not afraid of losing our new car or our computer...that is when we start living life...when you are destitute, at the lowest part in your life...when the only place you can go is up, that is when you are completely and absolutely free to do whatever you want.  The world is free for you to do whatever you please, because you have absolutely nothing to lose.  We never need to stay stagnant.  We need to be ever-changing, ever-evolving.  We should never be complete; we should always be challenging ourselves, our character, our intellect...and above all, we should let ourselves develop into the person we naturally are.  "Let the chips fall where they may."  Don't try to control the world, your surroundings...you can't.  That would imply perfection, which is unattainable.  Let things be how they be.  Things are going to happen sometimes that you cannot do anything about..."It's what comes afterwards that truly counts.  That's when you find out who you truly are." (-Buffy Season 2 finale)  It's amazing how one movie, based on one piece of literature, can make you think so much.  I now see how people can base their entire philosophy on one novel.  I now see why Jon was always so obsessed with this movie.  It sticks with you.  It's been almost a week now, and I still think about it...I'm still thinking about it.  "I just don't want to die without a few scars...  May I never be complete.  May I never be content.  May I never be perfect.  Deliver me, Tyler, from being perfect and complete."  -Lisa

      The TAMS community never fails to amaze me.  I do believe that most of the people here are funnier and/or more interesting than a lot of people I know.  It was "Family Weekend" this weekend.  Mmmm...translation: lots of things going on.  Saturday I saw the play that the theatre group put on.  They did Hansel and Gretel.  The guy that played the witch did an excellent job...when he was pushed in the oven he was all, "I'm melting!!!"  It was quite funny.  And then the Talent Showcase was at 7:30...omg, it was the best talent show I have ever been to, and the most diverse, that is for sure.  Kevin did his version of Wonder Wall, "McConnell Hall."  Osato and Guo did a rap duo..."T-A-M-S Y'll throw it up!" That was quite amusing as well.  The TAMS orchestra did their thing...I swear, half of the ppl in that were violin-playing Asians...lol...it was great.  Abby and Colin did a version of "Picture."  The one that Kid Rock sang that sounded all country.  One of our RAs sang Britney Spears' "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman." (he is a guy)  Kyle, Steven (diff. Steven), John, and this other guy did a circus thing...which was basically Kyle with the hackey sack, Steven juggling tennis balls, and John doing his crazy flips all over stage..and the other guy playing them music.  Hmm...We had a "Fan Dance," which was some kind of Asian tradition...and an Indian traditional dance...and Matt did "Jamie"...that was great.  Hmm...I can't remember all of them...but it was very entertaining.  Today was the Ring Ceremony!  Basically a little over 100 of us Juniors got our class rings presented to us.  Every Senior/admin could say a little thing about the person they were presenting to.  Hudgens' were so  funny.  Vikings, hardcore rebels, ice cream, praying mantises...he is a funny, funny guy.  Hah, and Josh had the last person so he proposed to him... :).    Betsy made everyone a haiku, so that is what mine was.  Something about "The future rock star Someday you'll sing about TAMS Hope you like your ring!" and then she gave a moving, poignant speech about TAMS...I forget what it said exactly...  They were all very interesting, though.  Hehe.  My mom, Matt, Brian, Naomi, her mom, and I all went out to eat at Tia's afterwards...Good ole Tex Mex food...mmm...we have lots of leftovers...anyway, dinner itself was quite interesting...I mean, I suppose I should have known that a combination of Nopei with any 2 of my 3 brothers would be interesting...lol ;p   "Antonio Banderas?" "Aha!!!"  -Lisa

      Man, I hate it when I think really high of someone and then they end up disappointing me.  I mean, it isn't their fault...they are under no obligation to live up to my expectations but I mean...  I guess I just lost a lot of respect for Steven tonight, not that I even really had a crush on him anymore anyway, but yeah, I thought he was a different kind of person I suppose...well, to put it bluntly, he isn't.  That is not to say that he isn't a cool guy to be friends with and that is not to say that he is not hilariously funny, but he is just...like every other shallow, sex-driven male on this planet...hah, but oh well.  I suppose I am just looking for someone a little more...reserved in what they do with girls and such.  Not in that he doesn't kiss or hug, but in that he...I dunno, doesn't always look for the butt to grab or the makeout session to have...I'd like any relationship I have to be deeper than all that...  Yeah, so about 12 of us all played Taboo tonight in Christina's room.  It was pretty fun.  I was going to go hang out with Lisa, Laura, Aaron, and Tyler after that, but then they left while I was upstairs getting my jacket, so I guess they didn't know I was coming...?  But, it was cool, because Sarah and I started walking and talking.  I decided that if I pretend to be happy, then I really will be...and it kind of worked...it was nice.  We went to Denton Square and I found a whole lot of places I want to go to.  Fifer, I found us our coffee shop hang out that it just as good as Starbucks, without the corporate logo.  Denton Square is a cool place and all of the shops are really cute.  The used book store is awesome as well.  Three floors!  Amazing, eh?  That is all.  I do believe I am going to go to sleep now :).  I am hoping for dreams that will leave me wanting to sleep more when I wake up, but I haven't had any of those in a while...  lisa

      This week has been one of failure.  Well, not actual failure...but close enough.  It is really tough not getting perfect grades anymore.  I know that sounds stupid, but it is.  I got three test grades back this week.  All B's.  An 86 (chem), an 89 (Pre Cal), and an 84 (Bio).  I mean, in Bio and Pre Cal I have borderline between A and B now...and the tests just keep getting harder...I actually think that the only reason I did so horrible on the bio test was because our professor cannot write questions for crap, but oh well...it's just that, last year, if I had gotten those grades, well...it just wouldn't have happened.  But oh well.  Change is a part of life, I guess.  And our undefeated soccer team lost our first game last night!!  To a team we had beaten before!!  Zahir wasn't there and we had a lot of people play that had never played with us before.  It sucked.  Oh well.  Afterwards, there were two girls teams that did not have enough players so me, Vanessa, and Adrian played for one team, and Naomi, Rebecca, and Leah played for the other team.  I scored a goal the first half and second half I played goalie!  Without letting any in I might add ;).  And then afterwards, people were just taking shots on me and this one hit me in the face as I was diving for it, and this super...super cute guy came over and helped me up and was like, "Are you ok?  That was a nice save."   ....sigh....I need to meet more UNT guys...  And today I went out to lunch with Matt and Ryan at the Tomato...it is probably one of the coolest restaurants around here...we played foozball (sp?)  Twas great fun.  Chem Lab was long and interesting...stuff with calorimeters...too bad I don't think I completely understood that concept when we tested over it in chem. :p  And then around 7, I went to Matt's band concert...Bass ensemble or whatever...I only dozed off for like a third of it...and it was like an hour and a half long!  I am proud...oh and then on the way back, I was telling Matt about the Anime shop and he was like, "Animay?  Don't you mean Anime (he phoenetically pronounced it)?"  And I was just like, "Are you kidding me?!"  He had never heard it pronounced correctly before...or like most people do anyway...I laughed at him for a while...that was great fun.  People here are so musical and well-rounded.  I don't think I am either.  This one guy, he plays like three instruments, he sews, he dances (like the real kind, not the "grinding" crap), plays soccer, is smart, and is just well-rounded altogether.  I was amazed.  He also listens to good music :).  Anyway, I think I am finished now.  Not much more to write about.  I'm getting my class ring this Sunday!!  Lisa

      Sooooo I just got back from a "Shower Party."  Hmm yes, apparently, people find it humorous to steal things from my stall!!   Rebecca, who was in the stall next to me, reached under and stole my shower bucket thing from me...and then, I finish my shower and lo and behold, my towel is gone!  Now, Naomi had finished about five minutes before me, and I knew she was the only one gay enough to do something like that....  So I yell for Rebecca to go get my towel back from Naomi, so Rebecca goes out and returns...with one of my face towels...har har har...!  And she's all, "This was the only thing I could find!" So I send her back...and she comes back...with another one...so I send her back...well, after about four trips, she finally brings me my towel and is like, "Gee, I just found it somewhere, I have nooo idea who stole it!"  Ummm hmmm....  LoL.  :)    The Desaparecidos rock my face off.    Lisa

      I watched Fight Club the other night, and it was a superb movie...it is two or three days later and I am still thinking about the end.  You know, I think everybody thinks of Brad Pitt as some pretty boy actor with no skills, but when you see him in movies like Fight Club or Seven, you really respect him as an actor more.    And Edward Norton, well, he was amazing as well.  He constantly amazes me with his ability to act completely different parts in different movies.  So many times, a certain actor will only be able to get a part as a certain type of character or person, but Ed, he can play the heartless villain (The Italian Job), a hopeless romantic who also happens to be a priest (Keeping the Faith), or an insane insomniac who enjoys beating the crap out of himself (Fight Club).  He is truly an amazing actor.  He and Brad Pitt really complemented each other.  This could possibly be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in a long time.  There is a collage on my desktop now.  It replaced the picture of me and the Jennifers when we went to Hooters :).  Well, I  should  be studying for my insanely in depth bio test tomorrow...so, I guess I will go do that now.  Oh yeah, I am in danger of making a B in Pre Cal...would that not suck?  I think it would.  Especially because I should be making an A in there.  If I were at Summit, I wouldn't have a B so I shouldn't let myself get one here, you know?  Gah, I screwed up on one test, and it will haunt me for the rest of the semester...  Lisa

      So uh, Saturday- Interesting day.  Don't even want to go through it.  I did have some fun though, apart from the stress that nearly killed me.  There was a nice two or three hour pause from the stress at night when Laura, Lisa, Tyler, Aaron, and I all saw Love Actually at The Magnolia.  It was fun hanging out with them and the movie was very cute.  It made me happy and hopeful...and Hugh Grant....and Colin Firth...mmmm....those English accents get me every time.    Now, on my way back from Denton, after dropping them off, I did get lost for two hours, but, eh, we won't talk about that.  And we won't talk about how I didn't get home Saturday morning until...oh wait, it wasn't in the morning, was it?  Haha, but, as I said, we won't talk about that.   And we won't talk about my mom and my brother yelling at me.  Or me only getting to see Amy for thirty minutes.  Because I am in a good mood and I don't want to bring back the unpleasant memories.  Today, I got to help build a house for Habitat for Humanity and that was really fun.  Met this girl from UNT and we cut out windows and doors.  And then I got to hammer stuff into wood.  Oo, and this one lady that reminded me of my grandma had baked us all brownies and got us hot chocolate.  Mm...chocolate...  Right after that, I had to go to Sonic for afterprom fundraiser....worked until 9:30ish...got back here at 10...so, I was out for around 10 hours today.  Craziness, eh?  Oh, and on the way back from Sonic, Spencer was driving us back, and he was all spazzin out and turning up the classical and country music really loud and he is one crazy funny guy, let me tell you.  Wow, it was pure spazasticness.  Me and Naomi and Rebecca went and got some asian food...or AzN food....and that was good, and I turned in my app to be a HOPE committee head.  Dunno if I will get that...prolly not though...  My brother is still mad at me, because I forgot to give him back his cell phone.  I don't think me and him are on very good terms right now.  This is not a good thing.  Anyway, I am here, back in my dorm room...putting off homework...pondering some things...yeah, yeah, that is about it.  Lisa

       What was I saying again?  Hmm I don't remember.  Something about today, I'm sure...but then I closed the window...  So, I am a really stupid person sometimes, and sometimes I can be really boring and depressing.  When that happens, I just need a change.  Like today I just really needed to get out of McConnell Hall and I did.  For a whole two hours.  After I took a 4-hour nap, my brother picked me up and along with his roommate, we went to Chilis and ate dinner.  They are a funny pair, they are.   "So, Matt, I was thinking.  Do you think that they kill more cows or chickens every year for meat?" "Well, you have to take into account that most every fast food restaurant serves mainly beef, and only a few serve exclusively chicken, and a lot of people like beef, so you would thinks cows...but you also have to remember that cows have more meat on them than chickens..." (the analysis continues)  or...  "I was thinking today about how someone with a billion dollars doesn't seem any richer to me than someone with 100 million dollars.  I mean, I know that it is a big difference, but you just don't think about it. To me, they are the same level of richness." "Well, yes, but if they were to both pile their money in their yards, one pile would be ten times larger than the other pile.  You would notice then, wouldn't you?" "Yeah, but the guy with a billion dollars would probably have a yard ten times the size of the yard that belonged to the guy with 100 million dollars, so you have to consider the yard-to-money ratio..."   And there was a Dr. Pepper chugging (well, not really chugging per say, but drinking really fast) contest, and I think Ryan won...  Me?  I was generally just really quiet the whole night.  Why?  Probably because I had been in a bad mood all day and Matt was one of the reasons why.  I hate myself when I get into a bad mood.  I act really stupid and make up reasons to be mad at people.  Hanging out with Matt and Ryan put me in a better mood by a whole lot for some reason.  Afterwards, I hung out with Naomi, Rebecca, Zahir, Jonathan, and John cuz we all walked to McDonalds and we all teased Jonathan and Zahir told us what "the ultimate situp" was...disgust.  And then around midnight, I went walking by myself around campus.  It had been raining all day, so the sidewalks were slick with water, and the light would shine on them and the campus was literally deserted.  It was so pretty, and so I took out the Jeff Buckley cd that Fifer burned me and walked around in the dark listening to him.  His music doesn't make me sad, or happy...it just kind of captures the unending monotony of love and heartache and life...I like it.  Pretty sure whats-his-face is with the other girl.  Suck.  Yeah, but it is no big deal.  I mean, I don't care.  There are other fish.  I suppose.  Oh, and I got to borrow three movies from Ryan.  Fight Club, Rushmore, and The Usual Suspects.  I expect they shall all be good.    Bye yall...I'll be in Arlington tomorrow (er...today, because it is around 1:45 am)...despite all the trouble I had to go through to arrange it.  -Lisa

       urlLink End of the World  I can't take credit for this, guys.  I found it on Kevin's Xanga, not that he knows I read it or anything.  But, yeah, it cracked me up.  "And Australia's still like 'double you tee eff?' but they'll die soon anyway"   Read and enjoy...er...and it has a litle bit of language, so if you are offended by that, then don't click! :)  And also, you have to read  urlLink this  "Purely in the interests of science, I have replaced the word "wand" with "wang" in the first Harry Potter Book..." -Kevin's Xanga (hilariousness ensues)

      MASTERMIND (Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker )   Lisa Like just 8% of the population you are a MASTERMIND (SIAT). You can be silent and withdrawn, but behind your reserved exterior lies an active mind that allows you to analyze situations and come up with creative, unexpected solutions. Normal people call this "scheming." Don't learn German.   Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you. If you learn to be a little more personable, you could be a great leader--you've definitely got the "vision" thing down. Just make sure all the plotting you do behind those eyes of yours is healthy.   Famous masterminds in television: Dr. Claw, The Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Montgomery Burns.

      Gah controlling Asian parents make me so upset.  Our Senior Mentor, Bestsy Liu, is the most awesome person you will ever meet.  She is outgoing, friendly, nice, nonjudgemental, scarily smart, and she's just...awesome...I don't even know how to describe how awesome of a person she is.  So, her dream school is Stanford, right?  So she spent hours upon hours, days upon days, and weeks upon weeks preparing her application.  I mean, she has prepared for longer than that, obviously, because she has been working her ass of her entire high school career so that she could go there.  And she can.  She has a 1530 on the SAT, her SAT IIs were amazingly high.  Her GPA (at TAMS) is like a 3.98, at high school, she was number one in her class, she is president of the astronomy club, the head editor person of yearbook, she did cancer research this summer at a hospital in Dallas, she was National Merit commended, on the Dean's list, on the President's list...everything you can think of, she's it.  The perfect applicant.  And she doesn't just half-ass it and do things just so she can have it on her application, she goes all out and gets involved because she wants to and she enjoys being around and helping other people.    However, one thing about Betsy is she is always comparing herself to her older brother, who she sees as the perfect kid.  He had a 4.0 and is going to Johns Hopkins and was president of a lot of stuff too, but to their parents, he is the better kid or something, probably just because Betsy is more free-spirited than he is.  She has this thing where she thinks that she will never live up to him, that she can never be as good as him.  She thinks she will always be just second best, never the top pick.  Her parents don't see how amazing she is.  So, she works so hard on this application to Stanford, and the day she has it ready to send off, her dad comes to the school because he says it is not good enough and he has to make some changes.  Ok, well, not so bad, right?  Today her parents told her to forget about going to Stanford, or Cal Tech, or any of the other amazingly good schools that she could get into, because she is just not good enough, she is going to go to UT and that is it and she is going to become a doctor and everything is going to go their way.  Except Betsy doesn't deserve that.  She came in and told us and you could see in her eyes that she didn't want to accept what they had told her, but she has to, because it is apparently the way that Asian families work.  I told her to screw that, she was going to apply to wherever she wanted to and go to college some place excellent and good.  But...she is just like, "No, they know what is best for me."    What is best for her is not to be in some public school, studying something she doesn't even want to be studying.  UT is fine for my brothers, heck it's fine for me, but it is NOT fine for Betsy.  She deserves to go to Stanford and pursue her own dreams of majoring in mathematics, working for Pixar, and opening her own restaurant.  But, because of the way that Asian families work, she may never get to do any of the things she really wants to.  Sorry, but this really makes me sad.  It makes me sad and it pisses me off.  I just..can't explain my frustration right now.  I am so frustrated.  I want Betsy to go to Stanford and have the best possible life.  I don't want her parents dictating what she can do with her life.  It is NOT RIGHT.  Life isn't fair.  She can't do much, because her parents were supplying the money for her to buy her applications, but we want to help.  Naomi, Rebecca, and I want to buy applications for her, and encourage her to just fill them out.  I don't know how this will end up, but I know that I want Betsy to be happy, and going to UT (which is like every TAMS kid's back up school) is not going to make her happy.  Ahhh  -Lisa

      So, uh, basically, nothing of importance has happened these past couple of days.  I had a Pre Cal test that I studied all Monday for and I think I did well on.  I had an essay due today that I cowrote with Laura and we wrote it in between classes today before English.  We won our 5th soccer game on Monday as well.  Now we are 5 and 0 baby. ;)    So, last night I ate lunch with Katy and Alejandro and Ian and these other two guys that were just what you would call your typical nerds and it was so fun.  It's funny, because, you would think that being at tams would help me to hang out with more nerds but so far, I haven't really.  They were all talking about rpgs and who could eat the most and it was just funny.  I think nerds in general are the most interesting people on earth.  I think I am about 90% nerd.  However, since I have never engaged in a game of D&D or memorized all of the dances to the new ddr cd, I think that maybe I am missing around 10%.  I do have the Tolkien/Adams/rpg/uil spelling team/tams/i like to read poetry and literature and take math electives for fun aspect of it down.  Oh and then Naomi tried to convince me she was a nerd and I was like, "er, no." but she insists...and I was just like...no...I took a poll too.  No one thinks she is a nerd...because she isn't...obviously.  And today was mightily fun.  I mean, classes, lunch, writing essays...who wouldn't have fun doing that?  We had to peer edit in English and we read Andy and Matt's paper on how in The Lady's Not For Burning and The Flea, the male sex drive is what motivates all of their actions and how, basically, it made them all act like idiots.  It was hilarious.  They used lines like, "...so all of their attempts were flushed down the toilet."  I mean.  Seriously.  I laughed, I cried, it was great.  Well, I didn't cry per say, but...you get the idea.  And then it was raining so me and Laura were running back and it was great fun and Tyler and her like each other and I didn't know that and I was all "oh sooo thats why he is coming with us saturday" because we are all going to see a movie and have a night on the town rather than go to homecoming because i dont see the point in going to some school sponsored event in which all we will be doing is grinding and talking over loud music and not have anyone to dance with to the occasional slow dance and going to the movies would be a whole lot funner and so Laura is all like,"ohhh youve got to get steven to go and then you can tell him about my steven sweater matching notebook" and i am all like, "blah blah yeah but we dont really talk anymore but ill ask him anyway and naomi freaking told him he should go to homecoming with me AWKWARD but she insists it isnt awkward but oh it is" and then this sentence is so run onned its not even funny, i wonder how long i can make this sentence/paragraph ok im done now.  That is about it.  It is raining now, although I think I already mentioned that part.  And I'm done.  out.  finito.  La fin.  the end.  asta la vista baby.  come with me if you want to live  lisa

      Halloween.  Last night.  Great fun-filled evening.  I picked up Fifer around 5:30 or so and then we went to Blockbuster to pick out some horror pics.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of good scary movies at Blockbuster, but we ended up getting House on Haunted Hill, which I had not seen, and had heard was good.   Then, we went to Jennifer's to help her get ready for her date.  She was all excited,  wearing her pants that were too small and the new sweater she got from Khol's for $12.  We talked much- of people and places and music (of course).  I am borrowing her Story of the Year and Thursday CDs to burn. :)  I am also gonna burn Interpol from Fifer.  We were there until around 6:45 or so.    And then: To the tennis party!  I walk in and immediately I hear everyone yell, "Lisa!" and then Olivia runs up to me and tackles/hugs me and Brittany does the same and I say hi to Shawna, Allyn, John, Kevinh, Nick, Melissa, Brad, Lisa, and others I am sure.  I realized once again why I miss the tennis team so much.  They are all so nice and funny.  And fun in general.  I hung out with Olivia, Alex (her guy), Brittany (my crazy Asian-Indian-Mexican-Hawaiin-who knows what else friend), Lisa (Arccy), and Fifer (Jennifer...different Jennifer) for about 30 minutes or something like that and ate some pizza and some cookies and drank some Sun Kist and asked Brittany about her college boyfriend (cuz they are getting really close ;) ) and her permed hair (which was super cute) and we spoke of college, where Olivia and Alex want to go, how Olivia had the SATs to go to the next morning...  I left around 7:30?  Something like that.    And then we went and visited Amy...er..well, we drove around the block until we sited her and Lisa Higbee's kids trick-or-treating (sorry bout all the Lisas, guys).  So we talked to them for a while and Fifer got to see Heather and I got to hold her but she started crying so not for very long.  And then around 8:00 or something, we left...and went to buy batteries at Wal-Mart...for my costume...Mua hahahahahahahahahaa.  Man, I wish I had a picture of me in my costume to put on here.  It was a sumo-wrestling thing and you put batteries in it so that this little fan would keep it inflated all the time.  hehe.  I was so fat.  Twas the "freshman fifteen." lol.  So we walked around like that for a while and went and made her mom laugh and then we came back but, after sitting on my brother with the fat suit, there was nothing to do and Fifer had to go home because she had to be home early for her UiL meet.    So, I sat around watching some history channel by myself when Jennifer walks in with Nick, her guy.  He was really polite and nice, and was quite funny also.  I approved.  I knew him from work this summer but I had never really said much of anything to him, but I am glad Jennifer found herself a nice boy.  We watched House on Haunted Hill until around 1, and then they left.  The movie was gory, but not too scary...oh well :).  Then I went to Amy's and we started watching Halloween, because it is a standing tradition with us, and I accidentally fell asleep, because I was meaning to come back here to sleep, but it is scary driving by yourself at 2 or 3 am after watching a horror flic.    And today I went brides maid dress shopping with Amy and Sarah, which was pretty fun.  And now....I'm doing nothing!  I miss everyone :)  Lisa

      You know when you are reading a book and you are really getting into it and getting interested and then you stop for a second and realize that you don't remember anything from the last paragraph you just read because you started thinking about something that shouldn't even be bothering you but yet it is and so you start thinking and while you are thinking, you are reading, but you aren't really reading you are just looking and comprehending the words, and so you stop and tell yourself to just stop thinking and concentrate on the book, but then five minutes later you stop reading again and realize that the entire page has been wasted because you keep thinking about things that you shouldn't even worry about and you've had an awesome day but then you saw that someone was online and you just haaaaaaaaadddddddd to talk to this person even though every time you talk to them you have more to think and be confused about than you did before- at no fault to them of course.  Because even though you like them, you hate them, and even though you hate everything about them, you like him.  What then?  And why do you still talk to him after you have moved away and yall talk more now than you ever did when you lived here and then he says all these things and you are just like well what a nice fellow and then you start thinking but he's a bastard I should hate him.  But why is he a bastard?  Well, he's a bastard because he makes me have butterflies in my stomach when I talk to him.  Well, why do I have butterflies in my stomach when I talk to him?  How the hell should I know?  I am just an angsty, confused, fucked up wanna-be emo nerd kid that hasn't ever been kissed or drunk or high or anything, which may be good, who knows?  But then there is always the what-ifs.  And the what-ifs are the most confusing.   So, I put my book down and I think ok, no more reading tonight, because I won't really be reading, I will be seeing and comprehending the words, and that is not productive.  So, I'll lay down and not be able to sleep as my mind goes in circles from one thing to the next and I get mentally dizzy and I ponder the what-ifs...the past, present, and future what-ifs.  I am going crazy.

      Today was unbelievably fun.  Abby + Jenn = Fifer and I laughing our nancies (hahahaha) off...and an incredibly high level of insanity.  I don't think I even want to go through the whole day...and it really was the entire day.  From noon to around 10...that is like...10 hours...wow...I don't know if I expected Abby and Jennifer to get along merely because of Jennifer's opposition to Abby's cursing "like a sailor" but it worked out well.  I don't think Abby minded giving up on it for the day even though she did slip a couple of times lol.  Man, but we had some hardcore times.  Very deck.  I want to be a polit.  Kind of.  That and a punk rocker.  And an emo kid.  And an indie rocker.  I'm not sure if it is possible to be all four.  Maybe so, though.  Byeeee!  Lisa

      Was out of town for a while, four or five days, I don't know exactly how long.  Was very interesting.  Thursday morning we left at like 7:30 in the morning, I had stayed up all night waiting for a chance to put stuff in my mom's stocking so I didn't go to sleep until around 5, so I slept the entire five hours to San Antonio.  First went to Aunt Hilda's for Christmas lunch.  Lots of food and such.  Played football with my brothers for a long while, learned a lot about football, and why it is not just a sport of guys looking for an excuse to tackle each other and slap other men's butts.  Then went to Joe's Ice House to hook up with the larger family, more food, played paper football, was interesting.  Went back to grandparents house, I feel asleep around 9:30 (yes, I know, shocking), and slept for about 12 hours.  Friday- Got to play Poker with my brothers, my dad, and my memaw...was fun...learned a lot about poker...passed the day away doing...nothing?  I dunno...my brothers and I hung out a lot...it is funny how now that we all live apart from each other, we are more like friends than siblings...had the family over for big steak dinner, lots of talking and laughter and such, then opening presents...hmm...after everyone left, played more poker, then I went and read until around 3.  Saturday- drove to Bryan-College Station, went shopping with Nanny and PawPaw for groceries, and witnessed what I have to look forward to when I get old.  my Nanny told me the story of how her and PawPaw met and fell in love...was quite a charming story...he played fiddle or something for some band and his sister was friends with her sister and so my Nanny would go up to the dance halls and see him play and they met each other like that and then one day, the two sisters wanted to go to Galveston or somewhere like that and they needed PawPaw to take them but he said he would only take them if Nanny got to go with him, and so she did and "we've been together ever since!"  She was only 14, got married at 16.  My, how the times have changed.  So, after that, we all ate dinner, lots of famille ppl with us, and we talked some, and then around 7 went to Jason's apartment.  Around 10:00 we all played Poker this time with Peter and his gf from Tennessee and this time with money (we all put five dollars into the prize money).  I was the first one out, tee hee, but I went out in style, and got an ovation, while Matthew (who went out second but bought some chips from Brian to stay in the game and ended up winning), got the Na na na na na na na na hey hey hey you suck song sung at him.  Quite funny it was.  Got back to the grandparents' at 1, read til 6, slept til noon.  That would make it back to today...big family party once again...chinese gift exchange, family bingo...I wish I could tape record my family...they are the weirdest, funniest, craziest ppl ever...  Anyway, I loved hanging out with my brothers all week, they are tons of fun sometimes when they are not being dumb.  I have actually begun to enjoy watching football on TV, God help me...and my Nanny cracks me up so much...quoting Christmas Vacation and whatnot...the part where he is like, "THE BLESSING!"  "I pledge allegiance to the flag..." lol...anyway  New Years Resolutions During the school year, get to sleep by 1:00 every night. Wake up by 7:00 every morning (is difficult when your first class is at 10) Read the newspaper and/or watch the news every day Make more time for fun reading  Am almost done with the 8th Sword of Truth book...such a phenomenal series...I encourage all of you to go out and somehow get a copy of Wizard's First Rule and read it...you will not be able to stop reading, I promise you...  But yeah, Christmas was great, and the presents were good...I always feel bad when people spend a lot of money on me, I certainly don't deserve it...oh well.  CDs to get with Best Buy gift certificate Yellow Card The Early November Senses Fail  Of course, the only one they will have is Yellowcard, but oh well...such is life...I shall have to search for other things I want...  Well, I am off...prolly to read a lot until the wee hours of the morning like I did last night...unless I finish the book before then.  Lisa

      Today was nothing big- just some more of the last minute shopping and insane traffic and near-death experiences (which no day would be complete without) with Fifer, and then handing out Christmas gifts with Jennifer and more of the "Nick likes you"ness because we saw him and stuff...that's about it.  I got North today...the new Something Corporate...I had been waiting for it because I wanted to buy it the day it came out but I had already told my mom I wanted it for Christmas and I was afraid to buy it and then get the same thing for Christmas so I didn't get it and then my mom told me that she didn't get me any of the CDs I asked for, sooo I was gonna wait until later after all my shopping to get it and I refused to listen to Sarah's copy because I love them so much and I just wanted it to be mine and perfect when I did listen to it for the first time...and so Fifer bought it for me today from the CD Warehouse (one of the only good places to buy CDs nowadays as the selections at Hot Topic are getting less and less what I like every time I go in there...although I have to admit, they still have a lot of good music but still...I guess maybe my tastes are changing...?  I know not, all I know is that they didn't have the early november or senses fail the last time I checked and I was very disappointed).  I put it on the way home and turned it up...because listening to music in the car is by far my favorite way of listening to music (besides you know live shows and the such :) ) and oh my gosh, it was lovely...beautiful...emotional...everything about it was great.  I have only gotten to listen to the first five songs...but they are orgasmic...and I save that word only for music that I truly love...When I first bought Leaving Through the Window a year ago...almost exactly a year ago, when I couldn't find anything but If you c jordan on kazaa, I fell in love with so co...they were "the band that changed my life forever", as Allister so adequately put it...and now, I love their new music, if it is at all possible, even more...wow.    Ok, well, I am going to go bundle up, sit outside on my balcony porch in the cold weather, listen to my new CD, think about my life, and ponder the condition of the human race...  Lisa PS- Am very happy with my psat score.  219...top 1%...which means National Merit Semifinalist...which probably means more college money for me...which means more of a chance for me to live out my Boston dream...:)

      So we went to Six Flags last night and who do I see but....Halston.    ::Dramatic pause for significance of statement to sink into the audience::  He was performing a Christmas show on the stage outside of the Cliffhanger and I sat down and watched him and three other guys sing and dance and whatnot while Olivia and Stephen and Olivia's younger brother and sister rode this other ride.  I had almost forgotten how beautiful he is...he is seriously in all probability the most perfect guy I have ever known.  And even though I could only manage to speak about two sentences to him the entire time I had a crush on him, I could just tell how incredibly nice and friendly and humble and smart and...everything he is/was.    Hmm...yeah, and six flags was fun...Olivia and Stephen were a blast to hang out with.  We had some funny conversations.  When I got home at around 10:30, I was really tired and wanted to sleep, but Jennifer had dropped by earlier and said she wanted me to call her and spend the night at her house because she wanted me to help her make her little Christmas baskets, and so I did, and there was much arguing between her and her mother, but not too bad, and Jenn told me how she really is planning on living with me this summer...hmm...  Ok, so, now I left my purse in Jennifer's car so I have to go to Kroger for the billionth time this week to get it back.    Oh yeah, and I got to stay at Olivia's the other night and watch Bend It Like Beckham....mad props go out to Jonathan Rhys Meyers for being so incredibly sexy...  Song of the week:  You and I Both by Jason Mraz...I can't get it out of my head...good song, good song...  Lisa

      Hey hey!  Lessee...last night's show was really fun.  No moshing, but that hardly detracted from my enjoyment of the show.  The first band, Fishboy was absolutely hilarious.  "I'm fishboy...to my left here is Slapbracelet and to my right is Sweatpants."  Hehe.  Sweatpants was this guy that kept this serious straight face the whole time but he had miscellaneous, random instruments.  He played the kazoo, the keyboard, the trumpet, and at one point in the show he starting rocking out with this tambourine, and I mean, he was getting into it...twas hilarious.  Slapbracelet, the drummer, would have been more appropriately named Wolfman, as he had a full grown beard and everything.  He was kinda goofy, in a really weird way, and at one point in the show started drumming with his hands, instead of drumsticks...was very, very cool.  Fishboy, the guitar person and lead singer, was awesome.  He reminded me so much of Max Fisher, from Rushmore (hehe thanks Alice for recommending that movie), and he was hilarious....ah...and the songs...this has got to be one of the most original shows I have ever seen.  Mae was pretty good...had good music, didn't entertain me as much as Fishboy.  And then The Rocket Summer.  I was expecting them to suck...but I really enjoyed them.  It is mainly the one guy, Bryce, and he is truly a free spirit.  At first I thought he was kinda fruity, but as the show went on, I decided that he probably wasn't...especially since he kept singing about girls.  He is a beautiful person, inside and out, in my opinion...his style was unique, and he was an excellent musician.  At different parts in the show, he played all three of the instruments in his band...very hardcore...and I don't even know how many times he called us "rad." and he said this was one of the best shows he's ever played...he loved the audience, and the audience loved him...and he had crowd interaction...he was just a free spirit...and for his encore, he played a Lisa Loeb cover ("I really like this song, but I'm not a wuss." lol) and he wrote a song for his family because they were all there and it was such a pretty and meaningful song...I was about to cry...hehe...and then he played his most well-known song, and that was really fun.  Yes, very good show, am very glad I went...  Afterwards, it was really late (like 1:30) and we went to Kroger's...so Jennifer could see her darling Nick...and yeah, the other Nick was there too, and apparently he told Jennifer I was really cute and he wanted my number but ok, he has had this girlfriend for like a year and they have promise rings and everything and he has cheated on her before...what level of commitment or honesty or merit could I expect from a person like that?  So, Jennifer told him to get his girls straight and we left...  So, that is that.  Went out to eat and grocery shopping with my mom today.  Screw Ryan, I am hanging out with Olivia tonight...ciao  Lisa

      Ok, if I have anything that could resemble a crush on him anymore, it is definitely not because I admire him, or because that I want to be with him, if that makes any sense at all.  I mean, why would you have a crush on someone that you didn’t really like?  I have nooo clue.  He’s only like the rest of them- the rest of the sex-driven, egotistical, nice, intelligent, funny, witty stoner slackers…  Our conversations get more and more interesting every night…  But, let us not speak of these things anymore.  Today was great.  Got up, drove Matt to the airport, came home, went to Fifer’s to make cookies, went and ate Chinese and went shopping, bought a lot of books at the thrift store, went to help set up the garage sale for UiL, listened to James rant on about nothing really, laughed on the inside the entire time, hung out with Fifer and Mrs. Lands, which was fun, went back to Fifer’s, ate dinner, went to Kroger and waited for Jenn to get off, went back to Jenn’s and hung out for a while, and then went bowling with Nick, Nick, and Lance (so it was Nick, Nick, Jennifer, Jennifer, Lance, and Lisa).    Bowling was interesting.  Lance, the guy that I admired from afar all during my tenure at Kroger, was there and…we talked…hehehehehe.   And Lance likes  my  jacket…tee hee.  And he is beautiful, and * sigh *  obviously   completely perfect in every way…oh oh, and he taught me how to put twist on a bowling ball…tee hee hee.  The other Nick (the one that Jennifer is not going out with) was hitting on me a bit.  It was quite amusing.  He was all, “You can put your arm around me if you want.” Or “I came over here to sit by you.”  Definitely not as good as Naomi’s pick-up lines, but it was cute I thought…not sure if he was serious or not…hmm…  Fifer is one of the funnest people to hang out with.  I mean, there were times when I could not breathe I was laughing so hard.  Jesus…man…I just love that guy.  I mean, He  is  Jesus  Christ  for crying out loud…  …breathe…  Ok, sooo, definitely thinking that Sunday isn’t gonna happen, but oh well…I don’t care!!!  He is just…stupid.  He may be “smart” but there are so many things that he is stupid about…well, must go.   I sure am tired from puttering around town today.  LoL.  Lmao.  Jessica's so stupid.  Lisa

      I got to see the tennis team today.  And hang out w/ Brit and Olivia...I misssssss high school....at times like those, anyway.  But then, I think about how if I were here full time I wouldn't be thinking that I love high school...soooo, TAMS=good decision...right?  Naomi's party was interesting.  At first, not many people that I knew....got more comfortable with them as the night grew older...or the morning...whatever you wanna call the 10:00-1:00 time period.  Rolled a couple of houses, the tree on one was quite artistic looking, I wanted to take a picture.  I think Naomi liked my present...mua ha...  Ohhh yeah, the confusion over my bio lab grade has been cleared up and so now I officially have a 4.0.  According to the email Dr. Sinclair sent me, 84 out of the 216 or so people in our class got 4.0s...(its cuz we are all overachieving nerds...but actually, for an averachieving nerd school, not even 50% getting all A's is almost weird, dontcha think?  Oh, and about 20 people got kicked out for having failing grades....Jonathan barely pulled through to stay with a 2.8 (2.7 to stay in and pull it up to a 3.0 by the end of the next semester), but poor Alejandro, who has to leave because of one point in Pre Cal...must go...stupid 69....:(  Am almost finished with Christmas shopping.  Am also almost out of money.  I bought a lot of people presents at around $10-15 for each present, a little more for my mother...it is hard budgeting my money to get everyone presents and still have some for me so I don't have to hit up my mom for money every time I want to go see a movie, ya know?  Umm...I think this is all.  Weird stuff.  Man.  This is some weird, effed up stuff.  Lisa

      Christmas Break has been absolutely blissful so far.  I start out my days by waking up at ohhh around 11:30 or so and proceed to lie in my bed for another half hour, watching the sunlight stream through my window blinds and think about what I want to do that day.  Then, I slowly drag myself out of bed, turn on one of four CDs really, really loud (Thursday, Motion City Soundtrack, Fall Out Boy, or Taking Back Sunday) and take a shower with the door open.  All of this I can do because I am the only one home for the first half of the day.  Then, maybe I get on the internet for a bit, do some insignificant stuff, make lunch, and then I sit down and watch TV for about three hours until my brother gets home, at which point I either continue watching television or go to my room and start talking to my friends online as they all start getting home.  Usually, around 3:30 - 4:00, Jennifer calls, wanting me to go places with her, and I usually end up going with her, to various places.  If that doesn't happen, there is more vegging.  After Jenn and I are done hanging out, other people call and invite me places or sometimes my little brother and I go Christmas shopping and I am home, on average, by midnight or 1:00.  I watch more TV, fall asleep around 3:00, and begin the whole cycle again the next morning.  Of course, I talk about this like it has been a long time, when in reality, this is the pattern I have followed for merely three days now.  Oh, but it feels like it has been a long time.  Tonight I hung out with Jenn, went shopping with my bro, and then went and hung out with Naomi and Rebecca.  We shot off fireworks and watched embarrassing videos of me, Naomi, Bethany, and JoAnn from a couple of summers ago.  "Yeah, Naomi, we can never show these to anyone." "Why?" "Because then they might actually find out that we really suck at being people."  I left her house around 2:00, and now I am back here, blogging.  Yay for blogs.  Oh, Naomi's mom is so cool.  She cooked Chinese dumplings (yummm) for my little brother because he has to bring a Chinese food to class tomorrow.  She was really nice and generous about it, too.  Oh, oh!  And, I got some new shoes and they are really nifty looking, so that is exciting.  Only $18.98 at Uprise.    So, this week has been relaxing and excellent, and I wish I could go through everything, but that would take way too much time, and besides, I suppose it is not all that interesting anyway.  What majorly sucks is that I bought two DVDs from Wal Mart but someone else got Kung Pow for Naomi and my dad doesn't have a DVD player so I have to return them and I don't think I have the receipts...so I hope they still take them :).  Byeee now!  Lisa

      It's funny...these re runs of Saved By the Bell and Boy Meets World get better every time I watch them...  Ok...so I've got some good news, some sad news, and some confusing news.  Which should I start out with?  I think I will start out with the sad.  Because, this really is upsetting...Alejandro's out of TAMS.  He won't be coming back next semester.  He was one of my first friends there, and one of the nicest guys, and he listened to some of the coolest music, and he is just...awesome.  I can't believe he won't be coming back.  It sucks.  It sucks a lot.  I am going to miss him next semester a lot.  I wonder if Jonathan pulled through with high enough grades to stay...last time I checked, he didn't have much of a chance...but I don't know, he might have pulled it off.  Happy news...I got my 250$ for BUGS put into my account today!  I really needed it, too!  So I am happy.  That and my week is filling up fast, looks like I won't be having as much free time as I had originally thought.  Urg.  I haven't gotten to see Olivia yet, either.  But, it is happy news because it reminds me how great all of my friends here are. :)  And I think I am going to dye/highlight my hair today with one of Jennifer's do-it-yourself kits.  Haha.  I am just ready for a change, I suppose.  It won't be a horribly noticeable change, but...it should be interesting.  And now uh...the confusing part...which really, I shouldn't be confused about at all, but yeah...Sunday is the day (kinda like it was for J-Chan ;) ) and we are gonna "hang out"...and really, I have no idea what hanging out means.  What?  Are we going to see a movie?  Are we gonna go out to eat?  Are we gonna sit around his house watching TV and eating cheetos?  Or are we just gonna drive around listening to music or some such thing?  I have no idea what hanging out is, but apparently, that is what we are gonna do.  Hmm....I think too much, need to stop thinking.  mua hahahahahhahahahahahaha.    Lisa

      I have about a million bruises on my body, I lost my watch in the moshpit (for the second time this year), my favorite pair of jeans is ruined (three holes, holy crap), my shoes have turned from blue to black, my ears are ringing, and my body feels like it has been run over by a steam roller thing repeatedly and then thrown from a three story building onto a bed of spikes.  But, I love it.  Ahhhh oh my god how I love it.  The Code and None More Black were good.    Against Me! was really good.  Rise Against was good.  AntiFlag was AWESOME.  There is so much difference between real punk moshing and pop punk or emo moshing.  I've seen soo many bands...The Juliana Theory, Something Corporate, SR 71, The Riddlin Kids, Bowling For Soup, MxPx, New Found Glory, The Starting Line, Mest, The Used, The Suicide Machines, Vendetta Red, Allister, Homegrown, The Early November, Senses Fail, Northstar, Letter Twelve, Clover St, Fall Out Boy...and tons more...I cannot even name them all!!...never have I been in a mosh pit to this degree of...insanity...  It was violent, crazy, hardcore, and violent...it was like...gah I can't even describe it.  This show was awesome beyond description.  I feel so free at shows...it is like, I let go of everything and all my inhibitions...it is like the raw me, the raw feeling and the raw music, and it is...my sanity.  The insanity is my sanity.  I seriously don't know how I would emotionally survive were it not for music.  I think if everyone at one point in their lives experienced being in the music like that and just outletting their emotions like I get to when I go to concerts, the world would be a much, much better place.  La La La and the punk rock community is so...family like.  I mean, it is like...unified...I don't know how to describe.  Everyone passes around water bottles and shares the wealth... they help you up when you fall in a moshpit...they are so nice in general.  And smart.  I think that punkrockers are some of the smartest people in the world.  Ahh...greatness..  Must go. Sleep and I can barely type this cuz my body is so exhausted...sdk;jl blah tee hee  Lisa

      So, uh, basically, my life is really boring and so I don't have all that much to blog about anymore.  So, I will try right now...hmm...  All I did this week was study...and climb a tree...oh! and on Tuesday me and Naomi made some snowflakes to add to our festive doorway.  Rebecca taped a Christmas tree on her door.  It was pretty hardcore, let me tell you.  But, we had to remove all of our personal items from our door because it is December break.  One whole month.  Woo!  I can't wait.  For Naomi's mom to pick us up, that is.  I think she just left like ten minutes ago.  *Sigh* oh well.  So, I took my last two finals today.  Bio and chem.  There were two for biology, the cumulative was optional, for if you wanted to replace your lowest exam grade with it..the first one was a little bit hard, pretty sure I got an A though, and the cumulative was simple.  So, that went well.  Chemistry is what killed me.  Our professor is a psycho and so much of what was on the exam we never learned or went over.  It was freeking craazy.  Half of our exam was multiple choice, 50 of them, and I made an "educated guess" on ohhh about 20 or so.  The other section was a little easier but I am still not sure AT ALL that I did all of them right.  I had to make a 77 to keep an A in there...not sure I did it...aw shucks.  Oh well!    Dr. Allen emailed me and told me I got an A in Pre Cal with a 95 on my final.  Yay! :) I studied hard for that.  I made a 90 flat in the class.  Next semester I will definitely pick it up in Cal.  Oh and I turned in my book for that class.  Ha Ha.  I don't think the old lady noticed that chapter 7 was all loose-leaf paper stuck in there.  Tee hee.  You make me dizzy runnin circles in my head.  One of these days I'll chase you down....  YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME BREAK OUT...MAKE ME BREAK OUT....  I've always wondered what they meant by that.  Does the person that is running circles in their mind made them get acne?  Break out of what?  Maybe I should read the lyrics...hmm  So, it is my first Christmas break from TAMS.  I only get two of these.  It is weird thinking how I won't see any of these people for a month.  Kind of how it was weird thinking I was moving away at the end of the summer.  Everyone was going crazy moving all their stuff today.  I have a lot of stuff to move too.  Well, I suppose that is it.  Hopefully, I will have a 4.0.  That would rule like...something unbelievably cool.  BYEEEEeee Lisa

      Tonight  is  a full moon.  Thanks for pointing that one out, Fifer.  Of course, your reasons are a lot more crazier than mine, but eh...oh well.  I woke up this morning and I did not feel like I was at TAMS, or here, or anywhere that resembles anywhere I've ever been actually.  It was like...I was living someone else's life.  I was taking a shower and I was like, wow this doesn't seem like my life.  I proceeded to go with Laura to see our English professor about our paper and my two final essays and exam...and still, I didn't feel like I was there, or that any of that was actually happening.  I went to eat and for some reason, none of the food seemed appetizing to me.  So I got a bowl of Frosted Mini Wheats.  And then Fruity Pebbles.  Then we went and talked to our biology professor about our final exam and still...I don't think it had set in that hey I am living my own life.  And uh, after that, I have no clue what I wasted my day away doing...I know at one point I took a lot of pictures for Naomi of David...all candid pictures... but i mean, it wasn't like I was being creepy about it..he knew that i was taking pictures..but he didnt know when...and they were really random...I think that being a photographer would be very hardcore.  I kinda want to see Abby's photo essay about the door from the other night.  And then me and Rebecca and Naomi said we were going to study outside.  So we "studied" for a while and then we rolled down the PEB hill for like 30 minutes in my big blue blanket.  And that was pretty crazy and fun.    Oh and then I spent two hours helping Cherie and Starr and Naomi package all of our soldiers Christmas gifts...that was a lot of hard work.  Oh, and I got to see the full moon tonight!  I made a point to go see it to explain why things are so weird for me today.  It was absolutely beautiful.  Umm...is that really all my day consisted of?  I think I wasted it all away, but it was the coolest waste away of a day I've ever had...if only because I didn't feel like I was living my own life the entire time.  OK SO YOU HAVE ALL BEATEN ME TO IT NOW.....WHAT'S NEXT!?!?!? I am so far behind all y'all.    *Sigh* I do not have a crush on him anymore, I swear to you.        Then, why do I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about how we are supposed to "hang out" over Christmas break?  STUPID STUPID STUPID.    Stop.  -Retard Girl

      So many things to blog about, so little time.  This weekend has been the best.  Where should I start?  Lisa's Hardcore Night of Fun and Fantasticness?  The wedding of my best friend?  My trip down memory lane?  Nostalgia?  My visit to Becky's house?  What, what what?  My mind is racing a hundred miles an hour despite the exhaustion that is taking over my body...and mind...lol I haven't even started studying for finals....OH WELL!!!!!  LoL I will faillllllllllllllll.  That is funny. Fail fail FAIL.  Hahahahahahaha.  That is freaking HILARIOUS.  Umm..anyway, I have been non stop since Thursday...umm... ok...  WELL, I got picked up and then we went to the rehearsal and Ben (Ryan's brother) was the Best Man and my escort down the aisle.  HE LOST LIKE 3,000 FREAKING POUNDS I swear to you.  The last time I had seen him was about two years ago before he went off to college and when he still went to Woodland West.  He was a chunky fellow.  I might even go as far as to say he was fat.  But holy crap I saw him and I was like that is BEN!>!>!>?!?!??!  because jiminy crickets he was SKINNY.  I mean, seriously...SKINNY no meat.  A completely different persoN!!!!  i was like wwhoaaaa. what happened and then Sarah was like it was the drugs because he used to be on a lot of crap and i was like holy CRAp those must have been some hella powerful drugs.  But he was super nice and I will get to that later.  ANYway  I saw Aimee and Kristen for the first time in FOREVER.  Them two and Sarah were the other three brides maids.  I was the Maid of Honor!  Rehearsal dinner great fun.  AMy gave me a charm bracelet as my present for being a bridesmaid and it was really cool because i don't have one or I mean I didn't have one and it is really pretty and I talked to Cody and Courtney and Sarah and Craig and Kristen the whole time and I really felt comfortable and at home and it was really...nice.  Sigh.  And then Friday I spent the whole day getting ready for the wedding and chilling with Sarah and Cody and Brett.  My hair took like two hours to do!!!  Then we were running around with Amy getting all these last minute things and then before I knew it it was time for the wedding!!  I had my hair done, my dress on, and my makeup all done prettily (by Kristen) and I got a lot of compliments.  I feel pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.  Haha west side story ok im done.  Amy was. So. Gorgeous.  I mean.  Wow.  I knew she was beautiful.  But she shined last night.  She was gorgeous.  She gave meaning to the word beauty.    So when I met Ben in the middle he was just like, "You look really nice."  It was super duper sweet.   He had complimented my hair earlier too.  Aww.  When I was standing up there for the duration of the ceremony, I was watching Amy and Ryan and my mind was racing.  It reminded me of how people say before you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes.  I remembered everything Amy and I had ever been through together.  From every two hour long walk we've taken together to those times we would stay up until four o clock eating ice cream and watching movies.  I remember the time we just started driving at midnight and ended up an hour away in the middle of nowhere and we never ran out of things to say.  I remembered sitting in her room with her when she was obsessed with the dark and all she had to light her room was a black light.  I remember when she told me about her first kiss and how I made her tell me EVERY detail.  I remember when she told me about losing her virginity and exactly how she told me.  I remembered walking to her uncle's house from the movie theatre one summer afternoon as it was pouring down rain...and how we called Spencer after we had gotten back there and dried off.  I remember the night her house burned down and how she was only worried about her cat.  I remember the entire summer that we spent almost every night together at her uncle's house and when she told me why my parents had really divorced...I remembered everything...from the year our lives were living hell because of Drew and Elise to her sitting in the car with me after I found out my parents were getting divorced and telling me she would take good care of Brownie while we were living elsewhere until my dad moved out...to our midnight swims under the stars where secrets were not secrets and we felt like the closest of friends...because I suppose that is what we were...  All of this rushed at me in a deluge of memories and flashbacks as I stood there watching Amy and Ryan pledge their undying love to each other.  And I just cried.  They were both happy and sad tears.  I was letting go of a part of my childhood...Amy and I...we won't ever get to spend every part of every day together anymore.  Things have changed, we've grown up...things are different now...but my tears were also happy.  She was moving on to live her life with the only guy that has ever really complemented her as a human being.  I see them together and I see that they love each other.  For the past two years...they have loved each other.  I think that their love can only grow from here.  oh my gosh there is so much more stuff I wanted to say but this is so long already and I know how annoying it is when people write a freaking novel in their blogs and people just have to scan over it...hehe that is WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW ISNT IT.  Ok so anyways to make today short I got home at 1 in the morning from cleaning up after the reception and woke up at 11:00 (after going to bed at like 3:00).  and then me and naomi went to visit Becky because her dad died last week and we caught up with her (so many memories sigh).  And then Jennifer and Fifer came over and we watched Pirates (my third time of the weekend :) ) and then came Lisa's Hardcore Night of Fun and Fantasticness.  Too many things to write a  lot about but here goes.  Slackers lounge so cool..reminded me of indie coffee shops I want to find in Boston...guys that were playing there were super cool...I found one of them afterwards and told him that I liked their music and he said it meant a lot to him.  His name was Jeff but every calls him Ffej (his name backwards) it was so hardcore.  and then his brother (the one with the beanie) that was really funny cuz he just got so excited when he got to sing I moshed with later.  and fall out boy was awesome and allister was cool and abby was freaking insane and fifer is super cool  and then during allister's encore abby is all "you should go" and i was like, "go where?"  and she just point up and then she gets this guy and he gets his friend and they lift me up and I AM FREAAAAAKKING CROWD SURFING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY FREAKING LIFE AND IT LAST FOR LIKE TWO SECONDS BUT THEY WERE THE MOST HARDCORE TWO SECONDS OF MY STUPID LIFE.  Oh my gosh and then i was on the stage but i didnt know it and no security guard came and got me so i jumped up and ran around behind allister and i didnt know what to do so i jumped and tried to do the rock symbol thing and i just jumped off the stage and I WAS ONSTAGE WITH ALLISTER.  and then i ran to abby and fifer and I was likee akhdskfjaslkfjsjfkjf that was soo dfgjikf shfwikjf cool anf oidsjfsjlsjv..  janfkjk  and they were like do it afain do iit again and ithen the set eneded and we ran out and threw beer bottles of the side of the roof (parking lot) and then we drove home and abby was being the insanest of insanity on the way home and talking in lyrics and about james hairy ass and wow.  wowness.  like jennifer with more cussing..  moshing.  crowd surfing. meeting the musicians.  indie coffee houses.  fifer.  abby.  me.  fall out boy.  allister.  buying cd and t shirt.  GReAT FunF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Olivia is supposed to be coming over in a little bit and we are gonna be very h.c. and stay up allll night even tho i should sleep to be rested for finals week but I DONT CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Woot!

      Ok, today was decent for a few reasons.    1) Our biology prof was out again today so no class...but actually, this might be bad since she hasn't been in for oh about 2 weeks so we have no idea what we are learning and our final is next week.  2)  I got to take an hour long nap until Pre Cal.  Yay.    3) In Pre Cal, I figured out that I did barely pull an a (90) for my homework average which is 17% of our average so the bare minimal I can get on my final to make an a in there is an 83.  I think I may be able to pull it off.  4)  All I have to make on the Chem final to make an a is an 80.  So that was the first half of my day.  I looked up so many colleges today.  It would seem that no matter where I go, whether it be Public or Private, as long as it is out of state, it will cost a considerable amount of money.  And I don't know how many of my credits a Private university will take, but almost any public one will take almost all two years I am getting from here.  I don't know exactly where I want to go...sigh...I need to visit all the campuses...oy...  Anyway, I also took care of the rest of my tuition and my library fines today.  And then I took a 3-hour-long nap and was awakened to Naomi telling me how she finally talked to this guy she had been admiring from afar.  She reminded me a bit of Ricky from American Beauty.  She told him that she had been watching him from afar every day and that she thought he was interesting or something like that.  I was impressed cuz you know, I would never have the guts to do something like that.  They guy has a very, very cute thrift store style that is like actually thrift clothes not the Abercrombie "Vintage" style that seems to be getting popular now.  And he is very unique...obscure music...The Rachels is his favorite band. Hmm but nuff about that.  For dinner I had all this good, good food because the cafeteria had a Christmas dinner type thing and oh my gosh they had cheese cake that had a little peppermint flavoring to it...it was...soo....delicious.  I want to learn how to make it.  Oh, and Olivia is excited about going to the concert now so that is happy.  I think it will be Me, Fifer, maybe her, and maybe JoAnn.  Fall Out Boy here I come.  Then MHA had their Pillow Fight GA.  That was...interesting.  I had a little bit of fun, but not too much.  Eh, I guess pillow fights are more fun when they are spur of the moment and with your closest friends.  I dunno...it was ok though.  That is about it.  No classes tomorrow!  Yay!  And not really Friday either because I will not be here!  And then the show Saturday night!  Fun fun!  I am excited.  Lisa

      i feel rejected on so many levels.  but yay for my pre cal test.  i actually have a chance at making an a now :).  I have to get a 94 on the final and at least a 90 for my homework average, which we get back tomorrow...i have no idea what my homework average is...  i want to go to this concert saturday, but i dont think anyone is very enthusiastic about going to it with me.  and i dont want to go alone.  what is there to do.  i think that i would be a lot mentally healthier if i got to go to a concert and mosh.    and i dont want to study no matter how much people tell me i should cuz it is dead week.  stupid dead week.  stupid finals.  although i guess i should be thankful for finals since they give me a chance at making a 4.0.  but then why do i even care about making a 4.0?  i dun even know.  ciao lisa

      I am in my own way honoring Abby and Fifer's pact, even though I am technically not a part of it.  This past week I have been so...unlike me...it is kinda crazy.  I mean, it started with the whole talking to him thing...which happened twice...and then on Thursday (I think it was) Christina was talking to me about the date auction and when I made the argument that I am not the type of person that likes standing up in front of a large group she was like, "But you need to conquer your fears!" and that is when it hit me that I was being a chickenshit again, just like I always am, and I thought about how Abby and Fifer had that pact.   Soooo I agreed to do it.  Ah ha ha.  AND I am going to do it by myself.  Other ppl are auctioning themselves off in groups but I, Lisa, insisted on being up there by myself because this is a new chapter in my life (so sad I didn't get to end the old one in a certain ironic way, eh Fifer?).   At the Dessert and Discourse last night about objectivity/subjectivity in the arts, I spoke up THREE times, despite my irrational fear of speaking in front of large groups.  And one time I made a very viable point in the discussion.  Twas great.  I am tired of being the quiet shy girl.  From now on I am not going to be afraid of talking or introducing myself to people, or anything!!  Mua ahjahahahahahaha!!!  The other night I was at an Astronomy Club meeting and a few of them were talking about Bush's plan to give more funding to NASA and so I was like, "Oh pleasseee, he just did that to get the nerds to vote for him!" and then I looked around and was like...er...crap.  I was talking to a guy with floppy hair, glasses, and pants that when he sat down went half way up his calves, a girl with red pig tails, freckles, and glasses, and a small Asian kid that hardly ever talks.  They all looked at me for a second, and the guy said something that sounded like an agreement maybe and then they went back to talking.  I felt really bad.  They didn't look like they minded that much, and I realize that coming to our school, everyone must be a nerd in some way, but they have probably been teased their whole lives.  Maybe I should have said to get the intellectually motivated population of America to vote for him.  Oh and now there is a couch war between us and the guys.  It is pretty funny.  I saw Mike and this other Asian kid steal the couch that we have on our floor the other day so I put up a flyer that said "MISSING COUCH" and they took it down and then Nicola brought it up at our "town meeting" and the next day it went missing from the boys' floor.  So they put up their own flyer...of no creativity, it basically said what mine said...anyway, it is quite interesting.  So this is gonna sound kinda weird, but TAMS really is beginning to feel like home.  It is like everybody knows everybody else and in some kind of weirddd way, we are like one really big family of intellectually motivated kids.  I just realized this week how much it is gonna suck to graduate...or closer, when the seniors this year graduate.  Hudgens and Mordechai are two of the most interesting people I have ever met.  Hmm...  I am really worried for Jennifer.  Fifer and I were over at their house and her dad and mom went freakin psycho again, and I didn't want to leave, but we kinda had to, and when we came back her car wasn't there but it wasn't at my house or Nick's house either and I have no idea where else she would have gone...I need o go see if she is at work today.

      I remind myself of a giddy school girl.  At lunch today, I was leaving Bruce and going to get an ice cream cone but they were all gone and then he came up behind me and was like, "Tell me there are still some left!" and then I was like, "No, I don't think there are." and he looked and was like, "Damn.  This ruins my day." (it was amusing) and I was thinking, well, it just made mine...hahahahahahahahahaha.  ahem.  And so I was like, "Maybe we should go ask for some more." but then me and Sarah left and him and his friend left behind us....and that's it.    I know it might seem like I am obsessed because all my blogs lately have been about this, but it is the most interesting thing that goes on, and Sarah and I have many, many jokes about it (much like Fifer and I have jokes about journalism boy and turkey), so it gets discussed a lot.  Hmm...he is so awesome.  Icecream cones are deck.  Lisa

      PS- Why doesn't anyone try to compensate my lack of love with coffee cake icecream and a bottle of ten dollar wine?  Maybe I should start rocking the haro sport and cowgirl blues.  Bleh.  I just want some ice cream.

      Highlight of the day:  I talked to him.  Yayyyyy.  It was...interesting, lol.  Will start talking to him more often now.  Nonhighlights of the day:  I didn't get to finish my Cal hw, I got my homework grades back and I have a 75.  I thought I had like 20 pages left of my English reading when in reality I had about 100 left.  Oh yeah and then Rebecca told me that I could submit my chem quiz by tomorrow at noon and of course that wasn't right, it ended tonight at 8:00, so I get a zero on that.  Woo hoo.  Basically, what this all means is that I will have to work my ass off to get good grades in my classes.  I seriously feel so behind in all of them, save for government, and we don't really have to do much in there.  I usually don't get stressed, but our first chem and cal and bio tests are coming up, and I am so underprepared.  I really need to start studying more.  Gah, I hate school sometimes.  Nothing else happened.  Lisa

      You know how you have those weekends that just completely relax you and make you all warm and fuzzy inside?  I mean, of course, if you are stuck in this TAMS jail like I am all week, and going home just gives you freedom and you get to see so many people, and remember what it was like before you came here and stuff.  Saturday after going to Summit for a while, and almost barely missing Jesus/Nancy/Bob/Ryan/James/Judas (although, technically, I didn't miss James, but he was Judas and then he called Ryan Judas which put them equal to each other by the transitive property, which meant that Jesus was in fact Judas which means that Jesus/Judas actually betrayed himself with a kiss.  Which defies the physical limits of a normal human being.  But..um...I digress..), I went home and got to see my grandparents and my aunt Denise and they fixed me this drink with vodka...I just felt so a part of the family...cause they don't give the "kids" the alcohol, but they give the "adults" alcohol.  Woo.  It wasn't very much, tho.  Oh, and it was really good.  It was like sprite, coke, and vanilla vodka.  Hmm...  And then we went and saw Clover St.  They were so incredibly amazing, I just cannot even describe it.  Willie was singing his bleeding heart out, and I just absorbed the music and felt the emotion flowing through my veins.  The guitarists rock too.  They are all so good.  Man.  They put on one of the best live shows I have ever seen.  I can't wait til their CDs come in.  Ben, one of the guitarists, saw my Letter 12 shirt and was like, "We played with them and Senses Fail!" and I was like, "I was at that show!!" and so that was really cool.  Then Willie was wearing this shirt that said, "Ben is NOT a person 2004." and one the back it said that he was a gnome and a rice krispie treat and two other things that I can't remember.  They are so deck.  I want a shirt that says Ben is NOT a person 2004.  Haha.  The ride home had this atmosphere...we were all so tired, and we were playing the MCS, and the fog was so thick that we couldn't see some of the overpasses, and when Track #3 came on, all of us knew every single lyric, it was so...infinite.  It's like, going to Deep Ellum to see shows now isn't as special as it used to be, but I enjoy it just as much.  The fact that its become just something that we get to do a lot makes it even...better...I think.  I really feel that I am in my element, sitting in the Slackers lounge, or standing by the main stage...and just watching the people and the bands and getting into the music...I can't think of a more perfect evening.  Today after church and eating with the Pattersons plus Craig, Sarah, and Dan, Me and Jenn and Fifer and Abby all went to Abby's to ride horses.  I think it's cool that we have almost a group thing going on now.  I haven't really had one in a long time, but it's like...when we get the chance, all four of us always hang out.  I really like it.  Anyway, we rode for like and hour and a half.  My horse's name was Molly and she was painted...brown and white.  She was actually a pony, and she was a free spirit.  I could tell she hated being told what to do, and when we started cantering, she would automatically start whenever I would tell her to go from then on.  She started going so fast sometimes, it was awesome.  Abby was afraid I was going to fall off, but I had a good grip on the saddle thing, and I stopped her if she got to go too fast.  Oh and Jenn said something about each of the horses showing something about our personality and said Fifer's was big and white, and mine was short and plump.  Ahaha.  Then Fifer was like, yeah and yours has attitude.  I thought it was funny.  But I have so much fun with thems.  Abby's house was awesome.  It was cluttered and stuff.  Hmm...anyway.  i dare you to forget the marks you left around my neck. -tbs  (gotta love em)  Lisa

      I am sitting with Fifer at Summit right now.  Interesing, ne?  We were contemplating alternate universes and stuff...yeah.    SAT was cool.  My calculator wouldn't turn on for the first math part, but it was ok.  Hopefully, I got a 1600.  Woo.  Haha.  That would be funny.  I love irony.  My brother and I had a convo yesterday about how I think Jesus was albino.  For different reasons.  Umm...Anyway.  Albino and HAIRY.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHa.  Gah, Jesus is so many different things.  And I don't mean this in any disrespectful ways at all.    Screw the 1600, all I want is a   1510  .  Then I can be like....HAH.  Going now.  Khubiar is acting up.  Lisa

      In Government today, our teacher was giving us examples of how politicians who express beliefs that are outside of what the public finds acceptable, then they will not win an election.  So she gave us a lot of different examples like the guy that was running for president and said he was completely against social security and then hypothetical situations like, "What if a candidate said that in order to keep crime down, he was going to execute criminals by publicly beheading them?" and then she was like, "What if a candidate said that he wanted to punish people in pocession of marijuana by having them publicly..." (she paused here as if searching for a word to use) And then from somewhere in the middle of the class someone yells really loud, "STONED!"  Oh my god, it was effing hilarious.  Our professor had to stop lecturing for like five minutes while she laughed.    And then Rebecca and I went to the GAB because she thought that there was a supplementary Calculus class today, but there wasn't.  So I laid down on the benches outside of the class and took a nap for an hour while Rebecca started her homework.  I felt so...Bohemian.  She said I looked really peaceful and something about my dream sure did put me in a good mood.    At one point, there was an encounter with the boy, and I completely overanalyzed the situation, as usual.  And, as usual, I did not talk to him.  Oh well.  Screw caring about ever finding a guy.  On the way home around 4:30, my brother and I listened to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack really loud, and it was a really perfect day.  I loved every minute of it.  I got here and then Amy called so I went over there and it was fun.  Heather was adorable and Craig and Brett were funny, and Amy and I got to talk a lot, and I got to tell one of my Michael Jackson jokes that is kinda dirty.  Haha.  It was funnn.  Yay for Amy's house.  My family is being extremely annoying right now.  And I really don't feel like taking the stupid SATs in the morning, and stuff...and I really want the Yellowcard CD and the 9 CDs that I have decided to burn from Steve.  Mua haha.  He only picked 8 to burn from me.    Lisa  PS Results from MAPP Test  Accounting & Finance:   NOOOOOOO    Animal Care: No   Automotive & Diesel: Noo   Aviation: Don't think so   Business: Haha no.   Computer: Yeah, right.   Culinary & Bartending: Sounds interesting, but me?  a cook?  and bartending couldn't make me much money could it?  Plus I'd be around drunks all the time.   Dental: Putting my hands in other people's mouths?  I think not.   Education & Childcare: I would velcro them all to a wall.   Electronics & Computer Repair: It could happen.  I'd be incredibly bored with my life, but it could happen.   Energy Trades: what is this?   Heating & Refrigeration: ummm no   Machine Trades: eh?   Medical & Healthcare: prolly not   Military: ha ha HA   Motorcycle & Small Engine: umm righttt   Office Professional: no i dont thinkkkk sooo   Taxidermy: What the...nevermind, not even going to comment on this one   Transportation & Trucking: Lmao...that would be GREAT.  Until I was shot and murdered, of course.   Travel & Hospitality: Travelll....now HERE is something I'd like to do.  Can you major in travel and Hospitality??  If so, I've never heard of it.  I don't think it is a real job, I think these people made it up.  I think I really will be a penniless musician living on the streets of New York.  I think that it would be first on my list if the MAPP Test people considered it a career.

      I got a fortune cookie tonight from Clark's Chinese New Year dinner thing.  "For a good cause, wrongdoing may be virtuous."  I think I've found my excuse for everything I do from now until I die.  Ok, here it goes.   Haha, wait, first I have to say that a guy wearing a red dickies trucker hat just sat across from me and it's amusing thinking about Fifer and Abby's aversion to trucker hats to say the least.  Now, where was I?  Oh, yes.  My mind is spinning, and I just don't know what to think about anything or anyone.  Things the past couple of days have been crazy...surreal...and I don't even know if they would be surreal to normal people, but definitely to me.  Tonight was just insane.  From the moment I woke up and went to get my spend a day.  Of course, it really just got insane starting with all of us going to Clark to eat after the soccer game.  Apart from 10 different things just happening at once, and only me I think understanding everything that was going on, there were my personal issues that I just...I dunno.  There was the boy and then there was Steve, and I was just like...well, I don't like him.  But then, Ahhh oh my gosh.  And the boy.  He was wearing the sexiest outfit I have ever seen on anyone in my entire life.  And it wasn't because of the style or because it showed off his figure.  It was because it was the most hideously unmatching thing I have seen in my entire life...and he knew it...and he didn't care.  He doesn't care.  It was so beautiful.  Plus, he looked good in it, even if Naomi and Rebecca thought otherwise.  Red athletic shorts, a white shirt, and a brown leather looking jacket over it...it was so unmatching...but it was the most attractive thing ever...to me.  *Sigh* From one side, I had Naomi and Kevin trying to get me to go and sit with him, trying to get me to go talk to him.  From the other side, Osato and Rebecca, who had no idea what the people on the other side of me are saying, are telling me to go get the number of this guy they thought was my style or something or maybe they just thought I needed to get over my incurable shyness.  And then there was Zahir and Rebecca hooking up.  Naomi and Kevin hooking up.  Leah, who thinks that Chris likes her, when he really doesn't, and is beginning to develop a crush on him.  And Chris, who didn't say anything to Colin and David (who are the ones who started the whole Chris likes Leah thing), is now being told that he has to be the one to break the news to Leah, and then he sits with these two girls and meets them...Chris is one of the deckest people you will ever meet, by the way.  Leah, all the time, still thinking that he likes her.  And then Kacy walks in with Andy, and they sit alone together, which fuels Naomi and Rebecca talking about how she is a hoe because this is like the third guy or something...she is apparently dating two guys at the same time.  But I don't care because it's none of my business.  So that is going on and then Kaufman and Abby and Megan and Allan sit behind us...Megan and Allan just hooked up a while ago.  Then, Steve arrives, and he is just...himself...and well, the old crush from last semester...ahhhhhhhhhh...so I went and said hi to him while the rest of thems people were planning what to do about walking home and who would walk with who.  And they decided that I was the one that would walk back with Leah and ask her about how much she really likes Chris.  Soo I do that.  And the crush is not serious yet, I think.  So that is good.  And the boy left by himself a lot earlier, and Sarah was trying to get me to leave to, so I would start a conversation with him.  But I'm so pathetic.  I can't even talk to him.  I am so shy, I can't do any of that.    Then Naomi and Kevin and Rebecca and Zahir all wanted to go play hide n go seek, and all of a sudden, since Leah wasn't there anymore, I feel like I am the tag a long.  The Fifth Wheel.  The only one without a guy.  So I start backing up.  "I think I'll just go back to my room." I say.  Kevin and Naomi don't want to leave me out, so they convince me to go.  We go to the fourth floor of the basement of the ISB, way down below in this maze of shelves and books, and then Zahir turns off the lights and we are gonna play hide n go seek.  I have to admit, it was deck as ef.  But...it happened just as I thought it would.  With them pairing up into their little dating things, and me being left by myself.  So I left.  And I came up here.  To the computer lab above ground here at the ISB.  I applaud all of you who read through this long description of tonight.  My head hurts.  Everything is so crazy.  I feel so...left out.  For some reason.  Kevin and Naomi.  Rebecca and Zahir.  Lisa and...nobody.  Nobody for the entiredy of her life.  Because things like that just don't happen to me.  I am pathetic.  P a t h e t i c.  I can't even start a fucking conversation with him.  I mean seriously, wtf.    But.  I guess it does not really matter.  The only of my friends left that hasn't had a kiss, the only experience with relationships being with people like Daniel Ruiz.  I suppose I am glad that I don't know what I am missing.  Perhaps, and maybe hopefully, I never will.  Kevin and Zahir are extremely cool people.  With that said, I think I am done writing about this.  I met the guy that always plays the recorder outside of Clark.  His name is Jeffrey.  He seemed really nice, especially when I told him that everytime I heard him play, I thought it was beautiful.  Surreal?  No.  Maybe not.  But I never thought I would meet him, that's for sure.  When I go home this weekend, maybe I will be able to sort all of this out in my head.  But then, there is the meet on Saturday, and we all know who will be there...   If I could just speak up, I would say that there is no truth. There is only you and what you make the truth. -Bright Eyes  Lisa

      Ok so I am on the University computers right now and this backaspace button really sucks so frm now on i am not going to correct any of my mistakes, no matter how much it might bug me.  It's weird writing a blog around all these ppl  ::glances over shoulder:: ok.  We were in West last Thursday and this guy was talking to a table of girls, well, not just talking, I guess you could say he was "witnessing" to them.  Anyway, I looked at him and I was like, "Naomi, I know that guy.  Where have I seen him before?"  and she was like, "I dunno...maybe you just see him around campus." and I was like.."Hmm...I don't think so." and so I thought and thought about it and finally came to the conclusion that he looked a lot like Darren Beames, but it wasn't him, so I thought maybe it was just that he looked like him and so that is why I thought I recognized him.    So some nights later we were eating at Clark and he was sitting by himself at the table next to us and I was like, "Naomi, there is that guy that I know I know again."  and she was like, "Fine I'll ask him."  So she asked him his name and he was like, "My name is Riley." and we all introduced ourselves.  And I was like, "Hmm Riley...I don't think I knew anyone from Summit named Riley." so I thought that the Darren thing was probably it.   Fast forward to today: Naomi, Rebecca, and I went to Bruce to get snacks (aka I got a bowl of cereal) and Riley is there again.  He goes up to Naomi and is like, "Can I just say that I love your shirt?" (it said Satan is a Nerd) and she was like, "Thanks!"  and then he looked at my shirt and was like, "Letter 12?!  I know them, they are some of my best friends and I am making their music video!"  We got into a conversation about Summit and him knowing Jasper but not Matthew and we ended up eating together and then he said that his name was Riley Morris and I was like ok where have I heard that name before.  And then in an instant it all clicked back and i was like, "You had a computer class with Dunja Dunda!" and he was like, "yeahh I guess so.  I talked to her a bit."  and so I was like, "Ok, I was the one with that weird website with the loser list that apparently you and her and Chris all looked at during class."  and he was like, "I have no idea what you are talking about."  Heh.  It was said in a way that made me feel stupid.  But, Dunja used to tell me that he thought that my list was super hilarious and that he wanted to meet me, so I guess that is why I thought he would remember.  Oh well.    He continued to talk, mostly about Christianity, and he said something about Pulp Fiction having a Christian message because Samuel Jackson quotes the bible and so I said something like, "Yeah, and then KILLED PEOPLE."  I think that sometimes, people who are completely obsessed with religion or some set of beliefs, even political ones, can be naive about what they see and what it means, or with accepting the truth as truth.    I don't know why I am writing a whole blog on this.  Hmm...I feel like singing that song.  Anyway, it amazes me that after hearing about Riley Morris (affectionately known as Milo) for so long, I have finally gotten to meet him.  That is all.  Sat by the boy in Chem today.  No talking, once again.  ahhh.  In English, he made some really deck comments and I am so intimidated by him, it's crazy.  Oh, heh, and got involved in the warning war between Taaha and Ryan last night.  Ended up warning both of them.  HHahaha, Ryan was begging me to warn Taaha two more times so I was just like "Click." and his warning went up to  90%.  Taaha thanked me for my "impartiality."  Go him.  Went and saw Secondhand Lions yesterday.  Tyler and Aaron are crazy with their "Muff" and their "Release!"  Also, I want to die upside down in an airplane running into a barn.  And I want to marry the Sheek's grandson.  Mmmm....  Chocolate...  Lisa

      hey guys i'm in rebecca's room right now because my computer is a piece of dog boggle and i just want to kick it in the theoretical computer testicles until it shrieks with the pain and anger of death.  or i want to fix it.  either one would work justtttttt fine.  love is just an excuse to get hurt and to hurt do you like to hurt i do i do i do then hurt meeeeeeeeeeeee then hurt meeeeeeee.  hmm he is so emo, i love it.  but anyway, i really miss blogging but at the moment i don't feel like writing in grrammaticalalean english or anything.  i mean grammar comeon what kind of pointless birdseed filled crap is that.  i dont know who eats bird seed but if you do, be assured that you are no sane person and that i will have victory in the end.  So I think the world is coming to an end.  Why?  You ask.  Well....  because of John Titor.  Yes, yes, the time traveller who predicted the start of an American civil war in 2005 that lasts for ten years, at which point, Russia launches a nuclear attack on the United States, causing World War III.  Now, he was from 2036, and the world hadn't ended then, BUT in 2666 I think we may be in some trouble.  Obviously, in that year, Satan will come to reclaim his children.  but anyway what was i talking about?  oh yes, kama sutra...or is it kuma satra or kumu satra....umm whatever it is, it looks fun and i want to try it.  anyone willing?  867 5309...umm did i screw that one up?  hopefully.  oahahahahahahahahhahahaaah ha.  but um seriously.  these days.  who knows what will come.  Tomorrow we could all be dead.  dead dead dead.  dead as ska music.  lmao.  hahahahahahahahaahahajha.  no no no jk jk jk... to be politically correct, i mean, i dont want to step on any toes here, ska is viable and lively and not dead...umm...but yeah i was thinking today about how there is this guy and i never see him even though he lives here and that is kinda weird.  and then theres this other guy that i am just attracted to solely because of his taste in music.  the question, as posed to Fiferchan:  Is this wrong?  Answer as told to myself by me:  not if im in it for the sex.  Scene:  Guy plays Taking Back Sunday and screams emo scream.  Lisa jumps on him.  Later has to call Rebecca.  NO ITS NOT WHAT YOU ARE THINKING YOU PERVERTs.  I have to call Rebecca when I lose my virginity, I told her I would.  And vice versa.  You know what would be really twlighty zoneish??  If we called eachother *AT THE SAME TIME*.  Whoa.  My brain hurts from thinking about such a coincidence.  Ok so when I am 50, I think we should all get together and make a nude magazine so we can be on Leno.  Who's with me?!?!?!?!?!?!  You may take our lives but youll never take...our ability to make nude magazines!!!! WOOOOOOOOO!!!!  oh right and polly did not come along.  polly sucks.  i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through that piece of cinematic crap.  ok so i have to go...the music is calling.  make love not war.  peace yo. yo .y o.  the lisanator "saving the world by killing one poseur at a time"    AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa

      I went to Dessert and Discourse tonight, which was this philosophical discussion about one of Aristotle's works.  And I realized that Aristotle was full of shit a lot of the time.  Everyone had a discussion during, between, and afterwards.  It was interesting listening to them all talk, although some people gave some opinions that I found stupid and ignorant, and a lot of them just wanted to hear themselves talk.  But it was awesome still cuz it was all these nerds that use words like requisite to describe stuff.  Haha.  They were like blah blah humans just want to find happiness, and I dunno, maybe not, you know?  And they said that humans need to feel like they have purpose, but once again, I dunno.  They said a lot of stuff and got off on a lot of tangents in the course of almost 2 hours, but I can't remember most of it.  Something about the ultimate purpose of man being to have some great thought.  I was just like...er no.  I'd rather live than sit around thinking all day.    I think that happiness requires pain, which causes unhappiness.  Without pain or things that are going wrong, you are bored and stagnant, which would make you unhappy.  This would imply that in order to be happy, you have to be unhappy.  Happiness is therefore unattainable.  I am a content and happy person, but there is still that longing for something more, that ultimate state of unadulterated happiness.  I think that people can get and get and get what they think will make them happy, but it never completely will.  There will always be that longing.  That is an inevitable part of life.  Yes, I know it is a paradox.  But I seriously sometimes think that thought is a curse rather than a gift or an "advantage."  Animals are completely content, no?    Hudgens was funny and insightful and I completely agree with him that it is more in the arts that separates us from animals, more than it is thought.  Emotions and all that.  He is one of those...people that appreciate art..lol.  He meant music, theatre, visual art, films, and every type of art you can really think about.  And then at the end Kevin was telling us about all the different types of discussion we'd be having and he was like, "We'll also be talking about whether or not art can be objective or not.  Can one person take Britney Spears and Mozart, and apply some kind of test, requirements, or definition to them to say which one is better art?"  My answer: No.  I think that art really is subjective.  I mean, you could perhaps objectively determine who has more talent, and who worked harder, but as to whether or not it is better is completely subjective.  That is my opinion as of now, anyway.   Ahh I am starting to sound like the pretentious people.  Will stop now.  But that is part of my view.  Rebecca, Sarah, Naomi, and I had lots of discussions in our room afterwards, and I defended my reasoning behind my support of the idea of legalizing marijuana.  I won't get into that though, because it would take a lot of typing, that I don't feel like doing at the moment.  Anyways, the entire time, I just wanted to scream out that the answer to life was 42.  But alas, I refrained, although I think I should've because I know there were people in there that would've gotten it.  This one guy was talking about how if God was infinite but only knew things in our finite universe, he would not know himself (has its fallacies, I know) and then he was like, "Then, he would explode."  Pretty sure that was a reference right there.   This turned out a lot longer than I intended.  I wonder if when my brother's away message says "Busy" with a little smiley wink face next to it ;) it means he is having sex with his girlfriend.  Lisa

      So I sat by the boy today in English.  Hahahhahahaha.  Of course, the only communication we had was when we accidentally bumped our computer chairs into each other and both said sorry...tee hee...ohh and when he asked me for a piece of paper.  Lance likes  my  jacket  and  the boy asked me for a piece of paper.  I feel so special.  Ok, so I have some work set out for me....hmmmm...it's funny, the comments I make in English...I must sound not-so-smart....oh well.  It makes it harder speaking up, sitting next to the boy, it does.  Lisa

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY FIFER!!!!!  *note: this post was in no way altered or updated after the original post.  Clearly, Lisa, being the good friend she is, remembered Fifer's birthday and by some miracle, Fifer overlooked this gracious wish of happiness on her birthday in an attempt to frame Lisa so that she may uh....take over the world.*    I guess I am stuck in self defense instead of journalism, but that is ok with me :).  It seems like it will be a  really  interesting class.  "Hello, I am going to twist and pull off your testicles and then shove them down your throat.  What was your name again?"  I mean, wow.  She was so blunt and...graphic.  Quite hilarious.  She says the guys have to wear cups because we will practice moves in which we get to kick guys in the groin anndddddddd she says we will work with  fake testicles ....and other stuff.  That class seriously is going to be a lot of fun.  We went swimming today and it worked us out so much.  15 minutes of laps really takes a lot out of you.  Anyway...  I'm kinda worried about Jennifer.  I hear a lot of messed up stuff has been going down lately and I have read about words like "police" and "gun" but yet I have no idea what has happened...it sounds like things are getting horrible.  Fifer, you have to tell me next time I get online!  Oh, and if anyone wants to spend the night with me one night this weekend, you should, and you should tell me by tomorrow at 11.   Lisa

      New bio prof mumbles a lot.  I tried to take notes, really.  Government prof seems really interesting.  Very excited about teaching government, anyway.  We had to take this survey on our political views and such.  And then the TA was all, "I'm an Aquarius who enjoys long walks on the beach."  Yeah, his name was Ryan.  Hmm...deja vu...ahahahahahaha.  Calculus seems like it will be hard, but oh well.  No curves or anything this time :(.  Chem has so many more tams kids in it than last time.  That class is so boring, and the prof can't teach worth crap.  English was pretty cool.  The only guy in tams that I find even remotely attractive is in that class with me ;).  Hmm I'm prolly not punk enough for him though.  He isn't the poseurish kind of punk either.  On the poseur scale I would probably give him a 1 or possibly a 2 or 3.  I can't switch to Journalism until tomorrow so that means I will get to see if I like self defense or not.  I don't think journalism will have any empty seats anyway.  Oh well.    So that is that.  Life is the same as it was, I guess.  I just hung out I guess and went to seminar and to work out and to eat and to the dollar store.  I really need to finish my cal homework, but this is how it always is.  I think I really will go now, though.  We took some pictures of our room but they all really suck, and they don't have much good light or anything....ohhh well!!!!  You all just have to come here and see fo yo self fools.  Lisa

      And I'm back.  *Sigh* (and yes, I really did just sigh)...I dunno...I just don't feel like going to class.  I really want to get out of self defense and take journalism.  Anyway  Highlights of my last days of freedom Friday- got to spend the evening with Ashley and JoAnn...they went tanning first because they are going to go to TRL on Thursday and so I was waiting in the front and then one of the worker guys sat by me and was all, "Can I sit by you?" and I was like, "Sure." but I secretly just wanted to read the article I was reading on Will Ferrell.  So he started talking to me about all these things and I was just like "Mm hmm...yeah...uh huh." but I really just wanted to read my article...so..he finally left I think.  Oh and then we beat Final Fantasy X  !! !! !! yay.  Anyway.  The ending was alright.  No epic ending like VIII or anything.  Hmm but I met Collin, JoAnn's boyfriend and then we all spent the night at my house...and that was...interesting.  Hahahahahaha.    Saturday- Barry's Pizza Pub...really hot waiter...Jenn was acting crazyy.  It was fun tho.  A lot of fun.  And then we went to Dallas to see Big Fish @ The Magnolia but it was sold out so we did nothing for a while and laughed a lot and stuff and then we blasted the Anarchist song and for a second, I really wanted to throw bricks through the Starbucks window, lol.  But I had to settle for stealing...er..."relocating" a cone.  Haha.  Anyway, somehow or another, we ended up going to see it at the Parks Mall @ 10:30...without Jenn...but it was cool.  The movie was pretty good, not amazing, but good.  And Ewan was definitely sexy.  I'm not sure whether or not I find him or the shirtless fight club Brad Pitt on my wall sexier.  Hmm...I could stare at that six pack alllllllllll day.  *drools* ok so we spent a hella lotta time fixing up our room and it is so super deck now I cannot even explain in words how incredibly deck it really is.  I'll post a picture tomorrow maybe.  Lisa

      Dreamworld was effiin hardcore.  "We are are no longer Inferno.  We are hereby called Antigone."  Quite the literary nerds they are.  Dante to Sophocles in one move.  Impressive.  Josh and Chris, the two guys that Abby Fifer and I hung out with at the mall the other day were in it and then this other guy, Logan, that I know from school somewhere.  Josh is hilarious.  They were pretty good.  The Cheese Song was the most deck song I have ever heard.  Then Censored came on and I had seen them once before when they played after Nine Volt Nova (Ryan and Alex's band) and they were really good too.  I knew Joe and Travis from that one, although I am not sure that Travis remembered hanging out with me homecoming night.  I wouldn't blame him, I had trouble remembering who he was and he cracked me up that night.  Chelsea showed up during Censored's set and we got to reminisce about old times and the talent show lol.  She is like goth now, it is weird.  But she is still cool.  Er...deck.  But ANYway.  We went into the bathroom and wrote some dirty things on the wall, because like, it was already covered.  I wrote  urlLink Fifer  .  And then Abby did an SLC line and wheres my penis.  It was pretty hilarious...  Sooo after that we all went and were in the parking lot and Abby is all, "I LOVE EMO!!  Everyone who loves Fallout boy RAISE YOUR HAND!" and it was funny cuz you know they are all punks, the kind that probably hate emo.  lol.  but that was funny too and then we had to leave and so me abby fifer chelsea and josh all had a group hug.  that was pretty hardcore.  Then we were leaving and Abby turned up the Baby I'm an Anarchist by Against Me! and Joe like ran over and near had an orgasm and told us all this story about how he boycotted Trees because his friend got beat up by some Nazis so he didn't get to go to the Antiflag/Against Me! show.  and then he was all, "What school do you go to?" and she is all, "Summit!" and he was all, "Why didn't I meet you before I dropped out?!?!"  "You did!  You made out with my best friend!....and you offered me free sex!" That was definitely the most hardcore thing of the evening.  Well, that and Travis leaving his ass print on the back of her car.  That was effing hilarious.  And deck.  Grood.  I mean good.  I mean great.  I mean great and good.  Ok so we went home singing Baby I'm an Anarchist and that song is great by the way and in the car with Fifer and Abby I just felt infinite.  Like I could do hardcore underground things like this my entire life and die happy.  Hmm...Abby is borrowing my Letter 12 shirt because she has a class with Travis (different Travis).  Hehe.  Oh yeah, and we were our  urlLink matching bowling jackets tonight.  How deck is that.  Oh and Fifer sucks because she had to brag to me about talking to a certain someone that I do not like anymore.  Haha.  "I heart you, James.  Signed, someone who is not Jennifer Lemmers."  We are sooo doing that.  Ciao.  Lisa

      I found this quiz thing so I think I'll post it in just a sec...today a lot of crazy stuff went down.  I checked online and it said my bank account was like -$109 or something crazy like that, and apparently they had charged me this fee three times because apparently I overdrew with my card but then it turned out that it was just because they had been charging me to use the stupid Bill Pay program which I am not using...soooo, I got most of that straightened out.  Hmm.  Yes, and then I went up to Summit and told the lady to send my transcripts to tams...and then naomi and i went shopping for our valentines banquet/dance dresses and i got this black one that is just like a simple dress...i dunno how to explain...but anyway.    Oh yeah, and then someone rang the doorbell and so instead of going downstairs I just walk out onto my balcony and look down and there is this Asian kid and he is all, "Hey is Brian there?" and then this other guy waiting in the truck goes, "Is that Lisa Wauters?!" and I look down and I don't recognize the guy at first and then Naomi is like its Jeremiah and so he is like, "Oh you don't know me." and then I was like, "Jeremiah?!?" because I knew him, I just couldn't remember his name right off...and anyway, he wanted to play football with my little brother and I was just like well this is weird and then to top off the weirdness, Larry frickin Dula was there too and apparently going to play with them.  Larry is the jackass that Amy lost her virginity to.  I told Brian he wasn't allowed to play football with them but he still went anyway.  It was weird, and I don't think those guys are very good influences for my little brother to be hanging out with.  I am so protective...sigh...some of the people I hang out with sometimes are not such good influences either...but I do not want him hanging out with Larry...*sigh*  Well, more than likely i will write in here again before the day is over to tell about dreamworld...maybe i will just wait until tomorrow though.

      I think it is one of the weirdest things how you can go to sleep and then when you wake up you don't have any socks on.  I mean really, socks are not easy things to take off when you are not trying to, but yet somehow, in the course of how I toss and turn at night, my socks come off, and my feet get cold.  Well, I was ready for a long night at home without anything to do yesterday when around 9:00, Jennifer kidnapped me and forced me to go grocery shopping with her.  The bet:  She could buy a basket full of groceries for her mother for under $10.  20 boxes of Pasta Roni, 8 rolls of toilet paper, some paper towels, 14 things of yogurt, and $6.82 later, we were on our way out the door...well, except of course, for the whole having to see her darling Nick and talking to him for a while.  She is quite proud of her shopping abilities.  And I have to say, they are quite impressive sometimes :).    We got back to her house, and she wanted me to to spend the night, so I aquiesced to her request, knowing, as I always do, what is in store for me whenever I spend the night at someone else's house.  But oh well.  It was three hours this time.  Maybe longer, that is just when I stopped checking the clock.  Three hours of laying in the silence and the dark, waiting to be able to sleep.  My mind must have gone over every detail of my life in that three hours.  It was crazy.  I wonder if I will ever have normal sleeping hours.  See this is why I will probably never get married.  I would drive anyone crazy.  Anyway  So I come home to find that Matt has broken my toilet, stolen my Will Ferrell DVD, screwed up my internet connection even more (I am on Brian's computer now), and is now sleeping on the couch, preventing me from watching some early morning television, which I will remedy by playing some Final Fantasy X, because I have not gotten to play an RPG in a good while...like 7 months or so...and I never got to finish that game...but I really want to.  Just one last thing though.  The things my mind thinks about when I am waiting in the dark and silence for three hours until I finally fall asleep, they are not things that I would ever think about normally, and it scares me sometimes what I do think.  Some people think that you get all crazy past 1 AM and so you start thinking and talking crazy-like.  But what if you actually are thinking the clearest you've thought all day?  What if those are the thoughts you are really having when all your guards are down and you are not worried about this thing they call "sanity."  Hmm    Lisa

      Yesterday hung out with Jenn for a while, went back home, slept watching films on IFC that were in different languages, Olivia came to my house at around 7, and I went to Starbucks to talk with her and then she helped me pick out some make up at Wal Mart...then she had to go somewhere...then I went to Amy's to spend the night and hung out with her and Brett and Ryan and Craig for a long time...we played Scattegories...was very fun...I stayed up talking to Craig until like 4 in the morning.  He gave me like his whole life story.  All the different drugs he had done (everything I had ever heard of and then some)...which ones he had sold...how much money he had gotten from them...how many girls he had slept with...how incredibly screwed up everything had gotten and then how he had to go to prison...and how he is never going back.

      Eyes Wide Shut, the first Stanley Kubrick movie I have ever seen, was freaking weird.  I just finished watching it and it is crazy, and the ending, it just leaves you hanging with many unanswered questions, and I don't really see what the message the movie was trying to get across, if there was any.  Umm...but it was extremely interesting.  Lots of nudity, tho.  Heh.  So the last couple of days I have done much I suppose.  Naomi and I reupholstered this couch for our room yestermorning and this morning.   It was a lot of work, but it is definitely the coolest couch I have ever seen.  Yesterday me and the Jenns went and played pool and then afterwards I dyed my hair this reddish auburnish color and it is really dry now and is not cooperating with anything I want it to do and I am not allowed to wash it for a couple more days so that it doesn't get dried out even more.  But I like the color.  Oh and yesterday I bought some bras and a shirt for really cheap so that was nice.  And today I found a Ti-89 for $30 at a Pawn Shop, and they are usually $150 so that was very nice.  I was excited.  And I spent around $13 at Half Price Books and I got a lot of new stuff to read.  Naomi and I were looking at Stephen King books and somehow struck up a conversation with some random guy about them.  It was pretty cool.  Oh, and then today when me and Fifer were at the mall waiting for Jenn and Nick to arrive, we went to the Calendar stand to chat with Abby, and I bought this Beatles Calendar for $4.50.  It is pretty awesome if I do say so myself.  I saw the Albert Einstein one later on and thought that I should have gotten that one, but eh, it was more expensive anyway.  I felt sorry for Abby because her friends ditched her.  She is awesome, so I dunno why they did.  :)  We are gonna have matching shirts and bowling jackets.  Twill be awesome.  I also saw Return of the King with Jenn, Fifer, and Nick.  The movie was good, I actually cried a bit when Frodo was leaving with Gandalf.  For kind of the same reason I cry when I watch Gladiator, but not really.  It's the whole wanting to be back home thing but home just isn't the same..or nonexistent, because the journey or whatever has changed him so much...I mean, the situation in the two movies is entirely different, but there is just a feeling or a theme that is similar, I don't even know how to put into words what I am trying to say.  Sometimes, I almost think Frodo should have died, but then I think that I wouldn't have liked that very much, although I would have cried a lot harder, that is for sure.  Fo sho.  I think that Aragorn and Frodo are definitely the sexiest characters.  Aragorn would be my husband if I lived in Middle Earth.  Liv Tyler can die for all I care.  DIE!  Ah ahahahahahahhaha. No not really, I am just kidding, I don't wish death upon Liv Tyler.  Umm but anyway, and then Fifer came back to my house and we ate and watched SNL and it was cool and then that is when Eyes Wide Shut came on.  Weird stuff that is.    And why do both my mom and Fifer say I talk like a nerd?  I don't mean to, it is just my way of talking.  Is saying "We go back a week from thirty minutes from now." nerdy?  Is "I am confident I could buy some shoelaces at Wal-Mart for cheaper." nerdy?  I mean, really, I would like to know.  TELL ME.    Bye.  Lisa

      Everybody in the world decided to wake me up this morning before noon...hmm...Olivia came in from Daniel's at I don't even know when...and then she left...actually, I don't even know if she left right away, or how long she had been there...I guess that might have been around anywhere from 7 to 9...and so that woke me up, and then Nopei, Naomi's mom called at like 10:30 to tell me about a dinner party she was throwing that night that my family was invited to...and then I fell asleep after that...and then Jenn called at 11 and said she was gonna come pick me up and we were going to go shopping again...of course, I fell asleep after that too, because I didn't get to sleep until around 6:30, and I need at least 4 hours of good solid sleep especially since I never get sleep and oh I dunno cuz I wanted to sleep, and so I was awakened by her thirty minutes later when she came into my house and sat on me because I was on the couch.  CDs I bought at Best Buy with Gift Certificates The Early November- The Room's Too Cold (came with DVD also) Bouncing Souls/AntiFlag split record Midtown- Living Well is the Best Revenge Punk Rock is your Friend (compilation Kung Fu Records)  Woo!  I've only gotten to listen to the early november one so far...and it was when I was feeling really sad because of this stupid thing that happened, but I guess it is ok now.    So I spent the rest of my afternoon watching the marathon of Queer Eye For The Straight Guy and was really touched by some of the things the Fab 5 did for the straight guys.  They gave Butch a chance for his art to be seen by art critics, they gave the vintage rock guy tickets to these events that had his favorite band playing there or something like that...they help them out in their lives as well as giving them a makeover, which can sometimes turn an average or ugly guy hot.  Anyway, I went to Naomi's mom's dinner party later and then me and Naomi and Bethany and Jennifer and Nick all went to Ashley Arms' house and watched Dirty Dancing, and then just hung out there for a bit.  Her house was freaking humungous and her neighborhood had a gate we had to go through with a code on it and stuff.  Crazy rich Mansfield kids.  Then we all went and ate at IHOP at midnight and Jared was our server and he is awesome.  I don't think he ever knew last year that I had a crush on him, but oh well :)...so anyway, he was supposed to be off at 12, but he stayed so he could be our server and then he paid for all of the girls' meals...it was really sweet...like $23 out of his pocket...and he was super funny the whole time because Jenn and Nick brought the other Nick (heh) and Jared pretended to hit on him and it was hilarious...oh and then I leaned back in my chair to get the ketchup cuz Jenn had thrown it on the ground and I fell and everyone started laughing...that was funny.  Afterwards, Naomi and I went back to her house and talked for a while with her mom and such.  Her mom wants to teach me how to be rich.  I think it is amusing.  Hmm...so first day of year was cool I guess.  I want to start watching Queer Eye a lot more.  Lisa

      My head is...aching... from laughing for like four hours straight.  Aw man.  Fifer and Abby never fail to make me laugh...and it is like...just amazing, the things we talk about...I think I am going to hell.  tee hee.  oh well.  So yeah, earlier was....ok.  Olivia is a great friend, so it was cool hanging out with her, but I had just imagined more people and stuff, and then we ended up just driving her friends around because they had been drinking and needed a ride so they wouldn't drink and drive and die.  Then we went some places with them, and I saw some pretty crazy stuff...like people on some pretty hardcore stuff...but we didn't stay there for long.  Then she dropped me off and it was like 1 and then I was talking to Fifer and then I went over there to hang with her and Abby in the after hours and wow I had so much fun, it was just unbelievable...I would put some of our jokes, but then people might think that I was like obsessed with sex, or completely stupid or something, and we all know that I am nothing of the sort!  Hahaha...haha...ha... ....  Um, so, this isn't what I imagined my new years eve to be like, but it was a good way to start out the year, with a lot of my closest friends.  Especially since I went over to Amy's earlier in the day and played Risk and this other game with her and all the ppl that hang over there and then me and Jenn went to the mall and did some shopping, and that all was very deck and fun.  So that is like, all of my closest friends.  Except for like Naomi and Rebecca and JoAnn and Ashley...but eh, Jo and Ash had their own thing...and Naomi told me she wasn't having a party anymore (but ohhh she had something of the sort I hear :p I see how it is)...and Rebecca lives in Granbury.  Sooooooooooo as you can see, it was not possible for me to see them today.  Ok, well, I go now.  Rest in peace.  Lisa

      So Mallory just came by...the issue of Three in Thirty was printed this weekend...much to the dismay of our admin, who got really bitchy about it all of a sudden because they want censorship or something...Mallory might be in a lot of trouble...maybe all of us (contributors) as well.  But she said that she is fighting it tooth and nail and that Adam is right behind her.  Adam is this guy that writes the most hilarious ed/ops for the paper and she says she wants to introduce us because she thinks I'll like him (not like that, mind you).  The camping trip was pretty cool.  The boy decided last minute not to go because he had to study for bio hardcore (the test is going to be very hard and he wasn't the only one who decided not to go...lots of ppl decided not to) so that was sad.  We saw lots of bison and I wanted to cuddle with them but they told me I couldn't for some reason.  The first night the sky was so clear and me and Kelli and Sarah and Tyler and Kyle all laid out under the stars and sometimes it would get so quiet and it was just awesome...That night we had our first toothbrush orgy.  Haha.  Well, actually, all we did was stand around a pump and brush our teeth together, but it was one of those things that makes you closer to people.  We had a gay marriage discussion around the fire that night with the whole group and I told em what was up.  Gay marriages are cool.  That night a few of us also played Truth or Dare...hah.  I picked truth three times and had to answer the questions, "Who do you like?" (2nd gradish, I know) "What is the craziest thing you've ever done?" and finally "Have you ever viewed pornography?"  I'll let you try and figure out the questions to those answers on your own.  Saturday we hiked for three effing hours and then that night we talked about a lot of issues including abortion...and I got to read the "ghost story with a hidden agenda" that I think the boy wrote...and it was deck and hilarious as ef.  Then they all started telling ghost stories and that actually was really creepy.  Had our toothbrush thing and went to bed, got up this morning and left.  I got to be good friends with Kyle and Hudgens and Tyler this weekend.  I was already good friends with Kelli and Sarah.  I wish that a certain other person would have gone :P oh well.    I hate sleeping when I go camping though.  It is the most miserable experience ever.  I am cold but sweaty, my back hurts, my hair gets plastered to my face and I just feel incredibly horrible when I wake up.    I studied some today.  And then I saw the boy...and the infatuation has gotten worse.  He looks so sexy in glasses, he should wear them like every day.  Mmm...he is so awesome.  Ok, gonna stope talking about him now.

      So I am so tired it's not even funny.  There is so much to do, and so little time.  I still have four chapters to read for the bio test and its a crapload of information.  And the camping trip is from Friday to Sunday...mm stress.  Heh.    Today was good.  I had classes in the morning and then after chem recitation, I went and ate lunch with the boy, and we had a really good conversation.  We've gotten past the trivial flirting conversations and today had one about our life aspirations and our friends from home and our beliefs about certain things and such.  It was really awesome.  He wants to be a doctor and establish a Rock n Roll laundromat because "What do people want to do while they're waiting for their laundry?  Rock out!"  and it would include live bands and a dance floor and coffee ("And not the weak yuppie starbucks coffee...but some good stuff") and chairs for lounging...and I think he said something about putting a place to watch good indie films, but I don't remember.  He talked about how he got into good music and his anti-racist views and such...he is a part of Anti Racist Action (I think it's called) and it sounded like some pretty hardcore stuff.  And he talked about how his older brother is his archnemesis and a lot of stuff.  I talked to him about how I don't really know what I want to do but I know I love to write.  And he said that I love music so I could help him out with his laundromat.  And I got to tell him about my divine albinism theory.  Haha.  He liked that one.  And then around 6:00 I went with him to this World Religion Conference that they had in the lyceum and it was interesting at some points, and boring and repetitive at others.  It was really cool hanging out with him.  Also, Mallory came by today and talked to me about the article that I wrote for her yesterday and she said it was stylistically perfect and said she was going to give me the paper next year basically.  It really meant a lot to me because she was like, "You really have an eye for journalism.  Have you ever considered it?" and I was like, "Well, I was going to write for the newspaper had I stayed at high school." and she was like, "No, I mean as a career.  I think you could make it."  So that definitely made my day.    We had a Dessert and Discourse on whether or not God exists tonight and that was mildly entertaining.  I wish we could have just been let loose, but we had to go down and examine arguments and such.  I'm done.  He invited me to go study chem with him and I want to go, so maybe I will.  Lisa

      Ok, so, I went on a comtemplative walk last night, thinking mainly about two different things.  1) This whole thing with the boy...and trying to decide whether or not I understand why he likes me, or how long it will last before he realizes that I am not as cool as he thinks...and yes, I know ppl are all like, "But you are cool" but I just don't really see it, I guess...at least not cool in the way that guys like me...I dunno.  I mean, I love this whole calling me everyday and asking me to go eat with him and smiling all the time in our conversations and just being...cool...but then the cynical side of me is just wondering how long it will take for it to end.  I hope not any time soon.  And 2) The whole religion thing.  With Jennifer.  She feels so betrayed now.  I wonder how many people would feel betrayed if I told them what I believe now.  A few of my close friends still don't know exactly what's been going on, and I think it is just because I didn't want to upset everyone, I didn't want to cause people to be "disappointed" in me which is the word everyone would use, I am sure.  I didn't want to cause any controversy or problems with friendships, so I just kept quiet about it for the most part, except to the friends that I knew wouldn't care one way or the other.  When I got up here, it was like I got to start out new, so no one had any expectations for me, so I just told people straight up exactly what I believe.  Which definitely isn't what it used to be.  I think I pretty much consider myself agnostic, if anything.  I am very open-minded about everything, and I don't really believe in the bible anymore.  I guess that is pretty much it.  I told Jennifer that, in so many words, and she got really upset, and feels extremely betrayed and brokenhearted and sad and confused and disappointed...I guess I just don't see why it is such a big deal.  It isn't like our friendship was based on religion.  She said it was like if she had come out and said she was gay...but honestly, I wouldn't really care if she did that.  Cuz I dunno...she is a really good friend though, so I hope we can get through whatever it is we're going through.  So, anyway.  This is the thing.  I'm tired of dancing around the subject.  There are only a couple of people that read this that will find this surprising or shocking, but there it is.  Now, everyone get out your disappointment in the next few days so the next time I come in town, we can hang out and be good again.  Lisa

      Weekend was so deck.  Friday night- Bouncing Souls, Hot Water Music, Longshot, and some other band...Bouncing Sould were frelling awesome.  I lost my shoe, and found it at the end of the show...had to mosh with one shoe to the souls.  They did a cover of Hey Ya.  It was so awesome.  Great show, great night.    Saturday- Went out to eat with Abby and Fifer and my mom for my bday.  Was very fun.  I think we scared my mom.   Abby: What would you not do for $10,000 but would for $one million? Mom: Go out to eat with yall again Tee hee...I guess we were being really...deck.  And when I say deck I mean hyper and loud and funny.  Haha.  Then we picked up Jenn and went to Red Blood Club, one of the deckest places in Dallas...really nice set up...saw Stories of London and then Letter 12 and then Fourth Score and then Clover St.  Letter 12 was amazing...Their music is what emotion would sound like, were it audible.  Stories of London was good too.  The lead singer was juicy.  I got a shirt.  Fourth Score didn't have any chemistry, and Clover St. had a bad night or something.  They did not seem like they wanted to be there, and that just ruined the whole show.  Oh well :P I still love them.  Had a birthday bash (with my mom, Abby, and Jenn) at like 1:00 when we got back.  I got this book about how to think like Albert Einstein and it is sooo a book about anarchy in disguise...it's all, "Break the rules, or fail."  Tis great.  Abby and Fifer got me a lot of really awesome things.  Including fortune cookies that I did not suspect of being tampered with but that have fortunes like "You are uber deck." "You will get laid tonight." or my personal favorite, "Do drugs and have anonymous sex."  I laughed so hard when I opened my first one to read "Wetting the bed does not make you a loser."  Silly Abby...  Sunday- Woke up, picked up Fifer ("FOB IS COMING!!!"), went to mall, bought some shoes and earrings, went back to Fifer's house for a CD Burning Extravanganza...ate with her and her parents...had a blast...went back to TAMS....played soccer game...won...  Today- Ate lunch with boy again...:P Tee hee.  He is funny.  And then our wing and Elizabeth's wing played mud soccer...that was super ultra fun...and then the boy called me around 8:00 and asked me to go eat with him...so I did. :) and he is so cool.  I think I like him more every time I hang out with him.  Tee hee.  Can't wait for the camping trip this weekend...Woo!!!!!!!!  Lisssssssssaaaaaaaaaaa PS-Yay for squirrels.  Queers are cool.  Boys are deck (unless they are fin.)

      So today was pretty cool.  I uh...basically went to class, hung out with Betsy, hung out with Kenny (don't feel like detailing this one heh, as I just did in Fifer's email...ask me about it later) and that was all good and fun.  Music is deck.    I got this thing in my box and it was called, "Three in Thirty" (referring to the policy of having to get three quiet hour docs in thirty days to get any points): The TAMS Underground Revolution Issue 1.  Some underground extremely opinionated newspaper type thing that Mallory Chesser started up and on the back it said, "Lisa, join the revolution.  Scoop is poop." (Scoop is the name of the official TAMS newspaper).  I thought it was really cool.  The articles said things that we could never write in the real newspaper, and they only give it to cool, underground people.  There were what I would consider editorials on a lot of different things, including politics and such.  Some were downright hilarious.  Anyway, Terra said that the reason I was invited to write for it is because Mallory had read my stuff in Scoop and thought it was the only good writing.  I felt honored because Mallory is the TAMS kid that writes for NT Daily.  Anyway.  That was pretty cool.  So is the boy though.  Hehe.  Hanging out with him was really really fun today.

      I was busy once again today.  But it was cool.  First off, I tried the whole dying black streaks in my hair last night.  It looks horrible.  So I spent ten dollars this morning on some new red dye to try and cover up some of the black but it hardly worked so that was a waste of my money.  I think I am gonna wait til this weekend until I have Jenn's help and then kill my hair some more and get rid of this hideous color.  The red was so cool though.  I will have to try and get the same color again.  Hmm...ANYway.  I think maybe I should do that Friday.  Or Saturday.  Haha.  Whenever I get my cartilage pierced.  I had classes and then BUGS, which was so effing boring because they wanted to talk to us about the science projects our mentees are doing but it just turned into an hour and a half long discussion about what was wrong with the BUGS program.  God I wanted to fall asleep.  It was soooooooooo boring.  So I doodled.  Hehe.  I felt like a giddy school girl as I doodled his name and decorated it with stars and hearts.  Heh.  And then I wrote out a list of all the deck shows coming our way soon.  I went to a Habitat meeting and then went back to my room.  Anddd there was a message on our board that said for me to call the boy.  But unfortunately it was time to go to chem lab, so I went.  Mmmm...fortunately, he was there outside his classroom (cuz he has it at the same time as me, just different room) and so we got to talk.  And...*sigh* talking to him just makes me smile.  I forget what we talked about now.  Just insignificant things, but it was great.  He had just called earlier for our chem assignment, so I got to call him back later and give it to him.  Hehe that was fun too.    So then I had like ten million meetings to go to and such, including art club.  I get to find a musical for us to go to.  Then I played a two setter with Myra for wing olympics and won 6-2 6-1 (holla holla).  Umm that is pretty much my day.  Crazy, huh?  So yeah.  This infatuation thing is tough on my studying.  I can't seem to really concentrate on things like bio or chem when I could be thinking of other certain things.  He really does make me smile.  Whenever I talk to him...or even think about him, actually.  God, I sound like a dumb girl.  Maybe I am a dumb girl.  Oh well.  Either way....I'ma gonna go now.  And do my homework that I have neglected.  Lisa

      Me: "So are you guys going to eat now?" Him: "He (referring to Ryan) is.  I just got done eating."   Me: (disappointed) Oh. Him: "So, you must think I'm an ass now." Me: "Huh?" Him: "Cause of the dance and stuff." Me: "No.  Not at all."  (smiling ear to ear and blushing) Him: "That's good.  Cause I was thinking that we should hang out, watch a movie sometime...cause you're really cool." Me: (eeking out the only word in my vocabulary at the moment and smiling even more and blushing even more) "Awesome." Him: "Yeah, it'd be awesome."  Then, he had to leave, and I went with Sarah and Ryan to eat lunch and all is well with the world.  And I am in yet another state of euphoria now.  Am pretty convinced that I am not dreaming.  I listened to all of my songs that are happy and pop punky and stuff.  Everything I listen to that Fifer considers crap in other words :) because that music does have a place and time, tee hee.  Tee hee hee.  I can't stop smiling, guys.  This is pretty damn awesome.  Deck.  And awesome.  And then deck some more.  This is so exciting.  Lisa

      Me: "I'm piercing my cartilage this weekend." Rebecca: "Your ear?" Me: "No, my spine."  Today was fun.  Last night I went to Kelli's for dinner with Hudgens, Naomi, Kelli, Vanessa, Sweeni, Chintan, and this other girl.  Then we watched this movie, Party Monster, that had Seth Green and Macauly Culkin as bisexual "Club Kids" from New York city.  Um...was interesting.  Great fun was had at Kelli's house though.  Today just consisted of sleeping, and eating, and shopping (I bought some hair dye...should be interesting...i want red with black streaks).  Then we played our soccer game and that was fun and then I played a bit in the basketball game and sucked it up.  But anyway.  Still riding the high.  I like the high.  That in no way means that I like  being  high.  I wouldn't really know.  Hah.  Anyway.  Bye now.  Lisa

      I now know how Cloud felt when he said, "If this is all a dream, don't wake me up."  If last night was a dream, I am so glad that no one woke me up.  Things like this never happen to me.  I am having trouble believing that it actually did.  So...amazing.  So I guess I should start from the beginning...  Yesterday was perhaps one of the best days of the year.  After the chem test, we came back here and I was getting really pissed at Naomi and Rebecca and them because they pretty much flat out told me that they did not want to hang out with me.  So Sarah and I were just randomly walking around to different rooms, talking.  Anyway, so we were sitting in my room, and Naomi came in and was like, "Hey!  A concert is about to start at Bruce!  Let's go!" and so I got my jacket and we left and then when we were about to walk down the stairs Naomi was all like, "Hey, who is in there?" and pointed to the TV room.  So I turned around and...  "Happy Birthday Lisa!!" with this huge cardboard sign with everyone's signature on it.  There were so many people there, like almost all of my friends here.  Laura, Kelli, Vanessa, Rebecca, Megan, Hanna, Terra, Tyler, Aaron, Hudgens, Jonathan, Osato, Kyle, Naomi, and Lisa and Gilda and soo many more.  It was everyone that I love to death up here, minues a few that couldn't make it.  They had ditched me all day today so that they could decorate and make me two cakes and stuff.  It was so awesome.  I can't express how happy it made me inside.  Everyone had pitched in to get a really really nice hair straightner that takes about 5 minutes to straighten all my hair.  It is so awesome.  And Laura got me "Nothing Feels Good:  Punk rock, teenagers, and emo." ("It reminded me of you!") and a $10 gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.  Kelli made me a mix CD of some really awesome stuff and some candy.  And everyone wrote me a little note on the big sign.  The party itself lasted about an hour and we all just sat and talked...it was so deck.    I started to get ready for the v day dinner after that because I had to be there by 5:30 to help set up.  So I put on my waitressing outfit (some really deck pinstriped pants and a white shirt) and straightened my hair and got all my stuff together and helped Rebecca get ready and then we went to Clark, cause that is where it was.  I helped blow up balloons and stuff.  Anyway.  Around 6:30, I was helping Naomi straighten her hair and I looked over and the boy was there, apparently dressed to be a waiter.  He he.  So I walked up to him and I was like, "Hey, you're waitressing tonight too?"  and he was like, "Yes, I'm wait ress ing."  and I was like, "Ohhh.  Yeah.  Heh.  I meant waitering.  I don't think you are a girl or anything." and he was all, "Thanks."  Aw man, I felt kinda stupid, but its all good :).  We had a little training session and I stole him some chocolate from the tables ("That was smooth.") and talked to him a bit more.  Hmm...from 7 to 8 we were all waiter/ress ing and we had a couple of small conversations and Rebecca told him something about me running into walls, and it was funny.  And I got to tell him about my birthday being the previous day and he told me happy belated birthday and it was just cool.  Soooooooooo.  Moving on.  I wish I could fast forward this but I can't because I just  can't.  I ended up changing and eating with Naomi and Rebecca and Zahir and Kevin and Megan and Terra and Hanna.  That was ok.  And then after some pictures with Osato and Naomi and Rebecca and Vanessa, the dance part of the evening started.  Hmmm.  Hmm.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm.  How should I begin.  I was sitting on the side, one of the few people.  And so was he, a little bit in front of me, right.  So, out of nowhere, he pulls his chair back and sits next to me and is all, "I'm gonna sit by you." and I was like, "That's cool."  and wow he started analyzing everyone on the dance floor and making fun of them.  Talked about middle and upper class suburban white kids listening to rap and how no one had any real rhythm and he would just be like, "Now, observe closely." and go into another analysis of people and he was so hilarious.  All I could do was laugh.  And then he asked me if I knew how to swing dance, and I said sort of and so he was like, "Ok, whenever a song comes on that we can swing dance to, you owe me a dance." and I said ok (of course).  Soo...a couple of songs later, a song came on, and he grabbed my hand and pulled me out onto the dance floor.  It was crazy and so fun.  We were twirling and swingin and wow it was great.  And then he danced with Naomi to the next song, and the song after that was another rap song, so I was sitting in the chair again and he came up to me and was just like, "So, you're just gonna sit on the sidelines?" and I was like, "I seriously can't dance to rap."  and he was like, "Neither can I!" so he pulled me out there again and danced with me some more...but ok, it wasn't like rap dancing like you are thinking.  He just mimicked other people by doing things that they were doing in really hilarious ways.  He said he was just trying to be a big jackass.  It was funny.  He reminded me of on Clueless whenever Josh is dancing and he is absolutely horrible at it, but he has fun anyway.  And the boy seriously did not care what he looked like, he was just having fun.  It was so...awesome.  One of the next songs was a slow dance, and so he overdramatically offered his hand and I took it and we started dancing, and then he was like, "Hey!  It just started snowing!"  and so we ran outside and he ran out onto the grass and started trying to catch the snowflakes with his tongue...:) and then he was all, "Come out here!"  and I had to jump this rail and so I was like, "I have a dress on!" and he was just like, "No one's looking!" so I jumped the rail out onto the grass, and he was like, "So let's dance." and so there we were, outside, on the grass, under the falling snow, dancing to Monica (Brandy?)'s Angel of Mine.  This is quite possibly a moment I will remember for the rest of my life.  We looked up at the flakes falling across the light and he was just like, "It's pretty awesome, isn't it?" and I agreed...It was cold outside, but I don't think I felt a bit of it.  At one point in the evening, another swing song came on, and I was trying to teach him the only move I know (the one that I practiced with Amy a lot) and I was just like, "Ok, all I know is the guy part, sooo you be the girl, and I'll be the guy." and he just laughed and said ok, so I taught him how to do it, and it is the one where you dip the person at the end, right?  So anyway, we tried to learn it the correct way with him doing the guy part, and one time we got all the way through it and I leaned back to dip...and fell to the ground.  lol.  He was laughing and apologizing and he helped me up, and I was just like, "I think that's the part where you catch me."  The night went on, and we danced a lot more, and then I danced with Osato some and the boy danced with a girl named Angela and I danced a lot with Naomi and Rebecca and Vanessa and Brian and Sal and such, but just like group dancing, it was really fun.  At one point, we all got to do a line dance, and that was pretty fun.  And I learned a lot of different dances to rap songs (I can see why people like to dance to those now.)  I started dancing with the boy some more towards the end, and he took me up onto the part of Clark that is kinda elevated from the ground, and we danced up there by ourselves and then were joined by Naomi and Vanessa.  There were balloons up there and him and I had a sort of fight and we threw balloons at each other and just...had fun.  One of the last songs we danced to was a slow song, and I just loved dancing with him...it was just...it felt amazing I guess...I can't explain why...  I had to leave kind of early because I had to help set up for the StuCo movie night, but the dance was so fun.  He is such an amazing person.  He is so spontaneous, and free, and he just doesn't care what people think of him.  He does what he wants to.  It's pretty awesome.  :) :).  I have been to a few dances here now and last night was the first time I actually danced.  He got me to break out of this shell of mine where I am very self conscious when it comes to dancing.  He made it so fun, and he didn't care that I sucked.  And then the snow... that was just amazing to me.  I came back here, and talked to a lot of people, including Ryan and Sarah, who went together tonight, and who, I think, are hooking up.  A lot of people told me they loved my article in The Scoop about Dessert and Discourse, so I was happy about that. The movie night started at 1 and I was sitting with the other Lisa, but I couldn't stay awake, so I just went back to my room and fell asleep.  Asleep, thinking about things, being completely happy.  I woke up this morning with a blanket of white snow on the ground, and the flakes falling in sheets on the ground.  Me and Rebecca got dressed and went outside to play with the other TAMS kids in the snow that was like 4 or 5 inches deep.  We took an hour to make a ten foot tall snow man that was effing huge and then this asshole came and pummeled into it and I cussed him out, and then we played soccer in the snow, and then ate...and now I'm here.  Things have been so eerily good lately, I wonder if this all really is a dream.  Nothing like this ever happens to me.  I don't know what to think, and right now I am just feeding off my emotions.  I don't feel like going into overanalyzing logical mode right now.  Right now I'm just feeling this euphoria, feeling this high, and I hope I don't come down for a long time.  Something tells me that the high is always followed by the low, but right now, that isn't a reality for me.  Right now is reality.  Right now is forever.  Tell me I am not sleeping, punch me in the face or something.  Yesterday was Friday the 13th.  I have decided that this does not necessarily bring bad luck, but maybe just weird occurences.  Good weird occurences.  He listens to ska.  No one listens to ska anymore.  But he does.  Hmmm....whoa.  Happy V Day everybody.  Lisa

      Birthdays rock, man.  It all started around midnight last night (this morning) when Sarah and Christina and Katie all came into my room and were like, "Happy Birthday!" and Sarah gave me a card that was really awesome and I love her to death sometimes.  And they all gave me roses with little hershey kisses as the flower part.  That was cool.  And then I hung out with them til about 2 and they are all so fun.  We had a punk rock vs. rap conversation (me and Sarah representing the former, of course) and then I woke up this morning in a bad mood because I failed to wake up early and finish my cal hw :(.  But it was ok in the end.  After that I chilled in my room til self defense and then I went there and we practiced with fake testicles today.  And when I say fake testicles I mean two ping pong balls in a stocking.  LoL.  It was realllly funny.  Me and Naomi were partners and it was just like....awkward even though we are normally extremely comfortable with each other.  Haha.  Anyway.  Then I changed and walked outside and Sarah and Craig were walking towards me!!  I was like, "Heyyyyy!" and then we had a tearful reunion with hugs and laughter and all.  Without the tears.  ANd she gave me my bday present (a hug) and my v day present (it was awesome) and then we all went to the Olive Garden and ate and had a blast.  Craig is so funny and Sarah is so awesome and we were listening to the awesome CD I burnt Sarah a long time ago and it was just....deck, man, it was deck.  On their way out, Sarah dropped me and Vanessa off at the mall and we shopped for a couple of hours and I got a pair of shoes for the dance tomorrow, two pairs of jeans, and some panty hose.  I know I splurged, but hey, it was my BIRTHDAY!!!!!  and then we had difficulty getting back because the UNT buses werent running anymore so we had to use the city buses and that took a while and there was this old lady prostitute on one of the buses.  Creepy.    And then we went to Bruce to eat and met up with Naomi and Rebecca and then the boy walked in and so Naomi asked him to come sit with us and he had his cd player with him and I asked to see what was in it and it was Less Than Jake.  Cool, cool, eh?  I am interested to see what else he listens to.  I would bet that it is some awesome stuff.  And then we had an interesting convo about the fake testicle usage in our self defense class and everyone was laughing a lot.  Twas great.  We left and then hung out in my room for a while and then went to Dessert and Discourse, the one about love.  It was really interesting, but I had to leave early because we had an indoor game at 10:00 and I scored a goal!!!  And the game was really fun.  And now I am back here, and I am about to have to start studying for bio.  So many people wished me a happy birthday today.  I love my friends.  They are all so awesome.  When I begin to lose faith in the human race, I just remind myself of all of them, and it is good!  Also, Kelli and Vanessa are going to go to the Bouncing Souls concert with us, and they are both very hardcore people, so it will be fun fun fun.  Wooooooooo.  My dad is coming up on Saturday to eat dinner with me for my birthday.  And tomorrow is the whole Valentine's Dinner/Dance and stuco movie night!  Today was effing awesome.  I love birthdays.  I can see rated R movies now!!!!  (Legally :) )  Lisa

      Damn these crushes of mine and damn biology.  I hate both with an equally fiery passion, and love only one with the same fiery passion.  If that makes any sense.  Which it probably doesn't.  Cause I'm dumb.  In fact, I am probably overreacting, but it's like, ok, now that I am not being a chickenshit, I am told that I was being overly outgoing, and that being myself made me look stupid.  But then I think that yes, sometimes I am quite possibly the stupidest person I know.  But I'm not...I just...seem that way...or get that way...especially when I am hyper or whatever.  So yeah.  I dunno.  Life is so effing confusing.  Pros?  Maybe now we will all eat after English every Monday and Wednesday.  Cons?  I can't tell if he was being really serious about what Sarah thought he said.  I guess I didn't include him and Ryan in the conversation enough, but it wasn't entirely my fault.  I was the only one who freaking tried.  And I guess I was acting a bit dumb, but that's me sometimes, you know?  I think that the people that know me best know that I am an interesting combination of being simultaneously the stupidest and smartest person they know.  And no, I am not saying that I am smart in any conceited sense of the word, since I did technically make a 58 on the bio test on Monday without the curve.  I mean, 3/4 of the class did fail, but I was 2 points below average.  Oh well.  With the curve and the extra credit essay I wrote, it ended up being a 74.  Translation:  I have to make an average of a 95 on the next three bio tests to keep my 4.0.  This is near impossible I do believe.  Oh, and as of today I am officially failing bio lab!  With a 55!!  Woooooooooooooo!  I am so freaking retarded sometimes.  I have an A in everything else so far.  It is just this damn biology.  I hate it, I have no interest in it, and it is all just the rote memorization of the most random things in the world.  Well, I didn't memorize random things but that was what our effing test was over, the random things.  Gah.  Things are just kinda pissing me off at the moment, but I am not in a pissed off mood.  It kinda scares me how I really am not all too concerned about my failing grade and my C.  I don't feel like studying at all.  You know, Einstein failed out of his classes because he only studied the things that really interested him, and he just didn't do the stuff that he didn't feel like.  I wish I could be like him.  Of course, Einstein didn't go to TAMS, and he didn't have to go back to somewhere like Summit if he did fail out.  Urg.  I need a 4.0 for scholarships, but at the same time, there is no way in hell I am becoming one of those people who does nothing but study, which I think is what I will have to do to get an A in bio now.  Hmm.  Quite the conundrum.  Anyway, I don't think there is much of anything else I can complain about.  I have been so crazily busy the past couple of days.  Last night I was auctioned off and I went for $9 which was good considering the average was about $11.  Sal started the bidding, and then Brian bidded on me second, and then Osato finished it off with a whopping $9.  I kept glancing at certain places in the room that certain person(s) were at but to no avail.  Ohhh well!  I totally talked to him today and I was being my normal crushy flirty transparent self, the same kind of self I was whenever I would go into the journalism room last year to get assignments.  Heh.  I crack myself up.  He helped our English prof remember the name of this one indie film today, and he said a few, and I realized how incredibly awesome his taste in the arts has got to be.  He said something about pop culture at one point, and it was kinda cynical sounding.  And then he compared a part of The Invisible Man to socialism, and it was great.  He is rocking awesome.    But I hate having a crush.  It sucks much.  Much indeed, yes.  Jenn came today and I only got to spend an hour with her, but it was mui cool, oui.  Tres tres excellente.  Woo woo.  Fifer, I gave her something to give to you, keep reminding her about it.  Lisa

      So today was the first time in my entire life that I sat down, took a test, and stood up knowing that I had completely failed it.  The bio test was effing insanely hard and everyone that I have spoken to thinks that they failed it or did horrible or something.  I wouldn't be surprised if I got lower than a 50.  I got my Cal Test grade back and yay I barely pulled an A.  Boy was late for English, would have gotten to be in a group with him if he had been on time.  Hung out with Vanessa and Kelli and Naomi and Sarah for a long time.  Was very fun.  Was gonna go play raquetball, but we ended up playing soccer.  Then I went to the Sailing Club meeting, and then I played Katie at tennis and had a very good set (won 6-4).  We are playing best 2 out of 3 and are continuing tomorrow.  After the date auction.  I am so nervous.  There is only one person I really want to bid on me, but he prolly won't.  Tee hee!!  This week is going to be crazy mad busy but also fun.....Oh and also today these squirrels tried to attack me and it was really scary.  Squirrels are evil.

      Date Auction Questionnaire  1) What would your Dream Date be like? 	Going to a show at some obscure indie/punk club sometime in November and then driving down to the harbour to eat Wendy’s food and discuss life, politics, love, and music while listening to Bright Eyes or Something Corporate and looking at the stars and feeling infinite.  2) What do you look for in a boyfriend? 	Topher Grace meets Justin Pierre meets Albert Einstein meets Tyler Durden meets Andrew McMahon meets Ewan McGregor meets Ricky Fitts meets Richard Rahl meets Will Ferrell meets Halston Beggs.  3) What would you do with $1 million dollars? 	Put myself through school, help out my parents, travel everywhere, buy lots of CDs, buy an ibook, and buy lots of really awesome sweaters and shoes and jeans and go to lots of shows.  And buy a car.  4) What is your favorite ice cream? 	Banana Crème Pie  5) What is the song that best represents your life? 	The Future Freaks Me Out by Motion City Soundtrack  6) Do you have any words that  you live your life by?  Or a quote that you like? 	It’s only after you’ve lost everything that you’re free to do anything.  Today I went to West Village with a bunch of people but it was just me and Naomi that hung out together the whole time.  We went around to all the shops, it was pretty cool but soooo expensive.  When I get rich, I want to buy some things at Paul Frank because they have random stuff and they were playing The Postal Service...Lucky Brand jeans are really expensive but they have a cute style so maybe there too.  The guy that was working there was so hipsterish, he had the big sunglasses and everything.  We ate at this place called Tom Tom Noodle House and it had such a cool atmosphere, and then we got ice cream at this place next to The Magnolia and they had Italian homemade ice cream.  It...was....soo...exquistite.  And they played Italian opera the whole time and it was so cool.  The icecream was so good, I just cannot even convey the tastiness.    I haven't read 53 or 54 yet.  No sleeping for me tonight!  Lisa

      I love my  urlLink name  .  Me and Rebecca were in IHOP like an hour ago and we were playing the game where we look around the room and draw inferences about people and I saw this group of guys in the corner and was looking for something when I noticed something blue on their hands...  And then I started thinking and I was like, "See those guys over there in the corner?  They just got back from Dallas.  They saw the Senses Fail, Moneen, The Beatiful Mistake show at the Door for $10."  I can't believe I missed that show.  But, alas, I wanted to make an A on the bio test and if I had taken a travel weekend no way would I have studied.  I was in the library for five hours today and I still have 2 chapters left.

      Today was great fun.  After classes, I went with Rebecca back to Granbury because she had a foot doctor appointment and she came out of the room and was like yelling, "It's just some dried up blood!  She took off my nail and scraped away the blood so it should be ok soon!" and then the three elderly ladies were like...right.... I got to see Granbury....I see why she wanted to go to TAMS now.  Her family was so normally weird.  Like, they were what you would think of as a wholesome, normal family but they are all so weird and it is weird that their family is normal in a weird way.  Like...when I was watching Everybody Loves Raymond...which is a funny show...I would be laughing; Rebecca's siblings would be making comments like, "He is so selfish."  or "How horrible!" and I was just like...wow.  Her little brother was so cute I just wanted to hug him and take him home to live with me.  Her sister was pretty cool too.  Anyway, after a while we went to the Parks Mall so she could buy her Valentine's dress and I had to buy an outfit so I can waitress for half of the dinner...just black pants and a white button up shirt.  It is so effing hard to find shirts that fit me...I just wish I could be a C...or maybe even a B...*sigh* so she found a dress and I found my white shirt and black pants and we went by my house to get my Valentine's dress that I bought a while ago and my mom bought me a shirt in Austin that is really...interesting.  :P.  I had something I wanted to give to Fifer but it was Rebecca's mom driving us around and she needed to get back so there was no time. :(.  We got back here around 10:30 and I gave Naomi her bday present (cuz I gave her an IOU on her actual bday) and then we went and hung out with Kevin (Naomi's guy) and his two friends that were up here.  Man, they were so hardcore.  They were twins and one had died his hair black and the other a blondish color and they were so punk...and hilarious...and fun....WoW.  I mean, they reminded me of the guy forms of Abby and Jennifer, in that they were insane.  I think that being in a group with the twin guys and the former two would be...just amazing.  So we went and got icecream with them.  The guy was all yelling out the window like, "What the eff (yes, he said eff...censoring himself for Kevin maybe) are you doing??" (talking to another car) and Kevin was like, "Uhh...Ryan (holy mother of Jesus would the irony please stop...was this a popular name in the mid 80s or WHAT?), this is a one way street....." lmao...so he was like ohhh and turned around and we went back to here and then hung out in Vanessa's room trying on dresses and talking...twas great.  Good day.  But now I have to spend my entire weekend studying bio.  Bleh.  Down with school.  Lisa

      Ok...my college searching skills have led me to my 6 Top Choices as of right now (subject to change, of course.)  1) Boston University (well, you knew this one was coming) 2) Columbia 3) Amherst College (very selective MA school...a good distance from Boston though) 4) University of Rochester (upstate New York...get this: Students there get to use Napster for free as a result of an agreement between the university and the music companies  and  tomorrow Mitch Hedburg is going to be performing there and all undergraduate students get in for free...how deck is that?) 5) George Washington University (my least likely out of the 6 colleges, but still would be very cool to go to) 6) Harvard (well, I have to have one big name college...)  Yes, yes, there it is...my backup school?  I am thinking Florida Tech.  Not because I want to go there but because it is a pretty good school and Betsy said I could get nearly a full ride.  I guess I should apply to UT in case all other options fail or if nothing else is financially possible, but Rebecca keeps telling me that my National Meritness (that I will probably, but not for sure, get) will get me lots of money.  I sure hope so.  Also, I was looking at a list of Boston venues and shows today and have decided that it is a happening music place.  Apparently, the Dropkick Murphys hail from Boston.  And...  2/07/04 Motion City Soundtrack/MxPx/Sugarcult/Simple Plan (Avalon)  2/29/04 Fall Out Boy/Matchbook Romance/Dynamite Boy (The Axis)  Neither of the tours will be coming to Dallas...or Texas at all, for that matter.  Ha.  I changed up the order of the bands as listed also, putting the bands I would be most excited about seeing first.  Speaking of Matchbook Romance, I burned them from Steve, and they are absolutely amazing.  Dynamite Boy is another one I got from him and they are awesome as well.  Hmm...I wish I could go see them all play with FOB.  That would be deck as ef.  The deckest of all deck.  And to see it in Boston...well...it'd be amazing.  They play all up and down the east coast, like most bands, which is one of the reasons I think it will be really cool living up there.  The music scene.  *Sigh* well.  I think that is all.  Oh yeah, I think I muffed up my Cal test today.  Oh well.  -Lisa  "I mean, roses only last like a couple weeks, and that's if you leave them in water, and they really only exist to be pretty. So that's like saying, "My love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance". But a potato! Potatoes last for fucking ever, man. In fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow shit even if you just leave them in the sack, that part alone is rockin' awesome and makes it a good symbol. But there's more! There are so many ways to enjoy a potato! You can even make a battery with it! That's like saying "I have many ways in which I show my love for you". Potatoes may be ugly, but they're still awesome. It's like saying "It doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you" "  -Stephanie Hsu's profy

      Today I was crazily busy...  It all started at 8:00 with Bio and I was five friggin minutes late and the tams police want to make some kind of point about being tardy to class and so they counted me absent so I have to report it and get five points.  Oh well.  I guess this is why this is purgatory and not real college.  Then I had gov't and then Cal and then Chem and then I had an hour until English, which I spent reading my assignment for English, and then I had English, and then I ate lunch (the first time eating all day), and then I had to study for Bio Lab, and then I had Bio Lab for two hours, and I made a 75 on our first quiz.  yay!  And then I ate again and thennnnn I went to the Scoop meeting and then I went to write my article because it was due tonight at 11 and I went to the GA at some point cuz I needed a break and someone to quote.  I found Hudgens, Katie, and Tyler.  They all gave very good quotes.  The GA was funny cuz Steve and this other girl had to spin around on these baseball bats and then had to put on makeup and Steve had the lipstick all over his face.  Quite hilarious.  He still has my CDs.  Am in CD withdrawal...  ::Look of insanity passes over face::  Anyway.  Then I finished writing my article at like 11:20 and then I had to finally start studying for my Cal test tomorrow and I did that for about 2 hours and now I think I am ready but I dunno.  Thank God he split it into a two day test.  Bio lab is officially my least favorite class.  Grr.  I hate it and our TA is annoying....and tomorrow is Thursday which equals happy day because all I have to do is Cal, Self Defense, and a nonmandatory chem recitation.  Wooooo.  I have such an interesting life don't I?  And no, you shouldn't answer that question truthfully.  Lisa

      Highlights of Day: In gov't, our prof totally drew parallels between the Seattle WTO riots and the Boston Tea Party.  I almost died laughing on the inside from the irony.  Me and Fifer are hardcore.  Even if we are living on two separate coasts one day, the spirit will be the same.  People are really stupid though.  I was one of the few that said it was alright to break laws as a form of protest and lots of people said that it was wrong to ever break laws to protest something unjust and our prof was just like, "So you are all saying that it was wrong for the Civil Rights movement to take place?"  I think people realized their error in thinking after that.  I even went as far to say that breaking windows (or throwing tea bags off the side of a boat) was ok in certain situations, but I also think that first people should try everything in their power to peacefully protest whatever it is they are protesting...but ANYway.    After English I sat with the boy and his friend.  It took a lot of guts.  I was at the Salad Bar and was thinking to myself, well, this is it.  Adhere to the pact or remain afraid your entire life?    So I was just like, "Can I sit here?" and he was all, "Of course....not." but he was kidding, and I sat, and at first it was one of those awkward silences where no one really had anything to say, but we got to talking about stuff, and I dunno...he has some interesting points, and he is a cool person, but I haven't decided yet whether or not he is Lisa-liking material.  I went and put my tray up and came back and heard the last part of something he was saying to Ryan (his friend....and no, I am not going to say what I am thinking) and it was something like..."...move to Boston!"  Now, earlier, in English, we did the game thing where everyone says their name and what they want to do when they grow up and not everyone says a job or whatever so Laura was like I wanna be tall and I was like, "I'm Lisa and I....want to move to Boston."  Now, granted, it isn't the most interesting thing I could have said, but I honestly didn't want to go through the long list of careers I am considering and that is really the only thing for sure I really know I want to do.  Everyone had to go around and say everyone before them so everyone had to say it and anyways, back to what I was saying...when I walked up behind him, he was obviously quoting me or something...it could have been making fun of me, although I doubt it, and it was probably just him saying something humorous about what I said...I dunno but I was just like, "What did you say?" not really mad or threatening but kind of firm I guess in that you could tell I wasn't just going to sit back and pretend I didn't hear anything and so Ryan was like, "Er...nothing, Boston is a cool city." and since I didn't want to press it any further I agreed and proceeded to talk about how the east coast is the coolest place in America even though I have not been farther than Arkansas and the boy said he hadn't either but I am pretty sure he also said something about preferring the west coast.  Hmm...And then I said I would see them later.  Wow.  Rest of my day was spent hanging out with people and going to seminar and selling yearbooks and Steve gave me his music collection of 83 CDs although I have to say, even though mine is smaller by about 10 CDs mine definitely wins in the quality of music department.  He has really cool music and then Blink and Sum and Green Day, which aren't all bad...but, he also had a copy of Lavigne...now, he said he realized his mistake after getting it but then...why leave it with the rest of your CDs??  Well, anyway, I have got to go work out now.  Ciao amigos.  Lisa

      Nights with Fifer and Abby are always most interesting.  Hot sauce and bottles and starbucks and figurative bleeding and effing prohibition and stuff...and wow, if anyone ever heard what we talk about after midnight I do believe we'd be committed...or something.  And apparently I need a crash course in Pop Culture ASAP...too bad that is not a course UNT offers...at least I don't think it is.  Hmm...  Um.  I think that is all.  Oh yeah we saw Win a Date with Tad Hamilton and it was really funny cuz every time I said Aww they would start laughing at me but I thought it was really sad cuz the one guy was really adorable and shy.  He was just a character mind you but he was a hardcore character and it was a cheesy of-no-real-importance chick flick but it was better than some of the romantic comedies that I have seen of late (coughalongcamepollycough) and it had a Piggly Wiggly in it.  How can you resist the Piggly Wiggly?  Plus the dude from that seventies show that I don't remember the name of...the one that is adorable.  ANYway.  It was reallly funny when I played DDR beforehand cuz this girl wanted to play with me under the impression I think that I had some semblance of skill and so I made a complete ass out of myself, but it was fun.  And me and Abby played this horse game and it was effing hilarious because you just had to basically like hump the horse to go faster and I totally beat Abby even tho she is an equestrian or whatnot and we were really loud the whole time.  Fifer said she could hear us from across by the DDR machine.  Tee hee.  When we left we tried to do doughnuts in the parking lot but I remembered how my mom said not to let anything else happen to her car so I did like one and didn't want to see how fast I could go without flipping the car over or something, but it was ok, because Abby was distracted by  the empty beer bottle and then we went to Taco Bell and she wanted me to go backwards through the drivethru so she could get her hotsauce but she ended up walking up to the window.  And then we drove by the Starbucks and she threw the empty bottle at the parking lot, because when it came time to throw bricks through that starbucks window you left me all alone....all alone...  Figurative bleeding is so emo.  And so is John Kerry.  And apparently Lisa is NOT a person 2004.  Lisa

      You know, I have been thinking...well, mostly, I have been sleeping, but I had some dreams.  As much as I love everybody up here, I think that sometimes, I forget to remember the people I knew before I came up here.  It's easy to just get caught up in how busy you get, and how many interesting people you live with, and everything that goes on, but it is difficult to set apart time for your friends at home like you used to do.  And before you know it, you haven't talked to a majority of them in over a month, you have no idea what is going on in their lives, and they are a little upset with you for it.  I'm not saying that the person that sent me the email I received earlier this week from someone I never thought would try to hurt my feelings was justified in some of the things she said, but I am saying that maybe to some degree, I am guilty of neglecting people.  I guess I am also saying that when you cut yourself off from a certain belief or affiliation, sometimes you do it so drastically that you unwittingly cut yourself off from the friends and acquaintances you made because of that certain belief or affiliation.  And that is wrong to do.  I should really just start over from the beginning, go back to my roots, and remember why I love the people I used to be best friends with.  If not, then I'd be forgetting and throwing away my past, which isn't healthy, moral, or something that I want to do.  Because I do still want to be close to everybody.  I think that maybe I just don't know how.    I have some phone calls to make tomorrow.  Lisa

      I am right now listening to Fevers and Mirrors by Bright Eyes - one of the two albums today that I downloaded from this guy on itunes...It is a masterpiece....  This week has definitely started out better than the last.  Today after classes I went and got Sarah a birthday present and then me and her and Naomi and Rebecca and Vanessa and Kelli all went to a Greek restaurant to celebrate.  Tons o fun it was.  Then we had to hurry back for the HOPE officer elections, which were rigged as hell.  I suppose that I was under the impression that when you nominate someone for president, and someone seconds the nomination, and that certain person has the most community service hours out of anybody at TAMS, that person should be on the ballot for president.  But since the HOPE officers are the facists they are, she got put on the ballot as Communications Director or some shit like that.  double you tea eff mate.  Anyway.  Me and Laura worked on English, and I have screwed around for the past few hours.  I still have cal hw to do.  Blah.  So much work this week.    Lisa

      Prom was interesting.  Naomi and Rebecca did my hair really nifty-like.  It was all up in "pinwheels" and it had flowers in it and stuff...we (me, Naomi, Rebecca, Chris, Osato, and Mordechai) left around 6:30 but the place we were going to go eat at did not take reservations and so we had to wait an hour and 20 minutes to eat.  But it was ok because we all went to Addison Circle to take pictures.  We took like a million pictures or something crazy like that.    The place we ate was really deck.  The guy that cooked in front of us was all like, "This is Japanese kethchup...this is Japanses broccolli...this is Japanese cholesterol...oops, that was Japanese mistake."  He flipped over my rice bowl without any of the rice falling out and he made this huge flame come off of the top of the table.  Oh, anddddd I learned how to use chopsticks...kindof.  But I can definitely almost use them efficiently now.  I had a lot of fun there though.  It got really interesting after that, because Rebecca's car wouldn't start and it was only a couple of hours until prom ended.  So around 10:40 we decided to leave her car in Dallas and all squeeze into Mordechai's car, heh.  Mordechai drove like 90 to get there because Dallas is a good 40 minute drive from Denton and we got there at around 15 after...but we didn't get into prom until around 11:30, so we basically spent about $1 per minute we were there.  But it was cool.  I danced with Lisa and Laura and Aaron and Tyler to a couple of songs, and they are fun people they are.  I danced with Chris the second to last song and the last song was extremely ironic, in a very nostalgic sense of the word.    After taking more pictures, we left and had a good half hour to change and get ready for AfterProm, which was pretty awesome.  Four hours of free go karts, mini golf, arcade games, and our very own casino, with silent auctions that we used the gambling chips to bid on.  Oh, and there was free food, of course.  I spent the evening with a variety of people.  Kelli, Vanessa, Sarah, Sweeny...yeah.  Good times.  I didn't get to sleep until around 7:00 and I slept until 2:30.  I played a soccer game and a softball game and then me and Rebecca and Naomi and Sarah all ordered pizza.  yum.   I was supposed to do a lot of things today, but I didn't, as usual.  I really wish that I was interested in more of my classes.  More than just...one.  Or two, maybe.  I was thinking today about how close I am with a lot of the Junior class and how by the end of next year, if we are all even closer than we are right now, graduating is going to be so sad.  Anyway, Rebecca is brushing her teeth now, and I need to get off of her computer.  I have some phone calls to make tomorrow and some homework to do and...other stuff.  Lisa "Looking back on the memory of the dance we shared beneath the stars above." -last song at prom (Garth Brooks, The Dance)  Ironic, ne?

      Listening to:  Vapour Trail by Ride  I am feeling considerably better.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have been so upset in the first place.  Boys will be boys, unfortunate as that may seem sometimes.  Rebecca was talking to me earlier and said something to the effect of, "There are six billion people in the world.  You are supposed to marry one of them.  One out of six billion.  So what is the point of being upset over this one boy?"    This is, of course, assuming that I get married.  Human emotion amazes me sometimes.  Even within myself, I like to observe it, analyze it, know exactly what it is I am feeling and why I am feeling it.  I am not sure if this takes the point out of feeling, but I don't think it does.  I suppose I can't say that I am completely over this, but at least I am lying to myself already to convince myself that I am.  I had this conversation with Lisa over lunch about my turning away from religion and her turning towards it.  She is one of the only people I know that can talk to me about her Christian beliefs without seeming like she is trying to "witness" to me or impose her beliefs on me.  I really respect her a lot, and it is people like her that remind me that religion is not bad.  I am going now I think.  Lisa

      Well, it's later.  And I am writing more.  It's funny how when you think you have something figured out, you really don't.  And you find out things that people should have just told you from the beginning because now you feel incredibly dumb...and stuff.  Anyway.  I found it amusing how Schaake tried to embarrass me in front of the class today.  She's so dumb.  English was alright.  Lunch was cool.  I suppose.  Bio Lab...well, I'm glad he told me but then not.  You know?  So our prom group has changed a bit.  Now it's Hudgens, Mordechai, and Osato with me and Naomi and Rebecca.  It will be a very interesting night I am sure.  Ciao amigo/as  Lisa

      American History X is an amazing movie.  I mean, there are few movies that just leave me...in awe at the end.  Definitely goes in the top five.  Uh oh.  There are six movies in the top five now.  Maybe I will have to change it to a top six.  Anyways.  My new Against Me! CD is really good.  I was listening to it a lot today.  It's like...Reinventing Axl Rose is the big party and ...As the Eternal Cowboy is the hangover the next morning, when reality comes rushing back at you and it is definitely not too pleasant.  But it is really, really good.    I answered the phone today.  We're just friends, most def.  Is good though.  A friendship out of an I-can't-speak-to-you-in-a-coherent-manner crush (before I got to know him) is better than nothing by far.  Vanessa told her brother I thought he was hot and gave him my sn.  Weird times in McConnell Hall.  He wants to meet me now.  Heh.  Life is weird.   Lisa

      I love Austin and I love free shows and I love Andrew (and he loves me!).  And Justin.  And Jesse.  And all of MCS and Ludo and Against Me! and I love Ted Leo and those crazy pharmacists of his and I love The (International) Noise Conspiracy and I love Lucero and I love Melee and hell, I love Sparta and Don't Look Down too.  I love DV8 and Feable Weiner and Bowling For Soup (especially when intoxicated).  I love Ben and I love Willie and I love Abby and I love Fifer and I love music!!!  I am so full of love right now, and Fall Out Boy is for lovers.  So it is for me!!  SxSw rocked the casbah and then some.  I couldn't recap the past couple days if I wanted to.  So many quotable quotes and laughable jokes and laughable nonjokes and singable songs and moshable bands (although I did not even mosh).  You can read our  urlLink travel journal  here (coutesy of Fifer's xanga :p), because I don't feel like pasting the whole thing and stuff but it gives you a good idea of the crazy fun that was had.  But it has ended...and I am back here, at TAMS.  Did my calculus homework (joy) and learned about Naomi's mischievous break and went and ate Chinese with Rebecca and her.  That is about it.  Got to talk to Katie about our mutual love for Ed Norton, and she is going to watch American History X with me sometime soon and then we are going to rent the two of his movies that we haven't seen and watch them together.  Fun stuff, eh?    The next few weeks are going to just pale in comparison to Austin, guys.    Lisa

      If you're listening whoaaaaaaaaa  Just listening to a little Jimmy Eat World...good stuff, man.  So we are leaving in approximately 7 hours and I am not packed yet.  My clothes aren't even done drying.  But it's ok because I live life on the edge...woo.  So, what will these two days bring?  Life changing decisions?  48 hours of musical bliss?  Two days of unadulterated fun?  Nothing?  I know not, but I suppose I will find out soon enough.  I'm listening to a lot of poppy upbeat stuff right now to just keep reminding me of the fun-filled weekend I am going to have.  I am seriously full of excitement.  Maybe I shouldn't be building this up so much, I should expect it to suck so that it is that much better.  Ohhhh well.  Anticipation is 90% of the fun.  That's why people like foreplay so much I think.  Lmao...I'm such a nympho.  I went and bought junk food for the trip with Fifer a while ago.  She doesn't like those Danish butter cookies that you buy in the little can...psh, what a weirdo.  So, anyway, I don't know what to do with myself these next 7 hours...I guess just listen to more music, and pack my stuff maybe, and watch some late night TV...maybe I'll even get a couple of hours of sleep.  Cha.  Wow, it's been forever since I've listened to this song.  I guess I could keep typing and take you through my day which included helping Rebecca find a prom dress (which I was successful at) and then coming home to find that my brothers had locked me out and then having to get the neighborhood boys to climb onto my mom's balcony to let me in...but I don't want to borrreeeee you.  Oh, oh, this song is so old.  aAhahahahahahahahaa.   I'm not sick but I'm not well .....hah.  This weekend is gonna rock much.  See you all in three days!  Leesah PS- Since I will not be here Saturday, I would just like to say that Saturday is the 13-month anniversary of my blog.  I forgot to have a birthday celebration in February sooo 13-month anniversary it is.

      Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream used to be my favorite kind of ice cream but I think I have moved on to a new stage in my life.  My new favorite kind is officially Banana Pudding...or Banana Creme Pie (@ Beth Marie's).  I think maybe this marks the beginning of a new me.  The Modest Mouse show was...alright.  The first band was kinda...oh alright, they just sucked.  Hard.  LoL.  Or at least I thought so.  The second band was alright and Modest Mouse was good, but I just wasn't getting into it.  So we left.  After the second song.  :) But it was alright cuz we got home at like 11:40 anyway and Fifer's curfew was 12.  We have now been to all of the major underground scenes (I use the word "underground" lightly...very lightly)...emo, punk, indie...woo!  And they really are different.  For instance, the emo combover count was only at like 5 before the guy from Josh Hendrick's band sat by us.  He had like three combovers on one head so then the count went to 8.  Sooo this definitely was not an emo crowd.  But they were still mui amusing.  No moshpitting...no "Fuck Bush!" speeches...no talking to the crowd at all for that matter...I think I like the former two scenes better.  Anyway.  Went to 303 Mall today.  With Jenn.  Interesting.  It's funny how...you change...and then other people don't...or maybe they have...and it is just in an opposite direction of the way you changed...and I dunno.  Am contemplating.  Had sausage for dinner with sourkraut (sp?) and cheese bread and corn.  That was a pretty deck dinner.  Oh, and then I had some Banana Pudding ice cream.  Yumm...I think I had better go get me some more.  Less than 48 hours until I'll be in Austin!!  Lisa

      So I get more and more excited about Austin every day.  We're not leaving til 6:00 Friday morning, but that doesn't matter much I don't think.  Friday all day is the AMP showcase with MCS and so many other deck bands and then that night is the Rock Against Bush punk show which is gonna be sos sososososososos uber deck (NOFX, Alkaline Trio, Against Me!) and then Saturday all day is the Take Action Tour with three stages and a lot of bands...awesome ones at that...I just can't even think of them all right now...Ted Leo for one...  Oh...AND tomorrow night Abby won me and Fifer tickets to see Modest Mouse in Ft. Worth.  Fun stuff, eh?    Anyway so hanging out with my family is cool.  Last night I went and ate at Outback Steak House with Matt and Brian and my mom.  And they are so quirky.  I love my family.  Then me and Matt and Brian went to play tennis...well, I watched them suck it up anyway.  Today I was doing nothing when Fifer kidnapped me and we went and sold books to Half Price.  She got $25 and I only got $5 but it was ok.  With our newfound fortunes, we went to Collin Park Thrift and she got a couple of things, but I didn't.  Then we went to CD Warehouse and I got last year's Take Action Tour compilation for $4.  We listened to that on our way to TCC because I wanted to get information about summer classes, but they don't have any yet.  We parted ways a little bit after that and I've just been chilling with my family since then because Jason and Morgan just got in tonight.  It's been a while since my three brothers and I have all been together...Christmas I think was the last time.  I had three tacos and some Mexican rice tonight.  Now I am craving some ice cream.  I think I will go get some.  Hm.  Yes, I shall.  Ciao.  Lisa

      I'm at Fifer's.  Last night and yesterday were interesting.  Our bowling escapade with Harry Potter who didn't look like Potter without his glasses and Penguin Boy was mui interesting.  And I got a strike!!  And there was this game that was uber exciting.  And then there were hotdogs that were..uh...anyway...  And then I ate some more food at Fifer's and Abby came and we went to pick up Jenn but she wasn't there so we went to feed the horses at Abby's house and then we were leaving to go see a movie and the cops pulled us over and Abby was saying how her brother might have had some "paraphernalia" in her trunk so that was interesting.  So she got a ticket for running the stop sign (Take THAT corporate America) and then we went to Irving but all the good movies were playing too late and so we left and drove around aimlessly listening to TBS.  Good times, good times...  Then we ate and laughed and Abby is a pig and then we were in those states of barely awake cuz we're so tired and I don't even remember what we talked about then.  Me and Abby slept on the floor together and I woke up when Frankie molested me at like 10.  Fifer's mom cooked bacon and there was toast and apple cinnamon bread.  Good stuff.  I eat so much when I am at home.   Literate and stylish; kissable and quiet...   Seems to be Abby's lyric of the past couple days...it's a good lyric...  -Squishy (lmao...)

      There's something about stepping into my house after a long three weeks of living at McConnell that just puts things in perspective for me.  It's empty and the sunlight is falling on the carpet in little stripes from the blinds, I hear Oreo barking from upstairs, and I just remember all of a sudden how incredibly relaxing being home is for me.  I don't have to think about bio lab midterms that I have failed, or admin reading my article that sounds like I hate TAMS now that Mallory edited it...I don't even have to worry about a certain boy that I still have feelings for even though I am fairly sure the feeling is not mutual.  I am just here, in this place that seems to be eternally laid back and relaxing....definitely not what it was when I lived here last year, but realities change when people and times change.  And so I sit back and Fifer IMs me and there are plans to be made with people I haven't gotten to see in forever, and a stack of college mail waiting for me on the table, like...they were just waiting for me to be home.  I suppose back when I was younger I never really understood the emphasis that people placed on home.  In movies, and music, and in general...but I think now I do.    And now I think I'll go out and be crazy and enjoy my evening.  Spring Break, here I come.   (Yes, I know I am lame.)   Edit:  I wrote this a while later, but I didn't feel like making a new post.   It's funny how songs can bring you back to your past.  Am feeling nostalgic.  No one will guess why or about what.  But man, it's like the feelings were there yesterday.  Things change in two years...I am over it, but then songs like this play and it's just like...I dunno what.  Music is some powerful stuff.  I saw Amelie and Memento tonight.  Amelie is my hero.  Seriously.  And Memento was so incredibly interesting.  Like a cinematic puzzle mystery.  And the end was pretty mind boggling.  That is all.    Lisa

      Conflicting emotions.  That is the general theme of today.  Eek.  I am really excited about heading up Scoop next year.  We had our first meeting today and it will be the coolest thing in the world to have this paper and have the ability to shape it into what it will become...I dunno...it is like...art, the only kind I am good at.  It will be interesting working with Norton next year.  He is an interesting guy and he has lots of good ideas I think.  So I have this chem test tomorrow that I don't really know how to do at all...hrm.  I should work on this.  But I really don't care that much.  I just want 1:30 tomorrow to come so Naomi's mom can pick us up and we can be on our way home for SPRING BREAK!!  My schedule is filling up pretty quickly.  Saturday I am gonna go bowling and laser tagging with Pittman and Potter (Jared and Thomas) and Fifer and maybe Jenn or Abby and then that night we are camping out at Abby's and riding horses/cooking s'mores/singing Against Me! around the camp fire.  Mmm...good times.  And Monday or Sunday we are gonna have a poker night it has been decided.  I'm sure the rest of the time we will be filled with hanging out with other people...like Jenn and Amy and Jo and Ashley perhaps...maybe Olivia, if I can get a hold of her.  And then Thursday I leave for SxSw!!!  Where was I?  Oh yes.  Plans for prom.  I don't know what will be going down.  Maybe a group date with me and Naomi and Rebecca with Kevin, Zahir, and Hudgens.  But that is not in stone.  It would be fun, though.  Well, I think it is official now cuz Naomi just called Hudgens sooo there it is.  That will be an extremely interesting night.  Oh yeah, and at the World Religions Panel tonight the Jewish guy had the most awesome answers ever.  The atheist was pretty cool too.  Oh, and the Hindu guy, he was awesome.  "Imagine we were all sitting around a campfire..." -Dr. Watt (Jewish guy)  Tee hee.  Ok, going now.  Lisa

      I found this in a random blog today:  "There are moments between people when something happens. Something non-physical, non-verbal, inexplicable--mystical. It often doesn't make sense within the normal parameters of what usually contributes to the development of such a relational connection, key factors being time and shared experience.  I'm not writing about love at first sight, or even romance for that matter. It certainly can be romantic, but the connection I'm referring to can also be purely platonic. I usually find this connectivity in making eye contact with others, but it doesn't happen with everyone. There is something I cannot deny in the eyes of some strangers, in some of my acquaintances that draws me to them, that evokes greater compassion, desire to relate. It is an unspoken kinship that often never becomes fully actualized. Somehow the experiences of these people, their thoughts, dreams, and fears, resonate deeply within me like monsoon thunder in July.  I know this, whatever it is, when I see it. I am always thankful to find it. And when I do, I find my mind more at peace, my heart more fully beating."  Oh, how I love when people put into words things that I have only thought that I imagined.   So I am fairly sure that me and the boy will just remain friends.  He doesn't seem like he is going to make a move, and perhaps we would just be better as friends anyway.  He's a cool guy, and trying to be more than friends at TAMS is difficult.  I would hate to have one of those sour friendships if we tried anything and it didn't work out.  I am somewhat disappointed, but I think that being friends is a great consolation, and probably all I am really ready for at the moment.  Tee hee.  sxsw is gonna be so deck.  I am glad I know what it is called now.  Betsy was sad cuz she doesn't get to go.  Austin is the place to be Spring Break apparently.  Woo.  Can't wait!  Lisa

      I glanced at myself in the mirror today and thought that I was someone else that looked like an ostrich.  It was an extremely weird out-of-body experience.  I think that a 4.0 in damage is sounding really appealing right now.  I don't feel like going to school anymore.  I could be like Mike.  But then I'd have to go into Botany.  But SOMEONE has to fight for em. ::hits fist on IHOP table::  Hmm...  La de da de da.  So I was talking to Hudgens today and I have decided that obviously we should all marry strangers and just stare at them all day and never get to know them because once you get to know them they'll never attain the level of perfection they had in your mind before you knew them.  Actually knowing them ruins it all!    I don't really believe that, btw.  I just thought it was an interesting conversation.  I'm a hopeless romantic...and you're just HOPELESS!!!

      As much as I love irony, sometimes I don't.  In other news, I am super excited about Spring Break.  Just Abby, Fifer, (maybe Jenn?), and I and the open road...and Austin...and Motion City Soundtrack...and Against Me!....and it is going to be soooo awesome.  I can't wait.    I just have to get through one more week of these tests and this homework and then I am free!    Today I had to work sonic for After Prom and then I just did homework/screwed around until our soccer game, which we lost, but it was alright.  Vanessa and I got to play a scrimage with some random girls afterwards and it was a really fun game.    So, uh...things are interesting.  I was talking to Amy on the phone the other day and comtemplating how different of a person I am now, and how I have changed and such...it amazes me every time I think about it.    Sooo....Irony.   How uninteresting life would be without it.  Wow.  Ok, I must be going.

      Mmm...  Today I woke up, and ate, and essentially did nothing.  I watched Clueless with Sarah and Betsy and argued with them about whether or not it was gross for Cher and Josh to get together, and then I played tennis with Betsy for a while.  My whole plan was to call the boy and hang out with him, and so I did and then he wasn't there but he called me back and apparently he had already called me and then he said something about hanging out tomorrow and so I went and got ice cream with Betsy and Aubri and I was all, "Ok, I am gonna call him back and be like TONIGHT."  so I called him when I got back and apparently he had called me while I was away and so he was like, "I was thinking we should hang out tonight." and so we decided on watching a movie.  I went up to his room for a bit to pick out a movie and then watched him play Megaman on Nintendo for a while.  Then we watched Dogma, and it was a really good movie.  Well, visitation ended at 10 so he had to leave then.  I don't know why we didn't just go do something else...I'll have to think about saying that next time.  Naomi and Rebecca got back a little while after that and we went and got Jack-in-the box but the doors were closed so we had to go through the drive thru on foot and that was fun.  Then I played Rebecca on DDR at the Lan Party.  Holla holla.  Lisa PS- (I really, really like him)

      So today was considerably better :).  I got to sleep for ten hours last night, and I decided to not worry about my bio grades so much, cuz there is still hope.  And then Matt (my brother) and I went to eat around noon and I got to borrow some DVDs from him.  Then I went to chem recitation, and left early, and as I was walking out, the boy was walking in and it was raining really hard so he gave me his raincoat and said I had to bring it back for him after recitation so I was going to but then we had a tornado alarm right when I was supposed to bring it back to him so I felt bad and called him afterwards but he didn't really care and then he was like, "You wanna go run outside in the rain with me?" so I was like...uhhh...sure.  Anyway.  It stopped raining, but me and him and Kyle and Nic and Angela all went outside and played some soccer in the mud.  Twas really fun.  ::Remembers moments:: *Sigh*  So I forget what I did the rest of the day.  I went to the Dessert and Discourse for a while.  It was ok.  Then we played our soccer game and I scored a goal and we won, and after curfew I went and watched a movie with Kelli and Vanessa and Sarah.  The Boondock Saints.  It was a very good movie, and interesting...and such.  The Irish boys were hot too, which was most def. a bonus.  Anyway, I must go to sleep now.   Peace out yo.  Lisa

      So I'm pretty sure Kyle didn't adhere to the "whatever is said in the circle stays in the circle."  Cuz I've definitely been getting some different vibes last night/this morning.  Hmmm...oh well. :P I guess it doesn't matter.  So, today I had the closest thing to a mental breakdown I've had in a long time.  Maybe it was because I haven't slept in about 36 hours or perhaps it is because of this weather or maybe it was because of my tests...or maybe it was a combination of all three.  I didn't sleep last night because I was studying so much for our dumb biology exam.  And from 3-6 I had to do my bio lab notebook because that midterm was today as well.  Well.  So much for studying and sleeping unhealthily too little.  I've only slept like...5 hours this week.  Hm.  Most def. not a good thing.  I got a C on my bio test and I am fairly sure I failed my bio lab exam.  Oh, AND she tells us well you can turn in your notebooks next week instead of today.  Well, gee, thanks for effing telling me NOW when I could have gotten three more hours of biology studying in last night.  So I was sick and tired and in a bad mood all day and then I got out of bio lab nearly crying because I know I failed it and I go check my bio grade, expecting a high B/low A at least.  A fucking 78.  Then something just snapped in me I guess, and I just felt all this stress, that I ended up suffering for practically nothing, wash over me in this one big wave of stress and I just had to get out of there.  I didn't want to be in my room, I didn't want to be in my dorm, I didn't want to be on campus anymore.  I just wanted to drive away as far as I could or something...or maybe just home.  I don't know...I ended up just walking...and I walked a long way.  I eventually ended up at the Recycled Book/CD store in Denton Square and being there just...it calmed me down.  Way much.  It's like a maze in there with like three different levels and its so...cool.  I could just hide behind some obscure bookshelf and read or look at books.  I ended up getting three Vonnegut that I don't have and one Orwell.  I am in a cynical mood I suppose.  I spent about 2 hours there and then walked back, thinking a lot about a lot of different things.  It's amazing how upset I was about doing so bad in biology.  I would think I wouldn't care, since I don't want my job to have anything to do with biology.  Or chemistry.  Or math.  Haha.  Kelli asked me the other day why I had come here and I just don't know.  To escape home I guess.  And now that is where I want to escape to.  Funny the way the world works, ne?    Now, it's all over, the bio madness I mean.  For the time being anyway.  I'm listening to my Perks of Being a Wallflower mix right now.  Scarborough Fair is playing.  It makes me feel like I am in a dream.  Infinite music fo sho.  The original.  Music is so amazing...it was so weird...earlier today, with the whole mental breakdown thing...I didn't even feel like listening to music.  It was a weird feeling.  Usually that is the only thing that I never reject or get tired of.  I've decided I need to escape from here more often.  Maybe go to my brother's apartment more or something.  I wanted to go over there today but he wasn't home.  Not having a car sucks.  I ate lunch with the boy today and it was pretty cool.  Pretty sure Kyle let the cat out of the bag...but it seems to have made more of a positive impact, so it's all good.  Last night I walked out of MAC at like 1 AM and he was getting coffee so I joined him, and we had one of those conversations that just makes you smile for like an hour afterwards...just a short one, but I was glowy.  Wow, from this point, if we end up being nothing more than friends, it will be one agonizing year.  Because it's almost exactly a year til I graduate.  Crazy, huh?  College seems so far away and scary.  Cuz this isn't like...real college.  You know?  I guess real college won't be very much more scarier though.  So, I am just rambling now.  I think I need to go sleep.  Yup.  Am doing that.  See ya.  Lisa

      Last night, I had a semi-argument with Colin, who is known as like the music god up here, about emo.  We spoke through a medium, Christina, and he argued that Sunny Day Real Estate started emo while I maintained that it was Rites of Spring.  He also said that if I wanted some complex emo to listen to, I should check out Modest Mouse, so naturally I told Christina to tell him that I saw MM live over Spring Break and that if that was the most complex "emo" he could think of, that it was sad.  This morning, I received a note from him in my box.  I thought it was interesting:  Lisa, Hey, this is Colin.  This music thing with Christina has been bugging me since she left, and, for the record, you are  right  about the whole emo thing.  Most of the time, I don't think about Rites of Spring and all those early bands on Dischord records as being emo, but you're right, they were the first to get the name.  I was thinking Sunny Day Real Estate because I was thinking of who begat the whole Get Up Kids, Promise Ring branch of emo rather than the harder-core stuff that bands like At the Drive-In grew out of.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I was mistaken.  I'd love to talk music sometime if you'd like.  I love Christina, but trying to talk to her about music is pretty tough to say the least.  -Colin  PS- You are right, the whole Modest Mouse thing is pretty off.  I'd just been listening to the new cd all day and they were the first band that came to mind.  Music nerds are funny.  heh.  Normal people wouldn't have let a trivial argument like that bother them :P.  Maybe it doesn't seem much to you, but the fact that he completely gave in and said I was right is amazing.  He is one of those guys that always thinks they're right and such.  He probably knows more about music than me too, hah.  But he doesn't have to know that.  Anyway, so I matched music wits with a hardcore indie guy last night and I won.  Fun stuff.  I can't believe I wrote a whole blog about this.  Obviously, I am a music nerd as well.  Normal people would not write a blog about winning a trivial music argument.  Other news of the day:  Computer is causing entire Res net traffic to be screwed up, had to shut down permanately until computer guy can come kick out the hacker guy that has been working through my portal.    Also, got my letter telling me of my Senior Mentor rejection.  And had my bio lab final.  Good day?  I would say not.  But it was ok.  I am so tired.  Why am I still awake?  Because I am an effing insomniac, that's why.  I need to go now.  Lisa

      "Anyone who missed last night's show missed some good singing.  Some Minor Threat-esque antics." "It was a  very  minor threat." "We are about the minorest threat that you can get."  "You should buy Centromatic's album...if you like good songs.  If you like bad songs...like maybe Hoobastank, or some other equally horrible band, then don't buy it.  But if you like  good  songs..."  ::Hugs a tree::  Death Cab for Cutie is hardcore.  I heart them.  I don't know any names, but the lead singer is really funny and cool and amazing at singing and the bassist is super cute.  He made the second comment of the blog.  :P.  Centromatic was good, but nothing compared to Death Cab.  We (me, Sarah, Kelli, and Vanessa) left before Ben Kweller because none of us really wanted to see him and we wanted to eat before we had to be back for curfew.  I looked for Abby but did not find her!! :( But I got a shirt and it is really cool.  It has an umbrella and raindrops that are really little skulls if you look close.  Deck, eh?  We ended up eating at Cafe Brazil.  It was really good.  The guys next to us were talking to the waiter about his night and the waiter was talking about how he had gotten trashed beforehand and was using his brother's 2-year-old son as a way to pick up chicks.  It was...umm...interesting.  Today I was thinking a lot on my walk to Sack n Save and back.  It is funny how you might not understand something that someone did to you in the past and then you look at yourself in your situation and you realize startingly that you are in the same exact position and all of a sudden you understand exactly why the person did what they did and why you had to be hurt in the process.  And you know not to make the same mistake, because you know that you do not want to hurt the person that is in the place that you were in a couple of years ago.  Sorry for the vagueness, but I feel it is necessary.  I'm sorry I ever was mad at that person.  Although the pain is still there, I know that he had his reasons, and that is was inevitable what he did.  We ordered pizza a while ago and Naomi, as a joke, printed off this fake coupon on telephone book paper.  It looked so authentic.  It was pretty hilarious.  Me and her and Hanna and Rebecca have been sitting here eating pizza and talking for about an hour now.  I was supposed to get that Scoop stuff to Norton by 1:00.  Oops.  :)  Going now.  Lisa  Dear Lisa,  I am pleased to let you know that you have been selected for the Intern News Writer position for the Fall 2004 North Texas Daily.  I will be contacting you throughout the next few weeks and months to help you prepare for the next semester.   Be sure to clear out the week before school starts in August for the NT Daily training week. During this time, you will learn all the responsibilities for your position, as well as the policies and day-to-day workings of the Daily.

      Being dragged into a puddle of mud by your fellow teammates is unpleasantly fun.  :P  I heart midnight soccer games with the soccer people.  We surprised Vanessa with a cake this morning and woke her up by singing Happy Birthday.  Twas cool.  Then I scraped paint off of the window frames outside of McConnell because we are supposed to be repainting them soon.  Rosecutting was after that and Chris gave a ballin speech.  Seriously.  He has a way of making people laugh that is just amazing.  For a while, it didn't even seem like he was talking about graduation, just about his car and such...and then he just tied it together at the end by paralleling the two and didn't even directly state how they correllated...it was awesome.  Katy had a really good speech as well and Allan's was cute.  Simone's was pretty good as well.  But I think Chris outshined them all.  After the speeches they had an insane amount of awards and I thought it was interesting how Norton got an award for Scoop and I didn't....yes, interesting.  Betsy won like three awards and left before any of them were announced :).  Christina won the Junior Pacesetter Award and that was pretty exciting.    I went and ate with her and Katie and Cherie afterwards.  Then me and Rebecca chilled on the PEB field and read books under the sun and such.  It was very pretty outside.  I went and played football with Christina and Katie and Sarah and Lee Lee and Kelly after that.  It was very interesting, mui fun.  And then I caught the end of the talent show.  Those silly TAMS kids...  Oh!  I also got stung by a bee for the first time today!  That was exciting.  My foot felt like it was going to have to be amputated or something.  But I didn't cry.  I only cry when I am emotionally distraught.  Katie thought that was funny.  So, graduation will definitely be sad.  The one two weeks from now, and the one a year and two weeks from now.    "Oh bring me back to the start..."  Lisa

      So the word emo has been tossed around a lot these past couple of days.  Chintan's spend-a-day was a cute little Asian commercialized emo boy.  Complete with girl pants, converse, a TSL t shirt (two sizes too small), an Early November trucker hat (good band, at least :P), and a pink belt.  I walked into Cal with my Fall Out Boy shirt and I saw his eyes light up as he saw the first person (as far as he knew) that listened to good music.  We had a short discussion concerning music.  I don't think he goes much further than drive-thru and such.  Anyway, after cal, everyone started talking about him and referring to him as the "emo boy."  Heh.  And they ALL noted his girl pants.  It was great.  Then Christina is all, "Lisa, what is emo?"  ::Dramatic pause::  The unanswerable question, unexplainable concept.  Haha, ok well, not really, but it can get quite complicated.  So I tried to explain it to her, and I think she kinda of understood.  And now she's been talking about it nonstop.  Same with everybody else.  It is quite crazy.  I have had to constantly describe the difference between punk and today's "emo."  Oh and also a couple of days ago I saw someone with a shirt that said, "War is emo."  I'm not quite sure I follow their logic.  Hmm.  Anyway, today was super great.  Felt like a Friday.  My cal test was hard as ef and took me two hours.  Then I had my interview for a position on the NT Daily next year.  I think it went pretty well.  If I don't get the part time job I am hoping for, I think that she will at least give me an internship.  Then I went to lunch.  Apparently, four of our Junior guys got caught smoking pot in their bathroom last night.  They all got kicked out; had to call their parents at like 1 in the morning and get them to go pick them up.  I feel bad for them because a couple of them were really nice guys and three of them were really popular with our class.  One of them had it set.  He was like a super genius and wanted to go to Harvard and stuff but there's no way an Ivy League school will let them in with something like getting kicked out of TAMS.  However, even though I feel bad about it, they did kinda bring it upon themselves.  I mean, it was dumb for them to do that.  If you have to smoke pot, at least don't do it in the dorms!  Anyway, I had Self Defense and then I went to Wal Mart with Rebecca and Megan which was interesting.  Then I went to bio open lab cuz I figured out that if I get a perfect on the final I get an A in the class.  Same with regular bio.  So I have to study a lot so that I can have another 4.0!  Anyway, I then took a two hour nap before our BUGS presentation, which went swimmingly.  Micaela loved the gift basket thing I put together for her and it was pretty cool.  I got a free lab coat, which I plan to wear to all my physics labs next year.  And then Naomi called Tyler and Matt (guitar teacher guy from Arlington that was in town and our other friend from UNT) and we went and hung out with them.  We all went and ate at this Chinese buffet place that was really good.  And then we drove around a lot.  They came back with us to McConnell and Tyler was just aimlessly wandering around Mac and Smitty.  It was funny.  Then Matt lost his keys in the bushes.  Lol.  That was great.  He and Tyler were like making all this ruckus and everyone was just walking by and aw man, it was like three hours of non-stop laughter.  Those guys are seriously some of the funniest people ever.  They make me happy inside and definitely made my day.  Good times.    I need to study chemistry now.  I only have two classes tomorrow!  Woo!  Lisa

      CDs to buy (or rip): The Weakerthans Hot Rod Circuit Jets to Brazil  I hate it when I let people get me down.  And I hate myself when I realize that I actually do care what people think about me, no matter how much I say that I don't.  I'm such a hypocrite and a coward.  Why do people have to say the things they say sometimes?  And why won't they give me a straight answer?  This is dumb.  I should just forget about it.  I barely passed the GSP test this morning.  I got a 100 on the spelling part, an 85 on the punctuation part and a flat 70 on the grammar part.  It was very difficult and the questions were very tricky.  Usually, I ace grammar tests.  You know?  But, I passed and so now I am officially signed up for Journalism 2310: News reporting and writing.  Woo!  After classes I had BUGS and my mentee and I worked a lot on our project which we present Thursday.  She tells me about her life a lot.  It amazes me how much drama a 5th-grader can have.  I did some yearbook pages sometime after that.  And now I am here, listening to my Hopelessly Devoted to You compilation.  I really like it.  But I let something someone said rip apart my contentness.  I don't know why.  I'm dumb.  Lisa

      When Betsy was pushing me around in the old shopping cart out behind McConnell tonight and the Get Up Kids were playing in my cd player, and we were laughing hysterically, I think I felt infinite for the first time in a long time.  We ended up playing volleyball; me, Rebecca, Lisa, Naomi, Betsy, and Aarron.  Betsy is graduating in three weeks.  I think it is kinda sad.  Sometimes I really love being up here.

      So I have listened to Ted Leo a lot today.  No reason.  I swear.  ::Giggles::  I'm a nerd.  Actually, right now I am listening to Jets to Brazil.  They are deck.   There's a phone call aimed at me tonight...   I wish there was a phone call aimed at me tonight.  I am feeling particularly phone-callish.  So let's see..it's been a while.  Thursday night I went to the SGA day and got a wax hand and wiggled my ears for a pumpkin pie.  Then me and Kenny were supposed to watch movies but we both had so much to do by the time visitation was over so he went with me to play soccer with a bunch of people.  That kinda sucked, so a bunch of us left and played volleyball, which was very fun.  Friday I just hung out with Fifer after getting home.  We went to the mall and eavesdropped on some nerds in the bookstore.  Nerds are so cool.  I heart them.  Then we got Wendy's food and went and watched random soccer games at the fields.  But mostly we talked.  It was cool.    Saturday I headed over to Vanessa's and just chilled at her house for a long time and met all of her interesting friends.  She has too many friends and a TV life we have decided.  Her brother was pretty cool, didn't get to talk to him much though.  They are too against drugs.  In an over-the-board type way.  But other than that, he and his friends are cool.  I went home Sunday and watched 8 hours of Stephen King mini series.  Mmm...8 hours of TV and doing nothing.  I am too busy at school.  Today was crazy and the week looks like it will be crazier.  I wish that there was more free time so that I could watch movies.  So I am just sitting here now...I was waiting for a phone call, and I got one, but not the one I was waiting for.  So now I guess I am out to play volleyball with cool people.    Lisa

      I am both melancholy and perfectly content.  But not melancholy in a particularly sad way, just a pensive, quiet way.  I don't really know how to describe it.  The madness is over for a while at least.  Yesterday and today I was so busy.  Yesterday I had class and then BUGS and then I had to skip chem lab to go to our semi finals game for the girls soccer team, which we won.  Afterwards, they named me MVP of both the girls and co ed team.  That was very flattering, but I suppose I do not really think that I was the most valuable player. :P I loved our teams this year though.  I will be sad to see Leah and Aubri and Zahir and Kevin and Chris graduate.  They are all such great players and people.  After we won that game, I went and ate dinner with Kenny.  Interesting times.  Today was so crazy, I almost died.  I had to do my cal hw in Bio and then skip poly sci to take a shower and finish the hw.  Luckily English was cancelled, but I still had to ask Schoolfield to write my letter of reference for the NT Daily app and so then I had to go finish it, which took forever because there was so much crap to include and it was my first time to ever have to type up a resume for myself.  But I got that done, had to go buy a manila envelope, drop off my learning log by Schoolfield's office, pick up my letter of reference, and finally turn in my application at 4.  Then I had thirty minutes to study for my bio lab quiz which I am pretty sure I failed.  Anyway, I have my interview for the job next Thursday at 9:00.  Tuesday at 9 I have to take the GSP test so that I can sign up for the Newswriting and reporting class.    After Bio Lab, it was a quick dinner and then off to the soccer games.  I got a lot of people to come, it was great.  But, sadly, we lost both of them. :(  Oh well :).  I have many battle scars that are even uglier than the ones from Anti-Flag in December.  After we lost horribly, I played a little basketball with Sweeny and Chintan.  Oh man, those guys are great.  I need to hang out with them more.  Kenny had to consult me for advice on what to wear to his research interview a little while ago.  It was quite amusing.  That kid cracks me up sometimes.  And he gives me good music.  I like laughing and good music.  So I gave him some good music in return (Anti-Flag and Ted Leo ;) ) Annyywayy...  I found out/realized a couple of things today that are both flattering and weird.  Hmm.  But they make me happy inside.  However, for some reason, I am in a peaceful, pensive, melancholy mood.  Bright Eyes and SoCo's Konstantine kind of mood, you know?    Lisa

      Today was a very good day.  After classes, I ate with Sarah, Ryan, and Kenny, which always proves to be an interesting experience.  Ryan is a cool guy, and intriguing.  I don't think I have ever met someone like him.  He's simple...but really interesting...and he's got a great personality, but he hates social situations and being around a lot of people.  Hmm.  Anyway.    Then me and Naomi and Rebecca and Sarah and Lisa and Kelli all went easter egg hunting with Kyle and Carlos and Steven and Carl at Eureka Park.  It was mui fun.  We played on the playground afterwards and it was just so great.  We were like kids again.  On the way home, we blasted the YMCA and Celine Dion.  Me and Lisa were singing our hearts out.  It was great.  Then we had our soccer game for the quarterfinals match and we won!!  I scored the goal that made it to where we could win.  Fun stuff, eh?  It is rare that I get to do important stuff like that in a game, and everybody was so cool to me and kept telling me good job and stuff.  It was great.  The whole game was great except for this part when this guy was like groping me and pretending like he was marking up on me or something but I mean....he effing grabbed my breast.  I was all "Get the fuck off me" and pushed him away.  He didn't mess with me after that.  Ha.  :P  Did some thinking later on while I was running with Naomi.  I think that I am one confused person.    The NT Daily Application is due Wednesday and I have to give them seven examples of my work and have two letters of reference and all this other crap.  I dunno if I have the time or the patience to do that.  And I don't even know if they'll let me write for them.  But I guess I should try...:P  Tax returns are due Thursday.  And I have to take that dumb grammar test to be in journalism.  I sign up for classes tomorrow too.  Ahh.  Lisa

      After a plesant spaghetti lunch after I woke up, I did nothing all day, except for help my mom clean up our yard, in the cold and rain...  Fifer came over around 5 and we just sat around talking and watching TV and then we had to go get some milk and then I made macaroni and cheese for dinner and she left to go see As I Lay Dying and Every Time I Die...haha...I kinda wish I coulda gone, but it was one of those family dinners and Matthew was making the chicken..yeah...my macaroni and cheese was ballin by the way.  Even though I was punk rock and deviated from the directions (or suggestions, as I like to call them).  After dinner, I played a game of poker with my brothers again and was second to last going out.  Amy called after that and picked me up to hang out with her for a while.  We went to Wal Mart because she needed last minute Easter attire.  I saw Laura and Jerred for the first time in like two years.  It's funny how I have been running into people lately.  Anyway, then we just went back to her house and watched Cheaper By the Dozen while eating Spam sandwiches...mmm...they were tres bien.  Jennifer got back from work at around 12:30 and then she jumped on me after making me put down the Spam (I thought it wasn't real meat anyway :P) and after the movie I talked to her for a while about stuff.  I guess we just acted like nothing had happened, which is good I suppose.  I am glad I got to talk to everybody this weekend that was having problems with me.  :)  Umm...so I am really tired and tomorrow morning I must sit through the torture that is mass...and I get lots of candy and such from the Easter Bunny.  Exciting stuff, eh?  Yes, I thought so.  Lisa

      OK, so I told myself I wasn't going to sleep in both Friday and Saturday, but I did anyways.  :P oh well.  Yesterday, I was just chillaxin around the hizzouse and I really didn't feel like doing much or going anywhere.  I went to the grocery store for my mom and ran a couple of errands for her, but nothing else really.  So, I really didn't feel like getting ready to go see Shut Up Agnes and, as Fifer pointed out, all of my favorite people were there, like albino boy and Satan.  Haha.  So I didn't.  But it was ok, because I was playing poker with my brothers.  I was winning a majority of the game until I went all in on a full house and then Jason had one as well that was higher than mine!!  At that point, he had just as many chips as me so he got to take all of mine.  Heh.  But it was alright because they know I know how to play poker now.    Around 10:00, Olivia dropped by to watch a movie with me before heading off to her boyfriend's house.  We just talked a lot and caught up on stuff.  And she invited me to go to Panama with her and a couple of her friends this summer.  It sounded fun, I might want to go.  Oh, and yesterday I found out that I only owe $1,700 for housing.  I have around $1,600 left from my grants.  That means I only have to ask my Dad for a couple hundred.  This is good.  Lisa

      Last night I had this dream that I was trying to convince everyone I knew that I didn't do the things that they thought I did.  I told everyone that I didn't get high or drunk and that I didn't have sex with random people and that I didn't go around breaking laws all the time.  And not one person in my dream believed me.  It was just a weird feeling...and dream.  Last night's show was great fun.  James went with us again and that is always interesting.  There were a ton of people for The Door and half of them were annoying middle school kids who didn't really understand what it was all about.  We met this guy named Sky that probably found his match/soulmate in Abby for the first time and after exchanging witty banter/insults, he called her incredible.  But Abby played hard-to-get and wouldn't tell him her name.  Oh, and Abby yelled really loud that A Walk to Remember was James' favorite movie and everybody in line was laughing.  It was hilarious as ef.    Inside, it was ridicuously crowded, more crowded than I have ever seen The Door before.  I didn't like it.  I really like smaller shows a lot better.  And when I say smaller shows I mean that I like it when there is room to walk around and being near the stage does not mean that you cannot do anything but be smooshed between two people that pull your hair the whole time.  So for the most part, I just watched the show.  The people in the mosh pit were a bunch of 13-year-old boys a lot of the time, and up front wasn't enjoyable at all, so I just watched.  Autopilot Off was good and Senses Fail, as usual, did not fail to amaze me with their live show and their connection with the audience.  That makes my third time to see Senses Fail but this was the first time that I didn't get to be in the crowd for their show because of the aformentioned reasons.  But, still, it was good.  Rufio was good, but not amazing.  They rocked out pretty hard, and they did a cover of Madonna :).    I was standing near one of the moshpits at one point during the show and I noticed this guy coming up to me and then he got really close and I was like, "What is he doing?" and then he gave me a hug and I realized that it was Justin!  So I hugged him back and I asked him who all was there and he said he was looking for Jeremy and so he left.  After Autopilot Off was over, he found me again and I got to talk to him.  I asked him if anyone was going around the church telling everyone that I was a bad person and he said no and asked why and I said because that seems to be the general consensus nowadays and he said, "Lisa, you're one of the nicest people I know.  And I really mean that."  That really meant a lot to me, and I wish I could have told him that before we left.  But anyway, Abby and James came back from the concession stand and Justin started talking about how he couldn't crowd surf because he weighed a good 250 pounds and then started talking about how all those emo kids wear those tight clothes and he can't because he's fat (and he's not like fat in a gross way, he just is big and plays football and that kinda thing) and so he says he is going to design his own line of clothing of emo clothes for fat kids and call it Femo..or Phemo...Phat with a P-H...haha.  That kid is funny.  I heart him.  So anyway, at another point in the night some kid sprayed the fire extinguisher and it was this powder stuff that got in my eyes and nose so I had to breathe down my shirt for five minutes until it got out of the air.  It was super annoying.  I spent the night at Abby's house and now I am home.  I slept a long time this morning.  I haven't had more than four hours of sleep since like...Afterprom morning...and before that...Spring Break.  Maybe I should start sleeping more.  Lisa

      I went to a FACES session of Zen Meditation today.  Really, it is just sitting and staring at the ground.  I don't think I was very good at it.  The point was to have no thoughts and just have a clear mind but I think there were maybe only ten seconds out of 24 minutes that I actually did that.  It is hard.  My thoughts won't shut up.  I was mildly calmed down afterwards, and then Tyler called me to go play tennis with him because he wants to learn how.  So I played with him for about an hour and came back here and talked to Sarah and Naomi and such.  I feel extremely awkward today.  Lisa

      Soo I really just want it to be summer already.  I think I spend too much time around certain people, and get too annoyed easily.  I don't really feel like writing, so I won't really...  Tomorrow I get to see Rufio and Senses Fail.  Fun stuff.  I hope I end up having a way to get home.  Oh, and I got yet another email.  This time, instead of anger, it was pity, which I think is simultaneously funnier and more annoying.  Telling me that you cry because of me isn't going to make me feel bad.  I think it's useless.  Cry for yourself, I am fine, you know?

      Currently Playing Complete Discography By Minor Threat   This music makes me happy in an angry I-want-to-bash-in-some-windows-with-a-baseball-bat-Mike-style kinda way.  You know what I mean?   So I had a lot of anger today.  In chemistry, I felt like hitting something.  Grr.  But I took a nap before English and so it was a little better after that.  I want to be home for the summer already, dawgs.  "I'm happy in a crying sort of way...curled up in the shower, biting your knees, wishing you were dead kinda way..." (Ludo rocks my world.)  "LUDO hold the listener's attention with a feel good, uplifting, and promising debut." -random reviewer  I think it is funny how they have such bitter lyrics but are called feel good and uplifting...I mean, I know they are, but it's funny how that works.  Feeling other people's pain uplifts us!!  Ok, going now.  Maybe I sleep some more.  -from Lisa's Xanga

      The FOB show was sold out.  Damn Mest and their popularity.   But anyway, it turned out to be an interesting night.  The reason we got there so late was because  we had to wait for James to get back from UiL and he didn't get back until like 7:20 or something and so we didn't actually get on the road until like 7:40 and the doors opened at  7 soooo anyway.  Like I said, it was an interesting night.  Me and Abby played songs that were funny because of certain situations ("I wanna hate you sooo bad, but I can't!  But I can't....").  Abby and James had a f...er, I mean...an explosion.  That was pretty hilarious as well.  After we found out the show was sold out, we tried to sneak in for a while until we figured out that it wasn't going to work and then we walked around Main St. for a while because there was some kind of festival.  I dunnno.  We ended up going to IHOP to see Jared.  Man, that kid is funny.  I heart him.  But I don't want in his pants.  Fifer.  They didn't charge me for my buttermilk pancakes so I got them for free.  Woo!  I picked up the tip, though.  After IHOP we dropped off James and then had a CD burning party pour moi at Fifer's house.  Then she kicked us out because she was tired :P.  Earlier, I spent the day with Amy.  We had a good time catching up and talking and stuff.  Good times.  Heather is so cute.  She is probably the cutest baby ever.  But she slobbers a lot.  Slobbering is gross :P.    My insides are copper.  Those anarcho punks are mysterious.  Lisa

      Went and saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind w/ Abby and Fifer.  Good times.  FOB is tomorrow night, I am excited.  I am supposed to look for a boy with curly red hair named Jed.  And Vanessa and Kelli told me to find a cute boy while I was there as well.  Haha.  That is amusing to me, cuz it's as if they expect me to be able to pick up a cute boy :p.    Had a convo w/ the mother about financial stuff.  Her: "You need to start budgeting your money better."  Me: "Yeahh...."  But there is just some stuff you have to do, you know?  I think this would have worked out a lot better if I had negotiated some kind of monthly allowance with her and my dad at the beginning of the year.  Oh well.  Next year I plan on reffing on the weekends.  I think it is unrealistic to go to school full time and work.  Especially since I am going to be taking 19 hours again.  A lot of people told me this week that I seem sadder than usual.  I don't know why.  I guess I have been rather melancholy lately.  Hmm...I suppose it is a combination of things.  Hah.  It just took me like ten seconds to remember the word combination.  I am debating whether or not I should go somewhere tonight.  I need to, but I am not sure I want to.  I dunno.  Confusingness.

      I'm tired of trying.  So, Shea Sanford is gonna be working with me this summer.  Interesting, eh?  Yes, I thought so.  Oh, and tonight after I got off, I thought I heard a familiar voice, so I turned around and who is it but my good friend Donelle.  Haha.  Six Flags must be the place to work for those Summiteers.  Also, at graduation I got to see JoAnn and Ashley for the first time in over a month...or two...and then I saw Matt Jones for the first time in a couple of years.  We had a good conversation about colleges.  But, I don't want to think about college right now because even though I know I won't get in to the places I want to go, I am still going to disappoint myself by applying.    I'm out.

      So.  Working "two days" this weeks has turned into five days - with a double shift on Friday.  I expect that when I get my first pay check I shall be, as they say, "rolling in da money."  So my mom woke me up at 5:00 this morning so that I could go get some groceries for her.  Groceries... like an ink cartridge, 40 popsicles, and 20 gallon sized ziplock bags.  Just the essentials, you know?  Wal-Mart at 5:30 in the morning is interesting.  The cleaning guys were shouting random Dave Chapelle phrases at the top of their lungs.   My favorite part of the day has got to be before the park is actually opened and I get to climb this long ladder and flight of stairs to do safety checks.  It's so pretty from up there and so peaceful...mmm...  My other favotite part of the day was when these boys started doing the Mighty Ducks cheer on El Conquistador.  That ride is the funnest.  Jenni is really nice, and probably the one who talks to me the most.  Lyndsey is really nice.  Becky is cool too.  Donni is cool.  Ferrell is...ok I suppose.  I guess the guy that has intrigued me the most so far is Greg.  He reminds me so much of someone, but for the life of me, I cannot think of who it is.  There are just some people that intrigue you even without you really ever being in a conversation with them.  I haven't talked to him save for the work conversations, but for some reason I find myself trying to figure out what kind of guy he is.  I wonder what kind of music he listens to, what his friends are like, what school he goes to, if he still lives with his parents, what his clothes look like when he is not in uniform, what he gets like when he's crazy or drunk or around people he knows really well.  This creates much entertainment for my mind throughout the day.    This is so much better than Kroger.  I didn't even feel like I worked 10 hours today.  HOLLA.  Lisa

      Last night I was ready to say goodbye to my computer and my music library of over 2600 songs forever.  My brother reinstalled Windows onto my computer, hoping to recover explorer.exe.  It was not recovered.  And I wasn't even able to get to my itunes or the folder that held my itunes music.  I was about ready to cry for the lost music and pawn off my computer.  But then, I messed around on it and have improved its condition considerably.  It is still incredibly screwed up, but now at least I have the internet.  I think this is reason enough to not pawn it off until I have my new computer.  I still can't play music on it, but at least I have been able to locate where my itunes music is, even if it is unaccessible still.  These are the reasons why I am never going to use Windows or Microsoft ever again.  Macs all the way.  Woot.  Anyhow...Three things I am exceedingly glad about right now: 1) On account of my brother deciding to tour with the Madison Scouts this summer, I will have full rights to his car and computer for the next two and a half months.  His car, the Saturn with a CD player and AC...unlike my mother's car with neither...I get to use it starting this Friday.  Exciting, no? 2) The swimming pool at our townhouse complex.  I have a feeling I will be wanting to use it a lot after my long days working in the 120 degree heat this summer. 3)  My ability to get into Hurricane Harbor for free whenever I want to...with a friend.  I think I shall also have to take advantage of this.  So, anyway, Saturday and Sunday I spent ten hours each day signing papers and sitting through classes and taking tests so that I can start working.  I am only trained on two rides so far.  La Vibora and the Conquistador.  I work in Spain.  I only work two days this week, though, because they said this week I am only working the open shifts they had.  This is good though because I am off Saturday so that I can go see graduation.  Last night I watched a movie called One Hour Photo.  It was very creepy.  Well, I'm off to see Ryan Fan at some orchestra concert thing of his in Richardson.  Fun stuff.  I haven't seen him since...well, I can't even remember the last time I saw him.  Lisa

      I almost forgot how fun it is to pretend to be an anarchist.  Until tonight :P.  Thursday I went to the Rangers game with Matt and his "friend" Meredith and Naomi.  We saw Lisa there with her little brother, who is adorable.  Afterwards me and Naomi had a Kill Bill fest until 3 in the morning and we watched volumes 1 and 2.  I thought they were really good, if only a little cheesy.  And today I went shopping with Amy and Heather for a bit, and that was fun.  Then Fifer called and invited me to go to some carnival with her and Abby and Laura and so I did that and we met up with some guy from Buzz Oven named Alex who was really crazy.  Almost as crazy as those carnies.  lol.  They think Abby and Alex are weird.  "And when  they  think you're weird, then you  know  that you're fucked up."  Haha.  I think we rode every ride there.  Then we had pancakes at IHOP and seasoned fries at Denny's and it was great fun.  I have to be at my first day of work tomorrow at 8:30.  And tomorrow night I'm going to some show with James and Fifer and Abby.  So anyway.  Ciao.  (haha that reminds me of someone's voicemail :P)  Lisa

      Watched my mother's third grade class deliver the poems they memorized in front of the class. Realized that I really miss elementary school.  Went to eat a picnic lunch with Jennifer at the park. Learned that UNT made me go psycho.  Ate dinner at a chinese restaurant. Found that I can talk to my mom just like a friend.  Went to my brother's football game. Was reminded how boring high school football is.  That is all.

      I have a job.  :)  The guy that interviewed me reminded me of Vin Diesel meets Adam Sandler...the former being looks and the latter being personality.  He was crazy, but I think he was smart as well.  And he was really nice.  Six Flags has a "points" system.  It reminded me of TAMS oh so much.  Calling in sick is ten points.  Being late for work is 5 points.  30 points and I'm fired.  Not quite as flexible as Kroger was, but then, Kroger didn't pay $6.50/hour either.  Anyway, Saturday and Sunday are my training days and then I start next week.  My mother and I might have to share a car again this summer.  Fin.

It's like hey let's take young people's goals, hopes, and dreams, make them believe they can achieve them, crush them, and put their acts in which they made themselves completely vulnerable on TV so all America can have a good hearty laugh at them.  Ha Ha!  Look at that girl think that she has achieved her lifelong dream of becoming a star!  How amusing that she sucks but does not know it yet!  With that said, I have some laundry to do.

      So I am having trouble remembering anything productive I've done the past couple of days.  I saw Troy last night.  Which was funny, even though I don't think it was supposed to be.  But, I mean, the war thing has been done so many times...Brad Pitt was sexy, of course.  There were a lot of scenes with him half-to-almost-completely naked.  Oh, and then Jill had a video of Trenton streaking.  Censored, of course.  :P  And tonight I saw Supersize Me.  It was very good.  Really opened my eyes.  I don't think I will ever eat fast food ever again.  But yeah, I recommend it to all.  Go out and see it.  That is all.  Lisa

      I thought this was really funny:  my pokemon cards bring all the nerds to the yard and they're like, you wanna trade cards? damn right, i wanna trade cards ill give ya pikachu, but not my charizard!  I know I've said this before but everytime I hear the milkshake song, I automatically think of Ashley's backyard.  But, I don't think she's a whore or anything.  I guess it was just all those sunny summer afternoons back in the day spent in her backyard, or Noel's backyard...or something.  I have an interview to work Ride Operations at Six Flags on Tuesday.  At 6:15.  I don't know what I'll do with myself until then.  Summer is awfully uneventful so far.  And I only have like $26 in my bank account, so I can't do much with money.  This is why I need a job.  Hrm.  Late night trips down memory lane are fun fo shizzle.  I think I understand my transition from religion to none a little better now.    Oh!  I almost forgot.  I totally just beat Matt and Brian and my mom in a game of Hold Em.  Word.  Lisa

      I am now officially the biggest nerd alive.  :P  Even though I left high school for TAMS, I came back to Summit to attend the UiL academic team (that I am no longer a part of)'s banquet.  And I enjoyed it.  Haha.  It was fun though.  I got to see everyone again and there were many hugs and such.  I went with Fifer and Abby, and Abby isn't a part of the team either, but we had fun making fun of all of them. :P  Things haven't changed much from last year.  I can't believe it's been an entire year already.  I remember Chess in a Tin at last year's banquet like it was yesterday.  I saw Ryan, probably for the last time ever, since he is going to the University of Southern California next year.  I decided to end whatever weird relation(friend?) ship we have with some sort of resolution, so I talked to him and told him thanks for getting me interested in journalism and told him about my internship and my editor-in-chief-ness next year.  I guess it wasn't too much of a resolution, but it was good enough.  He got up on stage to give a couple of awards tonight and I was reminded of why I used to have such a big crush on him.  It's interesting how things change, but not quite as much as you imagined.  Anyway, summer will be fun with Abby and Fifer. It was some crazy mad fun tonight.  We watched the Fall Out Boy DVD and Abby started hitting me and was all, "I missed you so much!"  Reminds me of Sarah in that way.  Speaking of Sarah, the party last night was great.  There were about 16 of us TAMSters there, and it was interesting.  We all played soccer and catchphrase and guesstures.  When 1:00 rolled around, we were just sitting and talking and such.  We all fell asleep on Naomi's living room floor at around 4:00.  I realized that I will miss Chris a whole lot next year.  He is just one of the most interesting people I have ever met.  And he's a good guy as well.  I'll miss Zahir as well.  And Betsy, of course.  I think everybody else at the party was a soon-to-be Senior.  But yeah, it was great fun.  The most fun I have ever had at a party, probably.  Man, I feel like I have rambled on too much, and I need to go to sleep.  I am tres tired.  I thought once school was out, I would get more sleep but so far this hasn't been the case.  Lisa

      I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.  I trekked out to Denton today to get my transcript and the signature I needed to take TCC classes this summer.  My GPA is now officially a 3.7.  Goodbye hopes of getting into Harvard :(.  And Columbia.  Oh well.  I suppose there is still hope :).  I was in Roberta Key's office, turning in my room key that I had lost the day we moved out, and she decided to give me a thirty-minute lecture on why  Scoop  sucks and what I should do to improve it next year.  She kept showing me the April issue and I kept telling her that the rest of the new staff and I did not do that issue, but I don't think it got through to her.  It started raining on the way back to my car.  I was soaked.  Visibility was at zero a few times on the way back to Arlington.  I don't think I have ever driven in such heavy rain before.  The rest of my day was spent going to Arlington Medical Center to apply for a volunteer position and eating a steak dinner at Naomi's house.  Then I had to move couches and such for her party tomorrow.  It is going to be holla holla.  I got to make some mixes, which is like my favorite thing to do for people.  They have a good number of radio songs though, but only because at a party there needs to be songs playing that everybody knows.  Man, Will from  Will and Grace  is hott.  Anyway, I was listening to Something Corporate tonight and I realized that I miss having a boy.  But I don't want the ones that are interested in me right now.  Quite the conundrum.  Why do some cities have to be six hours away?  The future freaks me out.  Lisa

      "Do you miss it?" my mom asked me this morning, as we dropped off my little brother at Summit.  I said no, of course.  But, as I watched everyone walk into the building with three minutes to spare, trying to find the motivation to make it through another eight hours of the torture that is high school, I knew that I did.  Maybe it isn't that I miss high school, but that I regret not knowing what my last two years could have been.  I picked up my mom from her school later on in the day, and as I was walking through the parking lot, I remembered how every day last year I had to walk from Summit to her school after tennis was over, and how I used to spend that time of the day to think about things and people.  And then Fifer brought her yearbook over to my house because they just got them today, and as I flipped through the pages, I looked at the last page of Junior faces and noted how this was the first year since Fifth grade that my face hasn't been next to Tyler Waterman's.  I looked at the Tennis Page and the UiL page...and it was just weird seeing my absense...I could still be doing these things and be great at them.  I could still be hanging out with those people and being close to them.  I could be heading up The Jagwire next year maybe...I dunno...it is just weird is all.  I watched The Breakfast Club today and it just made me think about all these things.  Summer seems so weird when no one is home with whom to hang out.  Lisa

We don't like him either."  And so commenced a weekend of Bush-bashing whenever politics came up.  Woot.  My grandma wanted me and my cousin Elisabeth, who is 16, to bond so she made her go to Wal-Mart with me.  It was so incredibly awkward the whole time.  I tried to make conversation and such since we will both be Seniors next year, but she is so...difficult to carry on a conversation with.  I listened to a lot of music on the way back.  Against Me, AntiFlag, Bouncing Souls, Bright Eyes (I didn't get past the first part of my CD case :P)...I heart music.   Anyway, I'm off job hunting tomorrow.    Lisa

      Fishboy is hardcore.  I am amazed at his musical genius.  And his drummer's  Psycho -esque antics for Mother's Day.  The TaDas were really good too.  We were talking to the guy afterwards and he was talking about how one time people were playing scrabble during his show.  It was pretty funny.  The show was at this little bar in Denton Square and there were maybe 20 or 25 people there to see it.  I have decided that small shows are my favorite.  But, anyway, yeterday was so crazy.  I had to write two essays and put together my portfolio before 1:00, which took like three hours, and then Naomi and I had to clean our room spotlessly.  We used so many chemicals and spilled Goop-Off (or turpentine, as David likes to call it) all over our floor to mop with it and people could smell it all the way from the staircase.  We didn't get checked out until around 4:00 and it took an hour and a half to get home.  So we didn't leave to go back to Denton until around 6:40 and we were about thirty minutes late for graduation.  I am sad that I missed Zahir's speech.  But it was cool.  All of the colleges they are going to amaze me.  The Prom King and Queen are going to MIT and Harvard, respectively.  What other high school can say that?  Anyway, after that we went to the place Fishboy was playing, only to find that the first band didn't go on until 10:30 or so, so Vanessa and I went and got food and then came back to see the last two bands.  Great show.  Afterwards, Naomi wanted to go watch a movie with David, Bruce Hall President and her pseduo-"We really like each other and hang out 24/7 but aren't together"-boyfriend.  We were with two other people so it was ok, but then they both left, and so it was really awkward.  Well, I take that back.  It was awkward before they left, because the only person I knew was Naomi and she was laying on David's top bunk with him the whole time.  But I did get to see When Harry Met Sally, which I had been wanting to see for a long time.  Very interesting...really does get me thinking...  Anyway, Naomi and I drove back around 3:00, and I had to keep her from falling asleep at the wheel, but there was no way I was going to stay the night in David's room.    Ok, now it is off to my grandmother's house for the weekend.  Have fun at Summit's Prom!!  Lisa

      It's the little moments that make the whole thing worth while.  Everyone has their good qualities and their own quirkiness.  I'm glad I got to know the people I got to know this semester.  Especially a certain few of them.  I think that the summer will be a pause in the relationships, but it won't be the end of them, and it won't make them any worse.  I think that in four months we'll pick up where we left off, and have an absolutely awesome Senior year.    I had a lot of little moments today.  Oh, look, I am getting all tearful and nostalgic.  I wonder how bad it will be a year from now.  :)  Lisa

      So I think that this morning I had my first test anxiety/panic attack ever.  It was so scary, I was looking down at the numbers and it was like I was reading a foreign language or something.  Nothing made any sense.  I tried to focus my mind but it just wouldn't focus.  On a few problems, I just wrote down some random numbers because it felt like no matter how hard I thought about it, I couldn't get past the most elementary steps of thinking.  And I knew the stuff, it's not like it was because I wasn't prepared.  I just...I dunno what happened.  There goes my A in Calculus though.  That kinda sucks, I guess.  I am so mad at myself.  Now that I look back at the test I can see exactly what I was supposed to do.  But it is too late now.  So I was in there for three and a half hours and I probably failed.  Bleh.  I hate school.  Tonight is my last night here.  :(  I will miss everyone so much over the summer, and it will be sad when the seniors do not return next year.  Have a great summer, everybody.  Lisa

      Laura Simpson is deck.  I surprised Fifer today when I got home :P and then I bought a Hot Rod Circuit album from CD Warehouse for $7.  Yay.  It is amazingly good and it makes me happy inside.  And then we checked out Half Price books for a while, but I didn't get anything.  Then we chilled at the Pattersons with Jenn and watched the end of A Knight's Tale.  I forget what else I did.  Adam Stepinski gave a showing of the film he made today.  It was so good, he should be a filmmaker.  I want him to make me a copy but I have to go get a DVD-R.  I realized for the first time today just how attractive he is.  I should've gotten to know him better :).  But he graduates in two days, so I guess that is the end of that.  We played volleyball tonight and such but it wasn't that great.  I told Christina I would put an all-nighter with her tonight and study calculus with her.  I only have to make an 81 on my final!!  Isn't that exciting?  I thought so.  So, I won't get to see some people for a whole four months.  Heh.  One in particular.  Oh well.  I guess we have 8 months left together after summer.  Ciao Lisa

      Pet Peeve of the Day:  People who think they're bad ass.  And then brag about it.  I want to go hooooooome already.  Saturday and Sunday I went out of my room for an approximate total of four hours.  And I still don't think I got As on my finals.  Oh well.  The worst of it is over.  I hope I never have to take a biology or chemistry course ever again.  Thursday is my last final - Calculus.  Which should also be a very difficult test.  I think my average in that class is like...a 91 or something.  So I just have to get an 87 on the final.  I think I should be able to do that.  Hopefully.  If not, my GPA is going to absolutely suck this semester.  Yesterday, after the biology and chemistry finals (bleh), I got to go thrifting with Sarah and Katie and Christina.  I got three new shirts and they are holla holla.  I also got six books from this one place.  Over all, I spent about eight dollars.  Fun stuff.  Then I went and saw Mean Girls with Hanna and Megan and Terra and Meena and Naomi.  I found it extremely ironic that we saw a movie about "The Plastics" with the three "Plastics" of TAMS (Hanna, Megan, Terra).  But they are not mean like the girls in the movie...at least not that I know of.  Anyway, the movie was mildly amusing.  Tim Meadows is really funny and the main character actress was pretty cool I suppose.    I paid my housing balance today.  $1,706.83.  Handing over that much money was...difficult.  Admittedly, only $200 of it was money that I earned, but still...I only have $50 in my bank account now.  Need a job...will get one soon.  Lisa

      Here's to the night -  So here I am, at 2:27 AM, writing this.  The internet is shut off by now by the way, so this is on Word.  I was going to just read biology until I drifted off to sleep but thoughts kept running through my mind so I thought it best to write them out.  What a strange but wonderful world we live in.  The night began when Naomi and I went and ate lunch with Ryan and Kyle, an interesting pair to say the least.  The more I hang out with them, the more I like them, in a completely platonic way of course, but they are just so cool.    Then Rebecca, Betsy, and I took Rebecca's car to the parking garage because she thought it was going to hail and we drove around in the garage listening to really loud music.  She used the pillars as cones and swerved in and out of them.  It was so fun.  We were sitting there in the car, waiting for the song to be over, and Betsy was just like, "This is so surreal."  Then we climbed onto the roof of the building next to us and just laid there staring at the sky and talking.  Rebecca and I told Betsy how much we were going to miss her next year.  And it's true.  TAMS just won't be the same without my Betsy Liu :).  Then the police officers made us get down and tried to threaten us.  That was pretty amusing.  We have decided to take a three-day-long road trip this summer.  It will be interesting.  When I got back to my room, Tyler invited me to go watch a movie with him and Chintan and Kelli and Vanessa and Sarah so I did that.  The movie was Better Luck Tomorrow - a movie that hit too closely to home with smart Asians who are trying to get into Ivy Leagues and try to beef up their applications with all this stuff and then they get into some bad stuff and end up killing a guy.  Quite disturbing at some parts.  Not really one of my favorites, but it was interesting.  Then we all went down to the Farewell Dance.  TAMS dances are always the most interesting.  I can't dance for crap but I still do goofy moves and everybody laughs at me.  But it's all good.  I got to slow dance with the person I wanted to dance with, as well as six other guys.  As Naomi says, it feels like 8th grade all over again.  When they played Lean on Me, it was amazing.  Everybody in the room got in this big circle with their arms around each other for the first verse and sang along.  Then we all just started clapping and free-styling, and man it was great.  At one point in the night, Kelli, Naomi, Kyle, Kenny, and I all went for a walk.  I love those kids.  They are all so great.  After the dance, a bunch of us were trying to get something to eat and ended up going four different places.  Good times.  I feel content.  I am glad that I have moved on.  I am glad that he probably has to.  Because I really click with someone else, and it's a good feeling.  Here's to the night we felt alive.  Lisa

      Monday and Tuesday I was sent home early from work because of all this damn rain.  Yesterday after I was sent home, the park flooded apparently and they had to shut it down.  I didn't experience any of the mad flooding because Spain drained all the water pretty well.  I have had nothing to do without work though, which is kinda sad I guess.    I was going to go experience the Alex Atchley Experience tonight but due to unforeseen plans that involve three kids that I love to death, their parents having to go to the hospital, and me wanting to do the right thing by helping them out, I think I will have to forego the experience for tonight.  Perhaps another day, though.  Last night I went to Naomi's for a bit and we collaborated on the TAMS Dating Article for the Junior Survival Guide and then planned out our trip for the second time.  It works a lot better now.  And now there are more colleges we are looking at.  I think it is...Harvard, Boston U, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, U Penn, and Johns Hopkins.  Plus a day of just hanging out in New York.  And I get to see a Broadway show.  Much excitement, yes?  Anyway, 8 days away from here.  I shant be able to wait.

      College seems to be on everybody's mind, including mine.  My father and I had a chat about college today.  He doesn't want me to go 2,000 miles away (even though he knows he can't stop me) but if I do, he wants me to go to MIT.  And he keeps pushing this medical profession at me.  He thinks that since I am so "smart" or whatever that I should become a doctor.  Hence the MITness.  Even though I can get a good pre-med education at any of the places I am applying, if I so wished.  I dread college apps in the fall.  I know that my credentials are probably mildly impressive...but I don't know exactly how impressive.  And I don't know how big of a role my essays will play into admissions...or those Bs I got last semester (I keep telling myself that it is ok because they were the first Bs of my...entire...life, but I dunno)  I just keep thinking about how if I don't get to go somewhere away from here, it will be sad for me, because I have looked forward to it for so long.  So my mom is out of town until Wednesday and my brother isn't home right now and my dog is barking so I am somewhat creeped out.  I don't like being home alone.  I feel like I should be having a super teen party.  Too bad I am apparently not a partier.  Oh well.  Melee is awesome.  They should be the soundtrack to my life.

      All in all I'd say it was a pretty fine day.  Melee, Flogging Molly, Taking Back Sunday, and the Bouncing Souls made the rain and the sharp pains in my neck from people landing on my head all worthwhile.  True, I would rather see them at a smaller show, at some venue in Deep Ellum, but I'll take what I can get ::refrains:: ah, fuck it.  As long as it's from you.  I went with Sarah, Naomi, and Fifer and I ran into Katy, Chintan, Kyle, Vanessa, and Kelli.  Fun stuff.  So then we all ate at Naomi's and had a CD burning party kindof.  I love how people that first meet bond over making fun of me.  So, man, I've been talking to a lot of people online and it's crazy the different...conversations...and things you say...and relationships you have with people...and i don't even know.  I think I should stop thinking now.  And start living.  Or sleeping.  Yes, I am rather tired.  I shall go sleep now.

      I would just like to point out how incredibly stupid the human race is sometimes.  Anyway, without further explanation, this week has been good.  After the craziness that was Monday, on Tuesday I met some kid named Byron and got to hang out with him and Fifer.  Wednesday, I found out that my eyes have gotten worse by .25 on each eye and then I drove all the way to Granbury to hang out with Rebecca for five or six hours.  She should feel special.  It takes exactly one-fourth of a tank of gas to go to Granbury and back.  Today I chilled with Naomi down by the pool and we had some margaritas and then I ate dinner with Fifer and then I did a little babysitting for about four or five hours.  $20 for watching movies and eating chocolate pudding.  Joy.  Apparently, they were really amazed with how I kept the house clean and the children peaceful.  When we were watching Pirates of the Carribbean and it was at the part when it shows all the pirate fighting in their ghost forms or whatever, Tyler, 4, and Austin, 6, were all like, "I'm not scared, Lisa...are you scared?" as they huddled together on the arm chair.  I was like, "Y'all can come sit over here with me if you want." and they were like, "Thank you!" and scrambled for a spot next to me.  Aww.  But that doesn't mean I ever want children.  Nope.  Double shift tomorrow but Warped Tour on Saturday.  Everybody get ready to rock...out.

      Some things are only for the priveleged to know.  Last night...completed the four nights in a row of surrealism.  If that makes any sense.  I wish I could write a big long blog about it, but I think it might somehow diminish the experience.  Let's just say...Kenny and I were gonna go see the Decemberists but we couldn't get in because he couldn't prove he was 17 so then we had to think of things to do.  Which ended up with cop cars and trespassing and disorderly conduct and such.  Shh.  It's a secret.  That I am posting on the internet for all to read.  Cafe Brazil, The Terminal...back to Denton...sleep.  Wake up at 6:45, coffee, leave for Arlington.  Last night was one of the most unique and fun experiences of my life.  Haha.  Want details?  Talk to me later, fools.

      Sooooo I just got home.  Yes, it is 7:00 AM.  Yes, I have to be at work at 9:00.  Yes, when Will and Alex found that out, they thought I was crazy for going with them, but eh, oh well.  Tonight was kind of surreal.  Katie and Christina came down from Denton to go to the Chomsky show with us (me, Fifer, Caty (sp?)) because they had never been to a rock concert before and they wanted someone with experience to go with them (me).  Haha.  We get there and who else is playing on the second stage but Dilitante, the band from Mansfield that I have heard so much about.  And who is there to see them but EVERYBODY I KNOW.  Haha jk.  But seriously.  Ryan Fan, Shea, Robert Rowe, Shayne, Alex, Heather...that whole group.  Eventually, I am told Ryan (Essex) showed up, but I didn't see him.  It was crazy how we didn't even plan to run into all of these people and then we...did.  Dilitante's set was like an hour and a half and they were really good.  Really mellow and chillaxy.  When we went to the mainstage after that, Henry Holt was still on, and we didn't get to see Chomsly until around 11:00.  I dunno how long they played for, but they were pretty effing amazing.  Crazy guy was...crazy, insane...the lead singer was awesome.  The whole band rocked.  I could really make a habit of seeing Chomsky live.  After the show, we were walking out and the lead singer came up behind me randomly and was just like, "Hey, thanks for watching.  I caught you watching us, so thanks for watching Chomsky."  and I was just like, "Oh..er..yeah, your welcome?...you guys were awesome!"  ::shakes hand::  lol.  It was interesting.   We didn't get back to Arlington untli around 1:00, at which point we proceeded to Denny's for dinner and ended up finding Will, #3, and Terra.  Later we were joined by Alex (not Atchley) and #2, who both decided to sit and talk with us the whole time.  It was quite, quite funny. There were make out sessions (well, pseudo-ones) and water being spilt on laps and drawings of..things.  Haha.  Lots o fun.   Then they all decided to go ghosthunting again, and I, having heard all these stories about it, wanted to go.  In hindsight, I should've just not gone after I found out none of the four I came with were going, but oh well.  Anyhow, So I dropped all them off and went back to Denny's where it was decided to meet at Will's apartment.  Alex said he would ride with me but he wanted to go get his CDs or something first.  So...we are in the car, right, driving down Cooper, and he's all, "So, I will probably never see you again."  and I said something about how I wanted to go see AAE sometime, so maybe I would, and he said something like, "Well, I don't think I am gonna see you for a long time so I should just get this out right now. [dramatic pause] I am attracted to you."  Me: ...ok.  Him:  Sorry if that makes things awkward right now.  Me: No, no, it's ok.  ::awkward silence that lasts for like two minutes::  Me:  So, what kind of music do you like?  Aw man, talk about your awkward conversations.  No offense or anything to him, but I am in no way attracted to him.  Soo...I didn't really know what to say.  I don't really remember exactly what I said, I hope I didn't say thank you or anything.    We went to Will's apartment, which is like, everything you would dream a punk rocker's apartment would look like, and then Will and Danny and Alex all rode in my car to the River Legacy Park with the other three in another car.  Apparently, I know nothing about the real underground, by the way.  I didn't even know there was a genre called Industrial until a few hours ago.  We had to listen to this crappy fusion of techno and death metal all night (morning).  Ugh.  Oh well.  I guess I am a tolerant person.  I had to explain to everyone why I am not going to stop being someone's friend just because they are a conservative.  All we did for two hours was just hike some paths in the park.  Everyone was trying to make it seem really creepy, but I am not an easy person to creep out, so I was pretty unentertained for the most part, although the company could be quite hilarious at times.  I was quiet for the most part, partly because I was so tired and partly because I am always quiet around a lot of people I do not know very well.  There were some good times.  By the time I dropped off Will and Danny, I was exhausted and when I told them I had to work at 9, they both said they felt bad, but I said it was my decision, so don't feel bad (I hate pity).  So, yeah, I think I am gonna go try to find my mom's "Stay Awake" pills and take a shower now.  I should be ok at work.  Then I will sleep right afterwards until I have to wake up to go to the movies with Ryan and Naomi.  Ciao peoples.

      I should have told him I liked his shoes.  It seems to work for Connor Oberst.    "Thanks, can I follow you?"   Why, you sure can.    Anyhow.  The show tonight was good.  The music was excellent.  New band I saw called the pits were very unique and good.  Still Standing was fun, of course.  Shut Up Agnes was fun.  Shayne is sexy.  A Faith Called Chaos was pretty good.  Letter Twelve was...AMAZING.  As usual.  I will never get tired of hearing them.  I'll take what I can get, as long as it's from you.  How true.  People show up in my Door and then are all nice and stuff so that I can't hate them.  What the hell?  Stupid boy.  I met Charly.  So nice and cute.  We had a nice conversation before the Letter Twelve set.  He was there by himself, very sad.  Am glad I met him.  He plays for Clover St. so I am gonna go see him and Ben and Willie and the rest of the gang play July 9th.  Interesting night I think.

      So the last couple of days have been interesting.  Yesterday after work I met Abby and Fifer at Cheddar's and ate they're left over fries and whatnot.  Mmm free food.  And then we just sat around at the park, talking and swinging and catching/naming frogs and such.  It was all very cool.  I think the park was the favorite time of my evening.    Then me and Abby went back to my place to eat ice cream and Will called her or something so we met up with him and Travis and Ricky and this girl that I don't remember the name of and we all sat around Denny's for a while and then went dumpster diving at some places like krispie kreme and barnes & nobles.  Then I watched Travis and Will spray paint some stuff on this Barnes & Nobles place.  And then he wrote "Objectify women?" under the drivers window of this giant Hooters bus.  That was pretty brilliant, if I do say so myself.  The rest of the...early morning...was spent chilling in the Kroger parking lot, watching Ricky trying to smoke anything he could find, and then watching Travis and Ricky throw firecrackers out onto the street while we were driving. It was all so very punk rock, haha.  The evening was accompanied by a very excellent soundtrack of bands like the refused, the weakerthans, the (international) noise conspiracy, and other various punk bands.  Good times.  I want Will's CD collection. It was an interesting night, to say the least.  Anyhow.  I didn't get home until around 5 or something so I got like 2 1/2 hours of sleep before my shift this morning.    Today at work we had to shut down temporarily because of weather when it started storming and raining.  There was this group of guys that came under the Queue line with me when it started raining and started talking to me.  They were all so very nice and funny and the one that talked to me the most was so very cute.  He had this little green polo shirt on.  I was just getting into a good conversation with them when Matt had to come and tell them that they were not allowed to wait in the Queue line. :(.  Haha oh well.  I really want a nice, sweet guy by the way.  Have I ever mentioned that?  The guy today was just...so nice.  ::Sigh::  I went home after that and then went and saw The Stepford Wives with Fifer and Abby and Kelly.  The movie was mediocre at best, but it had it's funny parts.  Particularly the part with Viggo.  Ahahahahaha.  I laughed so hard at that part.  Then me and Fifer just chilled for a while and ate a lot.  She had to go home at like 9 and then Amy called me so I went and hung out at her house for a while and attempted to watch Moulin Rouge but since I am running on about 2 hours of sleep or whatever, I had trouble staying awake.  And now I think I shall go sleep because I am tired and do not have to work tomorrow.  Woo!!

      Wow, today I realized for the first time how much it really does suck that even though I promised myself I would, I haven't remained close to a good majority of my Arlington friends.  I haven't done much of anything except work the past few days because after work, I don't really have anyone to call except for a few people, who are usually busy.  I dunno.  Naomi was telling me about orientation and how she met a guy that loves MCS (probably not as much as me haha but oh well) and this other guy that likes good music and she picked them out to be our tadpoles for Frog Night and I started thinking about TAMS and it just blew my mind how it has only been a month since I left for the summer and already it seems so very far away.  It's like...this whole other world...and I dunno...it's just weird.  The life I lead here and the one I lead when I am living up in Denton are two very completely different lives.  I think that our Senior year will be really great...hopefully, it is anyway.

      SLC Punk really is a great, great movie.  I was looking through all my old pictures and scrapbooks and "common place" books today.  It was pretty interesting.  Nostalgia is...bittersweet.  Tomorrow I am supposed to work 16 hours.  I think I may die.  I hope I can get out of the last few hours.

      I can only describe seeing Cursive live tonight as indescribable.  They were absolutely amazing.  Beyond anything I had imagined.  Tonight was definitely one of the best shows I have ever been to.  Mike Park was great.  He is awesome.  I didn't enjoy Planes Mistaken for Stars, but they were ok I suppose.  Anyone that plays for Plea for Peace has got to be pretty A-Ok guys.  Saul Williams spoke with the conviction of an evangelist but the principles of a liberal activist...he also was also amazing.  I enjoyed his poetry oh so much and he was so inspiring!  And funny!  Man, I enjoyed the entire show, especially Mike and Saul and CURSIVE!!  Haha Cursive did a cover of the milkshake song and totally turned it emo.  It was so great.  I also saw Kelli there.  Oh, and I saw Colin, Shayne, and Alex.  And I bought a shirt.  I'm off to sleep now.

      So I just got home...  Today at work it was raining so all we did was wax bobsleds and talk.  It was pretty cool.  I got to leave around 11:30.  Woo.  All I did with my day after that was watch these random TV movies about a guy that was trying to invent a computer to sell for $99 and a black guy who wanted to become a doctor and finally did at the end of the movie.  Then I don't know what I did but around 9, Naomi called and I went over to her house.  We planned our trip which will most certainly be going down July 7th-13th. Unless I decide not to take a class during the Summer II's.  Anyhow.  Wednesday- arrive/Harvard, Thursday- Boston University, Friday- Columbia, Saturday- U Penn, Sunday- Sightseeing in DC, Monday- Johns Hopkins, Tuesday- Yale/catch our flight back home.  We will be hitting a total of six states, if you count DC as a state.  This will double the amount of states I have been to in my entire life.  I am very very excited.  Yay!  Actually, 7 because on our way to Connecticut we have to go through New Jersey.  Wow.  Seven states.  In seven days.  Oh my god, I just came up with the title for my book.  Haha just joking.  I am just very excited is all.  Naomi got tired and wanted to go to bed so I left and called back Fifer who had called me earlier and they informed me that they were scheming so I had to go join them.  Then me and Abby and her drove two hours to Czech Stop for some kolaches and then two hours back.  I fell asleep, but it was still fun.  We are some hardcore kids and mmm those kolaches are oh so good.  So Cursive is tomorrow (er...today, actually :P)!!  Everybody get excited.

      My new name is {{{{{    'GREGARIOUS-EXECUTIONER'    }}}}}    , apparently.  My first act as a Ludo Ninja is to tell all you people out there that read this to check them out.  That's right.  Check out the "rock explosion that is Ludo."  They are a quirky, nerd, punk band that is hilarious as ef.  Their live show is amazing and their CD is great as well.  So, everyone go to http://www.ludorock.com and check out some of their mp3s.  :P  Anyway, today there was lots of chillage with Fifer and we tortured James at his work and left him a ticket for $5,000 for being "the gayest straight man alive."  We were just kidding though.  And then we drove around randomly and listened to some Death Cab.  Mm...good stuff.    I have officially given up on guys.  But it's ok, for real.  I am just gonna go watch some TV now until around midnight at which point I will probably fall asleep and then have to wake up to another day of work.  Have you ever felt nostalgic for something you haven't ever had?

      Upon further consideration, Matt isn't a bastard at all.  In fact, despite his tendency to try to show off to Nick after work sometimes, he is an A-Ok guy.  The word A-Ok...that reminds me of two things.  1) MCS's song.  2)  During the school year when Kenny said that he always insulted me because he thought I was A-Ok, which I never completely understood.  Anyhow.  Today was a long adventure full of Dallas and getting lost a block away from our destination.  Good Records is deck.  I had never been to a real record store before.  CD Warehouse, Hot Topic, Best Buy, and Hastings were the only places I had really been, and I would be hard pressed to find as many good cds those places as I did at this place.  It was amazing.  I got to listen to Broken Social Scene and the album of the Decemberists that I hadn't gotten to listen to yet.  Both were superb.  I am definitely gonna have to see the Decemberists when they are here.  I will have to find someone to go with, though...  Then we went to some vintage store that was kinda dumb and then we went to the tattoo parlor because we are just that cool.  Deck.  Anyway, work was at 4 but I got to go home early at 9 because of the Phase 3 lightning.  Yay for lightning.  Edward Scissorhands is an excellent movie.  I watched it for the first time in years today.  I think I enjoyed the movie a lot because I relate to Edward so much.  Everything I touch dies.  Hrm.  But seriously, the loneliness and such...yes.  That movie definitely goes in the top ten.  Or at least 15.  I dunno.  There are a lot of good movies.  Oh, yeah!  I accidentally flipped a guy off at work today on purpose.  But it was behind his back, don't worry.  I don't wanna get fired or anything.  Some people are so rude.  Don't let the bastards be your master.

      I almost cried at work today.  Which is weird.  The one thing I hate more than anything in the world is crying in front of people.  I didn't actually start crying, but as hard as I tried to keep my poker face, I think everybody saw through it.  I was going on my 13th hour and the whole day had been pretty crappy.  I found myself spacing out more than usual.  Anyway, so 13 hours + boredom + unhappiness = me spacing out.  I was confused with whether or not I was supposed to hold my gate because Clinton told me to but Matt said to open it and then I did and then Matt yelled at me for opening it, in front of everyone, which didn't help the situation any.  I was so angry.  Mad with him.  But for some reason instead of getting mad, I just felt all hurt and stuff and god, I almost started crying at work.  The guest I was loading in the bobsled was trying to reassure me and was all, "It's alright, don't let him get to you."  Matt apologized after close, so he isn't a complete bastard.  14 hours is entirely too long for me to work.  I am dead.  I feel dead.  I can't feel my feet anymore, though.  Time for some cheese enchiladas.

      Lead Singer:  Well, if Ohio is for lovers, then what is Texas for? Crowd:  ::mumbles:: Abby:  SEX!!  Good times, good times.  Texas is for sex.  I should make a shirt.  Along with my moog shirts and "Your mom is for lovers" shirt.  I have a lot of shirts to make.  Hawthorne Heights is the shit.  Or the crap.  Whichever you prefer.  I got a button and two comments on my "Fall Out Boy is for lovers" shirt from two very attractive guys.  Mmm...I fall in love too easily.  I have like thirty future husbands.  Ohh well.  Emery was cool, they had a moog and the moog player was juicy.  He had a cute little hat and a polo shirt, worn emo...er excuse me...I mean  hardcore  style.  Because emo and hardcore are  not  one and the same.  ::coughs::  Oh well, labels are dumb anyway.  I didn't  really  mean the comment about if Ludo are not sellouts, they will consider playing for Abby in August.  If they do, though, I better see all you bitches there.  And I mean that in the nicest way possible.  Ahem, where was I?  Oh yes.  Alexisonfire was ok.  I think they are way overrated though.  Silverstein was last and they were good, but my favorites of the night would have to be Hawthorne Heights.  Good stuff.  We should never let James drive to Dallas ever again.  Hey, if anyone wants to go to the Pedro the Lion show, please tell me so that I have someone to go with.  Same with the Decemberists on the 21st.  I will call Kelli, I suppose.  Oh, and if anyone wants to drive to Austin with me on July 14th to see Fall Out Boy who I will miss in Dallas because I will be on the east coast (holla holla) July  7th-13th checking out colleges, then tell me as well.  I can't miss my Fall Out Boy.  That would be unoffice.  Undeck.  FIN.  Anyway, I must go now and finish reading Hitchhiker's Guide...I have a ways to go and Fifer wants her book back.

      I was waiting for a cross-town train in the london underground when it struck me that I've been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound like a movie.  So I changed my plans and rented a camera and a van and then I called you.  "I need you to pretend that we are in love again" and you agreed to.  I greased the lens and framed the shot using a friend as my stand-in. The script, it called for rain but it was clear that day so we faked it.  The marker snapped and I yelled, "Quiet on the set," and then called "Action!"  Then I kissed you in a style that Clark Gable would have admired.  I thought it classic.  I want so badly to believe that there is truth, that love is real.  And I want life in every word to the extent that it's absurd  I know you're wise beyond your years, but do you ever get the fear that your perfect verse is just a lie you tell yourself to help you get by?  Your perfect verse is just a lie you tell yourself to help you get by.

      Well APPARENTLY its MY fault that my dumb bank didn't post my 100$ deposit that I made Friday morning and now my mom is pissed that my bank account that she wants to use does not have enough money for her to buy George Jones tickets because she does not have her own bank account because of some bitch named Elise.  I don't understand things.  Anyway, tonight was crazy.  Tornado and such.  I was at Amy's house and the power was out for a good twenty minutes, but it was all good.  I got to bathe Heather in a bucket.  It felt like Little House on the Prairie or something.  Bye.

      Sooo I am done writing about all those silly boys.  All it is is drama, drama, drama, anyhow.  Love is just a game.  mua hahaha.  Moulin Rouge:1 Lisa's love life: 0.  I don't understand either.  I think I am just typing for the hell of it at the moment.  So yesterday I got to clean out the fountains by Conquistador and got  $7  in coins.   And then I gave Hendric a ride home and he gave me  $3  for gas.  I am rolling in the money.  Today, work felt like it would never end.  Mindi is like a little clone of Jennifer now.  It is ever so annoying.  God, four more days and I am free!!   And finally, I figured out how to access my old files on my computer, which means good music and a new picture on myspace.  I am listening to the mix Betsy made me right now.  It makes me happy inside.  Tomorrow I get to see Betsy.  Hopefully her father will let her go this time.  We are gonna go check out Planofest and then maybe steal a sign or two later on in the night/early morning.  I expect I shall be having more fun than you.

      Ahhhhh- my Jets to Brazil cd just got here!!!&nbsp; And I am listening to it!!&nbsp; And it is excellent!!  "In the summer you'll really know.&nbsp;&nbsp;You're the only summer that&nbsp;I think I'll ever know.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'll keep trying to find you somewhere smiling over me, over you, over me."  Because of music, long drives during the orange glow of sunset, and advice from&nbsp;a certain friend&nbsp;with humorous anecdotes and well-made points, I think I am feeling considerably better, more adventuresome, and less inclined to be shy.  Aaron texted me tonight: "Leeessaaa, whats up.&nbsp; I dunno either.&nbsp; Oh yeah this is aaron if ya didnt know.&nbsp; Anyways, i broke up with my gf for good this time i think.&nbsp; I'll tell you about it lata."  Well, I am ready to give something a shot.&nbsp; Like I have said before, so refreshing it is for a guy to be making some kind of move.&nbsp; But, as I have resolved tonight, I am going to be making some moves before long.&nbsp; If I can adhere to my resolution.&nbsp;   I still...feel somewhat disappointed by the way things turned out with the other boy.&nbsp; But I guess I will deal with my feelings&nbsp;concerning that subject in about a month.&nbsp; For right now, I am determined to have some fucking fun already.

      Absolutely fucking nothing.   I don't really know what else to say.&nbsp; I think I am just mad with myself at the moment.   If he liked me, he would've done something by now.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp; A word, a held hand, a fucking kiss goodnight.&nbsp; But no.   No no no no no no non nononononononononononoinooooooo.   You just don't understand what it's like to be  this  close...and have nothing happen.&nbsp; It is the most frustrating feeling in the world.&nbsp; I. feel. like. violence.   Does he understand that I spent $14 on gas today, drove&nbsp;to Denton and back twice&nbsp;to pick him up and drop him off, just so that I could spend time with him?&nbsp; Because I don't think you usually do that for casual friends of the opposite sex.   I finally got out the question I wanted to ask him.&nbsp; "Do you remember the first time we met?"&nbsp; He, of course, did not.&nbsp; After telling him it was at IHOP that one time, I left it at that.&nbsp; What did I really want to say?   I wanted to say that I remember that night because it was the first time that I noticed a TAMS guy that I could be interested in.&nbsp; I wanted to say that I listened to him talk about how the Smurfs really lived in a facist community and I thought that he was the funniest guy ever.&nbsp; I wanted to say how that instigated a crush on him that I had the entire year, even before we started talking.&nbsp; I wanted to tell him that on the night of the Valentine's Dance, when he asked me to dance and we danced half of the night together, that it made me the happiest I have been since I cannot remember when.&nbsp; That I was riding a high for at least a week.&nbsp; I wanted to tell him that he is the closest I have been to a guy since...two years ago.&nbsp; I wanted to tell him that yes, I still have feelings for him, and yes, it would be nice to know whether or not he has feelings for me too.&nbsp; I wanted to say, "Just kiss me, damn it." and make the first move.&nbsp;   I just wanted to tell him I like him.   But I didn't.&nbsp; Eleven hours together today and I couldn't seem to make the words come.&nbsp; Other words came...yes, but nothing of real importance...like say, us.&nbsp; I think perhaps this is me just beginning to realize that maybe his crush on me ended with the school year and now he just sees me as one of his friends.&nbsp; Platonic.&nbsp; Friend.&nbsp; The concept is hard to swallow, but it may be what I am going to have to start to do.   I almost killed us on the way back to Denton because the roads were slick and I braked too fast and my car swerved out of control and we didn't stop until I swerved off the road into the grass...just a mere few feet from the median...   "Soo... you wanna spend the night at my dorm tonight?" because that's what I did the last time we didn't think I could drive home without killing myself.&nbsp; He&nbsp;was&nbsp;joking.&nbsp; Half-joking.&nbsp; Not joking at all?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; This time I didn't stay.   Then, "We have the greatest stories together."&nbsp; Yes, we do.&nbsp; Everything that we plan screws up, but we end up making things work.&nbsp; Well, except for one thing.   I had to call him when I got home to tell him I wasn't dead.&nbsp; "Goodnight, Lisa."&nbsp; It's always...kinda special to me when a guy says my name like that.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me.&nbsp; I guess I just am a sucker for any sort of attention they give me.   If he ever read this, which would be really awkward, he'd prolly just say something about how I am too emo for my own good.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; I am emo and who cares.  I feel dumb.&nbsp; And stupid.&nbsp; And dumb.&nbsp; I think I should just give up.&nbsp; And move on.

      This morning, as Aaron and I were filling up the water jugs for the rides, we got into a conversation about why he broke up with his girlfriend.&nbsp; Then he started telling me about a conversation with Rikki Ann in which he mentioned that it was all because of me.&nbsp; Then he went on to tell me about the rest of the conversation.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Of course, I misunderstood the conversation and didn't get what he was trying to tell me.  Me:&nbsp; So Rikki Ann thinks you like her? Him:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; She thinks I like you. Me:&nbsp; But you like her? Him:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I like you. Me:&nbsp; Oh...  But you&nbsp;got back together with&nbsp;your girlfriend?  Him:&nbsp; Yes...it's complicated.  All I can say is that it is very refreshing to have a guy tell me how he feels about me.&nbsp; I wish other certain people could pick up on this and tell me that they have liked me since February and that&nbsp;they think we should give something a shot.&nbsp; But, eh, he'll probably never get the balls to do it.&nbsp; Jk jk people.  Aaron and I had break together and he shared his fries and pizza with me.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; You know...it's funny...Aaron likes me despite the fact that every time he sees me, I'm in some crappy work uniform.&nbsp; Despite the fact that he's never seen me with makeup on, never seen me with my hair down.&nbsp; Despite the fact that I am a complete and total dork.&nbsp; As I said, it is quite refreshing.&nbsp; If he had asked me on a date while he and his girlfriend were still apart (apparently because of me), I would have gone on a date with him.&nbsp; Oh well.  In other news, I have been looking at all the applications for schools I've gotten in the mail recently.&nbsp; I didn't request them, but for some reason, I've been getting them.&nbsp;  I was looking at the ones for Harvard and Yale the other day and thinking about how my stuff will look on them.&nbsp; The University of Chicago's "Un-common Application" is by far the deckest application of them all.&nbsp; The essay options are hilarious.&nbsp; I might write about a giant jar of mustard.  &nbsp;

      It's funny how just one little thing can make your whole day better.   When I was on break, the guy that always clocks me in was there, and as I was leaving I accidentally dropped my cell phone into the trashcan.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; So I had to dig it out right in front of him and the people he was sitting with.&nbsp; Anyhow.   I got off about 45 minutes early, due to the tree branch that fell on Bobsled's track, and who did I run into right as I was leaving the park but him.&nbsp; He made this weird face at me and that made me smile really big at him so then he smiled and waved and I waved back.   It was a small gesture, but it made my day a little bit brighter, I suppose.&nbsp; After work, I chilled at my dad's til around 9:30.&nbsp; We actually got along and stuff, and he gave me the money for my plane ticket.&nbsp; It was weird.   Last night was pretty interesting.&nbsp; Betsy&nbsp;cancelled on me last minute because her dad was afraid of the impending thunderstorm so I had to call Naomi and we had to improvise.&nbsp; We made a couple of Jack Daniels fudge cakes and then went to get ice cream at Braum's.&nbsp; Then we took the ice cream into IHOP and then harrassed Jared for a while.&nbsp; It was great fun.&nbsp; He sat down with us even though he was working.&nbsp; Then Jacob and Zach (from Dilitante)&nbsp;and Alex showed up and they sat with us and we all talked for a while.&nbsp;  IHOP  is Mansfield's  Denny's .&nbsp; Then me and Naomi left for our movie.&nbsp; We were gonna see Fight Club at midnight but apparently that was only last week so we ended up seeing I Robot, which I thoroughly enjoyed even though I was expecting not to.&nbsp; The scenes of Will Smith with no shirt on did not hurt either.&nbsp; ;).   Anyway, as I was working on editing the articles for the Junior Survival Guide tonight, I started thinking about how weird it will be to go back to school in August.&nbsp; I feel so...far away from everyone.&nbsp; TAMS seems like a lifetime ago, but yet it feels like it was only yesterday at the same time.&nbsp; I've reconnected with so many people this summer, and made so many new friends...going back to TAMS will be strange.&nbsp; Mallory wants to do another issue of Three in Thirty before the summer is over and get Jacinda to distribute it.&nbsp; You know, there comes a point when it is healthy to let go.&nbsp; She is trying to tell me how to run Scoop as well.&nbsp; Urg.   I can't think of anything else to write.   &nbsp;

      You know, my mom is deaf in one ear.  I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before, but she is.  One day when she was a little girl she was cleaning out her right ear with a Q tip when she fell or something and...well, and then there was pain I suppose.  Sometimes when we are riding in the car or walking side by side I will be talking about something, sometimes important, and going on and on about it and then I'll ask her opinion and she won't say anything.  It's then that I look over and realize that she hasn't heard anything I've said in the past five minutes.  It's weird trying to imagine what it would be like to not be able to hear out of one ear.  I think there is something wrong with my ears.  They hurt...or itch...or something.  This is a new development.  I think I should probably go see a doctor or something.  I don't want to go deaf in one ear...or both.  Anyhow, I saw Identity the other day when I was babysitting for Wendi for nine hours.  It was a good movie.  I certainly didn't see it coming.  And after I babysat I got to see Jenn's new loft apartment.  It really is quite cool and cozy.  We chilled for a bit and then parted ways.  Last night Sarah and I went to see Braid w/ Panic in Detroit, Moneen, and Recover at the door.  All of the bands were good.  I enoyed PiD and Braid the most although Moneen was pretty crazy and Recover was quite excellent.  Travis was there along with four girls, two of whom were Rachel and Desiree so I talked to them for a bit and wanted to say hi to Travis but then realized that he probably does not know who I am.  I was so tired that I almost fell asleep at many times during the show because we were sitting upstairs despite the excellent music.  Anyway.  That is all.  I get to see Betsy tonight.  Woot.

      I was tired of my old template, I guess.  Maybe one day I will get un-lazy and make my own.  Until then...  I just got back from Denny's with Laura and Joe and Deanna and Will and Alex and two of the Joshes.  There were arguments of the correct pronunciation for the word wooooo or woOoOoO and Will showed everyone how he could stick his finger through his ear because of how big his gauge is and they were talking about ear odor.  And it was pretty hilarious.  Joe and Deanna were working on this crossword puzzle and me and Laura were helping them out.  After it was just Laura, me, Joe, and Deanna, Laura and I were reading the Dear Abby letters and omitting certain words that made it sound dirty and funny.  Good times were had by all.  I think it has been interesting this summer getting to hang out with all the scenesters.  They are all so very interesting and really very nice.  I guess back in the day I always just kind of knew who some of them were and didn't expect to ever really become friends with them.  It's cool.  I love just sitting in Denny's with them until the wee hours of the morning...just hanging out and being...young, I guess.  Hrm.  Yesterday I sat in Barnes and Nobles for an hour, listening to music.  I listened to a lot of stuff and it was all good, which makes it difficult to pick out which ones to buy.  However, while all of them were good, only a few stuck out to me as excellent, and I think I need to start saving up money to buy those CDs.  I really liked The Format and The Gloria Record.  There were some other good ones too, although I don't remember them at the moment.  When I left I noticed some hipster kid that was sitting next to me.  He was quite cute.  And tomorrow I get to babysit and then maybe go play frisbee in the park with Jennifer...?  I hope it's not like...a youth group thing.  And then I may go to Laura's house.  But she has to ask her mom first.  Her dad is out of town.  I am devious, I am.

      I have decided that I have crushes on the weirdest, most random people ever.  For instance, today I discovered that I have a crush on the guy that clocks me in every morning.  Sure, we have barely said anything to each other save for the occasional "Hi", smile, and wave, but nevertheless I find myself anticipating that time around 8:53 every morning when I will scan my ID and he will press some buttons on the computer and look at me and give me some kind of greeting while my timeslip prints out.  One day, he even said more to me.  As I was leaving he said, "Have a good day." and I said, "Ok.  I will." and he said, "And if it's not a good day, make it one."    I think that means we're in love.  My three-day-long trip was pretty cool.  Mississippi was kinda...boring.  I guess Alabama was too.  But I am convinced that no one in Jackson eats or uses gas to fuel their cars.  My mother and I spent half an hour trying to find a restaurant and ended up having to get on the high way to another city to eat.  There were a couple of fast food places, but nothing else!  We also went to this blues cafe that was supposed to be a happenin' place in town but we made up half of the people that were there...but we did get to see Ironing Board Sam play a few songs and then he handed out his biography to everyone.  That guy is hardcore.    Alabama was pretty boring as well.  We saw my brother's drum corps perform though, along with seven other corps.  It was all very entertaining.  Oh, and before we went to their rehearsal and I got to see 128 young strapping boys aged 16-22 shirtless and marching around the field playing their instruments.  Sexy.  I fell on the stadium stairs during rehearsal and there were like ten people sitting in the stands so everyone saw and after rehearsal was over one of the shirtless boys walking in my direction asked if I was ok.  Why, yes, yes I am.  Happens all the time.  The riding in the car part was pretty cool.  We stopped at an outlet book store and got a book on tape.  Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes, which is a collection of short stories.  They were pretty good.  9 1/2 hours of listening to that and then some of sleeping and 2 of listening to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine.  Also got some good music listening in.  I heart The Shins.  They are great.  And some reading.  I am well on my way to being finished with the Douglas Adams collection.  Anyway, I got back last night with no plans for the next two weeks.  The only thing I know is that I need to work as much as possible and save as much money as possible so that I am able to buy that ibook after I get back from my trip on August 16th.  $739 is what it is going to cost me.  Plus shipping and handling because it is online.  Best Buy doesn't carry Macs or anything but the latest models.  I want an ibook G3.  The G4 is the latest model but it is also around $400 more expensive and the differences aren't even that important.  Anyway, I guess what I am saying is that if I play my cards right, and I think I will, by the end of August I could have a new ibook.  Joy!  Well, I lied.  I do have one plan.  And that is to go see Braid play on the 23rd.  But that is it.  Hrm.  Well.  My new favorite line from Chutes Too Narrow:  I'm a walking cliche.  And sometimes, that's just what I am.  I don't think that's a good thing.  :/ oh well.

      So I have around 16 newly burned CDs and tomorrow I am driving 6 1/2 hours to Mississippi with my wonderful mother where we will have a night out on the town and go to a blues cafe with live music and feel all...southern and hip.  We shall then proceed to Alabama the next day where we will see my brother's Drum and Bugle corps play and then check out what Alabama has to offer.    Sounds like some pretty exciting days to me.  I guess this past week I have been irritable and melancholy and down, but not to everybody...just to certain people.  I think it has something to do with me feeling like a failure or something, I dunno.  I mean, I've been having fun.  After Fall Out Boy on Sunday, Rebecca and Lisa randomly showed up at my house and went out to eat with us and then I got to hang out with Chintan on Tuesday while we worked on the Junior Survival Guide and Wednesday I got to hang out with Rebecca and Naomi and then I had a really fun time at Denny's with Byron being his brilliant self and taking breathtaking pictures.  haha.  And Thursday I got to hang out with Sarah and then come home to a CD Burning Party with Abby and Kelly and Jennifer.  So, the fun is there.  But I am not, I guess.  Hopefully, a break from here for three days will cure the misanthropy I have come down with as of recently.  Today I worked 14 hours and was once again annoyed the hell out of by Jennifer.  She's such a bitch to me and tries to thinly veil it with this fake kindness.  I can't stand it sometimes.  Xander is pretty cool sometimes.  I definitely like him better than Jennifer.  We have the same birthday.  Afterwards, I had to go to my dad's to talk to him about my speeding ticket.  And my missing license plate.  And then my mom wanted me to tell him that she paid for my TAMS deposit so she didn't have to pay him back half of what it cost for Brian to take Drivers ed.  His response: "I didn't expect her to pay me back anyway."  Fuck you, Dad.  He got all pissed off at me too.  Just gave me these blank stares and rolled his eyes a lot and yelled a bit about how stupid I am for getting a ticket.    I didn't think it was the best time to bring up writing Naomi's mom a check for $275.  Maybe next weekend.  When I left, he gave me a hug and was like, "I love you." and I was like, "Ok." And he's all, "I really do."  I wish I could believe that.    But I don't feel anything from him.  "This just isn't love.  It's just the remorse for the loss of a feeling."  I fucking hate having to be the mediator between my parents.  And have to hear them say shit about each other.  I know their past is  scarred and that they'll never love each other again and whatnot...because of reasons that I am reluctant to tell even the closest of friends.  I understand all that.  But I don't get how two people cannot work something out so that they are able to talk about things that are relative to their four children together.  Their hate for each other is so...strong I guess, it makes me doubt the existance of love.  Maybe love is just a short-lived fantasy before you really discover what kind of person the person you love really is.  "They're just dead feelings."

      I remember when I used to write things of substance on this site.  Now, it's all bullshit.

      I guess I should blog, although I am having trouble remembering what all I have done this week.  I know that Tuesday night/morning I was hanging out with Olivia...and Wednesday I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with Jennifer.  Afterwards we ate at Jason's Deli and talked politics.  I do not believe we did anything after that.  There was a lot of Denny's this week.  Thursday I picked up Abby from Houston and then me and her and Jennifer and Laura met a bunch of people at Denny's.  Then we went to the park and sat around talking.  Last night was the Clover Street show which rocked.  The Alexander were really good as well.  And today I ate dinner with my grandparents and then went to see Spiderman 2 with Laura and Abby and Jennifer which was good.  I started clapping when Mary Jane and Pete finally got together.  Then there was Denny's (once again) to chill with Joe, Deanna, and Alex.  There was much fun that was had with Risk and looking at the classifieds and such.  And there is an incriminating photo of Abby and I that might be making its way around the internet sometime soon.  Pay no attention, it's not what it looks like...    Tomorrow is Fall Out Boy.  One more dayyy...my foot is in the dooooooor.  Yay.

      Tonight will make three nights in a row of crazy fun.  Haha.  The 4th was spent with Kenny, which always proves to be a fun-filled adventure.  Kenny's town, Trophy Club, is Pleasantville meets Summerland minus the beach.  Scary stuff.  But he is not TV material.  Vanessa's life needs to move to Kenny's town and we'd have the perfect WB Prime Time Teen Drama.  I would comment on some of the...perfect WB Prime Time Teen Drama times we had, but I feel as if it is something I should discuss individually with each of you, so ask me about it.  Last night, after getting off my 14-hour shift, I went to Denny's with Laura and Jennifer and Byron until like 2:30 and then went to Byron's until around 3:00.  I hear Jennifer didn't get home until 6:45.  ;).  Some crazy times were had.  Although I was completely sober, I do not think anyone in the restaurant thought so.  I was...insane.  And there were phone calls and much laughing.  Ah, I love my friends.  So yeah, tonight I'll be chilling with Olivia and friends.  Should be fun and interesting.  I think we are going to a party.  Woot.  Ciao amigos.

      I'm in love with a boy that I might have never actually talked to.  Well, I use the word love loosely, but oh well, it might as well be love with as close as I'll ever get to it.  Today was rather nice.  At work I got to walk the track at bobsled, stay at hat for three hours, take a break for longer than an hour at only a 45 minute pay cut, and I got to go to first aid because I cut my leg.  All in all I'd say it was terribly exciting.  Then I went to Jennifer's graduation dinner thing and then we made a run for it and went to Dallas to see Censored last show with Travis.  They played with the Jump Boys, who I enjoyed immensely.  Bravo, bravo, Jump Boys.  And Censored was great save for the band insisting on playing their new stuff that Travis couldn't sing to even though it was supposed to be his goodbye show.  The bastards.    I don't know if I mention this enough, but I love punk rock so much.  And ska.  Ska is great.  I wanted to bust a move so bad tonight, and sing along and whatnot...I just didn't feel comfortable enough or something I guess...  And I love the way that punk boys are so antiwhateveryotherboyis and by that I mean they're not homophobic in the least and I find that to be very refreshing.  Anyhow, I'm out.

      Chicken Express's tea is delicious.  Yum.  And on that note, I went and helped feed homeless people yesterday.  It wasn't like normal homeless shelter stuff, there were tables and food bowls and I got to host a table.  A lot of the people at my table didn't talk much and left right after they were done eating.  But I did get to talk to Alvin who introduced himself as the chipmunk and he was cool.  Then I played tennis with Byron and totally beat him while Jennifer watched.  Even tho we both sucked it up pretty bad.  I am going to die at the tournament on the 9th.  Then we all ate at IHOP and I had to argue with Byron's conservative views.  The end.  I need more money.  I think I am going to go look for stuff to sell on ebay now.

              It will soon be mine!!! Five business days!  So I went to my dad's tonight. We were just gonna look at computers for me. I had found a lot of refurbished ones and such that were semicheap. But, he decided he wanted me to have a brand new one so we went onto the Apple Education Store and picked out a *brand new* 12-inch ibook  G4  w/  Combo Drive  and 30 GB (i let him make sure the numbers were alright). It's so pretty!! I am excited!   Anyway, the deal is that I pay for half of it (Around $600 once you add tax and such) and he will pay for half as my graduation present.

      Holla guys.  So today I got to shop some and I got a pair of jeans at Old Navy.  It is like impossible to find non-stretch jeans nowadays.  But I did.  And I bought a purse at Target too because I got tired of carrying my phone/keys/wallet around.  Then I went grocery shopping.  Michelina's has the best TV dinners ever and they are only $1.  Eh so that was pretty much my day.  Ohh yeah and then I guess I went to the airport to pick up Jennifer and their were tearful reunions and such and me and her and Laura all went out and saw The Village, which I somewhat enjoyed even though I was told by some people that it sucked.  Seriously.  People say it sucked way more than it actually did.  Just because it wasn't what they expected or something because it wasn't scary.  But hey, maybe, just MAYBE, that wasn't the main point of the movie, eh?  Oh, there was this whole, "Sometimes people in not doing things, don't do them because they don't want others to know they want to do them." or something to that effect and then she was all, "I know he has feelings for you because he never touches you." Ahaha.  It all makes sense now.  I think.  Then we chilled at Denny's for a while.  And now I am at Jennifer's house typing this while she is reading Spin.  Haha I accidentally called Laura Simpson's house earlier asking for Laura Siders and her mom got all confused saying she was in Colorado.  I felt dumb when I realized what I had done.  Laura's mom will think I am stupid now.  Oh what a day.

      So wow.  Life never fails to astound me.  And boys never cease to amaze me.  With their stupidity.  Concerning certain things.  Aaron = manwhore and liar.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.  I guess the thing that hurt my feelings was the realization that I am interchangeable like batteries or brake pads.  It wasn't that he liked me, he just wanted a girl, a girl to temporarily fill in the spot of his old girlfriend.  Glad I never fell for him.  The bastard.  Anyway, I quit work two days early.  Today I realized that another two days of hell could quite possibly strip me of my soul forever and so I got people to fill in for me and I am DONE with Six Flags (hopefully forever).  I got to say goodbye to the two people I wanted to say goodbye to (Shea and Lindsey) so that is good.  Hrm...yes.  Last night, I got lost on the way to Betsy's house and somehow ended up in Denton.  We decided to meet at Sack N Save since Betsy lives like 25 minutes away or something and so I bought some fruit by the foots and some cookies and then made friends sitting with the girl outside who was on her break.  When Betsy got there, we went to the lake that looked like it was in a picture and then went to IHOP.  We talked a lot and listened to the new mix she made me (good stuff it is).  Then we went by Kelli's and hung out at her pseudoparty for a while and left for Arlington around 1:00 or so.  I just fell asleep after we got back to my house.  It was very complicated finding a way for Betsy to get back to her house but we eventually did it.  I like Betsy.  I am going to miss her next year.  But she is gonna let me know about all the cool stuff happening in Austin so I think I will be visiting her a lot.  I can't believe I don't have to work anymore.  I am just gonna take it easy the next couple of days.  Relax, catch some sun, do some reading, get lots of sleep...it'll be nice.
