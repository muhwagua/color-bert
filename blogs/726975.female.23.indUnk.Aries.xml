      weird thing happened today.. i got on the PATH train to come home and a girl i was friends in high school, danielle, was on it with her boyfriend! i haven't seen her in so long! probably cause she changed schools before senior year and moved to california. anyways, she's so super nice and it was really nice seeing her=)  oh and it's so hot that the pavement in new york feels cushiony under your feet..or as one of the producers where i work, dave, said a 'soft pavement' day! bleck!  5 day weekend here i come=)

      you guys have to hear the 'meow' song...it's on one of the cds of music used for promos and commercials at work that me and the other intern in the creative services department (cece) have to go through.... but for some reason i have ymca in my head....probably b/c i've had to look for a disco song like it for the past couple days (hence finding the meow song).....  also, it's annoying that this thing is orangy-peach on other computers when on herbie it's pink! when i get up enough motivation i'll change it.  oh yeah and i'm going to new brunswick tomorrow-yay!

      I am  SO  sad!!!!!  I just finished  Return of the King , so now I am completely done with the  Lord of the Rings  series. (sob sob) I know I sound kinda dumb, but you have to understand! I got  so  into that whole world-I mean with school and stuff it took a long time to read it, so it's been there everytime I'm reading or i'm bored or i'm procrastinating or with me on train rides-I feel literally very very sad that it's all over =*(! I'm gonna miss my Frodo and Gandalf and Shadowfax and Sam and everything else. sigh  Anyways, I was gonna  finally  start  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , but I left it at school. So i'm gonna start  Deborah Harry  now instead! =)

      aye yi yi..back to work and stuff..i don't think i'll be able to do the comments thing, or at least for awhile, cause they are temporarily not accepting new signups....so use the message board for all that stuff.. i'm also still trying to put together my small picture section whenever i have a free moment. i'm gonna do something better with that as soon as i can as well.  today at work i forgot my  favorite  pen was in my back pocket and it fell in the toilet  AFTER  i had peed =(! tomorrow at work i bet i see a cleaning lady with my pen!

      so today i did nothing at work....fun! i finished my book,  Deborah Harry , on the PATH home..i'm still in disbelief about last night by the way...i'm like oh wow i saw Deborah Harry and Chris Stein and all of Blondie right in front of me!  ...i have  Rock Lobster  in my head=) By the way, you know what sucks?? I wanted to buy a Blondie shirt last night so badly and when I got there they were 40 bucks! That's basically how much i had to pay for the ticket!! =(! anyone love me enough to go to  urlLink their website  and buy me one????=)  i'm gonna feed kiwi and finally start  Goblet of Fire  ...

        wow wow WOW!  i don't even know where to begin....  tonight  urlLink shane  and i went to see the  urlLink B-52's  and  urlLink BLONDIE !  IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!! our seats were in the second row in front of the stage-center-aisle!!!  So B-52's play and we're dancing and then they end without playing one of the coolest songs ever (which i was obsessed with sophomore year of college):  Rock Lobster ! But then they come back and do an encore...the first time i think i've ever seen an opening band do an encore...and they play it!!! I was going nuts it was great!!!!!  Anyways, then Blondie comes on and as soon as I see Deborah Harry i'm freaking out! (actually i was freaking out about seeing her before then) So they play a new song...then  Dreaming (yes!), then  Hanging on the Telephone (yeeeeeeah!) and during it the security guard tells us to go against the stage so for the rest of the show I AM RIGHT UP AGAINST THE STAGE RIGHT IN FRONT OF DEBORAH HARRY!!!! i still can't believe it.... it was so awesome and the played so well and her voice was amazing!!!!! SHE WAS DANCING INCHES FROM ME! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (i'm not a dork i promise)

GOOD STUFF! rivers was acting weird, but thats nothing new i guess.. heehee... and me and van were wondering where the giant =w= were the whole time.. and then in the middle of  the sweater song  the platform pat and his drums are on raises up in the air and it's under it! it was so cool!! it was worth sitting through dashboard wah wah wah confessional hehe...  ok goodnight=)

SOME PEOPLE!!!!!!!  OH and NEW BRUNSWICK(still) = PAPERBOY! i seriously think i almost hit at least 3 people..one of which was a woman running across the street with a shopping cart...and i almost got hit by 2 cabs!  also..i'm going to disney world!!!!!!!!!!!

      ok...first of all i am GOING CRAZY! i'm trying to pack all of my stuff to go to school tomorrow and i own too much stuff! i made a list but i keep thinking of more and more i need to take!! and i feel like i never have something to wear or shoes..well after rounding them all up i have no idea how i get that feeling! when i get to new brunswick tomorrow i'm going to have to make like fifty trips from betty to the house.. plus i still have to go food shopping....  and just a little comment that has nothing to do with that... i know alot of people pour their heart out in their online journals (like this one).. like they go all into detail about their emotions or go on these huge rants about feelings on a subject..i have no idea how people do that! not that that's bad or anything but i just can't really go into detail on my computer for everyone to read...maybe i'm just not that interesting to have anything major to talk about!=) my entries are like 'today i played with kiwi and then i pooped. tomorrow i'm going to new brunswick. goodbye!' hehehe.... boring maybe but eh-who really cares all that much..  hey-ironically i did kinda just rant slightly on something, right?  eh whatever! back to packing and some ice cream=)

      some songs just weirdly seem to express how you are feeling sometimes.                            'Can't seem to get my mind off of you                           Back here at home there's nothin' to do                           Now that I'm away                           I wish I'd stayed                           Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in                            When you looked at me I should've run                           But I thought it was just for fun                           I see I was wrong                           And I'm not so strong                           I should've known all along that time would tell                            A week without you                           Thought I'd forget                           Two weeks without you and I                           Still haven't gotten over you yet                                                      Vacation                           All I ever wanted                           Vacation                           Had to get away                           Vacation                           Meant to be spent alone                            A week without you                           Thought I'd forget                           Two weeks without you and I                           Still haven't gotten over you yet' -gogos

      you know, at first i got Carrie but i went back and changed 1 answer cause i didn't think her description fit at ALL...this one's a bit better on the whole  i guess :   urlLink      urlLink Which Sex and the City Player Are You?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty  "You're demure, sweet, unassuming, compassionate and generous.   Brimming with Cinderella-esque fantasies of the fairy-tale life you have planned for yourself, you find yourself easily dissapointed. Not that that would stop you, you're forever the eternal optimist.   You're on the materialistic side. As far as your concerned, money matters. Alot. Almost as much as manners. You want everything nice and orderly. Including sex. You like it polite and proper on 300 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets. And no one better question your taste in china.   Your sweetness makes it easy to over-look your high standards and somewhat judgmental ways. You are truley a genuine, kind-hearted person. There's nothing you wouldn't do for your friends. "

      today is one of those days. i should've stayed in bed...  first my hair straightener breaks. luckily christine has one.. then on my way to class i wipe out on the sidewalk right after which some guy in a sports car laughs at me..then i notice that this incident ruined my favorite shoes=(... then i come home to make a veggie burger and spill them on the kitchen floor(not a big deal but it still counts!) and then the virus scanner on my computer tells me that i have the trojan virus! lucky me!! i think staying in bed all day might be a good idea...too bad i still have one more class and a movie to watch for it...  also it was brought to my attention that the rice krispie treat quote from yesterday might not work because half of its funniness was in the way, 'Maybe it sucked,' was said.   i can't believe it's already been 1 year since september 11th....

Last night when Van and I put  Halloween  on in our room (to fall asleep to mind you) we were wondering how many times we've actually seen that movie...It's probably some ridiculous number... I really had nothing interesting to say I just felt like posting. =)

Shaniqua don't live here no more!' etc) Yeah....so that guy is the one we hung out with!! weird, huh? he lives with dave...he was funny...but kris, van, rachel and i had to try SO hard not to belt out the song or ask him, 'Is Shaniqua there?' dave said he hates that song.  ok...night!

       watching: 'Model Behavior'(it's on the disney channel=)!), other: i'm a model, too!(read below)   mall trip was both weird and wonderful!! you know my favorite shoes? (my london shoes!) the ones i kinda ruined when i wiped out on the way to class?? WELL.. i went into a shoe store at the mall and THEY HAD THE SAME ONES! i freaked out!!! i think i almost hugged the people who helped me! =) they're a little different..not AS quality...but look basically the same =) i also bought a couple tops and a new jean jacket from jcrew ;)...the weird thing that happened was when i was in old navy..some girl comes up to me and says: 'Has anyone ever told you you look like a model??' i was like WHAT?!?! i thought either she was crazy or she was selling something (or she was hitting on me)...so she goes on to tell me how she's a scout for a talent agency and i have the features that would make a good model!  i was laughing..i probably made her feel kinda dumb but i couldn't help it...she invited me to a meeting but i told her i couldn't go cause i go to school in new brunswick....funny though, huh?=)

      sorry for the depressing last post but I can't help that...to make you feel better here's a quote from today's  Seventh Heaven  rerun episode that made me crack up: Matt: 'Well I guess I know who wears the pants in that relationship!' Robbie: 'Yeah..Joy does..and they're tight and pink so I do what she says.' (that show is pure quality!) also,  Coyote Ugly  (which I just got sucked into instead of writing my press release for class tomorrow no thanks to Christine!) is a very bad & very wrong representation of New Jersey & the people who live here!!

      SO you wanna hear about my day so far? (it's only 3:47 pm but it feels like it should be 10pm!) :  OK, take a deep breath and.....go! so you remember from yesterday how I'm sick? well i was feeling better last night so van,  urlLink rachel , kris, & i went to the diner for an american cheese fiesta pretty much, but later on in the night i was feeling not so hot. i fell asleep around 2:30 am....   SIX FORTY FIVE AM: SQUIRREL ATTACKS BEGIN!   **wait wait..i don't remember if i ever told the story of the squirrel. van & i share a room in the upstairs of our house..(rachel is in the other room upstairs & christine is downstairs)..so we've been hearing weird rustling noises coming from the ceiling & walls for  awhile .. turns out this squirrel made a hole in the window frame of one of the windows to me & van's room (which, by the way, is at the foot of my bed) and she's crawling in & out of there every day and running around in the frame of our house. our landlord had the hole sealed last week.** OK back to the day at hand. so, yeah, 6:45 am i get woken up (feeling yucky sick) to noises coming from the infamous window..i look up and see the squirrel sprawled on the window climbing around! so it starts making weird squirrel yelling noises and keeps running around the outside of our house b/c obviously it's home was sealed. next thing i know christine runs upstairs & i hear her telling rachel that there's a squirrel in our house downstairs! so awhile goes by..rachel calls pest control & they basically laugh at her & tell her to tempt it out of the house with peanut butter on ritz crackers. so rachel is freaking out (and rightfully so) cause the squirrel is going nuts and chewing the bottom of the front door.  eventually (at like 9am-ish) i get the squirrel to leave our house via the front door.  so yeah...there's poop on the couch & kitchen floor and everything seemed so yucky. rachel & christine had classes & van was sleeping so me..sick of course...had to sweep downstairs & clean everything to disinfect it...finally at 10am..i can get the rest i need..i decided since i only slept 4 hours i'd skip my first class to rest...lay down to go to sleep....then........about a half hour later....... I OPEN MY EYES AND A SQUIRREL IS SQUIRMING INTO THE WINDOW ABOVE MY BED! i SCREAM, "The  squirrel is in our room!!!!!!!!' so van gets up and we FREAK out...OI! so i run downstairs & open the door and grab crackers and peanut butter and leave them around to lead her to the door..but she won't come out from under my bed (where we find out later she was pooping incessently). so i call the landlord who reassures me that he's sending someone either today or tomorrow to take care of it and tells me to open the windows. so i call kris cause he likes squirrels. he comes over in his pj's and for a long time the three of us are thinking up plans upstairs. the best part was when kris & i went into my room to open the window (the squirrel was STILL under my bed) and van was in rachel's room to try to coax it down the stairs if it came out. the squirrel jumps out, i scream so it runs to rachel's room..van screams so it runs to my room..i scream so it runs to rachel's room..van screams,etc..................so it ended up in rachel's closet..rachel came home & finally kris chased it out the front door! sigh it's not over yet. so two minutes later pretty much the squirrel is back on the outside of van and my room window laying on top of the air conditioner and making its weird squirrel yelling noise! rachel van and i moved the air conditioner out so it can't squeeze into the window again(i hope). SO we've (that is, rachel vanessa and i) spent the ENTIRE day (van and i in our pajamas....all of us unshowered) cleaning our rooms like CRAZY! seriously, this squirrel pooped so much it's inSANE.   so, yeah, everyone please keep us in your thoughts that we don't get eaten by the squirrel who KEEPS attacking our house..   yes, she's still out there...making her squirrel yelling noises................

      after talking online to chris carpenter (who, by the way, just informed me of  his  livejournal) i decided to post a couple missed points about last night.. amid our loudness & chris and my exhilaratingly freeing experience of running barfoot on cold nb ground, a group of 'tough' guys tried to start a fight with us by calling kris fagsomething...but van totally showed she could've taken them on!! i wanted to spare the boy the humiliation so i went over and made peace. also, chris threw socks at people outside tijuana buritto. such a good night!!! by the way, visit chris' site  urlLink here  or in the link list on the left!

      so the last weekend pictures look kinda pixelated to me so i linked them to the actual pic meaning if you click on it you get the full-sized version.. thanks to  urlLink rachel  for making them faster to download with her photoshop she took from  urlLink chris , which i get to take next!  also..this weekend was very depressing..things have been so weird for awhile it feels like...dan's and rachel's family went through losses..and in my own we lost my aunt(godmother) last april right after my bday and now my gramma. every case the person had a terminal illness though so it's all very sad, and our family will never be the same, but at least they aren't suffering anymore=*(.. it's so heartbreaking to see your parents crying.

      today i met jimmy at the student center for food and he was actually there this time!! (don't ask=)!) it was cool i haven't seen him in awhile! for all you rutgers people, he drew the latest edition of the medium's cover and a comic inside.. afterwards the parking police chased me out of corwin on cook campus when i stopped at jenny's...then rachel and i went on a date to see  White Oleander  where i ate the curly fry cone and will now die of a heart attack.  p.s. the story that was never told:        rachel, van & i were walking home from class on some day this week when a kid came up to us. holding his stapler up to us threateningly he asked, 'are any of you jewish?' i replied, 'no, sorry!' why did i say sorry?

       last listened to: the go-go's, last watched: the end of 'The Crush', last heard: 'Rachel, you should be an elephant.'-Van 'Why?'-Rae 'Cause elephants only sleep 2 hours a day!'   weird. walking to class by myself 2 boys smiled at me like they knew me-taken off guard i didn't do anything. then 1 minute later a car beeps at me and people wave like they know me but all i see is the driver who i don't recognize at all and they're smiling. THEN after class  I  walk by someone who is sitting on bench who i think is someone i know and smile at them and he gives me a puzzled look!(the same one i gave the guys&car) maybe im going crazy(or maybe its the sudafed)

      just got back from a party where van, rae, kris, chris and i went dressed as characters from  Royal Tennenbaums ..today and yesterday was the best time ever searching for the peices to the costumes with them! we went to every store there's ever been, and pigged out at chilli's and taco bell..i think it was even more fun hunting for costumes then wearing them at the party! OH and last night kris left to go to ny, but the remaining 4 of us decided to go see  The Ring  and it scared the  crap  out of us. i took pictures of us tonight and of some people's costumes that were funny..they'll be up when i get motivated(along with the pictures from the party at our house last weekend)..goodnight.

      i can't decide how to post about the party that took place at our house last night. i kinda feel like i was hardly there for some reason! i think i was too busy running around making sure everything was ok or getting this or that. i feel like i hardly talked to people and didn't dance quite enough-BUT! as long as everyone (especially the bday girl) had fun that's what matters..  i mean, sure our house is beyond disgusting, but what's a party for? but although it was fun, it can pretty much be said that this is the last big party thrown by the phat house...thanks to everyone who came and to everyone who helped in any way! (especially kris&chris for pre-party help and shane&mike for bailing us out of the stereo fiasco! ohh! and dave for tapping the keg!!)

      for anyone who doesn't believe i live my life in supermarkets....yesterday shane, christine and i went to stop&shop and tonight van & i went to a&p(to get her medicine but of course we got a whole basket full of groceries!) i finally got an a&p card to complete my collection!  then afterwards (to make a long story short): shane saw a ufo, van & i made artichoke dip, shaving cream exploded in the bathroom, i drank ensure,  urlLink chris  called and we had a nice evening hangout at sarah-veena-aruna's place, and tomorrow we're making pancakes (peanut butter & choco chip  or  blueberry) to be followed up by both sweet potato and squash(made by christine & i) pies with ice cream!!!  also, i'm finally able to link van's blog-->  urlLink here !  ps.  i think because of  urlLink these such incidents  involving multiple pumpkins and flower pots on many past nights, my fellow pumpkin theives & i might  seriously  have to go into hiding. when we went tonight, a&p had removed  everything  from outside of the store  and  the eyewitness news van was parked out front! the pumpkin patrol is finally getting us...

      i don't want to go to class! i have to leave soon though...  last night van and i had a fun girly night! first we tried to visit katy and joan but went to the wrong house..we found them though! (brendan came by and was like she doesn't live here! over there..) it was fun looking through their old pictures and watching the  Cosby Show  and  Felicity ! then we left and decided to make the brownie mix i've had since last semester so we went on an egg hunt because stop&shop was closed..finally, back home again, we made the batter and then sat down to watch a tape of missed episodes of the cheesy shows we watch(think 'the WB' type shows!)...the brownies were only supposed to take 35 minutes and they took 3 hours!! we ate half-cooked brownie after like 50 minutes and then put them back in)..we stayed up till 5 and stuff being silly-it was fun...as van said it was very freshman year-like! (and even sophomore year-like staying up till the sun comes up watching  Christmas Vacation )  also, chris left us a message last night..he went to AC and either won $750 playing roulette & stayed at the Ritz or emptied his pockets and slept in the car!  ok i should go...if you see rachel today ask her to see her shirt-i love it!!!

       THE ATTACK OF THE PARKAS! people, parkas are taking over new brunswick....   it hit me when i was walking to my last Film Genres class, i had to stop in the comp lab beforehand-all around me in the lab, all around me walking to class, people in parkas! grey ones! brown ones! white ones! red ones! all different parkas on all different people!! i'm not one who likes to categorize people or put 'labels' on them, but looking at things in that way, every type of person in this University has a parka!! think i'm ridiculous?  go outside and walk down college ave. or easton ave., or sit in the student center or comp lab, and look around!  it's insanity i tell you!  i personally don't understand all the craziness.. they remind me of the coats that boys in my third grade class would wear and their heads would look really small.. but hey, if that's the look you're going for than go for it!  in my opinion, i hope this is a fast moving 'fad' for the sake of cold weather. not that i'm fashion guru in any way shape or form, but what is it about those big coats with fur lined hoods that's got everyone going bananas?  if someone can explain this to me than i'm all for it. if not, so be it.  it's not the end of the world (maaaaaybe) but it's crazy! and it's actually not just new brunswick.. sadly i think it's taken over the country-or at least parts of it.  people, if you haven't fallen victim to the subliminal parka-loving messages or whatever is going on yet, then maybe it's not too late! RESIST THE PARKA!!!!   if i've offended anyone i'm sorry-that wasn't my intention. this is a joke-i just find parkas amusing and the fact that they're trendy even funnier! but people can be good people and wear parkas, too, it's just clothes... that's all for my little rant=)

      **happy 21st bday spykey mike aka spuke**  on a sad note....   "Joe Strummer, the lead singer for the landmark British punk band The Clash, has died at the age of 50.  Strummer, who was the band's guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and sometime frontman alongside Mick Jones, died on Sunday at his farmhouse in Somerset, southwestern England. A statement released by his record label said Strummer "died peacefully at his home." It added that his wife Lucy, two daughters and stepdaughter "request privacy at this harrowing time."

      phewf! this week has been so crazy!!! aye..i need to go to bed soon. a few random comments on stuff (not related to each other at all that only a few people-past&present-will 'get'):  i miss the smurf dancing days.  if she doesn't get why then that's too bad.  2003 is NOT better than 2002 but it will be-oh yes-it will.  he needs to take a hint for goodness' sake.  i'm making a rollerskating/bowling call in a couple days to an old friend.  and....drumroll.....I LOVE YOU RACHEL!!!! (i miss you!)  on another note, a peice of advice to everyone out there(& me as well):  just stop & appreciate what you have & let the people you care about know instead of always being disatisfied & complaining & instead of playing games with people...life seriously goes by fast & if you haven't really REALLY realized this stuff yet sadly you only will see it when bad stuff happens (again and again) so try to take advantage of it now before it's too late........  okok yes it's time for bed now in MY bed which i feel like i haven't slept in in a year! van, i'm glad you were on all of the past days of journeys with me..although our plans kept having to change, it was a good & needed time...we set out as ourselves & came back as new & improved ro & van =)    (richard! haha)   nightnight!

      ps christine sent me this email not too long ago & i really wanted to share it b/c of its educational content! (i'm so proud) :   'So I heard on the radio this morning that there is this Portuguese saint named joncallo or something like that and he is the saint of hemorrhoids.  hahahaha. he's also known for curing acne and helping wives find husbands. In the town he is from they have a festival where singles meet and the women bring penis cakes.  I was laughing my ass off when I heard this.

      ok does everyone know my garage here at school? well last night i dug most of it out  by myself  (christine helped when we got another shovel which i appreciate so much). it took me 2 hours - it was insane. tonight i helped van's parents dig hers out cause she's sick. i sure better have muscles soon! right now van, melissa & i are watching our second movie in a row (my third because of film class). ( Born To Be Wild, One Hour Photo,  and now  City By the Sea-  urlLink James Franco ! we're swooning!) i also ate the rest of my chips, a ton of pretzels and 10 oreos. goodbye. ps i really like the results of this quiz i took!   You are most like: Audrey Hepburn. You are free- spirited and exotic. The world is your oyster. You have no regrets and probabley never will.    urlLink   What Legendary Hollywood Actress are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      wow ok so it's STILL SNOWING! basically today all i did was shovel our incredibly huge back driveway area behind our house & all around from 11am - 5:30 pm with a brief break for a cheese & mushroom omelet sandwich. (mmm) my mom & i took pictures & i'm totally going to have to put some up! i tried to climb my car (or should i say the mound of snow that had my car underneath) but kept sliding off. i tried to read the book i have to finish by tomorrow as much as possible but i couldn't get much done considering i haven't really been inside. i think my 3 favorite things have been jumping in huge snow mounds to make snow angels, kiwi wading in the snow till she was white trying to attack the snowblower & my parents bringing out the port wine for us & our neighbors & drinking it in the snow to warm up! it was a little blizzard neighborhood party! i have no idea when i'll get back to new brunswick. i guess tomorrow evening?   ps it's  's

      mr. rogers passed away today=( it was only a few months ago that rachel & i had a conversation about him & agreed that he was basically the grandfather of a whole country when we all grew up.. i used to love the 'land of make believe' parts... this quote is from someone from  urlLink here  & i think it's sweet:  'Thank you Mr. Rogers .... for decades of creativity ... inspiration ... humor ... music ... education ... and love. Our world was a better place because you were there as our teacher ... mentor ... father ... uncle ... and favorite guy. May you inspire those who have passed before you. We'll think of you everyday when we put our sweaters and sneakers on!' Matt    go  urlLink HERE  to read about mr. rogers & his life.

      so last night after the bowling bday party(!!) at which rosemary won worst bowler (yeah ro!) i went w/her & her friends to a bar in hoboken where this band that all looked like nelson(think 80's...long blonde hair...dj tanner's poster on full house) played the weirdest mix of music from 'Blitzkrieg Bop' to 'HotHotHot'..i think my favorite point of the night was 'my name's earl! and this is earl!' and the worst was rosemary killing my cell phone in a sink full of dirty water! (also the conga line, tamborines, & my coat getting compliments were pretty nice, too.) hey ro, where's vest? (we should make everyone ba-tu-pe!) ok now back to working on my paper.

      last night was fun & yummy!! (the food!) blah i'm an idiot cause it's not just analog behavior playing saturday at the somerset inn, it's jack nebraska, too.. go  urlLink see for yourself .  also, i know this will be the third post in a row of amsterdam talk, but i just wanted to say a couple things about it that have nothing to do with little inside jokes and memories for amsterdam crew...  amsterdam. it's pretty there..canals, canal houses, cobble stoned streets, antique and art shops everywhere..but the people are also so great. i mean, i know holland isn't the only place that exists like this, but the people were all different types, like it didn't matter at all how you appeared, and they all talked and hung out and had great times. we'd walk into a place and people would start talking to us and sometimes they would be from different countries as well. it was just like people (no matter where they came from or what they're into) getting to know people. like at paradiso when we saw the kills, and even when we went dancing, it was all different 'types' of people having fun together-it was so great. no feeling of being looked up and down, no disgust at pretentiousness. and also, yeah weed, shrooms, and prostitution are legal so it might seem like the place would be a mess, but it's so much nicer there than here. everyone lives fine under those conditions. mind you, there  are  restrictions on that stuff, but just like how much weed you can carry with you at a time and stuff like that. their government doesn't just take everything away from them, they found a way to work with them, so that it's really not abused. (the tourists probably do the most abusing!) they work together with the people and it works.  SO! who wants to move to amsterdam?! (did i mention the reasonable pricing on food & clothes???) hehe ;)   ps

      a late ps to my last post:  a:   analog behavior is playing at the somerset inn saturday  evening. a couple bucks for a good band. 21 and over of course.  b:  i took out the link to mugshots since i have not paid attention to that idea in a long while when, ironically, it was the thought of taking psuedo mugshots of my friends that was one of the things that inspired this blog. anyways,  new links  will follow such as 'your comfort' on theleft.  c:  it has come to my attention that  i missed a few amsterdam happenings  in my last post (which you should read to refresh your memory).. they are: mr. rodrigues is not in his room, drew supposedly getting pushed into chairs, mystery rolls on skirt night, the fact that sodas were so tiny that by the end of the meal you drank 4, the lovely service of hansel and whatever that cafe was, maids' persistent knocks and calls, and of course, constantly checking the tv for messages 'we have 1 message!'....thanks to those additions, guys...also, if you didn't already you can go read  urlLink van's blog  for her take on amsterdam!

      right from when i got woken at 11am by a car blasting 'Gettin Jiggy With It', i knew today was going to be a beautiful day. (too bad i spent half of it hungover on the couches with melissa & van who were also hungover hehe) but then melissa & i cleaned the whole house & i felt so productive! we sat on the porch the rest of the day into the evening attempting to do our work but instead singing to our cds, talking, & receiving lovely random visits & chats with fid, ed, jake & danielle, shane, & brian. brian & i almost got killed by a scarey guy hiding behind a tree, but thankfully we survived! i then visited  urlLink van  at bbv where we laughed the whole time.  & now here i sit, herbie on my lap, chatting with  urlLink katie  & spykey mike, feeling nauseous.  2 humorous quotes from my housemates this weekend: ' My friggin' Saturday is lame, when it was supposed to be fun-packed, & i'm home boiling eggs! ' -melissa (pissed off) ' When he started growing that mullet thing, that's when things went wrong. ' -vanessa (in reference to michael jackson)  ps. ever want to start a band but you can't play an instrument(or you have no friends)? then go  urlLink here -it's fun

      so i guess you could say we celebrated cinco de mayo saturday night when van, melissa & i seemed to be the jose tejas hotties.  then last night we made a 'vat' of nachos to cap off the fiesta & ate them while watching '8 mile' in our pjs-funfunfun! (after brian took over our house for 5 hours!) tonight is road trip time to philly to see the libertines. tomorrow = PAPER!

      PS. so, as an example of the notes i spoke of in today's post, i decided to put up 1 online cause it made me laugh so hard when i found it! vanessa, jim, and i used to take a few classes together freshman (& even sophomore year)...1 game we'd play is called the ABC Porno Game where we'd think up names for Pornos for every letter of the alphabet! (haha)  urlLink HERE  is one round from freshman year =)

       i had 2 weird dreams last night:   one was an episode of the twilight zone that i dreamed up w/a crazy old lady named astrid who tried to kill me (i was an old woman, too) so i killed her and then everyone in the neighborhood thought i was the evil force that had been lurking, causing everyone to stay in their houses.... in the other i went with van halloween costume shopping cause she didnt have one & she decided to be a pirate, so i collected all the pirate stuff they had in the shop and then ended up stripping for the customers to music playing in the store.    ...no more jalepeno pickles before i go to sleep!    also , i think kyle from real world chicago is on days of our lives as the new phillip! ( i definitely just showed my dorkiness )   yesterday  i cleaned the rest of my room that needed to be gone through & threw out soooo many papers & work from throughout college, yet kept all of my notes & silly things...goes to show what's really important in college afterwards i guess..(not that i am graduating this year or anything.)   my mom helped me put my older tee-shirts in this container & while doing so was like,  'i was brought up to be dainty and elegant, a lady.'  then she mumbled a bit.  then she said 'you girls don't take after me! ...why would you want to look like a boy?'  haha i guess i didn't have enough pink frilly outfits.. ( what's even funnier is you were included in that, rosemary, & you weren't even home..dont you love when that happens=)?? )  ALL I WANT IS A DECENT NIGHT'S SLEEP IN A BED WITH SHEETS!

      i deleted the last post b/c it was way too big. if you missed it i posted the lyrics to let me clear my throat b/c i had heard it in the car.  highlights of the last few days include, but are not limited to: splitting a pizza halfies with van when we we drunk & eating my half in about 5 minutes, meeting blue(cute kittybutt), seeing drew in a drunken state & meeting cheeto's friend, swapping butt sweat with van & brian, the lunar eclipse that never happened, going to old bay when myles was working, pizza city with fid in the beaver suit, veggie cheese dogs all week, getting to hang out with dan somewhat, seeing lots of people i actually like at the ale'n'wich for veena & aruna's 21st bday & also the fact that they are now 21, getting on dean's list again, seeing parker's band's first show at the court tavern, talking to todd (tood!) when he was completely trashed, fid & my madonna/deborah harry debate, eating more free good food at yet another quintana family party which i am a part of, & watching 'pretty woman' with christine & van. =)  lots of stressful/stinky stuff has been happening but stuff like that makes it better. thanks guys=) (mushymush time)   ps i dunno if you guys remember but the song i have stuck in my head right now is 'bagel chips! bagel chips! bagel chiiiips!' pps i am going to be living mostly in Lyndhurst now =(! call me to say hi or hang out & save me from boredom please: 201-889-6721 (yeah i'm a little iffy at internet posting my # but i don't think anyone reads this anyway except for about 4 people once in awhile)

      PHEWF! last night was ca-razy! it started when van & i kicked drew out of our house (just kidding!) & went to veggie works. it was so packed so i asked this guy by himself if he wanted to sit with us to save time. he was really cool-his name was pete & it turned out he knows fid-he's in one of his bands with him. so that was cool but the food part took forever cause it was busy & we had le tigre tickets for the fastlane so we were kinda in a hurry. jenny walked in to eat there, too, & she also had le tigre tickets! when we took off we weren't positivly sure how to get there & had a little tour of belmar/bradley beach b/c mapquest gave me vague directions BUT we found it & le tigre hadn't started yet. becca, kate, dennis, marina, and like 5 other people van and/or i knew were there-it was crazy! anyways, the show was  awesome  of course. THEN we hopped in the car to speed to hoboken to hop on the path to meet up with ian, keith, brendan, etc, in ny cause it was ian's last night! anyways, we had to park far away from the station and it was POURING so we were soooaked & only got into ny at like quarter to two. since we couldn't get in touch with the guys we met up with glen & had a good time at cinema classics with him, benny, & the awesome bartender despite the fact that this one weird guy was not leaving me alone for awhile. anyways, so then glen & benny came with us & we get back to hoboken & it's still pouring & we couldn't find a bathroom-so i made friends with a lovely bush on the waterfront.. then after about 45 minutes & then making a left at the do not enter sign for the second time we returned safely at 6:30 am, got out of our soaked clothes and CRASHED.  the night before was fun, too.. oscar got me & van into 'Finding Nemo' for free (such a good movie! i wanna see it again!) & then we went w/drew to ale'n'wich & john was bartending & then tood & glen showed up..meanwhile brian was supposedly dying according to todd!  right now i'm sitting on our nb living room floor on a seat cushion cause christine moved out already & took the couch & most of the furniture cause it was hers-our house is so weird looking! it's kinda depressing-the end of an era in a way. christine, rachel, van & i lived in this house for 2 years (rae wasn't here this past semester, melissa subletted, but rae is moving back this summer) but now christine is gone & not coming back=(. van & i are going to target this week & re-decorating the house & my dad is bringing our extra couch & we're gonna cleancleanclean! it should look nice again in no time. (i hope!)  bewitched marathon on tv land is still going on!   ps. according to "matthew"  urlLink this guy (fata1ity)  is the spitting image of todd?

      monday i got locked out of nb house & had to wait for van to get there..went to barnes & noble by myself where drew distracted me on the phone so much that i didn't realize i had been lingering in the gay & lesbian section for awhile until i hung up- anyways  tood came & hung out with me outside the house till rachel finished getting ready & heard us outside..later that night cherry street vegetarian (which luke didn't think was vegetarian) & then elliott smith at the troc!!! it was so good-we could see better-but it can't beat the smallness & adventure of maxwell's last thursday. afterwards on the ride home we had a lovely singalong & brian liberated his feet & aired stinkiness out of the window. after van wanted to go to the beach so todd took us-it was pretty & i got to wet my feet before we pigged out at dunkin donuts. theeen yesterday van & i had a shopping spree & jose tejas & attempted bowling with fid but we were late & i couldn't successfully steal a ball so that stunk-but bbv mike was there & since he's pulling a steve it was nice to see him! then we visited chip!!! to end the night van, fid, beavey & i watched 'bridget jones' diary', & then ate fajitas & watched 'perfect strangers'. its been fun=) next week dan is coming up for the summer!!!!!!! (& he's gonna join us for the next chip reunion!) i've been trying & trying to find one to no avail, but i found out that i might still get an internship in nyc for the summer thanks to help from my sister=) plus my hives are almost over & all my steroids are almost done i don't look manly! yay!  does anyone care? probably not-apparantly 'blogs are for people with too much time on their hands' (according to brian)-haha (which i agree with anyways..i definitely have too much time on my hands! but hopefully the job & lessons will work out & that problem will be solved)

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY TODAY TO  urlLink ROSEMARY !!!   this past saturday,  urlLink vanessa  & i drove in torrential rains & traffic to avalon to rosemary's shore house to hang out with her & her friends for her bday! it was so much fun! we hung out at the house & then went to the bar down the street (jack's place) where a cover band (mr. greengenes) that actually played alot of good songs performed that night.   here are some memories of the evening:  4 hour trip, tuckahoe inn, egg everything, really fast 'stayin alive', college house/michael myers house, the menu dilemma, the fishbowl race, dancing to the dj (rosemary loves justin timberlake), pushing people into the singer's crotch, good charlotte being played, johnny bass player, van & i screaming to bon jovi!, finding ro during 50 cent 'it's your birthday!', my stalker who loved my glasses, the guys getting van's attention with her hair swoop, i love rock and roll being played, me and van going to the front where ro and dana marie were rocking out, me and the singer singing to each other!, the red adidas jacket kid, ro yelling WAWA!!!, what's his name?(MIKE! BOB! STEVE! JESUS!), JESUS!!! or HEY ZEUS!!!?, 'I am Jesus! Come to me!', ro still yelling WAWA!!!! esp. at the guys across the street, lettuce and pickle sandwiches!, everything going to van's crotch, falling off the air mattress & hogging blankets, car ride home gas. it was a good time=)   ro-i hope your real bday & your other party next week are tons of fun, too! love you!!  ps. on another note, i have hives!

      ok so i saw blondie last night for the 3rd time!!!!!!!!! van & i went & we were probably 2 out of 10 people there under 30-but it was so good & deborah harry was amazing! (she's gotten a bit more fit & her outfit was so cool) i tried to look a bit 80s for the occassion.   anyways, so then i slept at van's & had to take the train from there to penn station & then get to work from there...after wandering aimlessly for the 6 train for a half hour in the wind & rain i finally hailed a cab.  the cabbie was super nice (such a change from psycho cabbie last saturday)! so we chatted the whole way..he thought i was from another country & then he asked my age & when i said 22 he started laughing. he told me he thought i was 16! so then he goes 'are you married?' then proceeds to go on about how i need to go & get married b/c 22 is the age to do it & if i do then i can relax for the rest of my life! haha!! i was like no no no not yet! & he's like 'do you have a bf so you know a couple years from now you might?' i was like no!!! hahahaha its ok thought cause he was a sweet man.  i have a feeling that this 4th of july weekend will be so much fun!  ps i forgot to mention in my memories of van's bday weekend a couple posts ago that at one point when i was waasted & van was waaaasted & todd was accompanying us back  to penn station, a group of greasy guys passes us and says something about getting a blow job & drunken van yells to them 'YEAH WHO WOULD GIVE YOU A BLOW JOB?!' HAHA & also, when she was puking into the trash can in front of MSG a couple of guys pass by making fun of her puking & van pauses looking pissed so i'm like 'don't worry he has a bald spot' so drunken van yells 'YEAH KEEP MOVIN BALD SPOT!' HAHA it was great!

('bugs are back' or the poop is singing it?) *switching towels *i had the best seat on the train *crazy cab driver *gay pride flooding ny *van & i getting drunk very fast *lots of dancing...even on stage...even in the front room *todd broke the banister *trying to sleep with no blankets and jeans for a pillow *the 3some-hahahaha *the prime puking points for the birthday girl: trash can outside of madison square garden, in a bag over the toilet in penn station, dunkin donuts parking lot 3pm the next day  i have pictures that will be posted ;)  hope you had a fun weekend van!

      a little update is in order. tuesday was my parents anniversary.  their friends and a cousin of ours are visiting from Portugal & so my family plus them went out to eat at this little cute Portuguese/Spanish restaurant.  my mom has expressed a few times how much she loves their dishes & how she wants an olive dish like the one they serve their olives in.  so, of course, while the small restaurant was distracted by the waiters' chorus of a lovely Portuguese " 'Appy Birthday' " to a nearby table, Rosemary & I swiped it for her. we think the waiter may have suspected something, after all he forgot my ketchup.  ..anyways. last night was my first drum lesson & it was so fun! & my teacher said that i got it all down really quick & couldn't believe i was a beginner-yay!  the nyc subway system is like a ride at epcot center. bongos in one hallway, authentic indian art around the next corner, and the little man with an accordian just a little further down.

      2 things.  1: i wish i had one of those digi camera phone things or something bc i definitely needed it waiting for the bus to go to work today! this guy (probably around my age) had on this amazingly like 80s/early 90s tough bully at school outfit (think johnny from karate kid) comPLETE with the bike glove things and bandana...so anyways he's standing there, waiting for the bus, too. it's just me and him. he's wearing a walkman and seriously, he's performing whatever he's listening to. i mean he's not singing outloud or anything, but he's lip synching and moving around like he's in the music video. at one point he crouched down to the pavement and pretended to scream into an invisible mic in his hand while a car slowed down and watched. how hard was it for me not to laugh?? VERY! i would've loved to put up photos of that.. 2: ok now that i'm laughing about #1 i forgot #2 so i'll fill it in here when i remember =)

      i don't know where to start! if i didn't post about last weekend i wouldn't be able to post about the week b/c it all seems like a busy blur! but it was all fun=) this week ruled b/c i got visited! one night van & brian drove up & we had dinner... (although gobi ended up being closed & brian's car's tires deflated-it still turned out to be fun!) another day van had an internship interview so she met me at work in ny & we ate at a yummy veggie chinese restaurant... (although the 1 and 9 took her too far that turned out to be fun anyways, too!) one night i drove to red bank to meet van & go see '28 days later' at a 11pm showing with both endings..van was sitting on the aisle & i was right next to her-at one intense point during the movie a guy walked by us & scared the bejesus out of us..then i was scared the crap out of and did 90 the whole way home at 2 am! (although i got completely lost going to her house cause a road was closed-a cop found me & THAT turned out fun anyways too!!!!!)  (i guess it goes to show that i have to learn not to 'ro stroke' b/c things work themselves out. ANYWAYS..)  so then the weekend... friday was GIRLS NIGHT! it was "roommate reunion night" for van, christine, rachel & i..we got super dressy (hott!!) & went to eat & then went for sangria at nova terra...so classy!! turns out our landlord was there!! (he bought us 2 pitchers!!! ALSO turns out he has a house in puerto rico & is gonna let us go and stay there!!! i'm so excited!) we ended up back at christine's with it not just being girls on girls night but that's ok cause it was a good time! we even revived our old house dance ('booooomba!!') & individual/parent dances! UGH that night was so much fun!!!!! since i'm the only one that doesn't have a digital camera, i don't have pictures-so i'll have to link to the 3 of their's when i can.. saturday rachel, van & i rearranged our house somewhat & then van & i had a lovely dinner followed by a lovely evening in nyc with fid and craig! actually we only got to cinema classics (gogo night?) at 12:30 and got home at...8 am?? i don't remember! (that says something=)!!)   so....we have to reschedule gobi, van might work by me (kinda) soon, i'm scared of the 'infected', we're going to puerto rico, i drank alot & disappointingly have learned i have a tolerance, but i had alot of fun, AND i love my friends. bye!

      i brought my polaroid camera into work yesterday b/c one person i work with alot who i really like, julia, is going to be out next week (my last week) and i wanted to take work pictures before i was done-what a day to have my camera....  so i get to work and i need to go by film for my polaroid.  i run to duane reade across the street & then come back.  i get in the elevator & press 9.  doors close.  the little screen that tells you what floor you're on says "9" but the doors don't open.  i'm all by myself in the stupid elevator so i start pressing door open and 9 buttons.  finally after literally 5 minutes the elevator jerks upward and leaves me on 8.  (IT WAS AN OMEN-I SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME RIGHT THEN!)  so anyways I go upstairs & they threw a surprise little lunch going away party for me in the conference room=)!  it was so sweet!  and as a present, julia gave me these sunglasses she used to wear in 1964 that are big and checkerboard b/c she said they looked like they would fit me-she always calls me marlo (thomas) or gidget-heehee.  anyways so lunch-yum-i took a bunch of polaroids of people & stuff (which i'll post).  then, back to work.  a couple hours later.... ....i'm sitting in my little cubicle using my computer & the tv over my head that plays cnn only goes static.  i didn't think too much of it.  then i notice the lighting is weird.  i look up and the light right above me is flickering, but everyone else's is fine.  then-ZAP!  tv, lights, computers, etc are all out.  i go over to where my sister & the departments i work with are & we're all just like what the???  someone looks out the window & says how the traffic lights are out & people in other buildings are looking out at us & the street too.  the building alarm is going off.  someone comes around and says we have to leave so we all grab our bags & walk down the stairs.  masses in the streets!  no traffic lights!  no one knows what the hell is going on & some people are getting nervous.  we're all waiting around to see what happens when one of my bosses with a radio says that the power is out-blablabla (you all know it by now).  so the boss says we should all go home-does anyone need a place to stay, etc.. me, my sister, amy & 2 other new jerseyans decide to walk to port authority from where we are.  walking the streets of nyc was insane.  HORDES of people walking in the heat, cars and trucks going everywhere b/c of no traffic direction (a hot dog truck almost hit me).  masses of people outside the ny public library.  finally we get to port authority & like everyone else finds out-no buses.  (i snapped a shot of the crowd outside).  so we walk to the lincoln tunnel, they aren't letting people walk through it.  (there's a bunch of people trying to get rides from cars that aren't moving anyways).  so we go to the ferry and join the  MOB .  (i snapped 2 shots of the crowd there, too).  so-yeah-we wait packed in with 100,000+ people in the heat to get on the ferry.  it was so crazy that people were ripping open the fence to get into the crowd.  (i snapped a shot of amy holding the fence open.)  there were like 10 helicopters hovering over us-sirens everywhere-pandemonium!  everyone kept saying how on 911 it was so much easier to get home cause there was some sort of order.  there was a 1 week late pregnant lady among us who had to be taken away bc she went into labor!  anyways so after waiting for hours and hours and hours on the line, it becomes dark out and finally cools off a bit.  luckily, one light turns on right by the ferry entrance at which point the crowd cheers.  so FINALLY we get on the platform (one of the people with us starts yelling NEW JERSEY I CAN SEE YOU!!)  and we get on the ferry.  (they couldnt tell us where the ferry would go-we'd just have to get on one).  so we get dropped off in weehawken.  after walking and walking and waiting and waiting we have to walk from weehawken to hoboken to my sister's apartment-but i didn't care bc i was finally out of the city.  so we stop at this place and get gatorades and literally inhale them for lack of hydration.... ....LUCKILY my sister's apartment was one of the few who had regained power.  b/c of traffic i stayed there (as did a bunch of her friends whose apartments DIDN'T have power).  my parents said at our house we didn't have power either, so that was even more of a reason for me to stay.  but-her elevator wasnt' working.  as we climbed the stairs to her apartment we both agreed that we felt like we had just been to war.  i said 'this is one for the bloooojjjjj'...after inhaling food & talking to everyone about our days while we watched 'drive me crazy', we went to SLEEP. ...i woke up today and finally my phone worked!! but my body felt like lead.  (thanks rosemary for everything!)  what was everyone else's experiences like??

      our house is rooting for the "hurricane" to be a major event but so far it looks like it's not what we hoped.  still, we're drinking wine in celebration and hoping that it'll be crazy tomorrow so we can be stranded in our pajamas in our house all day watching every  Halloween  movie one right after the other.  here's to the hurricane being insane ::cheers:: !

      it looks like the old lady in the basement isn't alone....  so last night i woke up from a really weird dream for no good reason, and just as suddenly with no good reason i turned around to look right at the curtain wall/partition in my room & i saw what looked like the figure of a civil war type man (hat & everything) with feet off the ground. seriously i could not move at all, and i couldn't say anything. finally i got myself to grab the tv remote next to my bed and turn on the tv to bring light into the room. of course the light turned on and it was just curtains-and i wasnt wearing contacts or glasses-but MAN this scared the bejesus out of me. (plus of course i started thinking of sadako!) sigh..i convinced myself it was nothing and i eventually fell asleep an hour later, but seriously-i'm scared to sleep in my room tonight=(     ps in case you haven't heard, i'm engaged to beavie.

      I recommend: - rewatching the original 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' - seeing the new version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' -  not  watching 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'  ...I couldn't decide whether I liked the new version out in theaters now or not since it's so different. But afterwards when everyone was talking about it, it did seem better that it was a new 'Hollywood-ized'  version of the concept of the story  rather than a new 'Hollywood-ized'  complete redo of exactly everything  (like the Gus Van Sant 'Psycho' remake a few years ago). Anyways, either way, it scared the bejesus out of me & everyone else in the theater, so that says something!

       HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN HALLOWEEN HALLOWEEN! HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN! SILVER SHAMROCK!   ...i LOVE halloween! i LOVE scarey movies!! i LOVE scarey stories!!! i LOVE scarey anythings!!!! i LOVE getting dressed in a costume and running around (as my friends can attest to) but especially on halloween bc i'm not a weirdo then!!!! (the only thing bumming me out is that my costume didnt quite work as i had hoped...my mom helped me put together an old looking nurse outfit but i couldn't find a pig nose literally ANYWHERE! so-instead of being a character from an episode from the 'Twilight Zone', i kinda made myself a dead nurse so at LEAST i wouldn't just be a lame nurse. BUT I REALLY WANT TO FIND A PIG NOSE!

      halloween is over=(. (but it's always kind of halloween for me!)  i spent the day watching a marathon of the "Halloween" movies with Fid (once again)..i also dressed him in my clothes and he looked lovely for his halloween evening as a drag queen killer! beavie even had a costume! anyways, we watched the scarey movies & listened to the Misfits & blasted my "Halloween" soundtrack (the John Carpenter creepy music from the first "Halloween" movie) out my window upstairs and turned out the lights up there so the music just rang out from the house for hours! we semiscared van and rachel when they came home by shutting off the lights but they thought the music sounded like it was coming from the garages(which is even creepier!)...  fid left to go to world inferno so van rachel and i drank on our dark enclosed porch with the windows open yelling/whistling at drunk people in costumes as they went by-heehee! finally we decided too many people were getting arrested in front of our house & thought it would be a good idea to drive to the party that night on townsend st. with lots of alcohol in our bellies! ("i can't see!! my eye is smudged!!")   *OH! AND! it ended up that i got my pig nose after all!! i made it! i was inspired by the creation by mike(non-roomie of the week) of van's "Mrs. White" hat for her costume... SO i was able to be the nurse from "The Twilight Zone" after all!!! (instead of just a dead nurse).. yay! i was so psyched.*  so yeah, we went to that halloween party and 6 people knew what i was without me giving hints so they all got a kiss cause that made me happy! anyways i had alot of fun! drinks and dancing and drinks and dancing and drinks and dancing!!! and i loved seeing people's costumes all weekend & i have a few polaroids but not too many since i always forget about my camera. rachel has alot though! anyways i dont know how i drove us home...alls i know is van was hanging out the window as we all belted out the yeah yeah yeahs to blurred visions of passerbys!  last night was benny's bday party-i was burned from the night before but there was a bit of a dance party there, too!  oh and van, trish & i went to see the strokes last week and it ruled=)  well i have to go to the library now to research for a paper-yaaaay.

      hmm audioblogging? i don't think so. i can't even hear myself on people's answering machines...  ...anyways, the guy is upstairs painting my room and i'm freaking out because i have to shower and get to the comp lab to print out hand-outs for my group's presentation at 2:50!!! ug!!! why doesn't my landlord like to give notice!!!! and my room is so tiny it's like i'm gonna be falling all over the place if i try to sneak in there to just get my clothes! uuuggg...  i guess i'll write about last night while i'm waiting. so school has been crazy and so yesterday in our 1 mutual class, van goes 'we should get drunk tonight.' so we practically run home b/c it's freeeezing and fid and rachel are here...i end up making tons tons tons of pasta/brocolli/beans and then we go to the bowling alley! which we haven't been to in forever it seems like, but wednesdays is all you can bowl for 8 bucks (plus shoe rentals so it's like 12 each). so we bring with us cokes which are half-filled with vanilla stoli and we got a pitcher there and it was so much fun...i actually got strikes! everytime i did i was so excited that i would automatically turn and jump and then feel like a big dork. but anyways they had this raffle for 500 bucks and another for 340something bucks, and the more they announced it the better it sounded! so we each got together quarters (and dimes) and bought 2 tickets. we were really bummed we didn't win but then they made the winners bowl for a strike-one shot for a strike-and THEN they would win the money!! rip off right? i would'a never wanted to enter if i knew that's how it worked. the poor guys, the whole alley was watching them... the first one got NINE pins and the second got a gutter ball! oops. so when it closed we headed to the knight club to visit chip which we also haven't done in awhile! so he gives us 2 free pitchers (yay) and then rachel and i are having this long conversation sitting next to each other at the bar when all of a sudden these two guys come over....oh my goodness..."my" guy's name was NIO! LIKE EL NIO! which i kept calling him because he kept calling me sarah at first and then roxanne...he also kept telling me i have the prettiest eyes blablabla-oi. i was like yeah does that line really work for you? i kept looking at van and fid and chip and so did rachel but no one helped, they just laughed-thanks guys! when they left we clued chip in, so next time he's becoming one of our boyfriends just in case. so then we came home and FINISHED the immense amounts of pasta stuff i had made before plus tator tots were made. after two group hugs i went upstairs to watch clue and hit the hay. when rachel came in my room at 10 i wanted to kill her but thanks for remembering to wake me up rachel=)  ok i'm gonna go kick that guy out of my room! it's 1 o'clock already!

      ...still using roomies' computers since Herbie is still broken...  so the landlord's crew put up a wall in my room in place of the curtains-i have a door! but it made everything smaller so the furniture is all rearranged and now it looks alot better. BUT you've seriously never seen a bigger sheetrock dust mess is your life! Even Vanessa's room and downstairs were dusty!! What a mess!! But now everything is clean =)  Also-the past few days have been good. I was home for Thanksgiving and went shopping with my sister and mom and stuff. I ordered glasses with my contacts perscription and I LOVE them so I'm definitely gonna be switching back and forth. My dad came with the 3 of us and we all saw "Elf" (cute right?)-it was so so so funny! I wanna see it again. Last night I got back and went with Van and Fid to the Court. It was alot of fun and Amsterdam Sara and a bunch of people were there! 'Excuse me, can you tell me where the basement is?' 'I'm just gonna rest here for a second!' 'BR!' 'Spicy food!' and the toilet spraying water everywhere are only a handful of funny moments.  Ok...back to homework-yuck.

      today i went home and got my new glasses...i'm definitely going to switch back and forth between them and my contacts b/c i love them!   tonight i went with van and christine to go see 'Love Actually'...I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! they did, too...but for some weird reason we were the only ones cracking up in the theater...since it was all couples except us, maybe they were busy b/c it was seriously such a funny movie & so GOOD! (so CUTE!) we're gonna go see it again next week! (hopefully!)  as a side note, my people are taking over the world! first the new Nelly Furtado video features Portuguese dancers and now 'Love Actually' has a Portuguese character in the story line-yaaaay! (haha!)

      what a BLAST! (new years, that is.) i had so much fun! i don't think i can write the entire adventure but i'm so glad it was 100 times better than last year's new year's! i will say that i love that at midnight i was around a bunch of people i really like, champagne in hand, screaming the countdown with the bar while dick clark's rockin eve is on (and amy is yelling DICK CLARK!), to then be greeted with hugs and kisses of new years (van first! aw) all night from more people i really like. the people that were around definitely made the night! (even eye patch who i insulted by accident-i felt so bad!-added something to the night!) the only thing missing was that one of my best friends wasn't around at all b/c he is gone to europe for a month-sooo lucky! but i did take lots of [drunken] pictures with my new handy dandy digital camera which someone correctly identifyed upon first glance by type and model new year's night and freaked me out! so i'll have to post them asap! as well as others i've taken....  a new year means inspiration to change anything and start over-or start things you want to start! amen to that.

      here we go! i am totally biting off of  urlLink rachel  but i decided to create albums on the web of my pictures from my new digital camera! it's so much easier.  so far i have christmas, fid's last night before tour, new years (in which i get progressively drunker and thus messier as the pictures/night go on), nyc shopping, and miscellaneous! i'll try to keep up with them!   urlLink click here  to see them (and im adding a link in my photo section!)

      added new photos to the digi photo album...i add them all the time though...  it's so sad and depressing that 3 girls signed the lease to our little house! christine, van, rachel and i lived there for 2 years and then this past year has been van, rachel, and my 3rd...SO many memories: the old lady in the basement, boooomba!, the squirrel attack, our old little parties, ETC on and on and on! =( i'll miss you, house!  tomorrow i will hopefully become rich. and if this happens, i will buy everyone a round of drinks on thursday!   I NEED A YM BOYFRIEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (coughcoughsethfromtheoccoughcough!)

      best 2 places to find cheap cute clothes right now: h&m and mandees!  but when i was in mandees today i heard the feee-unniest thing! you know how the music that plays in there is always like untz untz untz? well-they played 'last nite' by the strokes EXCEPT it was a redo in untz untz untz fashion sung by some cheesy girl singer. HORRIBLE! but i did get cute shoes/skirt/sweater. thanks mom!=)  tomorrow i am meeting rosemary in ny and then we are eating at gobi-yay!  i think a fancy girl's night needs to take place next week!!!!!!

      why does my blog always start the writing halfway down the page?! it's so annoying! i think i'll change the format soon...  last thursday's girls night was such a good time =) i took a few photos..van wrote about it so it seems silly for me to, too, since the only people who probably read this would read her blog as well.  i'm sick and dog sitting. at least i get to see kiwi & rosemary's here (even though she left for brooklyn which i would've gone with her if it wasnt for my fever,etc) and i get to go pig out and watch movies all night....but that kinda seems like what i do everynight (except thursdays).  do you ever wish you could go back and take a chance on a missed opportunity to see what would've happened?....i hope i get that second chance....

      and i spent it (and am still spending it) in my pj's on the couch watching movies (oh well!), but happy birthday to people who's birthdays only come every 4 years!  also: * tricia's bday last night in ny was fun (despite a missed train!), but unfortunatly i basically forgot to take pictures the whole night, although the 3 i took i love! all in all everyone that was hanging out were really cool & it was a good time. * hanging out at christine's friday night was fun-i'm in love with her dog shadow & her bruschetta chips! dan was up & drew even met us at alenwich cause he was in town! i have a few pictures of this night to post. & rachel throwing her hamburger buns yelling 'where are my hamburgers?' & then flooding the kitchen with mashed potatoes was a great end to the night! * 'school of rock' is such a great movie! vanessa & i watched it earlier cause i had rented it before it comes out & it was so funny & cute! * my hair is all one color!  ok now on to 'office space'...

      last post was deleted because (as drew said much more eloquently over im) my 'dramas' dont belong on here-it's a stupid blog! ...soooo yeah.  on another note...wasn't it just last week that we were all running around in jackets and short-sleeves? snow??? i mean, if it was going to snow at LEAST it could've snowed so much that my 8:10 this morning was cancelled...completely unacceptable!

      i had a vivid dream this morning right before i woke up that i went to atlantic city by myself but my parents & aunt & unlce & gramma ended up being there, too, and i played 1 slot machine & won $5000..so i decided to run to my car as fast as i could (with my bucket of quarters that equalled $5000) to make sure i didn't lose it. however-on my way to the car i saw these 2 guys sitting at a table in the parking garage & announced to them that i had won $5000. they asked me where it was & i said that it was in the bucket. the one guy said, 'That doesn't look like $5000 to me!', so I look down & sure enough the bucket was filled with peanuts. i should've been dissapointed right? no-i still insisted that the peanuts were $5000 & took off in my car, driving on the sidewalk of AC cause i didn't know where i was going! then i woke up (that half wake up where you're not  quite  awake) and thought i really had won 5000 dollars/peanuts...but i quickly realized that i was in bed & it was all a dream. I WANT MY 5000 DOLLAR PEANUTS! anyone wanna go to ac? haha  ps. does anyone read this? maybe when i leave nb (soon!) i'll stop writing in here so it seems like i've dissappeared off the face of the earth & i can be just a memory..(that is, except for when i visit nb almost every weekend ha!)  pps.  urlLink rachel  posted pictures from my bday night in nyc...please take into account that i was the bday girl when you see my drunk eyes! haha  [your comfort is my silence.]

      sometimes all you need is 10 hours of bruschetta, margaritas, toenail painting, cheesy movies, and talks about children & how food is better than anything else with the girls! that's how my saturday was at christine's & it was really nice.  the night before was the last new st. party & i attained my goal of showing up to it already wasted! yay me! i was really enthusiastic that night for some reason but i had fun so that was good. everyone was so silly, at one point giant dice were being tossed about, & there was just generally a good vibe there.   those 2 days were refreshing after a horrible day last week that i won't talk about.   AHH! THURSDAY I'M GRADUATING & 1 WEEK FROM TOMORROW MOVING OUT OF NEW BRUNSWICK!                                   [your comfort is my silence.]
