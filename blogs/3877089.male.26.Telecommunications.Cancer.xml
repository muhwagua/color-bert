      The key is am trying to unlock is the self of balance. A skill to keep all little things around you running smooth as it all connects and follow the heart's beats.   Yet it is so hard to do that with all the new tech we have out there. The levels of mental noise is so shocking that we all have become a norm to the sounds out there that does have some effect on our mental health. Typical american sees 400 to 600 ads per day — that's 40 to 50 million by the time they've turned 60. How can you tell me that company spend billions of dollars on ads to just sell a product in one setting. It more like they spend so much to just slowly feed your mind. Then bam one day I'll be buying Pall Mall Ciggy to just try it out then going back thinking of how Hollywood has changed their movies into more commercial verison since the image of Johnny Deep in Secret Window smoking Pall Mall Soft Pack in Red. It was a symbol of somekind. Yet it stuck in my head. Then one day I was like why not buy that. It is often thought that we don't keep those in our mind if we just see something. However, that isn't true because of information like In 1983, only $100 million in TV advertising was aimed at children, but by 1997 the figure had climbed to $1 billion, with the total amount of ads and marketing in all media reaching $12.7 billion. Almost half of all parents report that their kids are already asking for brand name products by age 5. Even my niece she come home one day crying to her Mother and telling her that her friends were making fun of her because she didn't have "Old Navy Brand" so therefore she was nothing. Mother felt bad and wanted to change that and then therefore shopping in Old Navy to slove the plm of her girl.   Balance is to support Free Press Our information of balance needs to flow. Balance is the Key!

Then food shopping. Then got home then read the Saturday newspaper then went through all the paper crap I have and damn I had more trash than ever so I cleaned that out. Then str8 out the important papers. Then add some things in my datebook of stuff I have to do this week. Grrr bills and credit card bills and ahh ahh is all I can think of.    I didn't get the job with Gallaudet and I found out few days ago and I was so depressed and sad I end up sleeping so much for days and then I just gotta snap out of it since I have vr appt this coming up Monday.

      The Joy to the World on the pill Poping from Rich old Gals and their lovely wine with pills to teens drinkin' and poppin'.   I enter a new age of WildWellbutrinWild. It is interesting after second day on it and I am slowly going off the speedy white paxialll as it slowly fades away. As my insanity goes nuts with this culture of ours the by product of lifetime self-obesssion.    Capitalism contorl our lives. Let just admit it. We really are the drones to their marketable choices in our daily lives. The market is sucessful at taping into our wallets and our self product idneity the things we buy are shaped by the information flow that we see daily by radio,tv,internet, anything that has flow of information isn't free and it is contorl by bigger companies and each information out there isn't free and it worth so much to bigger companies that counts every marketable spots they can tap into. When Capitalism is in full effect it creates so many different markets that we all have to watch and pay for the services we want to get for whatever service that meet our product needs. Markets ranges from  Addiction and Cancer. There money made in Black Markets that would only exist in a capitalism market to try to tap into more wide screen of of markets to get the maxium proft dollars.   We are a Gen who see the world through T.V. and that is what shapes our joys in the world.    Capitalism equal Death

      I have lived with this guy on and off over the years from my second year in college until many years later. He can be quite obbessive on little things but I always enjoy that from him and seeing that he has great ablities to just obbese the little things out of my wits. During the past spring I was struggling with new meds and I was in one of my lowest point of my life and I was crying out for help and this dude was insane but I still love him the same and he called the cops and the whole city on my ass. They all come over and of course I had to deny it all because I wasn't ready and I was just simple just had fear of getting better. I was pissed at Tom but now since the past few days I do admit I wish I did go out and got help when I had the chance when he made that call but it was a choice I made while ago but I am still graceful that he did care at least somehow even tho he gets sick of me quite often but he did give one second of care on my back and for that I am forever graceful for him to do that for me.   Yes, I'm on new meds right now and it seems to be slowly helping me somehow. I still want A.D.D. meds not fucking depression meds but within three weeks I will see doctor again and tell him to give me what I really want. Right now I'm slowly going off paxil and going on Wellbutrin. Indeed It is different.   Tom, thanks for bearing with me when I was a nut and crazy on my meds.

      For like the million time and it just feels good to just downsize on the baggage. Makes it whole lot easier on my back to travel to where I need to travel to. Less the better. I have like so many stuff and it unbelieveable how much paper we can all gather up these days. Mostly are just junk we don't need and photos that just keep reminding ourselves of our past. Not sure if that helps us to look back into the past throught those photos. lot of people have issue with letting go of the past and those tend to live in the past tense and not the today nor the future.    Going to escpe logic.

      It is so easy to just forget to drink something natural and pure such as water since we often replace them by sodas, tea, coffee but yet those aren't pure form of water. Since our body is 70% water it only make sense that water is the most healthy thing we can drink to help our long term health. Here more information below as we should value water.   Ten Tips For Maintaining Proper Hydration   The Nutrition Information Center at the New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center offers the following tips for maintaining proper hydration:  Follow conventional wisdom—drink at least eight, eight-ounce servings of water each day. The more time you spend outside, the more water you need to replenish lost fluids.  Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink water. By the time you feel thirsty, you probably have already lost two or more cups of your total body water.  Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Convenience is a must, so carry a bottle of water with you as you commute to work, run errands or enjoy the day at the beach.  Don't substitute caffeinated coffees, teas and sodas for water. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, causing you to lose water through increased urination. Alcoholic beverages have a similar effect.  Keep a bottle of water on your desk if finding time to drink water is a problem. Or, visit the office water cooler and take water break rather than a coffee break.  Once you start exercising, don't stop drinking. Keep a bottle of water with you and take frequent water breaks.  Don't underestimate the amount of fluids lost from perspiration. You need to drink two cups of water for each pound lost following a workout.  Start and end your day with a serving of water. Your body loses water while you sleep. So drink a serving before bed and again when you wake up.  Don't forget that common maladies such as colds and the flu can frequently lead to dehydration. Keep a large bottle of water next to your bed so you can sip it throughout the day without having to get up.  Remember that when it's warm outside, cold water—not carbonated soft drinks or sport drinks—is the best fluid for keeping hydrated. Cool water is absorbed much more quickly than warm fluids and may have a positive effect on cooling off your overheated body.  I never knew how important it was but then again I always did know but it didn't seem that big of a deal but after reading this it sure did. There a link where you can go and figure out by body weight of how much water you should drink. It really important to know how much then see how much it would change and affect your health in long term.   http://www.water.com/learn_about_water/swg1340_hydcal.asp  Enjoy much more healthy lifestyle.
