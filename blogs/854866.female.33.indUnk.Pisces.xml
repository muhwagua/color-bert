      More Things I Suck At:  19. Photography.   I have no sense of visual composition whatsoever, and I don't think instruction will help.  20. Crying. I didn't cry for five years one time.  Ever since I took it up again, it's never been cathartic or cleansing or anything.  It just makes me puffy and gives me a headache.  I'd probably rather throw up.  21. Throwing up. It's really barely an alternative.  22. Unpacking. I moved 12 times between 1986 and 1997, mostly not because I wanted to.  I don't recommend it unless you already live in a tent.  Being semi-nomadic made it really hard to unpack and get settled in.  So I didn't.  For 11 years.  Now that I have unpacked (in 1997), I'm no longer interested in moving, ever, because then I would have to unpack again.  Maybe.  Or maybe I'll just give all my stuff away and go live in a tent with my cats.  I won't give their stuff away, of course, because it's theirs, so I would be living in a tent with two cats and all their cat-slobber-covered stuff.  Still, it beats unpacking.  23. Not making that sarcastic comment when I feel it welling up inside. I can't help it!  I think this is related to #7, saying the right thing in quasi-romantic situations.  In any case, it's explosive, and it's gonna blow.  Actually, a former (HOT!) boyfriend of Lisa's (ca. early 1992) had the best story about this ever.  I'll get to that in a minute.  First, let me expound on his hotness.  Eric was unbelievably hot, probably the only boyfriend of Lisa's I ever actually coveted.  He was a giant, warehouse-club-sized Teutonic thing (my favorite), blonde, blue-eyed, funny, somewhat nerdy (my other favorite), had a butt that could make Michelangelo cry (my other other favorite) and was an incredible musician.  He played Bach on one of those little plastic electric organs so beautifully, he actually made it sound like a musical instrument.  Plus, he was apparently, er, gifted in other delightful areas.  They started carrying on when I told Lisa that if she didn't do anything about his hotness, I was going to have to, because it would be wrong to let all that hot Todesco go to waste.  I think he eventually turned into a freak and went away, but I don't know the details.  So anyway, Eric's friend is driving through Georgia and gets pulled over by this redneck cop for going 56 in a 55 or some bullsh*t thing like that.  The redneck cop says, (picture the drawl) "Noboday goes through *mah* state that fay-est."  To which Eric's friend replies, "Sherman did."  They spent the night in jail.    For that great a line, so would I.  In New York one time, I actually had someone ask me how to get to Carnegie Hall, but I haven't had THAT great a setup, ever.  24. Turning the other cheek when challenged directly. Some aspects of my personality are a little, well, wolfish.  I chewed up a few folks when I was GSAC president just because they invaded my territory and pissed me off.  One poor schmuck from the Business School (95% of those who need a good chewing at D.U. are from there) came to a meeting with a brand new management course under his belt and no information about the organization and proceeded to criticize my people and their work.  I'm sorry to say I went Alpha Bitch on his ass.  I'm not proud of it, but he was belly-crawlingly submissive every time I saw him afterward.  25. Saying no in the face of flattery. I can't believe how many things I've been suckered into by cheap flattery, even when I see right through it!  26. Keeping my hands to myself. No, it's not what you think.  I have goosed relatively few strangers.  It's just that being so tactile, I like to touch everything.  I was at the Botanical Gardens today, and I couldn't keep my mitts off the plants.  Some of them were so wispy or bumpy or strange, I just *had* to find out what they felt like.  And, hey, if there is anything around to pet, I'm pettin' it!  27. Goosing strangers. I frequently want to, but I almost never do it.  28. Jumping on the fashion bandwagon. I'm sorry, I can't get over all those uglyass shoes!  Remeber *why* we wore those bellbottoms in the 70s, folks?  That's right, to hide those offensively bad shoes!  I just can't do it.  And I'm not sticking my TV in an armoire, either--it's okay if people know I have a TV.  And you know what else?  I'm not growing my bangs out, so there!  I don't have the forehead for it and I'm not going to have an addition built onto my forehead just so I can grow my bangs out.  I need these babies.  Leave me alone.  Oh, and I hate the color coral.  29. Asking for directions.   Apparently, I'm "as bad as a man" in this department.    30. Thriving on disorder. Related to #10, remembering important things just because they're important, I have a whole system of Scatterbrain Management that helps me appear to be a normally functioning human being.  When my environment is disorderly, the system begins to break down and my scatterbrainedness begins to show through the cracks in the facade.  I hate that.  31. Tolerating pretentiousness. As many opportunities as I have had to learn this valuable skill, I've blown them all.  I mean a "vahz" is just a vase that cost more than fifty clams, right?  You're still just going to put some dead plants in there and let them get deader, yeah?  32. Politely eating things I don't like. It's true, I'm an insanely picky eater.  Also, many of the things I hate the most are really common, like cucumbers, tomatoes, and eggplant.  I couldn't choke down a lovely gaspacho if my life depended on it.    33. Being photogenic. I consider myself an "active beauty".  I'm usually in motion in some way or another, and to freeze that motion on film, it's, well, kind of like a roulette wheel.  You never know what kind of goofy position I'll be immortalized in.  It almost never looks right.  34. Cooking meat. Now, I can cook.  You didn't think I got to be nine-foot-six by waiting around for someone to make me a sandwich, did you?  But I stopped eating meat (okay, occasional seafood excepted) before I started cooking for myself, so it's a skill I've never really acquired.  I made Phillip a turkey once when we were living in Maryland being starving lovers.  It grew a giant fat bubble under its armpit while it was cooking, and puzzled and horrified me before I called everyone I knew whom I suspected had ever cooked a turkey and hilarity ensued.  35. Disguising my cinemaphobia. I'm afraid of films.  Not movies, not flicks, just films.  I was traumatized by being forced to sit through "Fanny and Alexander" as a child, and I have never been the same since.  I fear film may waste my time and my money and not entertain me, ever.  When I go to the movies, I like raw escapism: explosions, ridiculous plotlines that test the "yuh" factor.  If I want heavy and slow and meaningful, I'll go look at my own depressing life for free.  Sometimes, though, even I'm not satisfied with escapist entertainment.  Like in "Mission Impossible 2" where Tom Cruise and the bad guy are fighting on the beach toward the end of the movie (which as a whole really does strain the "yuh" factor quite a bit), and they're both bruised and bleeding and covered with cuts and trying to hurt each other, and yet they both completely fail to dunk the other one into the ocean.  Anyone who has ever shaved her legs before going to the beach could tell you how effective a move that would have been.  The cut-covered dunk-ee would almost certainly be incapacitated and screaming like a little girl in no time, but no.  No, just a little sand, no salt water.  Wusses.  36. Relationships. How come I have to have a relationship?  How come nobody has romances or love affairs anymore?  I don't want to talk about my feelings and communicate and behave like Cosmo quizzes are some source of wisdom.  I want to dance down the street like Fred and Ginger and walk around in the rain laughing together and take weird compliments in the spirit in which they're intended and have wild monkeysex on the kitchen table and leave before it gets stale and old and painful, and then think about it years later and smile at the rain on the window remembering those weird compliments and breaking that kitchen table beyond any hope of repair.  Yeah, here's lookin' at you, kid.  Of course, I'm not a member of the Wives Union on account of I'm more of a homewrecker than a homemaker.  Although I am also pretty good at table repair.  Hey, maybe I can even come up with 100 of these...

      Passing for half-whatever  Some of us who are odd ethnic mixes like to play a game called "passing for half-whatever."  It works like this: you tell people you're half some really exotic ethnicity, and whoever passes for the most exotic (or silly) one, wins.  I'm Italian and Welsh (dark-featured but pale enough to roast while changing a lightbulb), and a pretty good bluffer, so I do okay.  My friend Mark is a sensational bluffer of uncertain origins (he's adopted), and he's terrific at it.  I think we've all met our match, though, in a co-worker of mine at the bike shop, who is Irish and Philippino, and can pass for half ANYTHING.     Part of what's fun about this game is of course that you get people to think about their own internal ethnic stereotyping systems.  Another part of what's fun is that you get to feel exotic rather than weird-looking, which is always nice when you've never really been sure which you are.  And then of course there's the bullsh*tting factor, where you get to test the limits of human gullibility.  All in all, very entertaining.  Fun With Ethnicity, writ large.  I've passed for half Mongolian, half Inuet, half Tibetan, and a host of other ones, despite the fact that I'm incredibly western- (if ethnic-) looking.  How anyone can mistake this blatantly Celtic chin and coloring for anything else is a mystery to me.  Mark kind of reminds me of Buckaroo Banzai (one of my heroes) and has also passed for having a number of exotic half-backgrounds.  But Chuck recently knocked it out of the park when he got a bar full of people to buy that he was Samoan.    I should probably begin by saying that Chuck *might* be 145 pounds soaking wet.  He's sort of tall and willowy, with very long straight dark hair and dark eyes.  I would consider him attractive, and I'm sure he gets hit on all the time when he's behind the bar.  If he were a dog, he'd probably be something like a Borzoi, pretty and graceful with delicate feet and slender ankles.  At the shop, he's also my favorite contestant on "I'm Not Your F*cking Therapist," but that's another story.  Let's just say that being a bartender has made Chuck a good listener.    So anyway, Chuck goes in to work and finds this old nametag behind the bar that says "Paul".  He whites out the "L" so it just says "Pau" and tells everyone in the bar he's Samoan.  And they buy it.  That beats the hell out of my half Nepalese.  All hail Pau!

      I have a few high-profile talents that make it look like I'm good at a lot of things.  However, I want to assure those who keep asking me if there are things I'm not good at that there are PLENTY!  Stuff I Suck at in No Particular Order:  1. Miniature golf I like it, but I'm lucky to break 60.  2. Bowling Same deal.  3. Anything requiring vertical depth perception (basketball, volleyball, playing outfield, etc.) Seems to be congenital.  I look up, I have no idea how far away something is. I can eventually beat it with excessive skill-specific practice, but I just don't like volleyball that much.  4. Talking about my feelings Can't I just have root canal instead?  I'm interested in other people's feelings, though.  5. Linear algebra I have great mathematical intution, but when it comes to lame little linear equations, I tend to drop little details and come out with the wrong answer.  I'm usually better off just looking at the logic of the equation and guessing.  6. Asking for help Rather re-invent the wheel than ask for a pump...  7. Saying the right thing in a quasi-romantic situation. Two recent examples: 1. Him: I forgot how beautiful you are. Me: Man, do you have a shitty memory. 2. Him: You seem nice. Me: Eh, what do you know?  8. Dealing with The Public. Like people, hate the public.  I have pretty sketchy people skills with them, which is why I can't work serious hard-core retail, and part of why they keep me in the back at the bike shop.  9. Skateboarding. I sprained my ankle in June attempting to skateboard for the first time.  It was like the thing was equipped with an ejection system, sensed that I was over 30 and flung me right off.  10. Remebering important things just because they're important. I know it *looks* like I remembered that important meeting, and to go to ballet class, and your birthday, but I didn't.  I wrote it down because I knew I wouldn't.  11. Sitting still. No kidding, I'm still fidgety after all these years.  I think it's because I'm so tactile, positions get uncomfortable relatively quickly, and I have to shift around a lot or I feel like I'm in restraints (and not the fun naughty kind).  12. Being polite when I'm trapped listening to a really annoying lecture. If I can't get away, the sarcasm is coming out.  I have been known to heckle.  13. Sitting around watching TV. I'm sort of a worky person.  Even the things I do for fun are just a different kind of work.  I can sit there with the TV on, but I'm usually happier if I'm doing something else, too.  14. Pointe work. Okay, I don't really suck at this anymore, but I have no natural aptitude for it either.  I can do it because I work really hard at it.  I know lots of other dancers who have been on pointe for less time than I have, who don't practice as much, and who are really phenomenal at it.  Look for my Balanchine rant in a later posting...  15. Doing girlie things with girlie girlfriends I didn't start having real girlfriends until late in life, and in a pack, I'm still intimdated by them.  I'm still not down with jewelry shopping, but I can be talked into girls' night out.  16. Keeping my mouth shut about piss-poor auto modification Don't these yahoos who put enormous tires on their trucks know that that f*cks up the whole system?!  An automobile is a system, not a collection of parts.  Modify one thing and you must modify the system (or break it).  Their only crime was ignorance, but I just can't leave these dipsh*ts alone.  17. Being nice to the willfully ignorant It's one thing to be stupid.  It's one thing to be ignorant but willing to learn.  But it's something completely else to be reasonably intelligent, ignorant, and want to stay that way.  Wait, I feel a haiku coming on:  Ignorance is bliss. You don't know, don't want to know. Wrath is ill-contained.  18. Accepting injustice Oh yes, even the teensy, toonsy kind.  I can't tell you how many times this one has gotten me into trouble.  Barfights, ejections from buses, playground battles, having security called on me, court appearances...  As a small child in daycare, I once got punished for something I didn't even do, and in a moment of youthful passive resistant strategy, shouted out, "Come on, kids, let's all pee our pants!"  I was the only one with the cajones to do it, but the fact that every adult in the room froze was pretty satisfying.  There's lots more.  I'll keep you posted.

      Ah, it's that time of year again.  The time of year when I am reminded that my formal education will be old enough to run for Congress this year, and I'm still in freakin' school.  A friend suggested I post a speech here that I gave a few years ago at the All-University Convocation at the University of Denver (Theme: Into the 21st Century).  I had just become the President of the Graduate Student Association.  The organization was in shambles and we didn't even have an office or access to a phone, although somehow we were still paying for our campus phone line.  The previous year's president had left me nothing but a box of old letterhead and the memory of those cute dimples that made me come to meetings in the first place.  Nobody knew how to reach us and I was getting a hard time from the few folks who knew me on sight for not showing up at meetings I had no idea were even going on.  I found out a couple of days before Convocation that I was expected to throw on some academic regalia and give a speech to the whole freakin' University.  I was starting to get that What Have I Done feeling.  This year, I'm the Vice President of that organization, after an unprecedented three years as President (and one the year before that as Treasurer).  I'm enjoying watching someone else in the role do it differently from the way I did it, and I'm trying to be available for questions.  I was hoping I was non-control-freaky enough to sit back and enjoy, and so far, so good.  In the meantime, now that I don't have to look professional and put together for meetings on campus anymore, the upper-level administrative types who used to make small talk with me on the paths of the campus don't recognize me in my Carhartts and Hawaiian shirt.  It's fun!  In retrospect, I couldn't really have made the organization any worse off, and once I realized that, it was pretty liberating.  I think I made some positive contributions to the University community, and I may be able to make a few more before I graduate.  Those of you who have heard me talk about the importance of imagination and cite George Jetson's video conferencing are about to find out that I'm plagarizing myself.   Convocation Speech, October 5, 1999  When I was in third grade, my teacher asked my class how old we would be in the year 2000.  Although I was alarmed at the outcome of my figuring, I was soon relieved.  The year 2000 was so far away.  I would never be *that* old.  After school that day, I watched a little black-and-white TV, tried a new kind of sandwich called a "fluffernutter" and played some records, secure in the knowledge of impossibly large-numbered birthdays that would never come.  Now, as I contemplate the many 29th birthdays still ahead of me, I can safely say that the future is what we make it.    This year, I have inherited a strong and willful organization: one that dynamically meets its long-term goals despite annual changes in leadership and membership.  One good example is that the Graduate Student Association Council now recognizes and funds interdisciplinary organizations as part of its ongoing commitment to building community among graduate students.  It was a good idea in 1997, when the planning began; in 1998, when most of the hard work and administrative construction took place; last October when my predecessor stood before many of you predicting that recognized interdisciplinary organizations would become reality that very academic year; and the following spring, when GSAC voted to recognize and fund the first few such organizations.  During that time, GSAC had three different presidents, and not a single student who was on the Council in the 1997-98 academic year is still on it.  I believe much of GSAC's success in meeting its goals has to do with the fact that the larger goal, to build community among graduate students, doesn't change.  The smaller (but no lesser) goals along the way are accomplished over time, despite changes in membership, because the commitment to improving our experience here as graduate students continues to drive us, and because the ideal for which we strive looks similar to us from year to year.  Perhaps "one can never step in the same stream twice," but certainly the stream maintains patterns and characteristics that make it timeless.  With many of the barriers inhibiting interdisciplinary cooperation between graduate students now overcome, and with organizational supports erected in their place, we are in a new (and perhaps final) phase of community-building: it's time we come out and meet each other, that we begin the conversations that will become projects and ongoing dialogs.  GSAC is currently entertaining plans for quarterly campus-wide events; for setting up a website that can circumvent the collaborative challenges of our respective schedules and commitments by making the hour of our contact more or less unimportant; as well as for a campus-wide newsletter that will serve as a clearinghouse of information about each school's and organization's events and concerns, and perhaps even that which arguably ties all communities together: gossip.  In thinking about the future, about the daunting task of setting the new goals to be accomplished by graduate students I may never know who will sit in my old chair and read my old meeting agendas (and leave bite marks in my old pencil--that part drives me crazy), I can't help but contemplate the futuristic.  A friend of mine this summer, upon seeing the new Star Wars movie, commented on how sad it was that our generation squandered its energy on *visions* of progress, on futuristic-looking entertainment, rather than on the drive toward transforming their world itself into a realm of the future.  I can't agree.  When I think of the movie "2001," I think of how the computer consoles of the following decade bore a striking resemblance to those depicted in the movie.  I think about how the look and feel of the battles in the original "Star Wars" influenced not just the entertainment industry, but the weaponry designed and built in the decade following its release.  I think about how George Jetson first demonstrated video conferencing.  Progress grows out of a shared imagination.  We are already looking at the future and participating in shaping it on a daily basis.  I urge you to take advantage of this exciting stage of community construction, to talk to each other, to begin sharing ideas and collaborating.  Only in participating in what we collectively imagine do we create our collective future.

      Friday is Sophia Loren's 68th birthday.  I feel this is a perfect occasion for my rant on feminine beauty and cultural weirdness.  First off, Sophia Loren is gorgeous.  She's smack-yourself-in-the-head-with-your-own-shoes sexy, even in her late 60s, and the raciest thing she ever did as an entertainer was to climb out of the Aegean in a long-sleeved shirt.  Compare her vivid natural beauty and sensuousness to the women we see on the covers of magazines, and one wonders if they're even the same organism.    So here's what really frosts me about that.  I'm in Walgreens with my friend Brooke last week.  Now, Brooke is a lovely, charming woman.  She's a genuinely good person, has a great sense of humor, and is a very promising, sharp young engineer.  She has a pretty face, beautiful big deep blue eyes, chin-length strawberry-blonde hair, and a great smile.  She also blushes at the drop of a hat, and would be mortified to know that I'm telling the entire Internet that she's lovely.  Sorry, Brooke, it's true.  Here's the thing, though.  Every other comment that came out of her mouth was some sort of self-deprecating allusion to what she perceived to be very real flaws in herself and her appearance.  So here's this beautiful woman talking about what's supposedly unattractive about her, and hell if I can see it, and I told her so.  I found myself wondering who convinced this ravishing creature that this conversation wouldn't be pure satire.  Was it a clean-your-plate kind of thing: take it all out on yourself, there are ugly people in Burma who would love to have that criticism?  I'm going to tell you two secrets here.  The first one is this:  THE BEAUTY/FASHION INDUSTRY IS A SCAM.  You better believe they work overtime to try to make us all think we're substandard somehow, so they can sell us their crap!  The minute we start believing we're fine the way we are, they go bankrupt.  Fortunately, they have giant media access and can bombard us with images of our own imperfections at will.  They work on our most vulnerable insecurities: whether we ultimately believe we are attractive, and therefore lovable.  Those f*ckers!  Hey, don't you buy into that!  It's just a business, like anything else.  You don't believe you're a jerk for not driving a Humvee and taking a cruise and buying the latest toilet paper of the month, do you?  Well, you don't need every damn beauty invention, either.  You probably aren't even showing some arbitrary seven signs of aging, and even if you were, so what?  Besides, what are they telling us we're supposed to look like?  These models they're always sticking in our faces?  Well, you know what?  Models don't look like that either.  For the most part, you'd just pass them on the street and think they were sort of plain and gawky looking.  These are women that have just had a whole staff of people work on them for a few hours to make them look like that (you know, alike).  If you or I had a staff of dozens working on our appearances, we would look just as surreal.  And I do mean surreal.  What is the story with these waify lookin' deals that are supposed to be so attractive, with their bones sticking out and their skin kinda hanging off them?  I'm sorry, but you can't convince me that's attractive.  Hey, Kate Moss!  Have a freakin' sandwich!  You're weirding me out!  The deal is, there are about seven designers and four photographers that decide what they'd like to look at and photograph this season, and they dictate this as fashion.  That's it.  Totally capricious.  And then we as consumers are supposed to run out and buy whatever it is they're selling to keep them in business.    The truth is, though, that even if we're supposed to believe, contrary to what our evolutionary programming tells us, that emaciated women are more attractive than healthy ones, it has been my experience that the male brain is hardwired for response to curves, no matter what those designers and photographers say.  Having a certain fashionable look might have an appeal of sorts, but look at the enduring hotties of all time: Marilyn Monroe, for example, and our guest star, Sophia Loren.  Yeah, smoldering and curvy all over.  Twiggy?  What the hell has she done lately?  Do we even know?  Salome, hot enough to get John the Baptist whacked, you think she had celery and Evian for breakfast?!  Here's something else alarming: those runway models who appear to be at least mildly curvy under that underwear?  Those are shoulder pads.  I kid you not.  These women are using artificial padding to fill out underwear in place of the curves they have starved off their own bodies.    How do I know what goes on inside models' undergarments?  I confess I had a flirtation with modeling in my early mid teens.  Why?  Honestly, I was afraid I was ugly.  When I walked into a modeling agent's office at 14 and she told me I had a beautiful face, great coloring and the perfect shoulders for modeling furs, I felt valued in a way I never had before.  That was the beginning.  The end was recovering from a years-old eating disorder in my mid-20s.  So I'm not just bent out of shape about this because I'd like Brooke to realize she's gorgeous.  It's informed, and it's personal.  So here's the second secret.  Being beautiful doesn't have a damn thing to do with what products you buy, and being sexy doesn't even have anything to do what what you look like.  Take Mata Hari for instance.  Ever seen a picture of her?  Oof, kinda horsey.  If she were to go into a fashion photographer's office looking for portfolio work, he would tell her she's "too short," the polite industry kiss-off for being unworkably unattractive.  Yet, she is regarded as the epitome of the alluring female spy.  Her lovers were a who's who of powerful men who could have pretty much any women they wanted, and did.  And they didn't just want her because of her dancing skills.  They loved her and trusted her with things as sensitive as the military secrets of their nations (which she promptly sold, of course, but that's not the point).    Beauty has to do with uniqueness and being pleasing to the senses.  We can all find that, right?  We all have some great feature and the ability to be reasonably pleasant.  Being sexy is purely in your head.  It's so simple: feel yummy and you will be yummy.  I'm not kidding.  Have a sexual fantasy while you're walking down the street sometime and see who notices you.    Lest you doubt my authority on this matter, I have a little empirical research to offer.  By magazine standards, I'm not so much.  My nose isn't straight.  A couple of my bottom teeth are crooked.  Like any natural mammal, my bilateral symmetry isn't exact.  If one looks closely, one might observe that I have freckles, a few gray hairs, and the map of where my crow's feet will be is extant.  I am sorry to report that I even have some cellulite, and when I'm not in training, I'm often just a little squishier than I like to be.  I'm model-tall at 5'9", but everything else is in scale to that.  My hands are too big for nicely tailored women's gloves.  Girl shoes?  Forget it.  I'm also too broad across the shoulders to be even a male fighter pilot, and I'm relieved that short jeans are in style because now it doesn't matter that the fashion industry apparently considers me too leggy to be allowed to own pants.  And jeez, lingerie stores.  You're what size?  Honey, nice people don't grow huge breasts, they BUY them.  In the real world, though, the empirical evidence does not bear out the fashion industry's judgments on our attractiveness.  Since I can only speak to my own experience, here is a partial list of responses to my appearance alone in the last two weeks:  • A total stranger in a truck stop shyly told me I had the most beautiful long hair. • Two different men in two different cars screeched to two different halts in traffic to ask for my phone number. • At the dance studio where I work, three other women had a conversation in my presence about why they thought I was beautiful. • A man I had never seen in my life ran up to me and gave me a rose, just like in that 80s Impulse fragrance commercial. • A little boy told me he wanted to marry me when he grew up. • A very attractive woman gave me her phone number and a suggestive pat (I won't say where). • Three different women asked who colors my hair.  So either I'm in the midst of some kind of mass hysteria out here, or the fashion industry is TOTALLY FREAKIN' WRONG about what's attractive.  I think what's attractive is what's genuine and real, and I'm not just saying that because maintanence of the artificial is annoying and time-consuming.  I say it because few things I've done have gotten more attention than my beautiful and exotic-looking friend Amy and I feeding each other dessert in a swanky cafe.  I say it because I feel waaaaaay sexier in a size 12/14 than I ever did in a size 2/4 (of course, in my case, I was 150 really pointy pounds in a size 4).  And I say it because Sophia Loren is still a hottie at 68, and you can't get that sh*t out of a jar.

      When I was growing up, sarcasm was valued more than, say, adequate shelter.  The first time I ever made a roomful of grownups laugh, it was a greater rite of passage than when I got my driver's license.    My father was having a dinner party, and I was there because I was grounded, so I must have been about thirteen.  Now that I think about it, I believe I got grounded for being 20 feet away from where my father was supposed to pick me up, around the corner of a building, holding hands and talking with my boyfriend.  I got busted for all the little stuff, you know?  The time I came in with my bold 80s geometric print shirt on very obviously inside out, my old man had already gone to bed.  Anyway, back to the party.  One of my dad's friends had brought some tulips and put them in a bowl of water.  She mentioned to the room as a helpful hint that if you put a penny in the water, the tulips would open very slowly and it would be really beautiful.    "Maybe if you put a quarter in, they'll open faster," I commented.  My old man beamed.

      What the hell does the Arrow of Entropy have to do with what time it is in Palau?  So I've been playing fast and loose with time and space.  I got an idea for a short piece a while back and in order to properly research and write it, I started reading a lot of quantum theory.  I can't tell you about the piece because then I would have to tell you how I got inspired to write it in the first place, and the answer might tend to incriminate me.    This is not the first time I've twiddled with time, I'm afraid.  In addition to my youthful wishings for future events and the like, I also had a job being obsessed with time.  I worked on Emergency Alert System when it first came out in 1997.  I was Burk Technology's Assistant Project Director for EAS.  One of the problems the product was having was with its time zone logic.  Our signal couldn't make the leap over those red dotted lines in the road atlas, and the product was about to be released.  It was my job that week to figure out what the problem was and explain to the programmers how it might be fixed.  I started by compiling a list of all time zones in which the U.S. had any kind of populated landmass at all and ordering a giant official time zone map from the Bureau of Standards.  When the map came, I flattened it out on my desk and stared at it for about two weeks while I tried different things and attempted to solve the puzzle.  It took a long time to get really flat.  I had to stick stuff on the corners at first, which obscured my view of places like Zymlia.    As for the time zones, the U.S. has territories from GMT+4 to -10: from islands off the east coast of the mainland moving consecutively west to Palau, the U.S.'s westernmost territory, which is on the same time as Tokyo.  That's 12 time zones, half of the earth.  In the immortal words of They Might Be Giants, "I don't want the world, I just want your half."    During the project, I called a lot of interesting people in a lot of interesting places and had a lot of strange conversations.  I called the Royal Observatory in Greenwhich, because they're sort of the appointed timekeepers of the planet.  I called the U.S. Pacific Fleet Operations Center in Hawaii, because they have to coordinate giant military efforts over several time zones and even take into consideration that sticky International Date Line.  I actually got the naval officer at the Op Center to laugh out loud, which was almost better than solving the problem.  When I asked him what they called their time zone there at GMT+10, he referred to the alphabetic system.  The +10 time zone is also marked with a W, otherwise known by military alphabet (able, baker, charlie, etc.) as Whiskey Time.  "I bet you're always having a great time over there," I commented.  Yaaaaay, it's whiskey time!    Anyway, once I learned how the whole system worked, I set about teaching our equipment.  I piled up three of our boxes in the lab, hooked them up to each other to simulate line-of-sight, and tried to get them to go into hysterics together.  It turned out the problem was not with the forwarding logic as I had originally suspected, but with the time markers in our messages.  The National Weather Service gives weather warnings in their own absolute time.  Our equipment correctly transmitted those messages verbatim.  So the messages themselves were probably making it over the dotted line after all--they were just being disregarded as having expired.  Once I confirmed this hypothesis, I requested a code fix so the boxes would keep track of GMT as well as local time, and then I changed their method of tracking local time so that it would be relative to GMT by re-coding all the time zones based on my understanding of the whole wacky artificial system.  Essentially, I gave our equipment a sense of relative time.  I wondered what Einstein--or Heinlein, for that matter--would think about teaching relative time to a fleet of weather machines.  On that project, I also got to use my skills as a chaoticist for the first time and get paid for it.  The box's printer, a teensy little mimeo-blue-printing dot matrix that ran on adding machine tape, would occasionally freak out and print part of one message along with part of another, and once the process started, eventually the printouts would get completely out of phase with each other.  I think after you look at enough fractals, theorize enough models, and wind up enough differential equations to watch 'em go, you get a sort of Spidey sense about when you're looking at some kinda chaotic phenomenon, and I was up to my spiritual horn-rimed eyeholes in arachniod twitch.  So I assigned each line in a standard message a number and started expressing each looped message as an iteration, just to see what I might be looking at.    It was beautiful!  After any event that would perturb the message printing, such as overlapping incoming messges, a static zap, or even thinking unclean thoughts in the printer's vacinity, the message would begin cycling backward.  More interestingly, it would begin cycling backward at a rate of just over .4 1/2 lines per cycle.  I didn't have the equipment to calculate it precisely, but I knew exactly what I was looking at: .466920, Feigenbaum's formulation, one decimal place removed.  Classic chaos.  I was so delighted, I played with it for the rest of the day, predicting its unpredictability for anyone I could rope in to watch for a few seconds.  It was a small company, though, and pretty soon I ran out of audience.  Then came the sad part.  Knowing our customers wouldn't be as delighted with their chaotic toy as I was, I put in an order for the code to reset the printer after each message.  After all, I was being paid to figure out how to make it stop.  I kind of missed the old printouts, though, and I think I saved a few.  They were like weather warnings from inside a rift in time.  Thrilled to pieces with the practical application of my lifepassion, this was about the time I started habitually pointing out how everyone needs a chaoticist.  That building fell down?  That's why everyone needs a chaoticist.  Her company went bankrupt?  That's why everyone needs a chaoticist.  Your ham sandwich was eaten by wolves?  That's why everyone needs a chaoticist.  Yeah, a good chaoticist could have told you what to watch out for.  It was also during the time zone project that I was thinking about my search for Home, a recurrent theme of my life.  I became sort of obsessed with what time it was in different places (I can still tell you what time it is just about anywhere--especially Palau).  Someone told me once that the place you really belong is where the sun was rising at the time of your birth.  According to that theory, Home for me is somewhere in, oh yes: Whiskey Time!!!    So anyway, recently, I have been working on this piece about time, time travel, time perception, time metaphors, time and distance, etc., so I've been reading a bunch of quantum theory.  It does a really good job of distracting me from writing my dissertation, but I feel like I have to get it out of my system somehow, so I'm finding it kind of hard to stop.  Okay, it was easier to quit smoking.  Is there a 12-step program for quantum junkies, or some kind of outpatient rehab where you go to a clinic and they give you a chronograph?  Anyway, I've discovered a few things about quantum theory that really get under my skin, and not in that fun Cole Porter way.  Whenever something bothers me I have to wrangle around with it until it resolves somehow.  I can't help it.  I suspect if I can get some of this stuff straightened out, I can clutch my chrono-methodone and get on with the project at hand.  Now, some of this may just be that I'm an outsider to quantum theory and I just don't get a lot of stuff yet.  I have a long way to go to earn my fantasy business cards: Meg Spohn, Mechanic: Volkswagen - Bicycle - Quantum.  But then again, it could also be WICKED WRONG!  Probably we'll never live long enough to know.  Goddamn discrete/continuous experience of time!  The thing that really chafes me the most is the Arrow of Entropy.    Now, the frickin' arrow of entropy is this concept that time is linear and going in one direction only, like a perfectly straight arrow, as evidenced by the fact that while teacups tumble off of tables and smash, they never hop back up off the floor and reassemble themselves.  Okay, I concede I've never actually witnessed the spontaneous reassembly of a teacup.  Should we ever witness such a thing, it will be because the closed universe has stopped expanding and is now contracting, and the arrow of entropy has completely reversed and is now traveling in the same straight linear manner in the opposite direction.    FTN!  It can't be.  As a devotee of nonlinear dynamics, I just can't buy it.  What kind of quasi-dimensional hoo-ha...?!  For one thing, this smacks of a perspective problem.  Doesn't the Earth seem flat from our limited everyday vantage point?  We only know better because we've seen bigger pictures.  Furthermore, an insect with a lifetime of only a few hours couldn't conceive of a circadian cycle.  Maybe we just don't have enough perspective to see the whole spiralling arrow and our little piece looks straight from here.  Also, get this, at the quantum level, when we look at the little granular bits and pieces of universe, events and their sequences aren't really important.  It doesn't matter whether the teacup fell off first or whether it came to be first or what--it's kind of like a Vonnegut novel.  It isn't until things get bigger that sequences of events start to matter.    This is the thing, though: time itself is a human construction.  The concept of events (and subsequently their sequences) is an artifact of the human psyche that has to do with making sense of our experience.  To a photon, if it perceives, the whole sequence of time from the Big Bang to this moment and beyond is all one simultaneous rush.  To us, we mark our thread of perception with stages and moments that we decide are important.  So if time is a human construction (and let's face it, the only tools we have for conceptualizing the reality of the universe are our hinky little brains), human percpetion itself tells us it's not linear.    I'm talking about memory.  When we visit the moments in time that have been important to us, we truly do travel there in our minds.  Part of me, the unique creature I was at one given moment, still lives only there, as I will never truly be that one unique creature in time again: the moment I survived a serious car accident; the instant I realized the WTC bombings were actually happening and not some punchline-less George Bush joke; the first time I ever got a standing ovation for a performance; the snapshots in time where I fell in love; the last time I fixed a previously inert air-cooled engine and it roared to life.  Since time itself lives only in the human mind, if it's not linear there, it's not linear anywhere else, either.  At least, I think that's what's bothering me about this.

      Lisa tells me I need a blog, and proceeds to set me up.  I believe I will start my own personal rant-fest with the email excerpt that prompted her to Make It So.  My husband Phillip sells cars for a living.  Last week, I came with him while he delivered a truck to a customer in Cheyenne.  There was this Orthodox church on the northbound side of I-25 (around Ft. Collins or so).  It had a blue Hershey's-kiss shaped spire and a gold one, with appropriate crosses, but the building itself was a little cottagey thing, sort of corrugated-looking, with a bright blue roof.  I questioned the potential sacrilege of converting an IHOP into a church, and hilarity ensued.  Top 5 related comments:  5.  I'd ask you if you wanted sausage or ham with your host, but we're orthodox, so you don't get either one 4.  Phillip miming the administering of the host as if it were a pancake whose ends needed to be poked into the faithful's stretching maw 3.  Short stack of buttermilk salvation 2.  The boysenberry blood of Christ 1.  Rooty tooty fresh and fruity sacrament  Interestingly, on the southbound side of the highway not too far away was a rest stop I could swear was a gay tea room.  Lots of pretty boys cruising around alone in their expensive SUV's...

      In respose to my query at the end of my love letter to lube of a few weeks ago (October 13),  I have indeed received a few sex column questions worthy of answer.  I suppose I may or may not get around to answering them all, as Lisa is running a family site here and I don't want to piss off anyone's grandma.    That being said, this week marks the anniversary of the loss of my virginity, so it only seemed right to launch into one of the tamer questions and thus start my occasional sex column feature.  In opening, I give a nod to my long-lost cherry.  Had I known Rich Witherow would be along a few months later for me to fall in love with, I might have held off and not at that time let said cherry go rolling away under the sofa to join loose change and odd socks, lo, these many years.  Perhaps, now being of age, it will come out to vote.  So the question involves my friend, let's call her Anna.  Anna is so intensely attracted to this very shy, totally hot guy she knows casually that she is sure that anyone in a ten-mile radius is aware of her responses to him--except of course for the guy in question, who is totally not paying attention.  She really wants to take him to bed, but is not really sure he is interested.  How does she get Mr. Shy in the sack?  Hmmm.  There's a classic dilemma.  Which comedienne was it who said, "Women need a reason to have sex; men just need a place?"  My initial response to Anna was that Anna is a hottie, men are easy, just go for it, chance of rejection is relatively low, kind of a no-brainer.  But I, thinking in my usual guylike way, had totally missed the point.  This is atually a twofold dilemma:    1.  The shyness itself is a potential problem.  What if he thinks Anna is a total slut for coming onto him, and, will he get it if she is? 2.  The logistics of making a move.  What exactly should she do to make said first move?  To the first point, I can empathize with this.  As y'all know, I like 'em nerdy, and most of those nerdy guys who do soooo much for me are terribly, sometimes painfully, shy.  In fact, for me, that's part of their allure.  When I'm scoping out a party, I'm not interested in that pretty boy with the phony laugh and way more product in his hair than I would ever have, holding court with as many women as he can suck into his black hole of charm.  Whereas, if there is a mildly cute guy in the corner with a big fat book, I am intrigued.  Plus, built-in opening line: whatcha readin'?  Then, if you get it, juicy conversation, if you don't, you get to make him explain it to you and you get to see if there really is a sexy brain in there.    The key to dealing with deliciously shy and/or awkward men is the same as dealing with anyone else gracefully.  Any etiquette book worth a sh*t (you have to say that when you're talking about etiquette books) will tell you that the essence of good manners is about making others feel comfortable and welcome around you.  In an extreme case, if your guest drinks his fingerbowl, you by-god drink yours.  Putting particularly shy folks at ease is often as simple as steering them into conversational territory where they're supremely comfortable long enough for them to relax and let their natural coolness come out.  This deliciously nerdy creature Anna has her eye on is working on a pretty interesting research project.  Talk about that.  Locate areas of intersecting interest within his topic and talk about those.  Talk about his pets or his hobbies.  Let the conversation flow wherever.  Be polite and interested, be patient about getting to know him a little better, and above all else, be yourself.  So okay, after a little while, you're kind of casual friends, maybe you've had some coffee or hung out or whatever.  How to get past the shyness hurdle from the romantic end?  Will he think Anna is a total slut if she makes a move?  Well, under the patient cultivation method, he already knows her, so no.  Plus, if I were an incredibly shy nerdy guy and some total biscuit like Anna came onto me, I would be thrilled to pieces.  And the truth is, sometimes with these shy, nerdy types, they will never, EVER make the first move and it really is up to you.    Then of course comes my favorite part, the very thing that keeps me coming back to the nerdy ones every time: opening the floodgates.  The romantic notions and sexual creativity that have been holing up in that big juicy brain are unimaginable until you experience them.  Those few lines from Revenge of the Nerds after the nerd scores the sorority cheerleader really are true:  Are all nerds as good as you?  Yes.  Why is that?  Well, because all jocks think about is sports, and all nerds think about is sex.  Corny and forced, but true.  No kidding, university studies show that smart people are better in the sack.  Better responses, more creative ideas, more satisfying lovers.  Anna, you're in for a treat.  So you know you want it.  He might suspect you want it, but he is not stepping up.  How do you get that good nerd lovin'?  Well, subtlety is pretty much lost on straight men, so I don't recommend it.  Nothing more subtle than a good kiss that lasts 5 - 10 seconds will even register on the radar sweep.  You can wait for the right moment to plant one on him, or orchestrate a moment with a bottle of wine in a comfortable, casual atmosphere and see what happens.  But my very favorite advice (although I am rather more of a kisser myself) comes from the best sex book I have ever read in my life, entitled _Sex Tips for Straight Women from A Gay Man_.  That advice: Just Grab It.  I quote (p. xxii):  "We've had numerous conversations about when you've gotten the guy into striking distance but are unsure about what to do next.  Sure, you can look up into his eyes with a sexy come-hither glance.  You can throw your arms around his neck and deliver a deep, wet kiss.  Or you can slowly and seductively massage the knots out of his neck or back.  These might work, but in the end, there is only one method that is absolutely fail-safe.  Take a deep breath, emit a slow, audible exhale, look into his eyes and just grab it.  "You're probably saying to yourself that he'll think you're a slut.  Well, for a second, maybe.  But rest assured that any bad thoughts will be quickly dispelled by the novelty of your taking the lead and by your awesome performance.  This *will* make him happy.  A little ladylike initiative can go a long way.  Just Grab It is more than a piece of advice.  It's a way of life."  The authors even offer some precursory lines for just grabbing it, such as "To Your Buttoned-Down Accountant: 'Wait a second...let me get that thread off your pants.'"  Did I mention that this is the best sex book EVER?!  It's superbly well-written and hilarious in addition to being truly useful.  For me, most sex books are like a Unisom.  Oh, we should go out to dinner and then I tell him I'm not wearing underwear?  Did we steal that idea from "Flashdance"?  Call him at the office and tell him what I'm going to do to him later, then do it?  Oh, he won't be expecting that after dozens of women have already done it, maybe even this week.  Wear pearls to bed?  Come on, who does that?!  Who WANTS that?!  What am I, some kind of Donna Reed wannabe trying to be about four degrees less frigid?!  This book on the other hand has really terrific detailed information you can actually use.  Tips range from the philosophical to the physical/physiological to the step-by-step.  I highly recommend it for any woman who is reasonably comfortable with herself and the male anatomy and actually wants to make her male partners swoon with pleasure (as opposed to just making them wonder what kind of crap you've been reading).  I picked up this book myself because I was inspired by the prospect of one luscious partner in two ways.  First, as most of my partners have been American men, let's just say I'm accustomed to the Louisville Slugger, but I wasn't quite as confident about the subtle differences in handling a cricket bat.  Being a researcher, my first inclination was to go read up, but books that tell you wearing pearls to bed is sexy and not some sort of sad amature night weird thing to do don't cover such distinctions.  Whereas this book had some genuinely yummy specific ideas that I look forward to trying out at some point.  Second, men who are insanely good at cunnilingus (e.g. the aforementioned Mr. Luscious) have often been coached at it by having at some point been fortunate enough to have dated a lesbian.  In the same spirit, I had begun surveying my gay male friends for cricket bat advice when I found this gem.  So anyway, Anna, my advice to you is to spend a little time hanging out with Mr. Shy and then, when you feel ready, throw yourself at him.  You don't have to be overly aggressive, but you really do have to be direct.

      It's happening again.  Another James Bond movie is coming out in a matter of mere weeks!  If I were into guilt, James Bond would be a guilty pleasure of mine.  (As it is, more of a gilty pleasure, ho ho...)  Now, I know I'm not supposed to like James Bond movies.  All that sexism and secret agent whoring around and unethical political behavior and exloding vehicles, so little discourse.  Honestly, though, I really like a lot of explosions in my movies, and I probably wouldn't be an international relations scholar today if it weren't for 007.    I like the gadgets.  I like the explosions.  I like James' really stupid jokes.  I like the incredibly stupid names of the women he boinks.  I like the way the clothes and the furniture and the vehicles look.  I like the ridiculous plot points.  I like the music.  I like the wacky fight scenes.  I like the exotic locations.  I like the villains' lairs and elaborate plots.  I like the underwater action shots.  I like that Pierce Brosnan has stopped that really faggy prancing he did in Goldeneye, although he really is still too pretty to be Bond.  If you've seen *all* the Bond movies again and again, including the non-Broccoli ones, you know that there is not a single one that the original Austin Powers doesn't spoof.  You know that On Her Majesty's Secret Service was by far the most anomalous one, with the one-time Bond, George Lasenby (in a kilt no less, rowrrrrrrr!) getting rescued by Diana Rigg and then marrying her minutes before Telly Savalas' goons bust a cap in her ass (who loves ya, baby?).  You know that You Only Live Twice has by far the most gadgets, including the incomparable Little Nelly.  You know exactly how many casinos Bond visits and how many underwater fight scenes he's been in, and that Michele Yeoh wasn't the first Bond babe to kick ass.  My personal pre-Yeoh favorite would have to be Melina from For Your Eyes Only: a natural low-bullsh*t beauty with a crossbow.  More recently, I've wanted Teri Hatcher to get whacked for quite some time now, so Tomorrow Never Dies was rather satisfying in that regard.    Of course, everybody knows Connery was by far the best Bond.  He's closer to looking the part, too.  In the books, Bond looks a lot like Hoagie Carmichael--he's not supposed to be a pretty boy like Prancy Pierce.  Roger Moore was probably the worst one, although he did more of the movies than any of the other Bonds.  Toward the end there, all those face lifts were really taking their toll, too.  Every time he responded to something another character was saying, it looked like his eyeballs might fall right out of his head.  Also, the wind would blow his turkey wattle around and not his hair.  You know what I never figured out?  How come the villains don't just put a Baccarat table at the edge of a cliff?  When Bond comes running over, they can just shove him right off.  My favorite Bond movie moment is probably still when I went to see The World is Not Enough with my friend Michael (yes, the same one who read to me).  Michael is something of a lecherous world traveler himself, and also an international relations scholar, so I knew it would be a treat to see it with him.  At one point, they showed an establishing shot of a building and subtitled it "Baku", and Michael said incredibly loudly and with great disgust, "Oh, *that's* not Baku!"  People turned around and shushed and everything.  Only Michael could get away with that kind of proclamation.  I could go on and on, but I can tell I'm starting to scare you.  Let me just say how delighted I am that we're getting another Bond movie and leave it at that.

      Smutty Literature  One of my most abiding passions is smut lit.  I'm not talking about short pieces that begin, "Dear Penthouse, you're not going to believe this, but...".   I'm talking about the good stuff: Nabokov, Donne, Nin, Clelland, Whitman, Apuleis, the list goes on.  I don't drink blended scotch and I don't read weak smut.  As it is a conceit of the modern age that we invented sex for fun, I highly recommend smut lit, alone or with a friend.  There really is nothing like having very good sexy literature read to you very well.  My friend Michael did me that delightful service one afternoon when he spontaneously read me some Marquis de Sade, and I have never forgotten it.  I recently ran across a recording of Jeremy Irons reading an excerpt of Lolita (one of my favorite books of all time) and I almost swooned.  And so, today, I share this little piece with you.  Read it with someone you lust after.  The Geranium by Richard Brinsley Sheridan  In the close covert of a grove, By nature formed for scenes of love, Said Susan in a lucky hour,  Observe yon sweet geranium flower; How straight upon its stalk it stands, And tempts our violating hands: Whilst the soft bud as yet unspread, Hangs down its pale declining head: Yet, soon as it is ripe to blow, The stems shall rise, the head shall glow. Nature, said I, my lovely Sue, To all her followers lends a clue; Her simple laws themselves explain, As links of one continued chain; For her the mysteries of creation, Are but works of generation: Yon blushing, strong, triumphant flower, Is in the crisis of its power: But short, alas! its vigorous reign,  He sheds his seed, and drops again; The bud that hangs in pale decay, Feels not, as yet, the plastic ray; Tomorrow's sun shall bid him rise, Then, too, he sheds his seed and dies: But words, my love, are vain and weak, For proof, let bright example speak; Then straight before the wondering maid, The tree of life I gently laid; Observe, sweet Sue, his drooping head, How pale, how languid, and how dead; Yet, let the sun of thy bright eyes, Shine but a moment, it shall rise; Let but the dew of thy soft hand Refresh the stem, it straight shall stand: Already, see, it swells, it grows, Its head is redder than the rose, Its shrivelled fruit, of dusky hue,  Now glows, a present fit for Sue: The balm of life each artery fills, And in o'erflowing drops distils. Oh me! cried Susan, what is this? What strange tumultous throbs of bliss! Sure, never mortal, till this hour, Felt such emotion at a flower: Oh, serpent! cunning to deceive, Sure, 'tis this tree that tempted Eve; The crimson apples hang so fair, Alas! what woman could forbear? Well has thou guessed, my love, I cried, It is the tree by which she died; The tree which could content her, All nature, Susan, seeks the centre;  Yet, let us still, poor Eve forgive, It's the tree by which we live; For lovely woman still it grows, And in the centre only blows. But chief for thee, it spreads its charms, For paradise is in thy arms.-- I ceased, for nature kindly here Began to whisper in her ear: And lovely Sue lay softly panting, While the geranium tree was planting. 'Til in the heat of amorous strife, She burst the mellow tree of life. 'Oh, heaven!' cried Susan, with a sigh, 'The hour we taste--we surely die; Strange raptures seize my fainting frame, And all my body glows with flame; Yet let me snatch one parting kiss To tell my love I die with bliss: That pleased, thy Susan yields her breath; Oh! Who would live if this be death!'

      A possible solution to the Columbus Day dilemma and desserts for all...  Monday was Columbus Day.  For those of us of Italian extraction, Columbus Day is a big, joyous, fun deal with happy memories that stretch back into childhood and pride in all our accomplishments as Italian Americans, made possible by the first Guinea who stuck set piedi on this joint.  For those of us who have overdeveloped social consciences, Columbus Day symbolizes the beginning of the occupation and colonization of the Americas and is nothing to celebrate.  Being a Guinza with a social conscience, people ask me about this dilemma, and like most things, I don't think it really has to be a dilemma.  A few years ago, a professor of mine suggested celebrating a different great Italian.  What about DaVinci, he offered.  Since then, I have been celebrating DaVinci Day as my personal festive Guinea holiday.  DaVinci was unfortunately born on April 15th, or as we like to call it, *&^%$#@! Tax Day, but my taxes are always done in plenty of time to make my famous cannoli from the old-a fam'ly ray-cipi.  The secret to cannoli so good she make-a you cry is that it is not an American dessert.  That is, it is not outrageously sweet, yet as a dessert, incredibly satisfying.  If you go into a deli and they have something that looks like a cannoli but it's filled with some kinda sweetened whipped cream or something, run away.  It's WRONG!  People here cut corners because good cannoli is a labor of love and not all delis have time for that kind of carino.  You have to trust that Italians have been making kickass sensous dolci for millennia and just open your mind to the experience of cheese for dessert.  You don't want that thing in the case anyway, it's-a soggi, trust mi.    Proper cannoli has two components: a shell and filling.  The shell is made out of a very stiff dough with very dry vino in it that has gone through its own little spa vacation: rising, kneading, resting, rolled out really thin.  Then it's cut into squares and wrapped ever so carefully around special pastry tubes (mine are spring-loaded so I can slide the shells off them while I'm still holding the tube with tongs and not burn the bejesus out of my hands) and deep-fried for moments before being lovingly toweled off.  The oil must be super-hot because the shells have to be just-a so nice, and greasy shells are yucky (Italiano: iucci).  The filling is primarily ricotta cheese with a little sweetening, a little liquer, maybe some chocolate chips.  My filling is especially decadent because I use more liquer and more chocolate chips than anybody in my family.  I use orange liquer because next to assorted, my favorite flavor is chocolate and orange together.  Mint liquer, while it sounds like it would be good, is in actuality quite iucci, but chocolate is all right.  I have painstakingly experimented to determine exactly how much booze I can put in there before critical mass is reached and the fluffy filling collapses, and I know the amount almost to the molecule.  I use a Cuisinart to make my filling, which is also totally decadent thing to do, and I did have a minor moral crisis about it when I first started doing it.  But then I decided that Nonna Elizabeth would *definitely* have used a Cuisinart if she had one, and I went on my merry decadent way.  So you have your cooled off, light, barely crisp shells (the cooled off part is really important in avoiding getting third-degree cannoli burns and having to explain to the nice people at the emergency room what the hell a cannoli is) and your light fluffy decadent filling.  You want to go ahead and stick the filling in there, don'tcha?  Well, DON'T!  Not unless you're going to eat them *right now* because if you don't, they're going to get all soggy, and again, it's-a iucci.  Incidentally, I believe the Italian word for "soggy" is "inzuppato", or soupish.  Keep those components separate until you're just about to enjoy them.  So all these tricky things about cannoli conspire to make it a real project, which is why I rarely undertake it more than once a year.  It takes hours, but as DaVinci knew, you can't rush art, and it's sort of a tribute.  Anyway, that's how I handle Columbus Day: not by justifying what he did or by condemning him for doing it when he was but a product of his dark and ignorant time, but by celebrating DaVinci with sensuously edible art.  Viva Italia!

      On Selecting the Lube of Your Dreams  A dear friend of mine recently asked me about selecting a good lubricant.  Since I feel many of us may be in need of the right lubricant for the right job, I am sharing my response.  I'm terribly flattered you thought of me for your marital aid needs.  Here is my treatise on lubes:  There is really nothing like a very, very good lubricant!  Whether you're a carburetor or a bicycle or a horny woman, the cheap stuff sux and the good stuff changes the whole experience.  Cheap lube has crappy consistency and performs worse and worse over time as it breaks down or entertains its aspirations of becoming something else, like that splintery, powdery bubble gum you get with baseball cards.  It's like a bad waiter, always wanting to be something else and never quite adequate to the task at hand.  Good lube stays nice and lubey for a long time and you hardly notice it because you're enjoying the pleasant, smooth operation of whatever lucky piece of equipment you treated to good lube.  It's more like that professional waiter who appears in a puff of tasteful aromatic smoke, makes your perfect caesar salad on a perfectly appointed cart with a reserved smile and fades back into the ambient corners of the place until your subtle galvanic skin response summons him to your table again.  So, yes, Virginia, K-Y is very, very icky.  The only thing it has going for it is that you can get it at Wal-Mart.  I have two suggestions: 1.  Try various household items.  Canola oil is fun, butter is *really* good, anything slippery will do.  I've heard good things about Crisco, but I'm too ethnic to keep it around.  You'll want to wash up thoroughly later is all, and keep in mind that some of these things react badly with latex, if that's a consideration. 2.  Wasn't that fun?  Okay, after that, go get some good lubricant.  You will need to visit your friendly neighborhood sex shop, at least buying it for the first time, because you want to feel this stuff (bring a pocket pack of tissues).  If this is just way too uncomfortable a prospect, you can probably order it over the Internet and just get stuck (so to speak) with some backup lube if you don't like what you get.  Me, I kind of like running out of lubricant, because it means a trip to my friendly neighborhood sex shop.     Most sex shops worth their batteries have quite a selection of lubricants, complete with tester bottles.  Start checking them out.  You'll like this, because the claims the packaging makes are really hilarious.  Drip a drop or two (that's all you need--this is the good stuff!) onto your hand and try to rub it in.  See how long it takes to get sticky between your fingers, what you like the texture of (and sure, surreptitiously lick a little of it to see if it tastes like anything--there are even flavored ones if that's appealing to you, but for me, that gets back into bad waiter territory where I don't think it does either job all that well, but that's just me).  Don't worry about what the staff thinks or anything--they *work* there (they probably even get staff discounts.  Hell, ask their opinion if you get stumped).  Besides, that's why there are testers.  Ultimately, it's a personal decision.       Personally, I favor the silicone-based lubes.  They give a really nice thin coating that lasts longer than... it needs to, they go ANYwhere, their taste is usually imperceptible, and they don't damage latex.  Be prepared to pay about $10-$15 for 2-3 ounces, but don't worry about it because this stuff will last a long time, even if you frequently get rabbits coming to the door to tell you that you people are freaks.  These days, I'm partial to ID Millennium (it has a nice moisturizing agent that in this dry climate is quite refreshing), but again, it's a totally personal thing.  Whatever you select, try applying it with a soft pastry brush, it's fun!  Well, whaddya think, dear reader?  Should I have a weekly sex column feature?  Got any questions for me?  Let me know.  mspohn@du.edu

      About being a redhead...  Last night, I was up late and I saw a very cute redheaded comedian talking about how women want tall, dark and handsome men and how it sucks to be weird looking and get sunburnt all the time.  He was pretty funny, but I'm afraid he has prompted a pro-redhead rant.  First off, let me define some terms here.  Coloring your hair red does not, I repeat, NOT make you a redhead!  Real readheads are only 2% of the world's population, and it's much less a hair color than a complete genetic package and a mentality you grow up with.  It's a shared experience.  If you didn't share the experience, you don't belong to the club.  Of course, if you did share the experience, you are part of the club, and for that reason, the whole spectrum counts, from titian to titian, strawberry to auburn.  As for the complete genetic package, red hair is an indicator of melanin deficiency.  Melanin is the biological chemical that determines our pigmentation, from general coloring to how our skin responds to sunlight.  Lots of melanin, dark eyes, dark hair, dark skin, easily made darker to protect itself from UV light.  Little melanin, light coloring, vulnerability to UV light, etc.  It's just one of the countless reasons why racism is stupid: it all comes down to a genetic biochemical reaction.  Anyway, having the redhead pigmentation package is pretty much the last stop on the melanin train before albino.  It comes with near-translucent skin that offers little or no UV resistance, burning and freckling almost instantly.  Anyone with red hair and a tan, that red came out of a bottle.  You can stay out of the sun and your freckles will get light enough that someone has to look closely to see them, but you can't get rid of them, ever, and as soon as you venture back into sunlight, they perk right up.  You can always tell a real redhead from a black-and-white photograph because of that very distinctive translucent pale skin.  Harpo Marx, for example.    As for the mentality you grow up with, there's the shared experience of endless summer sunburns and attempts to hide the resulting peeling and spotting.  There's the intense teasing from other kids, and even from grownups who think they're being clever.  I could have sworn that the next old codger to call me Rusty was going to get smacked right in the head.    If you're a girl, though, you wake up one adolescent morning and the thing that has made you a weirdo all your life is suddenly what makes you special.  This too is part of the shared experience.  For me, it happened in my freshman year of high school.  I had colored my hair about a zillion different colors over a fairly short period of time, but of course, it always came out some kind of red.  This pigmentation is virulent and it's really hard to cover up.  Products like peroxide and Sun-In produce not lightening, but reddening.  It took days to get blonde with no orange.  I had to strip my hair and put color over it.  And of course, being as pale as I am *and* blonde, it looked really weird--perhaps even weirder than when I colored my hair black (even then, the red showed through in sunlight).  So when I finally decided to return to my natural hair color, it was sort of the last transformation.  I haven't colored it since, and I actually appreciate having a few grey hairs just to prove it's natural.  It was like a Twilight Zone episode.  The same girls who had teased me (and believe me, in the gang showers of the girls' locker room, everybody knows when you're a real readhead...) now wanted to know how they could have the very thing they had teased me about.  Strangers asked me whether I colored my hair.  My friends wanted to touch my hair and braid it any play with it.  I started to realize how cool it was to be a redhead and to like it.  Among my redheaded women friends, this is also a common experience.  Unfortunately for the men, they don't seem to get this part of the experience very often.  They seem to go from being teased to being ignored, which is unfortunate, and probably the painful basis of last night's highly entertaining comedian's material.  I have a hypothesis, though.  I think genetics play a role in sexual attraction.  Some genes really want to assert themselves and it seems to prompt a kind of magnetism.  For example, I read this really interesting study about scent and the genetics of attraction when I worked with a friend of mine whose scent drove me so crazy I occasionally had to take a walk just to get the hell out of the office before I sexually assaulted him.  Of course, it's very difficult to sexually harass a man, because very little sexual attention is actually unwanted, but I digress.    Anyway, this study wasn't quite about pheremones, but it was about similar phenomena.  They had all these men get all these tshirts really sweaty and ripe, and had a bunch of women come in and sniff them.  Yeah, it doesn't sound too sexy, but interestingly, the women were most attracted to the scents of the men with whom they would likely have the most genetic success.  That is, the scent of the man with whom they would have the fittest offspring elicited the strongest sexual attraction responses from the women.  I thought that was pretty interesting, and it made me curious about genetically-based attraction in general.  So here's what I've observed: as much as I've gushed about giant Todescoes (and I do like them), I'm quite partial to a specific brand.  Those huge blondes that tend to grow reddish beards, in other words, carriers of the redhead genetic package, really do it for me, even when there is no facial hair to inspect.  It's like I sense it.  This genetic package is very recessive but as I said, virulent as hell.  It's like it drives me to perpetuate it.  This may be the source of the legend about redheads being such voracious lovers: part of the drive.    Needless to say, as much as I love a big warehouse-club-sized Teutonic thing, nothing drives me crazy like another redhead.  No kidding, I actually find Conan O'Brien sort of sexy (if totally annoying), but I couldn't necessarily put my finger on why that is.  And that comedian last night, adorable.  Every time I've acted on my attractions and been with another redhead, it has been explosive, earth-moving, furniture-smashing, incredible.  Hell, I married one in anticipation of a lifetime of busted furniture.  So I take issue with our cute comedian's conclusions.  I'm not all that interested in those dark and swarthy types.  Maybe he just needs to hang out with more redheaded women whose genetic drives make him irresistable to them.

      On Being a Giant Ballerina  Today is Wednesday.  My typical Wednesday schedule involves writing in the morning, going to ballet class at noon, having about an hour and a half to finish up whatever I was doing in the morning and get some lunch, and then going back to the dance studio, where I work into the evening, and then have pointe class.  Consequently, I am so much more likely to have a rant about Balanchine today than on any other day.  George Balanchine was the ballet choreographer who has had the most profound impact on how the art form looks and feels today, especially with regard to its light, airy qualities of performance.  He also had a Pygmalion-like fascination with some of his prima ballerinas and married several of them, I believe, although he was really quite gay.  If you don't believe me, look at the instruments he selected for his choreographies: the men are Greek gods; the women little boys.    Before Balanchine, ballet much more closely resembled its court-dancing roots, and ballerinas were shaped much more like, well, real women.  After the profound effect he had on the art form, we now get what we're used to seeing as "ballet bodies" at the ballet: that five-foot-tall, eighty-pound, curveless creature in a tutu.  In the performing company I belong to, I am considered a "jazz person" (although I still learn the choreographies and look forward to the occasional character role), not because my ballet technique isn't good enough, but because I quite simply am not built like today's Blanachine-inspired ballerina.    This is of course okay with me.  In fact, in many ways, it makes me more proud of my technique.  For every inch over five feet tall you are, placement and turning get more difficult as your center of gravity gets higher and more precarious.  For every incremental cup size beyond perfectly flat that you are otherwised blessed with, your sagital balance is compromised and you must be stronger to compensate.  A perfectly-landed double pirouette is much more of a feat for me than it is for a dancer Balanchine might have had in mind (or married).  It takes more work, more strength, better balance, better technique, more control, better placement, and everything else.  In other words, I have to be a better dancer just to do the same stuff.  Also, I think I've taken my dancing a lot further having started it as an adult than I would have if I had taken my first classes as a child and stuck with it.  At 13, I was already 5'7" and almost spilling out of a B-cup.  Had I been dancing since early childhood, I would have gone through the trauma of having to give up my dreams at a tender age simply by growing into a strong and healthy adult.  As it was, I was a senior in college before I even attempted my first class, and dance has been one of the consuming passions of my adult life.  It also gives me a certain measure of freedom.  When I'm in pointe class and my feet hurt like I'm standing in two pink satin ribbon-festooned bear traps, I can take those suckers off and finish class in my technique shoes.  It's not like I'm 16, in a company class, and this is my big break.  I'm retirement age for a ballerina, doing this for fun.  Masochism is useful, but it's not a hard and fast requirement.  As an added bonus, since the growth plates in the human foot fuse in the early twenties and I didn't begin pointe work until well after that, it is not all that likely that I will be a crippled aging dancer like those who were put on pointe as small children while their bones were soft and malleable.  Okay, ballet is in many ways screwed up.  But being exclusively an adult dancer makes it a lot less likely it will screw you up, and as any dancer will tell you, once your techique progresses to a certain level, it's like flying, and totally worth all the years of hard work.  I should probably explain that pointe class is a special ballet class taken in toe shoes.  You know, when you go to the ballet, and the dancers are somehow hopping around on the very tips of their toes in those noisy pink shoes.  It's a different class because it requires different technique and a lot more strength than a standard ballet technique class.  After all, the human body was never meant to do that.  The shoes are hard around the toes and flexible in the arch to create a steadying base, but to look pretty too, in a Balanchiney sort of way.  In my shoes, standing on pointe, I am well over six feet tall, I would guess about 6'3" or 6'4".  It's a whole different perspective.  It also pretty much guarantees that I will never perform any sort of pas de deux, as there probably isn't a suitable partner out there, but that's okay too.  Like most women over 5'4" or so, I'm funny about being picked up.  So why the hell did I do this to myself when I didn't even have to?  I got to be in my late 20s and realized that my best years of dance were probably still ahead of me, and I really wanted to reach for the pinnacle of technial achievement.  Pointe has been a struggle, and I frequently feel like an Irish wolfhound running agility trials when I'm in class, but again, when it's right, you feel super-human, so graceful and free that physics only loosely applies to you and gravity wafts you skyward rather than yanking you toward the floor.  So although I will never be a "real" ballerina because George Balanchine was really, really gay, I still get to fly.  Take that, George.

      Another rite of passage story thanks to my old man  When I was about 10 or 11, my dad sat me down to explain to me how to make my way in the world.  "There are two things you need to know in order to get money when you really need it," he said, enumerating them on his fingers.  "How to write, and how to play cards."  He explained that he was going to stop giving me an allowance and instead, I would have to play Blackjack with him for his pocket change.  Now, my father is a guy who has a lot of pocket change, so that seemed like a pretty good deal to me, and it was.  His end-of-the-week bulging pockets were a much better haul than my allowance.  Turns out the old man was right, too.  My writing skills have gotten me paychecks, fellowships, admittance to places I never thought I could go, alliances, fair hearings, friends, and more.  My card-playing skills have gotten me home from places I've been stranded with no money, filled in the gaps when I've been in school and had a hard time making ends meet, allowed me to ace graduate-level statistics, and given me the added security of a little jingle in my own pocket when I've needed it.  But the real rite of passage was yet to come.  When I was 19, my dad and I were driving cross-country from L.A. to Boston and we stopped in Vegas.  He gave me $50 worth of chips, good at the hotel casino, and told me to go play the blackjack tables.  "Anything under $50, give back to me, and anything over, you keep," he said.  He was actually having a pretty hard time finding a game--as it turns out, he really looks like a card counter and the dealers were leery of him.  Even though I was underage, though, I was wearing a tight skirt and I got my hair a little bigger than usual (playing cards is one of the few occasions when it actually serves me pretty well that people take one look at me and assume I'm an idiot--but that's another rant), and I had no problems finding a game.    Or winning, as it turned out.  It's one thing to beat a bunch of inexperienced, ego-coasting rich kids at poker when you need the grocery money.  It's something else to take the casino's money, and it feels GREAT, even when the amount is pretty damned inconsequential to the casino.  I got to answer to the usual Vegas pickup line, "So, you winning or losing?": "Winning."  I even very charitably tried to coach a guy who was trying to pick me up.  He was losing miserably through the worst Blackjack strategy I have ever seen, and not impressing me much, either.  I mean, you do *not* split fives!  That's a 10, and given that you're most likely to get a 10 from the deck, do you want a 20 or do you want to be stuck with two 15s?!  (Sheesh!)  His Blackjack dealer took me aside later and suggested I look into one of the dealer schools in town before leaving the area.  He even gave me a card from his Alma Mater.  Apparently dealer schools have recruiters, too.  I probably still have that card around somewhere...just in case.  I gave my old man his $50 back at the end of the evening and pocketed the excess.  Another proud moment in Bertoni family bonding.  Thanks, dad!

      Lisa's Cavalcade of Men  Ladies and gentlemen, I have had a request (but I'm going to keep writing these things anyway).  But seriously, in response to my enthusiastic review of Eric (the former boyfriend of Lisa's whom you'll recall had a butt that could make Michelangelo cry) I have been asked to enumerate and describe Lisa's various boyfriends.  Needless to say, this is an outsider's perspective, and there were likely many single-date wonders I never even knew about.  But these are the ones I remember offhand and my impressions about them.    Lisa and I met in 1988 as college freshmen.  We were both commuter students, and she would listen to my rants in the Student Union (and generously named them Meg Monologues), so we knew each other, but we didn't get to be really good friends until junior year, when she was apparently celibate by choice.  This didn't stop her from making me her personal sexual stooge, of course.  When we had American Lit together, for example, she timed the whole class' couplet-by-couplet reading of "Howl" so I would end up reading the dirtiest parts aloud, much to her satisfaction and amusement.  That's the kind of friend Lisa is.    So anyway, I think the next boyfriend she had after she stopped being celibate and we started being roommates and I started being privy to direct information about who might be lurking in her bed was Chris.  He was the computer guru at the campus newspaper, where I held an editorial position.  I know they broke the "no nooky in the office" rule at one point, but I don't know when.    For me, this was just before or during the time that I call The Dry Spell of '92.  Oh, yes, it is the stuff of legends.  I spent so many late hours in the newspaper office, press releases had begun to take the place of sexual ones.  The Dry Spell of '92 was gratefully broken by a classmate of giant Danish extraction named Charles, who had the good fortune to be coming up the stairs to the newspaper office at the same time as I was actually coming down them for once, in a particularly disconsolate moment, and to be really, really sad about a recent breakup (and also a big Todesco).  I lent him a sympathetic ear, took him home and made him a sympathetic dinner, followed by a terribly sympathetic...   But this is about Lisa's Cavalcade of Men, not mine.  Anyway, Chris was sort of slight but wiry, with a tringular face like a cat's.  He had cycled across the U.S. and apparently had thighs of steel, but to me he seemed like if he were just a little more brittle, he'd be pretty breakable, like resin.  Also, he seemed to be perpetually chapped.  He was nerdy and nitpicky and the more time I spent with him, the more I had the desire to be drunk in his presence just to deal with it.  But basically, he was a very sweet guy, especially in small doses.  Lisa only told me two things about their intimate life: that he was "relentless", and that he had suggested soy sauce as a lubricant, which had really put her off.  He complimented my lipstick once--I think it was a metallic gold color with a darker lipliner for an interesting effect (hey, it was the early '90s).  In that same conversation, we agreed that Lisa was a good kisser and he almost fainted from the implications.  It was by far the most interesting conversation I ever had with him.  My recollection is that the relationship ended when he spent so little time with her that she quipped that she saw her mailman more than she saw him.  To which he replied something like, a guy could take that a couple of different ways.  Shortly after their breakup, he left the country or something.  I have no idea what has become of him, but I hope that thing with him being perpetually chapped didn't cause him to disintegrate entirely.  Then there was Eric.  I would add only one thing to my description, which was that he was a great help in a piece of empirical research Lisa and I were conducting.  The theory was that a man's obsession with gadgets was inversely proportionate to the size of his wonkus.  When Eric couldn't even work the stereo, Lisa and I did this sort of slow burn to look at each other before she broke into a giant grin.  I won't tell you what the nickname he received that night was, but that's how he got it.  Anyway, as I mentioned, I believe he became a freak and went away.  I think it was around this time that a former boyfriend attempted to come back to roost, and I *think* his name was Silas.  I met him once for an afternoon before Lisa gave him the old heave-ho.  He was pretty handsome, about six feet tall, dark hair, dark eyes, and sort of quiet.  He had some sort of giant white car that I think he inherited from his father.  I remember Lisa telling me that they had gone into Chinatown for lunch (at that time, Chinatown bordered on the combat zone) and when this young whitebread dude got out of this big white Town Car or whatever it was, he looked just like The Man.  What I remember best about him was when we were all in the grocery store and he made a visual joke about brussel sprouts being minaturized manufactured cabbages, which I found hysterical.  Hey, produce is not as easy material as you'd think.  Aside from that, my general impression of him was that he was really, really crazy, in an obsessive, Lifetime Network Four-hour-movie-of-the-week kind of way.  Lisa got rid of his ass, I didn't hear how.  I think Rob was next.  Rob was a roommate of Phillip's, my then-boyfriend.  He was a very sweet guy, and he cooked extremely well and was a professional masseur when he wasn't cooking or engaging in some sort of personal exploration and improvement.  He was quite attractive, over six feet, beautifully put together as if he had been assembled from some kind of a kit, hazel eyes, brown hair, great smile.  I would occasionally come home to find him making chocolate all over my kitchen, which was a nice benefit to me, and I believe he occasionally left Irish soda bread in Lisa's car.  All in all, a great boyfriend package.  I think he even brought flowers and little gifties on a fairly regular basis.  And, as I said, a good heart.  Bless that heart, though, he was as dumb as a sack of hammers.  I don't actually know why they broke up, but I suspect it had something to do with that.  They stayed friends for a long time, and I believe he is now happily married to a nice German lady, and has a few kids, which is good.  He was nicest to Lisa of all the pre-Evan Cavalcade I can remember, and that gives him quite a few points in my estimation.  Plus there was that part where he would be all in chocolate-covered clothes plastered to that kit-body.  You know how it's really hard not to bite the ears off the chocolate bunny?  Yeah.  It was like that.  Somewhere around here, I remmber Lisa having a string of really terrible dates.  She went out with a dropout-classmate of mine from Harvard whom I think was baked and weird the whole time and had some kind of aversion to telling her his last name.  She also went to the movies with some guy, who, in an attempt to be sexy, bit her lip so hard she dropped her popcorn.  All in all, a total waste of Lisa's intermittent leg-shaving.  Next, I think Lisa took up with the boyfriend I refer to as Stalkin' Steve.  Stalkin' Steve was a pretty interesting guy on the face of it.  He was a Jewish vegetarian from Kentucky, in his early 50s, with a bigass car we called The Ark.  He was intially very solicitous of Lisa, and nice to me, and I think she entertained moving in with him to get away from Kat and Lew, who were pretty much the Hostile Couple Roommates from Hell at that point.  Steve also cooked and even had a convection oven.  The problem was, though, that Stalkin' Steve was in reality just a very sophisticated weirdo.  Apparently, he saw Lisa as some kind of potential trophy wife.  Nice that he valued her, but ewww...  When Lisa began to realize just how freaky Stalkin' Steve was, she attempted to shake him loose, but apparently he didn't believe in unilateral breakups and was quite certain they were still together, even if she was acting rather strangely.  Although he was sort of a little skinny guy, I understand Dennis Franz is going to be playing him in the Lifetime Four-hour-movie-of-the-week.  I believe that brings us to Evan, Lisa's wonderful husband.  By comparison, Evan would really not have to be all that terrific to be the romantic rock star male lead of Lisa's life, and in this sense, he has overshot by miles.  Initially, I had relatively few impressions of him because he is very shy and getting to know him requires some effort.  I still don't know him as well as I'd like to, but I know enough to write a little open fan mail.  First off, Evan is one of a handful of Welsh-Italians I know that I'm not related to, which to my mind gives us an instant affinity, and he is so deeply, sweetly, and passionately in love with Lisa it makes me happy just to be around them.  He is medium height, medium build, and has lovely dark soulful eyes and a sort of charming thoughtful pout when he's ruminating about something.  He has one of the sweetest, most joyful smiles I've ever seen, and he's a very affectionate, cuddly guy once you get to know him.  Best of all, he's brilliant and hilarious.  I figured it out, and he makes me laugh out loud an average of once every 11 minutes when I get to hang out with him.  Some significant others, particularly spouses, of my friends, they're like marionettes or something: once the girlfriend goes away, they sort of slump lifeless in the corner and all their strings go slack, and you have absolutely nothing in common with them.  But Evan is one of the few spouses of friends of mine that I would choose to hang out with even by himself.  He's just a really nifty person I never would have gotten to know if it weren't for Lisa.  I sure can't say that about any other member of the Cavalcade.  Best of all, though, he appreciates Lisa for the uniquely nifty and quirky creature she is, and that really makes me happy.  Anyway, I'd like to point out that the maximum number of relationships we get in a lifetime that work out is ONE.  I'm delighted that Lisa found her handsome prince after all those freakin' frogs.

      Today, I institute Joanne Pratt Day.    Joanne Pratt was one of my best friends.  Had she not died of cancer on July 31, she would have been 32 today.  I plan to go on celebrating her birthday every year, just as I did when she was alive, so today I invite you to join me.  Joanne was an amazing and inspiring woman.  I am richer for having known her; she changed my spirit for the better.  In retrospect, knowing her has become all the more precious to me since her life was so short.  Because this is the first annual Joanne Pratt Day, I think it’s important to tell you about who she was and what she was like.  Before I get into that, though, Joanne was never one for overwrought, sad stories (any more than I am), and she thought gatherings without food or alcohol or… something were a total bust.  So to be true to her memory, before I tell you about Joanne, go get a drink and/or a bag of chips or spark up a fatty or something.  Get a Guinness if you have it.  She would want you to be comfortable and happy.  We’ll wait.  I first met Joanne on the steps of 132 Beacon Street in Boston in September of 1988.  It was our freshman year at Emerson College and we were both 17.  She had wavy bright red hair and blue eyes and her arms were kind of wrapped around her knees as she sat on the steps.  I was coming into the building to meet a new friend, I don't remember who.  I didn’t realize at first that Joanne was blind, or that she was crying.  I asked her if she was okay, and we started talking.  I forget what we talked about, but I never had a conversation with Joanne, even a short one, that wasn't fun or meaningful or just plain cool.  Joanne had a terrific mellow voice, and indeed a very laid-back personality.  Her greatest talent, next to her writing, was probably surfing the shitstorm of life.  She suffered dozens of heartaches, romantic and otherwise, in the time that I knew her, and she never let it change her.  Every time she fell in love was like the first, as if she had never, ever been hurt.  Whenever bad things would happen to her, she would just go on with her life, do what had to be done, get back on the proverbial horse.  One of the things I loved most about her was her incredible ability not to be hurt by life.    Above all else, though, Joanne was a fun and rowdy low-bullshit lady.  She had a great sense of humor, a whole palette of terrific laughs, and was always up for a good time.  She didn't give a rat's ass what other people thought of her, but she demanded to be treated with dignity at all times.  Most of the time I spent with Joanne really was spent with her.  We frequently just hung out and talked and laughed, or ran the occasional errand.  I probably spent the least money and did the least work of any of my social interactions, ever, and got the most out of them.    Joanne is also the inventor of the Orgasmacycle, a bicycle with a self-powered vibrator for a seat.  We thought about trying to put it into production, but figured everyone would just end up in ditches by the sides of roads, pedaling and pedaling and pedaling...  Still, it was the kind of hilarious and imaginitive idea she came up with on a regular basis.  She was also quite a wiseass.  We were in the liquor store one time when she got carded, and she told them her driver's license had been taken away because of too many parking tickets.  It also knocked me out, of course, that Joanne lived a pretty normal life without the use of her sight.  Considering how visual our society is, it's amazing that anybody does.  The ways in which she adapted, though, and the clever things she did, and her perspective, really changed the way I thought about a lot of stuff.  And as a writer, Joanne was the first of my contemporaries to influence my own work.  She wrote her own stuff in braille notebooks, but could also type about 80 words a minute and would type up all her assignments.  Joanne left Emerson after our freshman year.  She frequently did things like blowing off writing class because she wanted to finish a terrific play she was working on.  College didn't make a lot of sense to her, but she probably expected it to later in life.  In the meantime, she did go to school for massage, which she was really great at, as one might expect.  When I got married in 1995, Joanne was one of my bridesmaids.  She was the only one with the presence of mind to bring alcohol to the hotel room where we were getting dressed, and man did I ever need a belt!  She brought a magnum of champagne, that winning creature.  I also spent a bunch of holidays with her and always had a great time.  What a sense of occasion.    Less than two months after my wedding, Joanne left the man she had been living with and promptly discovered she was pregnant.  Having a baby (alone, no less) was one of many things Joanne did with courage and joy and that I haven't yet been able to do myself.  She always had such a fountain of love to give, I knew she would be a wonderful mom, and she was.  Alex was her heart, and he is a brilliant and amazing little boy.  Her mother is raising him now, and she reported that Joanne had prepared him very well for what was going to happen.    When I talked to Joanne about a year ago, she was doing chemotherapy and it seemed to be going well.  She had already beaten cancer more than once in her short life, and by April, I was sure she had done it again.  Her mother told me that Joanne got sick again during her last month of life and was gone in a matter of weeks.  I didn't know, though--she didn't tell her friends.  I wish I had gotten to see her, or at least talk to her, just a little bit more.  I didn't have any real unfinished business--she knew I loved her, she knew I admired her and that she was one of my best friends.  She probably just wanted me to remember her as she was before she got sick.  I found out Joanne had died while I was at a conference in Portland, Oregon.  She died peacefully with all her family around her.  It was important to me to do something to mark her passing, to send her off to the next adventure--another thing she bravely did before me--but I was pretty far from home and the people I loved.  I had started to make friends with two really special guys I met at the conference.  The three of us have a lot in common and we got pretty close pretty fast.  We found an Irish pub where I raised a Guinness to her and I told them about her.  I knew she would have liked that.  Hell, if she had been there, she probably would have been half-drunk and in one of their laps.  Anyway, I'm not really over losing Joanne yet and I still really miss her.  I expected her to bury me, not to die when we were still young.  I treasure the 14 years we got, even if it wasn't really enough.  I'm not Christian, but if I pictured Joanne in Heaven, she'd be singing Led Zeppelin songs in a campy operatic soprano voice and giggling like crazy, like we used to do.  So, since it's Joanne Pratt Day, I urge you all to have a belt with me and toast her memory.  Do something brave, say something funny, write something good, listen to some great music, kiss a total stranger like you mean it, goose the waiter and pretend it was an accident because you're blind.  She'd appreciate that.  As for me, I'm going to find something poetic and fearless in myself and have a beer with it.    Here's to Joanne.

      Convocation Speech 2001  Since my late-September posting of the speech I have at the University of Denver's 1999 Convocation, some folks, knowing I was President of the Graduate Student Association for three years, have asked what became of the other speeches.  Well, there was no 2000 speech, because the Powers that Be decided that not enough students came to Convocation, so they would no longer be invited.  Yup, the 2000 Convocation was basically a glorified staff meeting, with about 10,000 students, a giant segment of the community, left off The List.  How d'ya like them apples?!  Well, President of the All Undergraduate Student Association Tony Ryan and I didn't think much of them at all.  Due in part to our grousing, a new Convocation concept was introduced in 2001.  It was more of a showcasey outdoor thing with booths than it was an academic event.  I wanted to call it "D.U. on a Stick", but nobody went for it.  So, in short, there was no speech for 2000 because there was no Convocation that year to which students were invited.  However, I was reminded of my 2001 speech just today, so I'm posting it here.  I gave this speech about 3 weeks after the September 11th attacks.  I'm pleased with how it came out, and it even reflects a sort of patriotism that I was experiencing for the first time, having been born during the Vietnam War.    Ocean Journey, by the way, is Denver's aquarium.  It's new and struggling, rather overpriced and with very few exhibits.  Since many of Denver's area businesses are generous and into charitable giving, some of them had been trying to help Ocean Journey stay, er, afloat.  This has resulted in a glitzier look and a proliferation of corporate logos, but at the time of this speech, nothing substantive.   Odysseus of Many Devices (Address to Student Convocation, October 1, 2001)  Two years ago today, I stood before some of you and delivered a speech about the coming of the year 2000, and what it had come to mean in my generation’s collective imagination.  In keeping with the theme of years, I tried to come up with something related to 2002, or even 2001, but the only thing that comes to mind is, of course, “2001:  A Space Odyssey”.  “Why are you applying to graduate schools, Dave?” just doesn’t work as a tie-in.  It is my opinion that 2001 will instead be remembered as the year when the world changed, when global considerations took our minds away from visually stunning movies and dreams of the stars.  As we begin to try to make sense of the horrific events of September 11th, our thinking is more like that of the original Odyssey than of a science fiction movie.  The rhetoric of battle comes to us on a daily basis.  We face struggle as we try to journey home to safety, although in our case, safety at home is a state of mind disrupted by the explosion of passenger aircraft and the massacre of citizens, and Ocean Journey is a haven for giant otters and corporate logos.    Odysseus is a special kind of hero.  Like most heroes of legend, he is big and strong and courageous and has a beautiful yet functional home and a desirable and faithful lifepartner with a gift for entertaining.  What is special about Odysseus, though, is that he is clever.  He is often referred to as “Odysseus of many devices.”  “Odysseus of many devices,” he is frequently asked by his crew, “What are you doing?”  Clearly, he is constructing some kind of device, but he always patiently explains his plans to his crew, who then give him a hand with the implementation.  Ultimately, it is not Odysseus’ brawn or his bravery that gets him home.  It is his persistence in his heart’s desire to return and his cleverness.  He escapes captors, he creates tools and weapons, he calculates his way past the prototypical “rock and a hard place,” and he even identifies himself to his wife upon his return by passing her verbally administered tests.    Odysseus is a particularly pertinent hero today because the nature of human conflict has again changed, even if our tendency toward it has not.  The battle lines of the current conflict exist less in territories and among states than they do in our hearts and minds.  The eastern front of this conflict is not a heavily-armed line of sandbags and barbed wire; it is conceptual.  It is wherever in the world we expect to find a small band of men responsible for the attacks.    This is already a war of cleverness. The attacks of September 11th were as well-planned as they were deadly.  The attackers took into consideration America’s greatest strengths and turned them against her: total faith in homeland security, wealth, size, freedom of movement.  A few men armed with knives and a corrupted ideology accomplished what an entire military could not.  In a terrain of ideological battle, a strong infantry is no substitute for a powerful intellect.  If we are fighting hate and the very concept of terrorism, strategy and creative thinking are the keys to victory, and howitzers will not be particularly useful.  Cleverness, not firepower, will bring an end to this conflict with the least amount of grief and loss.  The best way, then, to strengthen our respective countries at this time of change and conflict is to strengthen our minds and examine our hearts, to seek to be ourselves masters of many devices.  The very path we are on as students, working to train our minds and increase our knowledge, is the path of the victorious, in the current conflict and beyond it.  Two years ago today, I stood before some of you and predicted a networking of graduate students on this campus using the devices of technology and electronic [intelligence], and it has come to be.  I predicted larger gatherings between us that would serve to break down the barriers between interdisciplinary discussion and interaction that we might share our ideas and devices with each other, and that, too, came to be.  Even as a few aspects of the larger University’s growth have occasionally created unforeseen disagreement, graduate students are coming together in greater numbers and with a greater sense of community and singularity of purpose than they have in this university’s recent memory.    GSAC’s mission remains to continue to foster that coming together, that community, that purpose.  We believe our voice contributes to the University’s future in important ways.  Most of us are here, after all, because we are in love with ideas.  What greater pleasure could there be than offering up our ideas, the devices of our own construction, and watching them improve our own community and our own experience, even in small and subtle ways?    GSAC would like to thank all the members of the University community who have drawn upon our perspective over the last two years.  It is a statement of faith in the University of Denver itself that we all believe in its ability to select and train good thinkers.  We look forward to further collaboration, and to the construction of many more devices for the greater benefit.  May we all return home to safety soon.

      Moving the Engine:  Another Pearl from Papa Bertoni  I learned my mechanical and repair skills from my old man, mostly because of his history of loose cars and fast women.  My dad drives sh*tboxes exclusively, and firmly believes in the $100 car theory.  He buys a sh*tbox for $100 and drives it until it finishes falling apart.  In this way, he probably does spend a lot less money on a car than he would if he had a new car and monthly payments, but it's nerve-wracking as hell.  Fortunately, my old man is good in a crisis so that part seems to be pretty much okay with him.  When I was about 11 or so, we were working on the engine from his '67 Karmaan Ghia convertible.  It had worked well several years before and had holed up in the barn for a while.  He had decided to break it out and start fixing it up again.  We dropped the engine out of the car okay, but we had to move it about 20 feet to get it in a better area to work on it.    "It's impossible," I said.  "We can't move this thing 20 feet." "Do you think we could move it 1 foot?" "MAYbe." "Well, then all we have to do is move it 1 foot 20 times." I laughed, but he was right.  We moved that sucker a little bit at a time until we got it where we wanted it, and I don't think we even had to move it 20 times, either.  I think about this particular lesson whenever something looks impossible.  I try to break it down into possible pieces or try to look at the problem another way.  It sounds a little like a Confucian proverb: When a heavyass engine cannot be moved 20 feet one time, perhaps it may be moved 1 foot twenty times.

      Harry and Matilda update  Since my last posting, several of you have expressed anywhere between perverse curiosity and genunine concern for how Harry and Matilda are getting along.  In the last few days, Freaky Matilda decided to go to the theater to be with Harry.  In the end, she couldn't stand not knowing what it would be like to sit there in the dark close to Harry and she knew that if she didn't go, she'd probably wonder about it for a very long time.  She's still a little bent out of shape about the change in plans, isn't crazy about her position, and she hasn't explicitly accepted seeing Tres Heures du Merdre, either.  But she thinks she'll get over the internal stuff in plenty of time to have fun with Harry, and she plans to work out the details of the specific movie to be seen when she gets to the theater and sees him.  In other words, with a giant popping sound, Matilda's head has become liberated from her ass.  I'll keep you posted on how Harry does.

      Hey, you know what I haven't mentioned in a while?  Things I suck at!    37.  Commitment.  Oh, this is a big one.  Complicated, too, and heavy.  It has to do with expectations and letdowns, and with how most of the people in my life who have been important to me, particularly earlier in my life, either left me or died.  I have a hard time committing to things and people for two reasons:   One, I can't stand to leave people in the lurch who depend on me.  Since I am a sort of nomadic spirit (look for my posting on Road Trip Therapy at a later date), but it is also incredibly important to me to step up in all things and always do what I say I'm going to do, I prefer not to say it unless I'm really sure I will do it.  I think that somehow it would dilute my power as a willful person not to do what I say I'm going to do--that that power resides in the connection between word and deed.  I am notorious on various committees I serve for not committing to a specific job but showing up to take care of as-needed stuff anyway.    Two, due to the all-too-transient nature of so many of my relationships with other people, I am in some ways too self-reliant.  I have a hard time trusting people to do what *they* say they're going to do.  It takes a leap of faith every time until they've established a certain level of consistency with me that I come to rely on, and sometimes that takes a while.  Once I take that leap of faith, if that trust is broken, it's like a personal betrayal.  It's about the strongest emotional reaction you can get from me, and I think it probably looks like a total overreaction from the outside.  From the inside, though, it takes me a long time to recover.  I find it easier not to get into that position at all, because of all the things I could appear to be, irrational is probably the least appealing to me.  I mention this because I can, of course, and also because I am currently in the process of getting over a fairly minor case of someone who is really important to me convincing me to do something that was a giant scary leap of faith to begin with (perhaps the giantest scariest leap I've ever taken), and then changing the rules on me.  I know I'm disproportionally upset about it, plus I'm bent out of shape at myself about being emotional about it at all on top of that.  It's the one thing I can't be rational about, because it involves my most damaged sore spot, like poking a bruise that never seems to heal completely.  Worse than that, I can't possibly behave like the person I want to be in this situation.  I wish this person had just broken my stereo or insulted my mother or keyed my leased car or stomped on my toes really hard--you know, something I could deal with rationally and with swearing.  I can't figure out how to protect the relationship, which I treasure, while protecting myself, which I now feel I have to do, and letting this person know that it's not the new terms I'm upset about; it's the trust violation.  Furthermore, the new terms seem to involve a decrease in free speech and concessions to a third party, which don't inspire my confidence.  Okay, this is all getting terribly abstract and emotional and we all know I can't sustain that for long.  So let's say Harry and Matilda are going to the movies.  They agree to go to a certain movie together, a good one with lots of nice explosions in it, and it's a big freaky commitment circus to get Matilda to plan ahead, because she's damaged, but she finally does it and begins to really look forward to the movie.  As the time draws closer, though, Harry decides he just can't bring himself to see a frickin' movie and he just has to see some overwrought foreign film where there are no explosions to speak of and nothing happens at all for three hours.  Hey, says Matilda, this is not the program I signed up for.  Tough, says Harry, if you want to see a movie with me, it has to be Tres Heures du Merdre and not Explosions Are Forever.    The thing is, Matilda has invested a lot in this plan because she thinks Harry is pretty terrific.  If he were any less terrific, she could not have gotten past her carney-freakish damage long enough to pick a damn day of the week to see a movie at all.  So now Matilda is really screwed.  She can either go see Tres Heures du Merdre and be with Harry, which was the point of this whole scary-clown exercize, or she can go see Explosions are Forever all by herself, and hell, she didn't really want to see a movie all that badly to begin with--she just wanted to be with Harry.  But she doesn't want to sit through something unbearable with people gazing longingly into each other's eyes and bemoaning their predicaments when they should really just be blowing a lot of sh*t up.  She kind of feels like life is too short for sad movies.  Harry, who clearly does care about Matilda, attempts to make the change in plans more palatable.  He makes it pretty clear to her that he really does want to see a movie with her, and he even offers to read the subtitles to her in funny voices.  However, Matilda knows how inept she is at foreign film viewing, is pretty sure she'd f*ck it up and wreck both their moviegoing experiences, and would rather exercize her unbelievable action-movie viewing skills with Harry, who, although he has his suspicions, doesn't actually realize how phenomenal seeing an action movie with Matilda can be.  He may not even know a movie can be that good.  She figured he was seeing enough foreign films with other people and seeing action movies was something they both really wanted to do with each other.  Besides, although Harry has made mention of how important subtitles are in general, she has no direct confirmation that Harry can read.  As it turns out, Harry has been seeing a bunch of movies with other people, which is just fine with Matilda.  She thinks he should be free to see whatever he wants with whomever he fancies.  But because of his other viewing commitments, he feels the only ethical viewing he can do with Matilda is Tres Heures du Merdre, and he's rather immovable on the subject.  Plus, his other moviegoing companions are apparently quite jealous and controlling, and in order to accomodate them because he's a hell of a guy, Harry has also started to become rather cryptic and sparing in his communications to Matilda.  Matilda, who genuinely cares about Harry, is understandably concerned for him but doesn't feel like it's any of her flippin' business to say anything about what Harry does with his movie tickets.  So all this makes Matilda acutely aware of her particular damage.  She's upset but doesn't know what to do about it.  A change in movies shouldn't get anyone so bent out of shape, particularly when Harry has made the very sweet offer about funny voices and everything.  She certainly doesn't want him to feel like his subtitle reading skills aren't valuable to her.  But Matilda is, as previously mentioned, wicked freaky about this one thing, and it was a big deal for her to make this plan at all, never mind changing it, and Harry seems to have forgotten about that part.  Plus, Matilda is beginning to feel like it doesn't really matter what she wants--she's pretty powerless and subject to the whims of Harry and his new cinema entourage.  She vascillates between saying the hell with it, she's not going to the movies, and wondering if she could maybe stand Tres Heures du Merdre.  Maybe it might have some really minor, nice explosions that would make it not suck quite as badly as she thinks.  Maybe Harry would surprise her and once they got to the theater, there would be some third thing they would both be happy with.  There may be a sliver of a chance that the promise of a really good action movie would prove too powerful and they'd eventually end up there anyway, who knows?  Also, as previously mentioned, Harry is pretty terrific, and Matilda thinks that if she doesn't just try to get her ass to the theater one way or another, she might always wonder what it might have been like to sit in the dark next to Harry and listen to his funny voices.    On the other hand, Matilda is what?  Freaky.  And a little bit crushed, because after all, she did decide to see a movie with Harry when he wasn't seeing movies with anyone else at all.  She feels acutely how much less important she has become to him recently when previously he made her feel pretty special.  She's afraid Tres Heures du Merdre might just be so sad she'll cry there in the dark, next to Harry, and more than anything, she doesn't want him to know she cries.  Matilda is much more of a laughy lady, and that's the part of her she wants Harry to know.  She feels like Harry is drawing out the parts of her she isn't so happy with: the freaky part, the sad part, the part that invariably screws up foreign film viewing; and ignoring the vast majority of her together, fun, cool personality.  It feels like she has this gorgeous armor that everyone loves and admires and all Harry wants to do is poke at the chinks.  On the other hand, she muses, he has a unique way of poking at them that kind of makes her feel like he's trying to get in there with her, which is nice.  She also never realized how much she was looking forward to Explosions Are Forever with Harry until he told her he wouldn't see it with her.  So Matilda's urge to bolt down the Freaktown carnival midway before this thing gets any worse is pretty strong.  That's what she'd be doing right now if Harry weren't so damned terrific.  So the idea of never knowing what sitting in the dark with Harry and his funny voices would be like is probably the most compelling thing to Matilda, who doesn't like to have regrets about her life.  She's still freaky and sad, but she's probably going to try to go down to the theater.  She's afraid Harry is going to change his mind some more, further justifying and perhaps even intensifying, her freakyness, and she won't have much to say about it.  She'll just have to suck it up or never know about Harry and movies.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Harry and Matilda.  I think they've got a good shot at something special, that is, if they ever get their heads out of their respective asses long enough to try it.

      Well, folks, the raucous sex is on.  Lisa wrote me such an amusing note of encouragement, I feel compelled to share it:  Megbert,   Family sites should go get stuffed, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars!  Y'all are allowed -- nay, encouraged! -- to be as sex-positive as ya wanna be on my site.  Heck, our ISP is in Canada anyway (see, now you have a vacation home of sorts in Vancouver), so if they wake up out of their beery slumber to bust us for porn it'll be a bona-fide international incident.  I've always wanted to cause an international incident.  Getting popped by an ISP for talking about sex would give us street cred for a decade, girlfriend!  Nisalator   Well, then!  Let the wild rumpus--and street cred--begin!  Q:  Do cock rings really work? A:  Yes, and they make the cock in question appear to be roughly the size of an ICBM from the weilder's point of view, which is always a plus.    Q:  My boyfriend really wants me to have anal sex with him, but I don't know.  I want to make him happy, but I think it's kinda gross and I've heard it really hurts.  What should I do? A:  Having clarified with this querier that the boyfriend wants to be the poke-er and not the poke-ee, I have the following advice.    First, I think that if your partner wants you to do something that's basically harmless and doesn't weird you out too much, even if it's not really your thing, what the hell.  Sometimes you never know what you might like until you try something you didn't think of yourself.  Also, if it really makes your partner happy, sometimes it's worth it for the response value alone, even if you try the something in question and it still doesn't really rock your racket.  If it is harmful or does seriously weird you out, don't do it.  So decide if anal sex falls into the too weirded out category for you.  Second, we've all heard the joke, right?  Women try anal sex twice: once just to see what it's like, and a second time just to be sure it really hurt that much.  Okay, I'm not going to lie to you--it does hurt.  However, it only hurts at first, it doesn't have to hurt that much, and you can really do a lot to mitigate the pain if you're into the pleasure.  The thing with anal sex seems to be that you need a certain temperment to enjoy it.  If you are turned on by the prospect of doing it, you probably have the temperment.  Likewise if you think you would be turned on by doing something "that dirty", or you perceive it as a kind of domination or control and that does something for you, or perhaps if you're simply very, very curious, you have the temperment as well.  Try it on mentally and see if it fits you.    If you decide you want to try this, there are three things you really need to know that will make the difference between being a try-it-twice cliche and a porn star:  1.  It takes a little physical training 2.  Lubricate, lubricate, lubricate! 3.  RELAX.  I'll get to those in a moment.  First, a few boring technical details, in the order in which they might become very, very important to you.  If your partner has never done this before, he will need to know that he has to go slowly and be gentle (or what?  You will never, ever want to do this again, not even that notorious second time).  You will probably want to use a condom, even if you've been clean and monogamous for ever and ever and the only time you see latex is when you paint your house.  As things can get a bit messy, you will probably want a very soft towel or other washable surface under you (or be prepared to change the sheets afterwards) and/or to get really well cleaned up beforehand.  Have lots of lubricant within easy reach, and lots of pillows, both for the same reason: comfort.  Many women who enjoy anal sex and reach orgasm during it do so with the help of a little clitoral stimulation.  Do with that little observation what you will.  Finally, since muscles tend to tighten up from their previously fun and fluid state right after orgasm, you will also want to get out of this position fairly quickly after the grand finale or risk feeling like a Cirque de Soleil act gone terribly wrong.  Now, on with the show.  1.  As to the physical training part, you'll want to start small and work your way up to the size of the instrument you'll be working with.  And you know what that means:  ROAD TRIP TO THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SEX SHOP!  Even really lame sex shops that just have some dirty magazines and a few expired condoms lying around have plenty of anal love gear to select from.  Like I said, start small, and pick something that intrigues you.  And yes, you will want to lllubricate it llliberallly.  Butt plugs are a popular choice for this, although the tiniest anal vibrator you can find might be more fun.  Some folks are really into those beads on a string that come in ass-sorted sizes, but I think they look, well... pinchy.  But that's just me.  Once your initial selection becomes comfortable, try something a little bigger.  By that time, you will probably have a good idea of what you'd like to try next.  A few increments is all you need unless your partner's love gun is rather more like a Howitzer.    2.  Lubricate, lubricate, lubricate!  Since my treatise on lubes of October 13 started this whole thing, I'm sure I don't need to tell you how I feel about good lubricant.  It is soooooo important to make sure everything that might be coming into contact with anything else in this situation is not just moist, but positively slick, at least at first.  Remember, neither your tush nor the items coming into contact with it makes its own lubricant.  Do not skimp here--you probably can't use too much at first on the surfaces that will be coming into contact with each other, and it means the difference between a novel sensation and the kind of pain that makes your socks roll up and down.  3.  RELAX.   a. On the macro level, you need to get loose before attempting this early on.  Have a glass or two of wine if that's your thing, blow some smoke, take a hot bath, have a good stretch, set off some illegal fireworks, whatever gets the kinks out.   b. Do engage in whatever sort of foreplay works for you, at least until the idea of being poked in the ass starts to sound really appealing.  The purpose of this is, after all, to have fun.  You will want to be in a frame of mind where you will be thinking much more about the fun/curiosity angle than your trepidation and the virtual proverb about only trying this twice, and where you will enjoy focusing on what's going on.  After all, being good in bed, regardless of what you're doing, is all about focus and concentration. c. Make sure your body is pretty comfortable.  In the typical knees-chest position, for example, you may want to be on the bed even if you normally prefer wild monkeysex in the shower, and you may want to put enough pillows under your chest and belly that you feel supported and relaxed. d. Deep breaths, relax your muscles.  To really enjoy this early on, you will want to be muscularly passive and respond to the motions of your partner more by rocking against him in a whole-body sort of way.    Like most things in life, anal sex is primarily painful and unpleasant only when undertaken by the ignorant or inept.  Think about *that* the next time you're in line at the post office!  Prepare a little and you should have a lot more fun.    Q:  I am considering genital piercing.  Does it really make sex more pleasurable? A:  I have no personal expertise in this area.  I have multiple piercings in my earlobes (ah, nostalgic mutliation of the 80s), but the first time a friend of mine showed me his pierced nipple, I couldn't stop protectively clutching my own ta-tas for about half an hour.  Since this querier disclosed no gender to me, I asked a few folks I know, both male and female, who have body piercings, about this.  They unanimously say it makes the area more sensitive, and that the pulling of the skin during sex caused by having a stud through it is very pleasurable.  To me, though, having to wait the weeks and weeks to try it out while those sensitive spots heal, along with the intense initial pain (not to even mention the horrifying possibilities of infection!), I don't think I could do it for a little skin tug, even if it made me see God.    Q: Would you watch me and my girlfriend having sex and tell me what I'm doing wrong? A: No.  But you could probably ask her.  I bet she knows.  Queries?  Go on, I'm unflappable and uncensored.  mspohn@du.edu.

      Hey, kids, do you know what time it is? That's right!  Time for more things I suck at!  For those of you just joining us, I started a list back in September of things I suck at, and I intend to keep innumerating until I get to 100.  46.  Land speed.  I'm quick in the water, but the only way I can go fast on land under my own power is on a bicycle, where torque = speed.  47.  Climbing.  Related to #46, those of us who are built for speed have a much easier time climbing hills on bicycles.  Those of us who are built for endurance can haul ass on the flats, but have a harder time verticalizing.    48.  Making a decision without weighing all the options.  Oh yes, even if it's just a decision about which black magic marker to buy.  I want to see *all* my options and then I'll know for sure which one is right.  It makes me a little crazymaking to shop with, but I hardly ever return anything.  49.  Containing my restlessness when distracted.  If I'm distracted by some unresolved thing in my life, even if I can't do anything about it at the time, I have a really hard time focusing on the task at hand, even when it's really important.  I must *go* somewhere or *do* something.  Driving usually helps.    50.  Sleeping when there is the slightest little thing out of order with my environment.  Oh yes, it's Princess and the Pea time.  Heaven forefend the sheet should be crumpled around my feet or not fit properly.  God forbid my hair should fall across the front of my throat, or *gasp* someone else in the bed with me should attempt to cuddle me while I'm sleeping and raise the ambient temperature in my immediate body space, or worse, drape some heavyass limb over me.  I know, it probably makes me a bad mammal.  Whoo-hoo, halfway there!

      You may have guessed that I've regained my mobility, as it's been a little while since I posted something.  You'd be right.  I've torn muscles before and it always surprises me how long it takes for them to feel normal again.  It sure doesn't feel normal yet, but it is functional, so I'm out and about.    One of the major places I've been out and about to quite a lot has been Home Depot.  I'm implementing storage solutions in the little house I've just moved into.  The other day, I went to Home Depot and got a bunch of those laminated particle board cabinets you assemble yourself.  The vote's not in yet on whether I recommend them.  So far, the pre-drilled holes aren't really deep enough and they're kind of a pain in the ass to put together.  I say that both as someone who enjoys putting things together and as someone who assembles bicycles for a living.  On the other hand, they seem pretty heavy and like they'll be pretty sturdy once they're together, and all I really need is a few years' worth of reasonably attractive functional storage, so it looks like they'll suit my purposes, even if they piss me off for a few days.  They can also be cut and drilled and what-not, so they can be customized to some extent.  They may even be prime-and-paintable, if temporarily annoying.  So back to Home Despot.  One of the things about buying storage solutions in kits is that the kit people often don't tell you everything you need to know.  They never told me, for example, that I'd need L-brackets to install the countertops and that it really was time to fish out the power tools for that.  I went back to The Despot twice: once for the L-brackets, once for screwdriver bits for my [insert monkey noises here] 3/8 cordless rechargeable drill.  I have other drills, but I this is the one I could find in the morass of boxes.  Here's what I love about The Despot:  If you're a woman who can handle a lumber cart and who appears to be relatively competent, you really feel the love.  The staff is helpful and nice, and nobody has ever been the least bit patronizing.  Compare this to the stump-the-chick attitude of most auto parts store denizens, and you begin to see why this is so lovely.  Also, the male customers seem sort of swoonily impressed with a woman who is testing out power tools and handling the merch.  In many ways, Colorado is behind the times in terms of gender equality--much moreso than in my native Boston, where it doesn't matter much with folks my age, and it's sort of a sign of sophistication that you don't acknowledge non-biological gender differences of any kind.  But inside Home Depot, you'd never know there was a problem here.  Inside some auto parts stores, it's like you've walked into the men's room and they don't want you in there.  Inside the Despot, feelin' the love.  It sure takes the edge off having to go back there again and again during a project.    Yesterday, when I was in there picking out a screwdriver bit, I examined several possible options before making a selection, as I always do.  First, I found a regular old Phillips bit, and then there was this whole set of various screwdriver bits complete with guide, in two different sizes.  I made some sort of delighted, slightly simian noise and began to deliberate between the kits.  The guy standing next to me seemed genuinely pleased.  It's as if they're not quite allowed to express themselves in there and the presence of chicks lets them do that or something, I'm not sure exactly what.  I'm sure I'll get the chance to research this anthropological phenomenon further because now I have to go get a damn masonry bit and some screw anchors.

      The time I jammed a 10-inch spike through my hand  You know, being injured reminds me of other times I've been injured.  For example, once at the bike shop where I work, I impaled my own hand with a bigass spike.  If you're squeamish, skip this one.  It seemed one of my fellow bike mechanics had been having some legal difficulties and had been joking around and made this prison shiv to take with him to the bighouse.  I don't want to think about how he planned to get it into the joint.  It was about 10 inches long, with a diameter and point gradation like a pencil on one end and a handle wrapped in handlebar tape on the other to allow for maxium cafeteria riot grip.  I ended up being the custodian of the shiv.  I don't know why.  Anyway, one day, my boss was having a hard time cleaning some serious detritus out of a shock tube.  You know how stuff in the LaBrea tarpits gets sort of petrified and stuff?  Yeah, it was like that.  I had the bright idea to soak the inside of the tube with degreaser and pull a shoprag through it.  At one point, the rag got stuck, but I had just the tool to dislodge it from the other end: the shiv!  So I'm there, shiving the rag to get it loose, and I guess I glanced away at the last minute.  I missed the hole in the end of the shock tube completely and instead stabbed the shiv right through that oh-so-tender fleshy webbing between my thumb and forefinger.    Part of why this is funny is that I have a parallel scar on my other hand from when I was bitten by the next door neighbors' evil Basenji (and my father called me "Alpo" for weeks afterward).  I am certain that animal has long since gone to dog hell.  The other funny thing is that my intensely tatooed and pierced boss went completely white and almost fainted.    Rule #1 if you're the only woman on an all-guy crew is this:  NEVER LET THEM SEE YOU HURT.  So I extracted the shiv from my hand and set about cleaning out the wound, which was utterly bizarre: almost no blood at all, and the stuff inside was fiberous.  I would have been more curious about it if it hadn't hurt like a sonofabitch, and it did begin to close up very quickly.  After a careful soap-and-water washing, I sprayed it thoroughly with the alcohol bottle while onlookers winced.  My boss stammeringly asked me if I needed to go to the emergency room or anything.  When I demanded to know what kind of pussy he thought I was, he grinned a little bit and said he was required to ask by law.  The color still didn't return to his pierced face for a while, though.  I've had lots of other entertaining injuries.  If I can't leave the house pretty soon, I'll be forced to record them for posterity (or at least posteriors).

      Aristotle drives me batshit  A great deal of western thought is still all about Aristotle.  I happen to think that's terribly unfortunate because he was so unbelievably wrong about so many things.  Not only was he sort of a dessicated old windbag with sketchy logical skills, he was really uptight about all the wrong stuff.    Now, we can't fault Aristotle for not being too good with some of his quality of thought, because he's the beginning, right?  Wrong!  Aristotle's teacher was Plato, and Plato's teacher was Socrates.  We don't have much from Plato from his own pen, but we have a lot from Socrates through Plato, and Socrates was much more dead-on about a great many things.  He was sort of a professional fly in the ointment, always asking questions and seeking to find the answers, so it's not like Aristotle shouldn't have known how to do that, too.  True, some of Socrates' logic is a little iffy (he contributes political science's first crappy model in the Republic when he talks about how the life of a tyrant is 725 times worse than the life of a just man, for example), but he's genuinely looking for answers, whereas Aristotle seems to be pulling stuff right out of his ass and holding it up as Truth.    Socrates also has a healthy respect for women.  Women were guardians alongside the men, and his teacher, Diotema, was a woman, plus, he's married and thinks women are probably capable of thought and a whole host of other skills.  For his time, he's really quite progressive.  Whereas Aristotle seems to think women are only good for procreation and crying, neither of which he has much use for.  I can't say that rollback of healthy values doesn't stick in my craw just a little bit.  So why should some 3000-year-old desiccated windbag bother me now?  Well, Aristotle's legacy lives on.  The linear statistics we're stuck with, the logical basis of things, that's all from his work, and it's just as dessicated and useless in the real world as most of Nicomachean Ethics is for much of anything but telling your friends how much you love them.  And you know how I feel about bad linear statistics: they drive me batshit!  So, linear statistics drives me batshit, linear statistics is based on Aristotle's mode of thought, therefore, Aristotle's mode of thought drives me batshit.  Right?

      Day 4 of my confinement.  I'm pleased to report I've mastered bathing myself for the second time.  I can now do it without the use of my right hamstring.  Not that it matters, because I am more or less bereft of human contact, and the cats don't care if I'm stinky.  Still, I'll take my little victories where I can get them.  I hope to be able to put on my own socks soon.  I took a little hobble out to the mailbox today, and I've been catching up on numerous small-to-moderately-sized projects I'm too busy to complete when I'm not all cripped up.  I even hauled the trash out to the curb, whoo-hoo!   Freaktown Elections!  I've also been thinking today about all the freaky men in my life.  You know, women have this reputation for being all emotional and irrational, but in my experience, that's basically crap.  I'm about 40% less guided by my emotions and 80% more rational than most of the men I know.  The worst part is, they refuse to see their own irrational freakiness because they're what?  Men.  Fellas, you need to embrace your freakdom.  Accept it--it's part of you.  My friend Amy and I have been talking about the freaky men in our lives, and we've decided to hold elections for Mayor of Freaktown.  Not that you need to be a man to be mayor of Freaktown, but in this case, I'd say it helps.  What might election platforms be like, you ask?  Well, we've been considering what sorts of fiscal policies Freaktown might need, and we think a Commitment Tax is definitely in order.  Now, when visiting Freaktown, I would undoubtedly fall victim to the Commitment Tax myself, but when in Freaktown, do as the Freakyfolks do.  It'd be like getting a speeding ticket out of state.  I might not even pay it.  We also think a Closet Toll might be helpful.  This bill was primarily inspired by a gay man Amy dated earlier this year.  Aside from the fact that Amy is certainly yummy enough to tamper with anyone's notions of their sexual orientation to favor her, it seems that the gentleman in question was in deep denial about his true sexual identity.  One would pay a toll upon entering or exiting The Proverbial Closet.  Candidates for the Office of Mayor of Freaktown:  Freaky Marcelo.   Marcelo has been a very good friend of mine for several years, and he also dated Amy for a while.  He's a quirky guy, and so has long had a sort of profile in Freaktown politics, but most recently, he accused me of disrespecting his current girlfriend, a woman who doesn't speak and whom I can't get to know without any sort of communication, but who seems nice.  I have no real opinion about her personality because I have yet to see it, but Freaky Marcelo, now following his girlfriend's lead, is apparently not speaking to me over it.  He's currently living in Paris with her in an 8 x 8 room.  I think that's called a cell, but whatever.  Amy's Gay Boyfriend. I forget his name, and even if I remembered it, I wouldn't want to accidentally tip him off that he's gay.  But we could still elect him and not say why.  Harry. You knew he'd make the list!  Matilda still doesn't really know how to categorize their relationship, and neither do I.  They are not technically lovers, but could be considered such in some sort of Bill Clinton sense.  They are more than friends in some ways, less than friends in other ways, just friends in still other ways than those.  They do collaborate on academic projects, but are not currently being published, presented or funded together.  Harry is absorbed in a relationship that is sapping his creative energies, so Matilda is currently having most of the ideas.  In the meantime, he continues to be more emotional than Matilda's grandma.  She has no idea how to handle him but just takes it day by day, with a view to what she'd like to do to him once he regains his senses.  She just hopes she doesn't have to introduce him because she has no idea how she'll do it.  Poopy Boy. Another of member of Amy's Cavalcade of Men 2002, Poopy Boy got his name by coming home with Amy and completely freaking out that the dog had crapped on the rug.  He didn't step in it or anything, and said crap was quickly whisked away to become a mere receding memory, but his manhood never returned.  He has since impregnated his sourpuss subsequent girlfriend, Buzzkill, to whom he is currently not too willingly betrothed.  Write-in candidates will also be accepted.

      Hey, kids, it's time for STILL MORE THINGS I SUCK AT!!!  38.  Tennis.  Man, I am about the crappiest tennis player alive.  I couldn't be worse if I only had one leg and significantly fewer fingers.  I took tennis lessons for a little while when I was a kid, and the guy my parents were *paying* to teach me how to play suggested I try something else.  (I did, but I was good at it, and this list is about what I suck at, so let's stay focused).  39.  Pool.  I'm good for probably one decent shot per game.  When I get sucked into playing a giant tag-team game, I quit after that great shot to keep up the illusion that I don't suck, and then I go get someone else a drink, which makes me cool, too.  40.  Confinement.  This is a new one for me.  I didn't know I sucked at staying home until I had to.    41.  Patience without distraction.  True, I have been called pathologically patient.  Some have even said I have a zenlike quality about it.  What they don't know, though, is that I'm really just distracting myself from the incredibly annoying thing that's making me so damned impatient.  I have not calmed the chattering monkey, I've just given it a banana.  42.  Remembering which it is: 42 or 43.  Every other number, no problem, I can keep straight.  For some reason, though, mental block between 42 and 43.  43.  Same deal.  Douglas Adams fans will appreciate the irony of my predicament.  44.  Not allowing myself to be distracted by sexual fantasies.  It's true, I'm like an erotic Walter Mitty.  If I get a good sexual fantasy going, I'm pretty much locked in.  Pocketa, pocketa, pocketa.    45.  Concealing my nerdiness once I get comfortable.  True, I can behave like a normal person for a little while with a new group, but as soon as I settle in, this big scarlet N on my chest gets awfully noticible.

      Well, folks, I'm still too injured to drive, and today I'm bored out of my tree.  I suppose I could be writing Christmas cards or doing paperwork I've been putting off, but what I really want to do is get out of the house (which is clutterously full of recently-moved boxes I can't lift or bend to unpack) and run some errands, but as I mentioned, I can't drive, and *nothing* in Denver is walking distance--let alone gimping distance--from anything else.  After my brief moving hiatus, I think I'm about to be rather prolific over the next few days.  So I saw the new Bond movie!  I got into the car with a minimum of screaming and had my butt hauled down to the theater.    It seems that de-prancifying Pierce Brosnan is an ongoing process.  There is a scene where he is in a North Korean prison camp for a while, learning to be more of a tough guy, but unfortunately, he still occasionally runs like a girl and consistently fences like a nancyboy.    However, I STILL LIKED IT!!!  Die Another Day is way better than the last two Bonds, and in my opinion, better than Goldeneye, too, making it Prancy Pierce's best work yet.  Not only does it revert back to being more of a real Bond flick than an action flick with Bond, but there are lots of little treats for diehard Bond fans, like Halle Berry coming out of the Caribbean in an Ursula Andress suit, and Bond visiting Q (a delightfully cranky John Cleese) to find Col. Kleb's knifeshoe and the jetpack from Thunderball.  Also fabulous: invisible Aston Martin, mmmmmmmmmm.  And the aforementioned fencing scene totally got me hot.  Something about two men doing something as elegant as fencing yet attempting to brutally beat the hell out of each other in a barely-controlled fashion is inexplicably sexy.  Plus, I thought the villain was kinda cute.  A little pretty for my taste, perhaps, but not without his appeal.  There were a few blunt-instrument moments that were pretty lame, however, even to me.  When the traitorous agent gets stabbed through the abdomen with a commando knife stuck through a tasteful leatherbound copy of The Art of War, I'd say that's a bit much.  And that's ME saying that.    All in all, I highly recommend it.

      Top 10 things it's insanely hard to do with a torn hamstring  I hamstrung myself during a dance performance over the weekend.  It's better now, and I can even walk a *little* bit, but I had no idea how hard it would be to do the mundane things of life with one damaged muscle.  For example:  10. Drive a stick-shift. 9.  Put on your own underpants. 8.  Get in and out of the tub/shower. 7.  Pick up your cane if you drop it. 6.  Dress your feet. 5.  Navigate around the cats, who are very concerned about you, and keep from accidentally hammering your cane down on some small furry appendage. 4.  Not fall down laughing at the surprised noise the cat made. 3.  Get in the car without screaming (out is not too bad). 2.  Get some. 1.  Not contemplate how if you were a horse, you'd be shot by now.

      The West Wing makes me sad.  I know I'm supposed to like quality television, and that The West Wing is a sort of brainy show, and it's even about a subset of my field.  Everyone expects me to like it and recommends it to me when it comes up in conversation.  So okay, it's a good show, but I still don't like to watch it, because it makes me sad.  I think it's sad that we crave real leadership so badly that we recreate it so realistically on television.  It's not entertainment, it's a desperate cry for help as a society.  The President of our hearts and minds is a good man, smart and trustworthy.  We haven't had anyone like that at the head of our country in so long, we couldn't even pretend it was someone we might recognize--we had to make him up from scratch--and we need him so badly that he's doing quite well on television.  Our real President, well, just look at him!  I don't know a single American Citizen who thinks it's a good idea to engage Iraq militarily.  That includes not only the eggheaded peacenik academics one might expect me to be in contact with on a daily basis, but mechanics and soccer moms and regular folks with regular jobs and even folks who are in or plan to enlist in the military.  I don't think I need to say that attacking Iraq is not about regime change, it's about oil change.    So in reality, we have an ignorant buffoon who is proud of having been a C student, stole an election, and is proceeding with whatever policies he feels like implementing whether we want them or not.  Leaving aside the fact that it's a puzzle how this putz gets dressed in the morning and gets all the buttons to come out even, if this were going on in any other country, we'd be investigating it if not stepping in and taking over.  Think about it: the son of a former head of state decides he wants to be head of state too.  The province his brother rules has the deciding votes as to whether or not the son wins, and of course, the brother comes through come hell or high water, even though there are some very shady election practices going on.  The son takes the election, and proceeds to run his administration so that his business cronies, not the general populace, benefit.  Think I'm being alarmist?  Look into the background of Trent Lott's replacement.  His family benefited greatly from a settlement with the government over their string of HMOs, even winning a concession that they will not be financially responsible for the effects of biological warfare on future patients.  The only potential beneficiaries of what I can only call the colonization of Iraq are those who require a cheap source of oil to resell.  What's the son's family's business?  Oh yes, it's oil.  It sounds like a corrupt third world dictatorship, but it's our beloved republic.  After September 11th, I had my first-ever whiff of patriotism.  I was born during Vietnam to parents who actively protested that conflict.  I remember Nixon and Watergate, and those were some of my earliest experiences of American politics.  I have long been disgusted with the system and have chosen to work outside it for positive change, because I'm not sure it's possible within it.  But September 11th so galvanized the populace that I actually put an American flag sticker in the back window of my car--something I never expected I'd do.  I was fiercely proud of the regular Americans who helped each other in the aftermath of the attacks, of the firefighters and police who ran into collapsing buildings to help those who were trapped, and especially of the passengers on the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania, who the previous day had been mowing their lawns and balancing their checkbooks, and who chose to die rather than let terrorists hurt any more Americans.  Ironically, these most heroic folks are the ones most readily forgotten in the litany of those who sacrificed that day.    It was especially meaningful to me because my father is from that part of Pennsylvania.  He came to be from there because his family, recently immigrated to America, worked in the coal mines there.  I never met most of them because they were killed, either by the mines themselves, or later by nickel poisoning and blacklung.  So beneath the wreckage of that plane, hundreds of feet down, lie the bones of a few of my recent ancestors.  They believed in the American Dream so much that they ultimately died for it: working hard, hoping their children would get out of the patch, go further, live better, because here, they could.  When I have struggled in my life, in my work, and even in my educational process, I often feel I am being carried by the strong shoulders and sooty hands of those miners, encouraged by their voices, and that my achievements are theirs.  The fact that I am two generations removed from the patch and close to being called Doctor is their doing, their victory as well as my own.  At its most cynical, my drive is an attempt to make their sacrifice *mean* something, at least to the bloodline.  We paid hard for the American Dream.  Of course, the America they came to is not the same one that I live in.  The one that I live in has forgotten the lessons of history.  It arms itself for greedy conflict as the Athenians armed their ships for war with the Peloponnese.  It will not go well, and we don't even have a decent Pericles to make us feel okay about it.  So today, I'm taking that American flag sticker out of my window.  My brief pride at sharing a country with such brave and sacrificing human beings as the victims of the September 11th attacks has been overshadowed by my disgust with the corrupt administration "governing" it.  In a way, I was happier before I ever knew what it was like to feel patriotic.  I feel like something has been taken away from me, where before, I simply noticed a dearth of recent American heroes.  My generation grew up in a sort of dreamless sleep, bereft of true examples.  Even Michael Jordan is a pretty poor substitute for Rosa Parks.  So the fantasy of The West Wing, where the President is in charge but human, fair and real and good, it only reminds me of what we don't have.  It's sort of a taunt.  We deserve good leaders and good, trustworthy people running our country.  We are entitled to our President listening to us--he works for us, after all, at least by statute.  And this time, it wasn't really that we voted for him.  Because this time, we didn't.    So, my fellow Americans, I urge you to get really pissed off about all this.  Write it down and send it, participate in protests, sign petitions, express your outrage.  Things are the way they are because we're letting what's masquerading as our current leadership get away with it.  Don't.  You let that cracker in a $3000 suit know we're onto him and that he works for US, not his oil buddies.  I'll take him on in a debate, in a wrestling match, any contest he likes other than the Duty Free Shopping competition, and I hope you will join me.    If the Tree of Liberty is meant to be periodically watered by the blood of patriots, this disillusioned patriot is stocking up on Band-Aids.

      Lately, I've been absorbed in getting ready for a conference I'm going to in Vienna, where I'm going to be sharing my nerdiness with the world in the form of a poster.  It will be by far the nerdiest thing I've ever conveyed to a group of people in my life.  May it be supplanted soon!  Needless to say, lots of arrangements.  I understand Matilda is also making her preparations to go see Harry.    In the meantime, I've been communicating with a new friend.  He's a really wonderful guy who just broke it off with a woman who didn't deserve him.  He's in his early 30s, so any date is seen by others as some sort of potential lifepartner, and he gets a lot of the same social pressures most of us in this age group get.  Get married!  Buy a house!  Own a minivan!  Move to suburbia!  Whelp!    Anyway, this friend is a thoughful, examined-life-living sort, fond of the small delights in life, and he's thinking about what he wants and what's important.  He recently asked me for opinions/answers, and I think I spewed out a stream of Philosophy of Everyday Adventures.  As I'm trying to sketch out some of that philosophy here, a respewing follows.  --------------------------  Okay, here's an answer of sorts: F*ck pressure.  It's much more important to construct a life you would actually want.  The house buying thing in my life was really more of a concession to my husband and his family than it was a goal of mine, so I don't know if it counts in my case.  I would have been okay with renting for the rest of my life, not having a new car, etc.  Also, where I'm from it's not a big deal to be my age and not have any kids, but here in Denver, it's damned unusual.  Might it be nice to breed sometime before I have 3 rubbery eggs left?  Sure, but if I'm not ready in time, I'm not going to do it.  And the marriage thing, well, I could very well end up like one of those middle aged sitcom landladies with big hair, dressed in skin-tight jungle prints talking about my endless string of husbands.  And I probably won't die of that either.  At times, though, I'm sort of astounded by how conventional my life looks.  I expected to be living in a tree or doing something really out there by now.  A wise observation, and you're right, suburbia sux.  You don't have to go there--you can bail off the suburbia train at any time and get back on if you feel like it--and you don't have to replace it with anything if you don't want to.  Taking pleasure in the small things is way more important, and it's harder to master, so you're far ahead of the game there!  I know exactly what you're talking about.  At this stage of our lives, it's like everyone expects us to have some f*cking Rand McNally Road Atlas of the Next 50 Years folded up in our pockets, ready to whip them out at a moment's notice and proclaim our plans, and then hop in our minivans and go there.  I hate that.  Only drones with no imagination who don't care where they end up or if they had an interesting life like it.  Making it up as you go along is much more fun.  I don't know if I have any good answers, but I have a few observations that you can take or make fun of or whatever.  There is nothing more appealing about a person than being comfortable in one's own skin and nothing more satisfying than being at the helm of one's own life.  Being and doing who and what makes you happy are key, and the belief that it's happening seems to be more important than whether it's happening from an objective standpoint.  Doing whatever you have to do to feel like it's all good seems to attract all the right ju-ju.  I don't know why or how it works.  Maybe it's some kinda chaotic increasing returns thing.  Travel is definitely a great idea.  When you're in motion, adventures find you like smells find dogs with their heads eagerly and joyfully stuck out the window.  Most of how you do your own accounting about your life has to do with how you look at stuff.  For example, I'm 31 years old, I'm still in school, I haven't whelped, I'm not a size 6, and I can't cook a fucking pot roast to save my life.  What a failure!  To me, though, I *am* the man I was supposed to marry, so what my husband does and whether I'm even with someone aren't all that important, I'm in school for a flashy credential and still on the young side for what it is, I'd much rather be strong and voluptuous than breakable and pointy and give up Middle Eastern dance because skinny girls suck at it, there's plenty of sh*t I *can* cook, and f*ck, I can *read* if the desire to make pot roast overwhelms me, and if I do get around to whelping, I'll be that much better at it for having waited until I was good and ready.  I think I'm doing pretty well, even if suburbia doesn't.  Plus, I get to pet ferrets, and drink all the coffee I want, and blissfully eat chocolate ice cream in upscale shopping malls in front of brittle rich ladies who always look miserable and glare jealously at me, and have strange and wonderful experiences with hot nerds in exotic locales, and wear a balloon hat on my birthday and accuse anyone who stares at me of being jealous of it, none of which I would get to do if I gave a rat's ass about all the conventional stuff I'm supposed to be doing.    So F*CK society!  Does society pay my bills, feed my cats, wash my dishes, balance my checkbook, make me a sandwich?  Does it comfort me when I'm sad, get me off when I'm horny, chill me out when I'm too pissed off to keep from ramming the car in front of me on the highway, make me coffee when I'm dragging ass?  NO!  What has society done for me lately?  Not a f*cking thing!  Lazy bastards.  I may not want to go live in a yurt in the middle of nowhere and eat bark, but I sure don't owe those  judgmental wankmonkies a damn thing.  Where the hell is my balloon hat?!  I dunno.  I often make decisions based on avoiding regret.  Will I get another chance to watch the sun set into the ocean anytime soon?  Will I always wonder what it would have been like to kiss this hot nerd?  If I got to see the World's Largest Ball of Yarn, will it be worth it to be a couple of hours late?  Won't I wish I could say I had taken the house in Las Vegas, even if it was for some inconsequential amount?  Would I rather be called Doctor for the rest of my life or make some f*cking money this year?  Ultimately, I'd like to die comfortably, impressed with my life and surrounded by my many attentive lovers.  Here's a weird idea.  You could write yourself a really kickass obituary and then try to live up to it.  Let me know if you need a balloon hat.

      I can't believe I forgot to mention:  51.  Parallel parking.  Sheesh, do I ever suck at *that*!  It's gotten better over the years, but there are still some times when I back up and pull forward about a million times trying to get it right.    52.  Not treating men like pieces of meat.  It's true, I objectify them all the time.    53.  Restraining inappropriate fantasies accordingly.  When I was teaching last quarter, I had conferences with some of my students, two of whom were notably attractive and brilliant.  I had a really hard time paying attention to what they were saying rather than contemplating clearing the table with a single sweeping gesture and... [insert chik-a-wah-wah style porn flick music here].  I know, it was terrible.  I was getting paid to care about their ideas, and I did, but one of them especially I just wanted to kiss hard and get in his lap.  54.  Accepting bullshit generalizations about women.  Being Such A Guy myself, I just don't buy most of them.  I don't prefer shopping to football, for example (okay, except if Parcells is coaching one of the teams and winning.  F*cker.)  I accept generalizations like "women tend to have ovaries," but even that's not true all the time, and it can be a tricky assumption to make.    Also:  Freaktown elections update:  I reported the Poopy Boy scenario incorrectly.  Apparently, Poopy Boy slipped in the dogshit and fell on his ass.  Amy, who has great sense of occasion, attempted to use this mishap as a ploy to get him out of his pants (so they could be washed of course).  In my mind, he's still freaky, but I think that puts him behind Harry and Marcelo both.    Speaking of which, Harry and Matilda are reportedly doing quite well.  With their movie date fast approaching, Harry has been being very sweet to Matilda.  She is starting to feel more cofident about her decision to continue with the plan and beginning to believe that she will probably have a pretty good time with Harry no matter what they see.  (No idea what I'm talking about?  See Friday, November 8.)  She may yet become the First Lady of Freaktown.

      I got a very thoughtful response to my last posting about how The West Wing makes me wicked sad.  I'm reprinting it here because I think our esteemed webhost has some good points, and because my particular brand of egotism does not include thinking I have a monopoly on the truth.  Besides, anyone who is as articulate and informed as Lisa always contributes something to the discourse.  Thanks, Lisa!  ------------------------------------ Is West Wing a Good Thing?  Dear Meg,  I wanted to write in reply to your post regarding how you think the TV show West Wing is sad -- sad because it mocks our desire for true leadership by providing one on TV that is so sorely lacking in real life.  I was inspired to write in part because I think I like the show for some of the reasons you don't. After the election, West Wing became part of my psychic force-field, allowing me to deny and avoid the reality that George W. Bush was president until I could deal with it. I figured, I would just pretend President Bartlet was the real President until George Bush II went away. It was made much easier by the fact that that other tv show -- Bush White House II -- had crappier production values than The Blair Witch Project and whose bizarre plotlines and dialogue had apparently been written by people who neglected to Just Say No.  Denying an entire Presidential administration seems like kind of a big thing -- the kind of heroic delusion that can only be sustained by those special people who wear the tin foil hats. But it was easy for me, because I had long thought that Presidents didn't matter. In a way, they were like management at my old company. They issued a lot of proclamations, announcements, and rules, but when it came down to it, none of them changed my daily life a jot -- when management spoke, I didn't suddenly have my PC taken away or my cube walls painted hot pink, and so it was with Washington -- streets didn't suddenly become unpaved after a press conference or anything -- so it was pretty easy to just turn down the volume on their blather and get on with my life. They could sit up there and churn out the Big Four types of bills -- Political Grandstanding (eg doomed flag-burning amendments that please the dupes, oops, I mean constituents back home but won't stand up to a sideways fart in court), This Is Thus And So Day (for big donors and other muckety mucks), Tax Fiddles (practically everything, including, let's not forget, the Mohair and Beekeeping industries), and Pork (It remains a mystery to me why Pork is so reviled, when of the Big Four it is the only kind of activity in Washington that actually results in something tangible). The actual fact of America was always a lot stronger than whatever leaders said or did, and my feeling was that the American Way -- by which I mean class mobility, the Big Mac, and unlimited consumer electronics -- could withstand 8 years in a cage match with any bozo, even if the bozo came equipped with a metal folding chair.   Of course, that was in the happy time before September 11, the time when we could safely ignore Washington and the world beyond America's borders. Poof -- there went my fantasy of holing up with President Bartlet & Co., and riding out the Bush administration in their loving if overly talky care.  Even though we have different reactions to the West Wing, we're both reacting to the same basic thing -- our distress as citizens at having lost any control over our government. In fact, my basic problem with the post 9/11 leadership is that it's still too much like the pre 9/11 leadership -- that is, run by and for the interests of large businesses -- and not just oil businesses. The perfect case in point is the recent bill that established the Homeland Security department -- which many commentators fhelt was entirely toothless, but managed to contain a rider from the drug industry protecting them against any and all lawsuits that might stem from kids being killed or brain damaged by the childhood vaccines they produce. (even more disgusting, the congressional sponsor of the rider, and the name of the lobbying group or drug company who wrote it has been supressed, so we can't even send crabby letters to them).   My big fear, though, is not that, effectively, my vote has been taken away. My big fear is that after 20 years of deregulation, giving power that used to be the peoples' power -- hand over fist, by the truckload, by the 55 gallon drum, to corporations, is that we are becoming, as a nation, an aristocracy -- and the reality of that would mean that losing the power of my vote wouldn't be the only thing I'd lose. I'd lose the hope I have for my son of doing better than I did. I'd gladly never vote again if I felt that it would preserve his chance to succeed -- the same chance my parents and their parents, and your mom and dad and grandparents, gave us.  But first, what do I mean by aristocracy? I mean this: Lords are lords. Peasants are peasants. Peasants never become Lords. The children of Lords are also Lords, and the children of peasants are always peasants. Class portability -- the idea that you can do better for yourself and your children -- doesn't exist in an aristocracy.  Why would I have the strange idea that an aristocracy is forming here in the US, the very country that was formed in opposition to the idea? Well, a lot of things give me a bad, sick feeling. The first inkling I got of it was in 1993, when I worked for an executive recruiter whose business it was to help venture capitalists find CEOs for small technology startups. The VCs routinely picked candidates that had cratered other companies, which baffled me. Weren't they looking for a track record of success? When I asked, a VC told me, "I want somebody who learned their lessons on somebody else's money." After that, what I realized is that the industry had created a revolving door for dangerous incompetents, who, once having become a CEO, just kept on being a CEO, ruining people's lives by destroying their workplaces, and wasting investors' money (let's not forget that the money in many VC funds comes, in fact, from pension funds, so it's not a victimless crime). Now I see this at all levels in society. Look at Enron; look at Worldcom; look at Henry Kissinger. People who should be in jail, people who should be publicly reviled, are simply waiting it out until they can make the big bucks again. It makes me long for the reintroduction of public humiliation as a punishment. All I want is a half-dozen CEOs and other charlatans in stocks on a flatbed truck, and half a ton of spoiled produce. Their punishment will be up after every man, woman, and child in every podunk town from coast to coast has had their chance to pop a rotten tomato right in the kisser. I feel that George Bush himself is a creature of this phenomenon -- a permanent revolving upper class of leaders and powerbrokers who always stay in power no matter how terrible they are and how often they fail.   And in fact, Washington has become so weak that they cannot even close a meat plant whose e.Coli tainted meat killed people, effectively sanction car companies whose cars kill the occupants even more than the people the cars hit, or get GE to stop flouting no less than 16 injunctions to stop dumping cancer-causing PCBs into the Hudson River. We can't even ensure our citizens that they or their children won't be poisoned by what they bring home from the supermarket. We used to be able to do that. We gave the power away, because many of our citizens and a majority of our elected representatives got themselves snared in a psychotic delusion that government was bad and letting corporations do anything they wanted was better.  I'm writing a satirical novel set in 2035, in a world in which the same trends I see now have played out. In doing the research I was surprised to learn that although I didn't have tons of company, I wasn't completely alone in thinking this. The economist Paul Krugman thinks that we are passing out of a brief period of democracy that began in the 1930's and ended with the election of George Bush. In the 1920's, he posits, the country was largely run by a cabal of large business interests with politicians at their beck and call, and would have continued doing so if they hadn't robbed the public to the extent that they tanked the entire economy into the Great Depression.  By the way, we are now experiencing the first episode of deflation (widely falling prices) since the Great Depression, and the recession we just came out of was the longest recession in the post World War II period, and many people think we will be back in a recession within the next two quarters. Like the US in the late '90s, Japan experienced a speculative bubble that burst in 1991 -- and they're still in the trough over a decade later. A speculative bubble, followed by a bust and deflation, was exactly what triggered the Great Depression. So, there are self-regulatory mechanisms. The greedheads at the top can screw up so badly that the people will revolt. But it takes a lot of pain and suffering to get to the point where enough people will be out there on the street saying NO to make it happen. I really don't think marches on Washington or postcard campaigns are gonna do it. I hate to think we'd have to have a rerun of The Grapes of Wrath to get there, and it makes me genuinely afraid for my family. Let's put it this way: whatever I've got is staying under my mattress.  One question I have for you is what, in particular, triggered this? I mean, why now, exactly? Did something you saw on CNN make your head explode?  Oh, and one more thing. See, you weren't raised as a Catholic, so you might not have this important skill -- the skill of dissassociating the leadership from the thing itself. The Church isn't the Pope, and the US isn't George Bush and his C+ cronies.  It's us. We're America. That flag is ours, dammit, not theirs.  How about one of these, with this fine American sentiment?  (You'll have to check my journal at http://www.cadence90.com/blogs/nixon.html to see the image).   Lisa

      The Ugly American  As anti-American sentiment grows, all this lumping-together of all 260 million of us is really getting on my nerves.  We can separate ourselves from the C student in front of the cameras who doesn't understand what the hell he's saying and claims to have been elected President, why can't the rest of the world?  "America" is not doing this to you, okay?  It's just one rich jerk and his buddies.    In fact, this seems to be a common scenario with Americans in other countries, and I think it's the basis for the very skewed view of us abroad.  Some rich ass with an American passport walks into a restaurant in a foreign country, proceeds to embarass his hosts, be rude to the waiter, and behave as if he had been fed out of a trough all his life.  Geopolitically, some rich ass steals an election, and proceeds to try to colonize a vulnerable country in an unstable region so he and his buddies and family can control a source of cheap oil for the next 50 years or so, and generally behaves like a jerk.  The thing that most folks in other countries who have had some experience of this brand of American don't realize is that that's not typical of us at all.  Most of us are polite, friendly, and only interested in violence in the movies.  We might use the wrong fork, but that's only because we usually only get one at home and we're not sure what the other ones are all about.  But we're game.  We get exposed to people who are different from us every day, and most of us are up for trying things a different way just to see what it's like.  We don't even get embarassed if we're awkward about it the first time.  Also, as someone who is very well domestically traveled, I have to say that at home, Americans are sweethearts.  They're itching to share what's intersting about where they live with anyone who happens through.  If you're from out of town, you have *got* to try this pie and see that curiosity or beautiful landmark.  And while we're driving through, if there is any possible way we'll have time to do it, we *do* try this pie and see that thing, because we're curious about other places and folks, too.  I have met so many Americans in my travels who would give a complete stranger the shirt off their backs, I couldn't understand where the sterotype came from.  And then I left the North American landmass for the first time.  I went to Aruba on my honeymoon.  There were a lot of folks there who never left the resort grounds.  There were others who did and were loud and drunk and obnoxious.  There was one family that made me want to tell people I was Canadian, all drunk, teenage son and father singing dirty songs at the top of their lungs, mom encouraging them and shrieking with laughter.  It began to become clear to me.  These weren't the kind of folks I met while driving around through 38 states, who were friendly and curious and liked to try new things and share what was special about where they were with others.  These were the kind of folks I didn't like to share subway cars with or be at the next table from in a restaurant.  There aren't that many of them, but hell if they don't all travel and behave like themselves wherever they go.  So why don't folks in other countries know about the majority of us?  I think it's because when you live on a giant landmass with ocean on either end, travel to foreign countries is expensive.  The folks you love to meet while traveling and remember for the rest of your life are regular Americans: waitresses and truck drivers and farmers and teachers and regular hardworking folks with regular jobs.  These folks often don't go abroad more than once in their lives, because they can't afford it and they don't know anybody there.  The ones who seem to travel most for pleasure (theirs, not ours) are those with brand new money.  They don't know how to behave in a nice restaurant here either, and they figure that just because they can afford to pay the check, they should be welcomed no matter what they do.  They're obnoxious and just bought a ton of horrible leather furniture.  They're also a pretty small percentage of the population.    Unfortunately, these folks are also more memorable than those of us who speak the language, know which fork to use, and politely ask directions, and they got there first.  All I can really say to the rest of the world is that before you decide that's who we are, come see us here at home.  You have got try this pie.

      SMACKDOWN!  Yoda vs. Gandalf  Over the last few weeks, my husband Phillip and I have had a running gag about who would win in a fight: Yoda or Gandalf.  While I can't imagine what two such moral equivalents would possibly have to fight about, I admit I am nonetheless intrigued.  Gandalf of course has size on his side, and is good with both sword and magic staff.  Yoda, on the other hand, jumps around while he's fighting like a bush baby on a double-espresso.  Judge him by his size, will you?  Of course, he said that when he was still a puppet, placidly dislodging X-wing fighters from swamps, and not a computer-generated mirage who mugs like he's having a bowel movement every time he practices a little telekinesis.    So Yoda vs. Gandalf SMACKDOWN! goes something like this: In this corner, wearing tasteful neutral-colored flowing robes, standing six-foot-nine, weighing 220 pounds, the Mofo of Middle Earth, the Grim Reaper of Gondor, GANDALF THE GREEEEY!  In this corner, also wearing tasteful neutral-colored flowing robes, standing two-foot-four, weighing 46 pounds, the Diva of Dagoba, the Jumpin' Jedi, YODAAAAA!   Whaddya think?  Who walks away with the belt?

      Quinn Martin Rocks!  Now, you might think I have several good rants about America's Brand New War, and you'd be right.  But I'm not going to talk about my feelings about colonization for the sake of cheap oil today.  If you want to get depressed, have a few beers and watch the war on videophone.  No, today I'm going to talk about one of the great movers and shakers of television and some of his finer products.    I love Quinn Martin Productions.  You may not know who Quinn Martin is, but you know his work: The Streets of San Francisco, Hawaii Five-O, Cannon, Barnaby Jones... the list goes on.  All those 60s and 70s crime dramas worth a damn, they're all Quinn Martin productions.  I adore them.  If I'm flipping through channels and find one, I'm finished looking.  The only thing that trumps a Quinn Martin production is Columbo.  Quinn Martin had a vision.  He wanted detective shows set in different major American cities, each with a certain style but its own flair, and they all had that trademark QM structure with four acts and an Epilog.  There's something about the vision that absolutely fascinates me, and it's not just nostalgic kitch.  I love the way each series had a certain kind of localized grittiness, like Dragnet meets City Confidential.  I love the way the characters wore polyester and were sure they looked good, sort of like when you're on the dance floor and you start to believe you look good, so you do.  I *really* love the cool theme songs.    I also love that Quinn Martin was so cutting edge for his time.  Despite the often hilarious scripts, he took on important issues of the day.  His stuff was at least as cool as Miami Vice was a decade or two later.  McGarrett always had groovy new techno-gadgets at his disposal.  Cannon had a car phone, a curly-corded handset that came out of his armrest or something.  Michael Douglas just had Karl Malden to go get the car while he ran after the perp, but he could shoot at him from behind his wideass shield of a tie.  And what did the milk-guzzling Barnaby Jones have?  Just Lee Merriweather, but that was probably plenty.    There's also something very viscerally appealing to me beyond my intense enjoyment of the *style* of it all.  There's something so sweet, so innocent about the stuff that people on those shows were worried about.  I mean, who is afraid of hippies anymore?  The characters all looked wistfully back to the simpler times of the 50s and earlier, commenting on how complicated things had become.  This is likely because Quinn Martin had a blistering conservative right-wing social agenda, which to me, just makes his delightful products that much more hilarious.  Maybe what I find most appealing about it is how comforting that is.  Perhaps in the next generation, during those trying times, we'll all look back on this as a society and laugh.  Or maybe it's just that anyone who can swagger with self-important authority while wearing a plaid polyester sports jacket is worthy of some admiration, and those shows were full of guys like that.  Anyway, they don't make 'em like that anymore.  Sure beats the hell out of war by videophone.  Even George Jetson, first television character to have video conferencing, would rather see Dano book 'em.

      The Hypothetical Dominatrix  Say you're in a committed relationship.  Say things are going fairly well and the sex is really good, and then one day, out of the blue, your man expresses some interest in your being a dominatrix.  In the immortal words of Dennis Hopper to Keanu Reeves, what do you do?  What *do* you DO?  Maybe you're up for trying stuff for sh*ts and giggles so you say what the hell.  Maybe the idea of getting a whole new lingerie wardrobe is irresistable.  Maybe pushing men around has been a lifelong hobby of yours and you think it might be nice to have someone else do the dishes without an argument for a change, and if you have to administer the occasional spanking for it, hey, why not?  So maybe you start off with a trip to your friendly neighborhood sex shop to try to get a feel for what it's all about, or maybe you go to your friendly neighborhood bookstore and look for a Dominatricing for Dummies book.  Well, if you've come this far, it's time to spring it on you:  this is another rave sex book review.  If you ever find yourself in this position, I highly recommend _The Mistress Manual: A Good Girl's Guide to Female Dominance_ by Mistress Lorelei.  Hell, I'd recommend it just for the social discourse alone.  Mistress Lorelei identifies five different male submissive archetypes and explains how to deal with each of them.  Who among us doesn't know a naughty schoolboy type who desperately needs a good spanking?  I'd have to say Harry is one of those for sure, although he probably doesn't know it.  She also offers encouragement for the reluctant Domme and explains a lot about how the mind of a male submissive works.    Best of all, Mistress Lorelei offers a lot of good information about what to do, what to wear, and why you don't have to be a severe six-foot blonde in foot-munching heels to do it.  There is even a delightful section on spanking: how to, where, with what, virtues of various implements, and so on.  She also offers advice as to how to find a guysub if you are not so equipped, and is always entertaining.  I highly recommend it.  Happy spanking!

      Harry and Matilda: The Resolution  Harry and Matilda went to the movies.  They saw Tres Heures du Merdre like Harry wanted, and he did do some funny voices, although they weren't quite as funny as Matilda had hoped.  Matilda had a nice time with Harry, and after the movie ended and they went home, she found she really missed Harry being around.    The sad part was, Harry had initially made Matilda feel pretty special, and once they got to the movie, Matilda felt more like Harry had just wanted her to come along so he didn't have to go alone, and not because of anything particularly special about her.  It took a lot of time and money and work for her to get to that movie, and in the end, all his coaxing and encouragement and funny voices seemed pretty empty.    Harry is a really special person who, because of his particular damage, can't get out of his own way long enough to let what is wonderful about him shine through, or to be free and happy for himself.  Matilda only saw little flashes of it, but enjoyed what she got.  She wishes he were capable of being that person all the time.  So Matilda feels pretty compassionate toward Harry despite the fact that he did exactly the sort of thing to her that causes her freaky damage in the first place, and he did it knowing what that damage was.  For all the things Matilda enjoys about Harry, he is in some ways still a selfish little boy and not interested in being the man he could be (and is for a few minutes at a time).  There were times when he even seemed to be jealous of her, or like he wanted to be more of a rival than a friend.  Matilda chose not to try to get him to see Explosions Are Forever.  He still has no idea what kind of opportunity he blew.  Matilda has no regrets, however.  She had a great time, she got answers to the questions she needed answered, and she never would have showed up for the great time for less than what Harry had promised.  Part of her still lives in the happy moments during that afternoon in the movie theater, and always will.  As for my trip to Vienna, it was really wonderful.  It's a beautiful city, I felt both at home and constantly exposed to wonderful novelty, I enjoyed the conference, and best of all, I got the guy I needed for my dissertation committee.  Now the only thing holding up my process is my own time, work, and discipline.  I expect to gas on more about that later.  Right now, I have some research to do...

      As you may remember from my posting of September 13th, the Arrow of Entropy really frosts my cachongas.  I've decided to submit a rant about it for the upcoming conference I plan on attending.  I think I can attack it from both a philosophical perspective, and because it's based on linear statistics, a mathematical one as well.  I'm a little stuck for a title, though.    In the meantime, I think a good way to test someone's understanding of something is to make them write jokes about it.  I mean, if you really get what's funny about an idea or a particular thinker or whatever, it's usually because you really get it.  You can't make fun of something in a clever way without understanding it.  I think comprehensive exams for the Ph.D. ought to include a "write a joke" question.    So I've been running my early ideas about the paper past a friend of mine more knowledgeable than myself in physics and quantum mechanics, just to be sure I get what I think I get (and maybe a little bit because he has a very sexy brain and I want to play with it more).  This of course prompted me to come up with several potential joke titles for my paper.    Why Entropy Frosts My Cachongas  Heat Death or Just Death Warmed Over? God Plays Backgammon (Film At Eleven) My Statistics Can Beat up Your Statistics The Uniform Puddle of Radiation and You: A Guide to Heat Death The Slaughterhouse Five Effect Omelets: Entropy's Community Service Reassemble This Is the Universe Winding Down, or is it Just Me? We're All Gonna Die (in several hundred billion years)!!! 1-900-HOT-4-NOW Uniformity of Matter is for Sissies Fuck Glue, The Wave Function Just Collapsed You Won't Need That Where You're Going: The Arrow of Entropy Emergency Kit I'm OK, Your Teacup is Smashed Forever  Of course, all this is really procrastination.  I have to stick a real title on this thing and send it off...

      So I'm trying to work out how I'm going to have a Ph.D. in my hot little hands in the next 16 months (if it kills me, thank you).  A lot of it involves getting money.  This summer, I'm going to be working at the bike shop a lot, trying to do a little fundraising on the side, and then for next year, I've landed a fairly sweet graduate teaching assistantship, which I hope will allow me to cut back on various jobs and focus more on writing.  What's good about the assistantship is that it pays super-well and it's pretty interesting: a distance-learning class being taught by live video feed by a guy in DC.  I'll be the on-the-ground, in-the-studio guy here in Denver, taking care of the student hand-holding and what-not.  Should be good experience for the changing future of higher education and set me up with some folks who can help me get a yob.  What's freaky about the assistantship is that the course is being taught at the Cable Museum, an industry museum about cable television that sits on the edge of the D.U. campus.  That joint is like walking onto the set of "Tomorrow Never Dies."  You go in the doors, and there is a "lobby" area three stories high, lots of glass.  There is a giant bank of TV monitors that spans the entire height of the building.  Where's Michelle Yeoh when you need her?    Also, the industry awards given out to various folks by the money people at the Cable Museum are rather stunning.  You know how most people get awards for being nice human beings?  You saved kittens from a burning building?  Here's your award!  You established a senior citizens center to help get roving geriatric gangs off the streets?  Here's your award!  You blew the whistle on the local milk distributor before he got milk from various circus mammals into the schools?  Yuck, here's your award!  Well, the Cable Museum has been giving out awards to people who have managed to come up with new and innovative ways to separate the public from its money using cable TV.  The guy who invented pay-per-view: let's rip 'em off right in their own living rooms?  That's a fabulous idea!  Here's your award.  I guess a lot of industry museums are scary like that.  The people I'll be working with seem nice, though, so I'm hoping they'll be more indicative of my upcoming experience.    Otherwise, I'll have to go James Bond on that place.

      I reckon I'm going to be a little sporadic on this 'blog for a bit, as Lisa and I have started a second about my upcoming trip to Boston for an academic conference.  You can read all about the road trip stage as it unfolds at   http://www.cadence90.com/blogs/treklog.html.  Should be juicy.  In the meantime, I'm sure I'll have many more non-travel-related rants over the coming months...

      Gee, why aren't there more women scientists?  So yesterday, I participated in the Sigma Xi poster session for gradaute students at my university.  Sigma Xi is a sort of professional society, like Phi Beta Kappa, but for graduate students and professionals, and largely for scientists.  As y'all know, in the world of academia, I am in some ways a woman without a country.  I am much more of a scientist than my field of international relations theory generally allows.  I have a lot of friends and colleagues in the hard sciences, and in some ways, I feel more compatible with them and more welcome there.  Yesterday, though, while I was hanging out with my poster that was about mathematical modeling in the social sciences using nonlinear dynamics, some scientists gave me some pretty thinly-veiled crap about not being a "real" scientist.  So I'm not measuring something easy like temperature.  Hey, nobody did that until Mr. Farenheit decided how to do it.  Just because I'm quantifying something new and I have to be creative about it doesn't mean I'm not being scientific.  That is not the attitude that brought us down out of the trees, you know?  For the most part, though, I enjoyed myself, and got to have a lot of neat coversations with a lot of folks I wouldn't otherwise have met.  After the poster session was a wine-and-cheese social deal followed by dinner and a lecture.  An altogether delightful event.  A few things happened with the speaker, though, that really frosted my cachongas.  First, the young woman who spoke was a nuclear chemist.  She gave an interesting talk, and really stressed the need for the government and the general public to be better versed about science.  She took a dig at policy folks, which wasn't really fair--she's at least as ignorant about what they're trying to accomplish than they are about her work, and less willing to learn about it.  She also pointed out how few women and minorities were in the sciences and engineering and stressed the need for that to change as well.  I am absolutely down with all that.  She seemed concerned and puzzled by the lack of female participation, and ended her presentation with a list of all the foundations that support her research.    Being in the social sciences, I was pretty stunned by the list.  You know who supports my research?  Me, my husband, and Lisa.  Her implication that the sciences were really hurting for money and talent in the face of all that public ignorance and all those stupid policy folks, is by comparison to the social sciences, humanities and arts, basically crap.  True, this country needs to do a better job with funding education all the way around.  But nobody but a "hard" scientist would have a list of a dozen big-name sponsors funding their research.  It felt to me like Marie Antoinette complaining about the coconut frosting on her cake.  Secondly, after being called a non-scientist repeatedly that day for daring to do scientific research in the social sciences with the hope of raising the bar, I can tell you why more women aren't in the sciences: because scientists aren't nice to us.  The women are threatened, the men think we're not smart enough, and social skills are in short supply.  Also, people who consider themselves scientists and anyone who is not doing physics or engineering or whatever non-scientists act like the training is like that of being a professional ballerina: that you have to start when you're a child, and practice every day, and publish this, and get that award, and blah, blah, blah.  You can't simultaneousy invite people in and slam the door in their faces if their backgrounds aren't exactly like yours.  Your field will be forever dominated by white boys.  Finally, the fiance of one of my friends made an unbelievably sexist comment to the speaker.  He challenged her perception that sexism was going on in academia in even a subtle way and said he wasn't involved in repressing her at all.  I thought back to the first time I met him and how he sort of assumed, like most men do, that I was sort of an idiot until I could prove I was smarter than he was, at which point he became frightened of me and subsequently polite.  I thought about how that was largely my experience: most men I meet assume I'm stupid and the oness is on me to prove I'm not.  That to me is what repression and discrimination are all about: assumptions based on appearances and wrongheaded biases.  Just in making that stupid comment, this guy ironically added to the speaker's lifetime load of male repression.  While being grossly underestimated does sometimes work in my favor and an intellectual ambush is sweet indeed, there have been precious few folks in my life who assumed I was smart when they met me, even when I've been standing next to a self-authored scientific poster.  And let me tell you, over time, that really makes my ass tired.  This "non-scientist's" next project is going to be to expand my Arrow of Entropy rant and prove that it's crap.  In the immortal words of Einstein, you can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it. So, in conclusion, I'd like to invite the proprietary members of the scientific community to bite my sweet, shapely social-scientific ass.

      Everybody Likes Peanut Butter  Whatever sort of trap you're baiting, whether it's to get a kid to sit still for a few minutes, to distract a skunk you're trying to get out of your basement, or to get that hottie of a repair man to stay around a few minutes longer, peanut butter always does the trick.  Everybody likes it.  Phillip, who doesn't even like sweets, is a sucker for a peanut butter milkshake.  Anyone from my generation will still eat a fluffernutter.  The pickiest kid in the world will eat a PB&J.  I have yet to meet a mammal who won't partake of peanut butter given the chance.  Even people who are terribly allergic would eat it if they could.  What is it about peanut butter that makes it so irresistable?  Is it the gooey texture?  The salty/sweetish taste?  The nuttiness?  The warm color?  To some of us, it's comfort food.  But a mouse's mom never made her a peanut butter sandwich, and she still likes it.  Dogs will struggle mightily with the roof-of-the-mouth factor, but they still want more.    I don't want to dissect delight, here--it's enough to say that everybody likes it and it's good stuff.  But it reminds me of a great rant my father had on the phone the other night.  One of his concerns with the current war is that it's one of those turning points in history where everyone has had enough of a reigning power and they stop subscribing to it wholesale.  The Delian League says the hell with Athens, it's not worth the crap, like that.  He's concerned that people will start finding other ways to do things than the American Brand, and then we'll all be out of work.  The American Brand, for all the beatings it takes, is essentially about youthful exuberance.  Blue jeans, red Mustangs with the top down, pepperoni pizza, Spring Break, rock & roll music, video games, and, I daresay, even peanut butter.  It's all about being young and happy and doing things that make you feel young and happy.    The irony is that the yahoos currently in charge of American are joyless.  When's the last time you saw any kind of uncritical conservative taking joy in anything but the pain of others?  The current administration is utterly incompatible with the American brand.  No wonder we're in a poorly orchestrated, ridiculous war.  So says my old man, and he has a point.    I need peanut butter.

      Chinchilla jokes  So okay, I promise I will get back to the Foucaultian Book of Job, but first, I feel the need to break the tension with some chinchilla jokes.  A friend of mine has just moved into a fabulous apartment in central London, which he shares with a lawyer and her chinchilla.  If you ask me, the chinchilla is the least offensive of the two, but this friend is kind of not an animal person.  For example, the constant flow of crap pellets really seem to get to him.  He reported, however, that it was the only way to be sure the chinchilla existed.  Despite my proposal that perhaps the chinchilla was participating in some sort of metaphysical experiment--such as Aquinas' assertion that the universe proved a God like a watch proves a watchmaker, or I Crap Therefore I Am--he doesn't seem to be warming up to it too much.  Also, the chinchilla in question has no name, and I thought it would be entertaining to order a tiny poncho, had, gunbelt, and possibly cigar for it so it could play a rodent version of Clint Eastwood's character.  No dice.  So to cheer him up, I decided to write some chinchilla jokes.  I figured, rodents are a comedy goldmine, how hard can it be?  As I started doing research, I found a number of really funny things about chinchillas, like the fact that females can aim urine when threatened.  Now, that's only good for a sight gag:  Hey baby, come here oft-- OWWWW!  Also, they apparently really like raisins, take dust baths and are nocturnal.  Despite all that, writing jokes about them was harder than it looked.  My friend contributed a couple of cute jokes to the process:  What's a chinchilla's favorite tipple?  Whiskey. ( I think it's because they're whiskery.)  What's a chinchilla's favorite rock band?  The Psychadelic Furs.  Anyway, the below jokes have been tested on bicycle mechanics, using rapid-fire Borscht-belt-style delivery.  What do you call a chinchilla that's not leaving crap pellets all over the place? A coat.  Two chinchillas are sitting at a bar (martinis, two raisins) and the female says to the male, "I can't help but notice you're nibbling on my ear, and I hardly know you."  The male says, "I'm sorry, it's just that I find you fascinating and my teeth never stop growing."  What's the difference between a chinchilla and a bowling ball?   Bowling balls make lousy coats.  So this guy chinchilla picks up a lady chinchilla in a bar and takes her home.  While they're gettin' busy, he notices she's rather unresponsive, and he says to her, "What are you, a fucking COAT?!"  What's the difference between George will and a chinchilla?   George Will probably won't be made into a coat.  So two chinchillas are on the bus, and one says to the other, "I met this really nice girl, and I liked her a lot, but I don't think I'm going to see her again."  "Why not?" asks his friend.  "She's a coat."  Sorry.

      I avoid getting shot... today  We interrupt this news of personal trials to report on a completely over-the-top incident that I am not making up: a couple of hours ago, I was very close to being in the line of road rage/gang related gunfire.    So I'm in the bike shop where I work, minding my own business, setting up some ill-conceived Shimano disc brakes (for those of you familiar with the bike industry, this term is probably redundant.  I'd never seen it before today, but that sh*t's held together with a cotter pin smaller than what I would use to keep my hair out of my eyes.  Yeah, for brakes--the thing that's supposed to stop you and 20+ pounds of bike at whatever speed you happen to be hurtling along), with three of my co-workers.  My workbench is in the back corner of the shop, against the wall of the building that faces the street.  Jim was working next to me, in the corner of the building that looks out on both the street and the alley.  Greg (Sally) and Jimmy were at the next two benches, kind of in the middle of the shop.    Evans Avenue, the street outside, is one of the main drags in southeast Denver, so it's very busy, and we frequently hear near-accidents and the occasional full-on accident.  Today, about half an hour before quitting time (and during rush hour), we hear some serious high-speed tire squealing and an impact.  I look out Jim's window and there's a car, doing a 360 and bouncing off the curb in the oncoming lane, narrowly avoiding an accident, and an SUV tearing along the other oncoming lane and screeching around the corner.  Both cars speed off in opposite directions.  The car that hit the curb comes within maybe a few feet of hitting the corner of the building as it speeds off.  Jim and Greg both think the impact we heard was a tire blowout, and they roll up the garage door and go outside to check it out.  Jimmy says to me, "That wasn't a tire blowout, it was a gunshot."  Of all the people I know, Jimmy is the person I would trust most to know the difference, so I go outside and look on the ground where we saw the car bounce off the curb.  Sure enough, there's a 9mm shell casing right on the sidewalk (what can I say?  I'm a researcher: have hypothesis, seek evidence).  I pick it up on the end of the Allen wrench that's still in my hand and take it inside.  Jimmy confirms it's a 9mm and that it probably came from a crappy gun because the powder burns blow backward.  The casing looks a little like a tiny, brassy, fouled sparkplug where the mixture's too rich.  Needless to say, the last half an hour of the day was not all that productive--we mostly debriefed each other.  We ultimately decided not to call the cops because everyone involved was so very, very long gone and we didn't get any license plate numbers or see any of the people or anything.  We wouldn't have had anything solid to tell them, and Jimmy thought all they would do would be to give me a hard time for moving the casing.  The cops didn't show up called by anyone else--probably nobody who heard the impact realized it wasn't a tire blowout.  We wouldn't have if Jimmy hadn't known the difference.  Our boss, the shop manager, brought us all ice cream sandwiches, which was nice.  A chilly treat was definitely in order.  So that makes you think, you know?  If that shot had been fired a few degrees before where it was in the 360, it would have come right through the window behind me.  I would have been whacked by a stray bullet while setting up ill-conceived brakes, and that is not how I want to go.     I thought I'd hang onto the casing for a little while in case there is some kind of investigation and somebody wants it.  If they don't, maybe I'll hang onto it as a reminder of how fleeting life is and how close we live to accidental death all the time.  It's extra good to pet my cats tonight, and it'll be extra good to hug my husband when he gets home.

      Foucaultian Book of Job  I'm not one to complain.  True, I am one to rant, but that's different.  Complaining is just pissing and moaning; a rant requires passion, critical analysis and humor.  Complaining is merely an imposition on others, while a rant takes work on the ranter's part.  It's an art form, really, and I aspire to be a virtuoso (virtuosa?) someday.    So today's theme rant is My Life Is Currently A Foucaultian Book of Job.  Foucault, for those of you not familiar with him, was a French social and political theorist who died in 1985.  He is widely credited with being the father of postmodernism, but in my opinion, if he came back and saw what drivel postmodernism had become and what ridiculous crap people had been saying about it, he would be sort of pissed off and nauseous, you know, like Jesus would be if he came back and saw the crusades.  (I picture Jesus running out into the middle of the battlefield to say, "What the F*CK are you people DOING?!  Did you hear NOTHING I said?!  Put that sh*t away and go home!  Here, read this part again and think about what you've done.")  Anyway, Foucault spent most of his career dissecting/deconstructing various social and political institutions and critiquing them.  He also spent a lot of time getting arrested and beaten, as one might expect.    Foucault also belongs to the SBF (Short Bald F*cks) club of social theorists and world peaceniks.  This club, given its inimitable name by Lisa when I was starting out in divinity school, includes such historical movers and shakers as Ghandi and the Buddha.  Foucault shaved his head but had eyebrows like a Dr. Seuss character, and he let the Establishment have it.  The medical system, the juridical system, our wacky socially-imposed gender and sexual issues, formal education, the scientific process, the penal system, our governments' incessant surveillance of us all...  he ripped it all open and looked inside.  I resisted his ideas for a long time because of his spawning of the solipsistic dadaism that is the blight of postmodernism, but like Jesus, I think he was really onto something and a lot of the folks who came after him just screwed a lot of it up.  His ideas about prison reform in particular won me over.  So anyway, we all have times in our lives when everything seems to be going particularly smoothly, and others when we wonder what the hell deity we pissed off.  Lately, I've been having quite a bout of the latter.  In attempting to categorize just what has hit the recent life events fan, I can't help but notice a Foucaultian theme emerging.  For example:  Western Medicine F*cks Me and Doesn't Send Me Flowers  I went to my annual this week.  I hate my annual more than most because I had a really terrible experience many years ago at Planned Parenthood where I was mishandled by a large, squarish, rough woman who was apparently offended by my intent to go on having sex with men.  For many years, I had anxiety attacks before and during my annuals.  I still get freaked out, but I don't have to breathe into a bag anymore, which is progress.  I still have to show up every damn year, though, if I want to stay on the pill, which I do.  So I showed up this week.    As usual, they took my blood pressure at the beginning of the exam and it was quite high.  This always happens.  Then they take it at the end and it's the usual 110/70 it's been since high school.  This time, though, the woman I liked very much last year gave me a ration of shit about my high blood pressure when it was 140/90 at the beginning of the exam, telling me that renewing my prescription with my high blood pressure (and its possible interactions with estrogen, not proven but apparently a big deal to her) would be malpractice.  She had decided early on that I was much fatter than I am and that that was what was causing my high blood pressure.  I had to interrupt her little lecture to me about portion control and super-sized fries to explain to her that I was a vegetarian, grossed out by heavy, oily food, and I really didn't eat things like that.  At least twoscore pounds heavier than myself, she was also surprised to discover, during the course of the exam, my substantial muscle tone and my evident ribcage despite the fact that I had told her that I take 4 dance classes a week, cycle, and do manual labor for a living.  At the end of the exam, as they always do, they took my blood pressure again and lo, the horrific 90 dropped down to the usual 70, as it always does.    However, this fine representative of the western medical establishment abandoned the western scientific tradition completely.  Totally ignoring all the evidence, from the fact that I had *lost* weight since the previous year to the evidence all over my body of health and exercise to my history of false high readings during the anxiety-producing moments before the end of the exam, she renewed my prescription only for three months, saying I would have to go to one of those public blood pressure machines (that is, if my arm would fit inside the cuff, leaving me with no choice but to reply with my impressive Hans und Franz flexed bicep, which she attributed to my "youth" alone) and call her with the results if I wanted the rest of it refilled.  For someone so very concerned about my blood pressure, she sure added to the stress in my life: I can choose between the anxiety of possibly getting pregnant, going to someone else and having to have another damn annual with a total stranger, or somehow carving time out of my insane schedule to run her fool's errand and appease her "concerns" which should really have been appeased by the damn medical evidence in the first place.  The only thing I can think of is that she had some sort of personal experience this year that she's projecting onto me.  Thanks, western medicine!   Boned by Banking and the Juridical System in the Same Day  A couple of months ago, my bank gave me shit about depositing a substantial personal check into my bank account.  They sent me to the branch where I had opened the account, saying "my banker" would be able to override the hold.  On the way there, some whitey in a Mercedes (apparently he spent all his bread on the Mercedes and had no money left over for the fancy factory option, the turn signal) started to make a left and then turned hard right directly in front of my car, leaving me no choice but to hit said car.  Despite the fact that I had a passerby witness who was immediately accessible at the time, Englewood Five-0 decided that whitey could not possibly be responsible for such a thing and gave me the citation for the accident.  He also broke the news to me that my car insurance had been canceled.  So since I was--SURPRISE!--driving around without car insurance, I would have to go to court.  My insurance company, whom I expected to be billing me quarterly, had decided to bill me monthly instead but had neglected to let me in on their little secret.  Or send me a cancellation notice.  Or even, say, a bill.  I would hire a lawyer, and get this, while I would be in her office explaining my case for the first time, I would get a parking ticket, literally less than a minute after the meter had expired.  When I finally did get to the bank, they said the people at the other branch should have known better, "my banker" couldn't override dick, and they had pretty much sent me there to get rid of me after wasting 40 minutes of my life.  To add insult to injury, my bank charged me two bucks for the privilege of this revelation and an additional $29 when the hold on the check I was trying to deposit was placed on my account 3 days later, causing it to expire 3 days after they told me it would and the check I had sent to my mortgage company had to be redeposited.  Needless to say, Wells Fargo received an eyeful of one of my notorious letters and I did get my $31 back, with a snotty, barely apologetic letter and a booklet about their policies.  I couldn't find anything in there about having to go to other branches to be screwed properly when a small supermarket branch is ill-equipped to administer a really proper screwing.  And just to make sure I remain their fee bitch for a while, my bank will freely disseminate derogatory information about me to anyone who cares to inquire.  This was the same bank that kissed my ass when I had a nice high balance just before I bought a house.  Now that my balance is less bourgeois, I am apparently no longer recognizable as the same customer.  The court case thing is still ongoing.  I have no idea how much worse the boning will get before it's over, but I'll be sure and keep you posted.   Oof, this is wearing me out.  Stay tuned for:  Gender is Socially Constructed, so Get Back to Work, Bitch Short End of Big Fat Capitalist Stick Advanced Degrees:  Thank You Sir, May I Have Another!

      Containers and stationery supplies  You may or may not know that I'm queer for containers and stationery supplies.  I have more pens than anyone I know, probably more than many retail establishments that sell pens.  There's something about a really well-balanced pen that writes smoothly that I just can't resist.  I like nice paper, too.  I still write actual letters, in part to justify my obsession, and I occasionally make greeting cards for people.  I love to play with the stuff.  I've branched into multimedia with the cards.  Most recently, I sent a friend a card with cloth frogs I decoupaged onto some vellum-like paper.  The glue made the paper all wavy and left the frogs smooth, creating a very satisfying watery effect.  I think it was my father who first realized I was queer for stationery supplies.  He probably observed my early magic marker hoarding and interest in using every color whenever possible.  I confess I still color from time to time because I find it relaxing.  Fortunately, I have some very high-quality erudite coloring books from my childhood in Cambridge in the shadow of M.I.T. and Harvard, so they've really stood the test of time for me.  I also find it sort of entertaining to review my design style over the last 30 years in a single book.  So in addition to the thousands of pens, I have crayons and markers and colored pencils, too.  My favorite set of colored pencils is actually mechanical, with erasers.  It came from my favorite pimp, Levenger.  Levenger (motto: serious tools for serious readers) has a vast array of stationery and art supplies and even some furniture.  Anyone who is ever stuck for a gift for me should just send me a gift certificate.  I think Lisa turned me on to them initially.  They're at www.levenger.com if you want to take a look for yourself.  They also put out a catalog, which frequently becomes covered with drool at my house.  While my obsession with stationery supplies is probably somewhat related to my being tactile, my obsession with containers is clearly linked to my spatial-ness.  My friend Amy routinely gives me beautiful empty boxes as gifts, and I get really excited, which she finds highly entertaining (and perhaps slightly Buddhist).  Sometimes I put things in the containers, other times, I just sort of collect them without really meaning to have a collection.  Boxes, pouches, luggage-like items, it doesn't matter.  I love them all, both for their container-ness and their containing abilities.  I just know I'm going to be one of those old ladies with a closet full of thousands of tiny boxes that some unlucky heir will have to go through when I die.  Personally, I like rediscovering found containers I've forgotten about.  Sometimes I left something in them, other times, they're just the right size for something else.  So now you know.

      Stress Management  Some of you who have been reading my recent entries have asked me how I'm keeping my marbles together.  The short answer is probably: perspective.  There really hasn't been any time in my life that I can recall where I wasn't struggling with something, and there have been several times when that struggle has been pretty intense and all-pervasive.  I seem to have an aversion to doing things the easy way, metaphysically and otherwise.  I can look back on other times of struggle and note that I didn't die, and eventually, things got better.    I am making the optimistic assumption that things will get better than this, too.  If I can just keep it together for a little while longer, something will give way and improvement will begin.  That's what I tell myself, anyhow.  In the meantime, it's stressful waiting for the wind to change.  I deal with it by writing, dancing, having wild junglesex with my husband whenever possible, and I've recently discovered I have a special talent for destruction.    In the last week, my boss at the bike shop has given me a wheel and two frames to demolish.  Why would I be demolishing these things, you might ask.  Well, when a bicycle company offers a lifetime warranty on their products, it will replace a cracked or damaged frame for free.  When that happens, the mechanic has to take all the old parts off the damaged frame, put them on the new frame, and then destroy the old one so nobody tries to build it up and ride it.  It's a safety thing.  Yeah, that's it.  So I take said frame out into the alley and go 2001 on its ass: monkey noises, smashing against the ground, pounding with sledge hammer (no old bones lying around), beating against the dumpster (because both dumpster and frame ring out loud when you do that).    When you've destroyed a bike frame with your bare hands, you really get quite a lot of respect.  People move out of your way.  They gape and stare, sometimes shift uncomfortably, sometimes look at you admiringly, and nobody would give you so much as a microgram of shit.  The best thing, though, is the release.  It is soooo good, it's like you just got off.  It's smoke a cigarette and take a nap good.  It really takes the kinks out.  My only reservation about this is that I think my boss may have some kind of amazon fetish.  He seems to be coming up with just about any reason to have me smash something up.  I think I don't care, though.  Whatever keeps the destruction material coming.

      And Now, Back to Foucaultian Book of Job  So one of the crapswells in my life at the moment is that I'm working about 35 hours a week at the bike shop, and it's the kind of job where the more time you spend there, the less you like it.  A day or two a week and it's wicked fun.  Approaching full time, some of the people and political situations really start to make your ass tired.  I call this segment:  Gender is Socially Constructed, so Get Back to Work, Bitch  First, some background on the situation.  In this shop, we do repairs and maintenance on bikes, and we also build all the bikes we sell at the store.  The bikes we sell show up in boxes in various stages of assembly, depending upon manufacturer, price point and a few other things.  Building bikes is supposed to be the "easy" job because it's just supposed to be assembly.  In reality, though, bikes often show up broken or with lousy components or just generally way out of adjustment, and some repair work is involved before it can be completely assembled and sold.  Also, doing a quality job involves taking some of the pre-assembled bits apart and making sure they are properly lubricated.  Often, partially assembled bikes are partially assembled with assembly-grade grease which won't necessarily hold up if someone rides the bike over time.  There's this particular sort of putty-colored stuff Gary Fisher uses that becomes the consistency of bubble gum after a while.  I take some parts of those bikes apart to get that crap off there and put a good synthetic grade grease on them.  It makes the bikes last longer, and it makes them much easier to repair later on.  In this shop, though, building is considered to be a sort of lower-grade, easier job than repair work.  It's not, it's just a cleaner job.   Also, you have to know what you're doing so you know when it's time to give up.  Some parts will just never be perfect and all you can do is do the best you can with what they gave you to work with.  Anyway, often, when new folks come on board, particularly if they're not too experienced, they spend the first several weeks just building, and then move on to repair work.  I always thought it was a wax-on, wax-off kind of thing.    When I first started working there about a year and a half ago, I was hired by the old shop manager.  He recruited me after a conversation about my work on air-cooled Volkswagens.  I went into the shop and was presented with a pile of parts, which I assembled into a bicycle.  It took me close to 4 hours (it now takes me  about an hour to an hour and a half, more if there's a lot of broken or screwed up stuff or if it's a more disassembled model, less if it's a really high-quality, mostly pre-assembled bike), but the shop manager deemed me generally mechanically inclined and experienced, sharp, and highly trainable.  He hired me, he began training me, he encouraged me, he taught me cool stuff, and he let me take on some hard problem-solving cases.  Then, after a couple of months, he left.  We didn't have another shop manager for about a year.    During that time, nobody was consistently training or teaching me anything.  When I ran into a problem, I would ask one of the other mechanics for help, and I picked up little things here and there through observation and experience, but after the old shop manager left, nobody sat me down and said, "Okay, this is how you build a wheel," or, "This is how you can tell that this part is worn, and here's what you do about it."  Fortunately, I'm a good enough mechanic that, given a little time and the opportunity to ask an expert a question or two, I can usually fix just about anything.  Still, it's an obstacle not to have received training in something that requires specific knowledge and skills.  Furthermore, the bike industry is a rather sexist one.  I present as evidence not only my personal experience, but the fact that women-specific geometry on bicycles is a new thing, that equipment for women is just beginning to have some quality to it, and that even in racing events, the prizes for women are pretty lame while they're usually quite generous for the men.  Every once in a while, I get a customer who just doesn't want to talk to a woman and gives me a hard time until I fetch him something with a penis.  I had to earn the respect of my co-workers, and the store owner still withholds his.    The store owner has consistently gotten bent out of shape, and occasionally publicly dressed me down, for attempting to expand my skills beyond building bikes (needless to say, the owner never publicly denounces the men).  My skills are already pretty far past that, of course--I'm just interested in learning more and getting to work on a greater variety of problems without having to sneak around to do it.  I've been doing good repair work for over a year now, it's just kind of a secret from the owner.  I was told during the time we were without a shop manager that once we got a new one, I'd get more training (training I'd already given myself of course, but whatever it takes to get my ticket punched) and could move on to other things, but we have a new shop manager now, and it's not happening.  Teenage boys we've hired have moved on to repair work after a matter of a couple of months.  Folks I worked with last year come back to visit and say, "Geez, you're still  building ?!".    Initially, I had pretty high hopes for the new shop manager.  He seemed like a nice guy, and was all for giving me the opportunity to prove what I knew.  He even went to bat for me with the owner once.  Turns out, though, that he's kind of more interested in chatting up the female customers and hanging out with industry folks and chatting on his cell phone than he is in making sure his people get the opportunity to be as good at their jobs as they can be.  I've never in my life had bosses who didn't want to take full advantage of my incessant interest in being better and better at my job, to be constantly enhancing and upgrading my skills, and generally doing better for them and making their business more successful.  I've never worked at a place where I invested so much more in it than it did in me.  Usually, employers are overjoyed.  So I started thinking about what the possible objections could be.  1.  Maybe I'm not a good employee. I'm almost always on time, and often there before anyone else--including the bosses, I work hard, I do whatever is requested of me, I don't get caught standing around doing nothing, and I make sure that everything I have to do that has some kind of deadline gets finished in time.  That's not it.  2.  Maybe I'm not a good mechanic. Hmm, I broke a record for the 23-minute full valve adjustment, I do incredibly high-quality work (beautiful when I can, solid when not provided with adequate materials), and I've never met a mechanical problem I couldn't diagnose if not fix.  That's not it.  3.  Maybe I'm inexperienced.   Not anymore--I've been doing work on the sly and out in the open for quite some time now.  Besides, there are only two people who have been working in that shop longer than I have.  I know what I'm doing and I  should  have some kind of seniority by now.  Also, as previously mentioned, teenage boys who have been there for a couple of months do repair work, and I've been there nearly a year and a half, not to mention the fact that if I don't get to work on new problems, I will never learn how to fix them--an argument that seems to hold when discussing the training of the men I work with.  That's not it.  4.  Maybe they think I'm going to leave soon, so they don't want to invest in me. I could have seen this argument about a year ago.  I'm in school, probably graduating in a while and moving on to other things, so why put in the time to train someone who's leaving?  But after a year and a half, it should be pretty obvious that I'm in it for the long haul, and anyway, all someone had to do was ask me how long I intended to stick around.  That's not it.  5.  Maybe I just don't fit in. Actually, my cameraderie with the guys I work with is quite good.  If they think of me as any less a part of the team as anyone else, I've had no indication of it, and I've looked carefully.  The only people who treat me differently are the bosses, and the guys are always extra supportive of me when it happens.  That's not it.  6.  Maybe I screw up a lot. Well, I've had two screw-ups in 18 months (a good record for any job), one of which wasn't my fault and the other of which, I stand by.  We have one mechanic who gets his work brought back to the shop a few times EVERY WEEK and somebody else has to redo the work.  Of course, when he screws up, either nobody says anything to him, or they take him aside quietly and explain what was missing.  My two minor issues where like media circuses.  In one case, I asked for help and didn't get it after being assured I would, and the problem was caught before the bike ever got to the customer, but EVERYBODY knew about it and apparently the owner came into the shop raving about my incompetence while I wasn't there (fortunately, my co-workers defended me, saying that if I hadn't done something right, it was only because I hadn't been taught how).  This sort of thing has never happened to anyone else in the time that I've been working there.  In the other case, I lovingly replaced all the old parts of a waranteed bike onto a new frame.  The cassette was worn, but I decided not to replace it for three reasons: 1., I was told that the customer didn't want to pay more than $50 to replace parts and he was already getting close and it wasn't an essential replacement at that time; 2., There's a difference between worn out and worn in, and these parts all knew each other very well.  In the stand and on the ground, the drive train worked perfectly.  Not just passably or well, but  perfectly .  3., With old parts like that, once you start replacing parts, it never ends.  That chain is sort of married to that cassette.  Replace the cassette and you'll have to replace the chain soon after.  Do that, and the front chain rings won't work right anymore, and you'll have to replace those.  The customer brought the bike back after test riding it and reported that the chain was skipping, so someone else was asked to replace the cassette--I didn't even get the opportunity to check out what was going on, and I was the one most familiar with that bike.  Additionally, the bike had sustained a big gauge in the top tube, but nobody looked for trauma--the bosses just assumed my incompetence was to blame.  I got a hard time about it even though the other mechanics agreed with my judgment call.  I still stand by it.  7.  Maybe I have tits.   Oh yeah.  Needless to say, being bullied by the store owner and not particularly well supported by my supervisor makes my ass tired and makes me pretty unhappy at work.  One day I even went to the labor board on my lunch half-hour and picked up a form to fill out.  It's 7 pages long, but once you submit it, a free federal investigation ensues, which determines whether or not you have a civil case (and then, if it does, you get a lawyer).  There are enough sketchy labor practices going on at that place that I would think the owners and managers would prefer that not happen.  I've tried to talk to my supervisor, but he's not available much and doesn't seem particularly motivated to make time for me.  Now, I am not a litigious person.  I've had many opportunities in my life to take people to court, and I haven't taken a single one of them.  But I'm a better mechanic, a better employee, and a better person than how I'm being treated would suggest, and I'm pretty fed up.  I have to go into work tomorrow for the first time since the cassette incident.  It's possible they'll fire me, if they have the balls (it would be the first indication I've seen of this, however).  There is a part of me that hopes I will be fired, because I will then have an iron-clad sex discrimination case.  I would certainly take a settlement only sizeable enough to allow me to finish my dissertation, which is what I would rather be doing anyway.  The need to work to make money is holding that process up quite a bit.  I may send that form in in any case.  I've been close a number of times, and the on-again, off-again nature of holding off is draining.  I can't come up with any other basis for the different treatment I receive than being female, and that is just bullshit.  I have willing witnesses and people who would support me over the owner in a heartbeat.  I won't put up with it any longer.    So right now, here's my plan.  My supervisor is not in tomorrow.  I get canned, I go to the Labor Board.  Tuesday, my supervisor and I hash things out or I go to the Labor Board, and I tell him so.  Things don't change immediately, I go to the Labor Board and I hang enough federal paper on that place that you have to wait for the wind to blow to read the sign.  I shouldn't have to do this just to be allowed to do my job as well as I could, but apparently I do.  One way or another, somebody besides me is going to be building some bikes.

      Fun at my mother's expense  Now, my mother is a very organized person, skilled not only at planning, but at planning for contingency as well.  She knows  that I, too, am a very organized person with excellent contingency-planning and on-the-fly skills.  She knows that ever since I lost my watch when I was eight years old, I've been practicing various kinds of scatterbrain management, rather successfully, that lend my very method of attacking life a rather seamless quality.  It appears from the outside as if my whole life is unfolding exactly as I had planned it, that things are perfectly executed and that I have discovered how to cram 96 hours into a single circadian cycle.  Now you know from reading this blog that that's pretty much crap, but according to many outside sources, it is a convincing illusion nonetheless.    However, my mother is not fooled.  She knows I really ought to be reminded to bring a sweater to New England in case I want to go outside at night, to bring a nice dress for my uncle's wedding, that today is another uncle's birthday, and that there is no way in hell I would ever have thought about those things or written them down in any way.  Shit, I might not even own a calendar.  This sort of thing really used to annoy me, because if anybody on earth would have made some sort of meticulous list about any of these things, it's me.  I mean, I don't just know when close family members' birthdays are, I know when Warren G. Harding's birthday was.  I'm not just planning on bringing a sweater, I know exactly  which  sweater it will be.  My conference banquet outfit  might  double as a wedding outfit depending on space, but I don't think I could stand anything less formal than that.  I know, I don't get out much.    Anyway, it doesn't really annoy me anymore, because I understand that she just tells me these things because she's going through her own organizational process related to seeing me.  She doesn't really think I'm some dribbling incompetent who can't manage the details of her life well enough to pack a sweater, not show up for a wedding dressed in a checkered tablecloth and a batting helmet, call her flippin' uncle, and use some sort of recordkeeping system.  She's just working through her own to-do list and wants everything to be seamless and perfect for me, which is really very thoughtful.  So instead of getting annoyed, which didn't accomplish anything, or reassuring her that I had already disposed of the all-important tasks, which was okay but ultimately neither necessary nor satisfying, I decided this situation was essentially comedy fodder.  What follows are excerpts of my reply to a recent classic advisory-style email, complete with reminder dates.  The parts about encouraging my acacemic process and thoughtfully putting my name on my uncle's wedding gift have been omitted for maxium comic impact, as have any comments about my mom being knowledgeable about interesting astral phenomena.   ****************** > A leetle packing advisory--Maine can be chilly at night, and > in case you want to observe Mars at its closest pass in maybe 60,000 years, > you might need a cozy garment. Of course, you can always snag anything of > mine.   Well, that's all very well and good for you, but I've decided that New England really isn't ever that cold, and I will be dressing only in enough duct tape to keep from getting arrested.  I refuse to bring a sweater or warm garment of any kind, or, for that matter, more than two rolls of tape.  I hope you like me sticky.  And ripe.  If I get really cold, I might borrow someone else's earmuffs.  And break them.  > Earon's wedding on Friday, the 15th, will be somewhat dressy. It's at > a fancy restaurant on the beach. No need for organza, but maybe a long, > easily packed dress of some kind would be good.   Screw that.  I'm showing up wearing only duct tape, an assortment of offensive temporary tattoos, and a live weasel.  > Everyone is > gathering at Kay's former condo (redecorated in a very cool way by Moie) on > Thursday night for a family fling. Dress is anything for that.  Nothing doing!  I hope there's plenty of room in the new floor plan, because I'll be wearing a giant dress that was inspired by a cuckoo clock.  It features elaborate woodwork, has multiple trains, and several loud and frequently chiming mechanical cuckoo birds.  Also, I can't fit in a car while wearing it, so I'll need to be strapped to the roof of someone's vehicle while they drive at a reserved processional speed.  This also gives everyone, including the traffic behind us, the opportunity to get a really good look at me while I wave at them like the Queen.  Furthermore, everyone else at the gathering will be required to match my outfit, so I'm afraid dress will NOT be just anything.  Acceptable colors include chartreuse, tangerine, fuschia, and wood grain.  No red.   > You probably have this already, but just in case, here's Michael Sean's > (today's birthday guy) cell phone: xxx-xxx-xxxx, for getting in touch to > pick you up on Monday, the 11th.  No, I've decided that for my convenience, he needs to have a birthday in October like your other siblings, so I won't be calling him until then.  For arranging transport, I will be using telepathy.  ****************** What a good sport.

      And still MORE liquor and sexual fantasies!  Okay, I'm running out of things to say about liquor.  Uhhhh...  Oh yes, if I have to grab a bottle of wine that has to pretend to be a lot less cheap than it is, I have two never-fail options: Chilean wines and my favorite domestic label, Meridian.  If it's the right time of year, there's always the Beaujolais Nouveaux, too, which is good because it's novel.    So a couple of days ago, this guy brought his bike into the shop.  Now, I say "this guy", but what I really mean is, "this aryan god".  While one of the guys checked his bike in, I just sort of stood there and gawked at him, but in my mind, I was going through the full Tex Avery spectrum of growing a wolf head, howling, and pulling my rolled-out tongue to make my ears clang together.  The moment he left, I launched into a spontaneous rant about his hotness.  My thoughtful colleague responded by assigning the repair ticket to me.    The following morning, another thoughful colleague brought me the repair ticket.  I replaced the chain on his bike (a Gary Fisher Tassajara, which I like to build blindfolded) and tuned it up.  I discovered that his was the dryest bike I had ever seen.  As far as I could tell, the only reason the parts hadn't seized up was because the bike was still fairly new.  Plus, aryan god though he was, he didn't seem to be a very good rider.  Plenty of stuff was stretched and bent, but the wheels were barely off true, like he had just been riding on easy trails and falling a lot.  I lovingly wiped down the bike, made sure everything was again in order, and lubed the bejesus out of it (and you know how I feel about good lube.  You don't?  See October 13th.).  Anything that moved, I lubed it, including the entire length of each cable.  The whole time, I had this wicked grin on my face.  Ah, karmic lubing.  What goes around comes around: you lube me, I lube your bike...  When I called him to tell him the bike was ready, I left a message suggesting he might want to invest in some good lubricant.  I didn't say it was for his bike.

      More liquor and sexual fantasies  The liquor: I dig Alize', this cognac and passion stuff.  It's sweet and warming and incredible over ice when you're in the tub.  I highly recommend it.  Now then, this is sexual fantasy #912, about R.  R is an interesting guy, both deeper and smarter than he lets on.  I sense a very profound soul and a very tender heart in him but have yet to get a good look at them.  I have gotten a few glimpses of his sensitivity, and seen plenty of his considerable senses of humor and adventure, though.  He is a thoughtful listener, he's funny and honest and good, and I sense that he's a really wonderful romantic.  The world is full of practice guys pretenting to be real guys, but R is a real guy masquerading as a practice guy.  I'm not sure why he hides his many lights under a bushel barrel, but there it is.  I sense hard disappointments and loneliness, bearing sorrow through will and strength alone.  It is as if he wishes to be a mere party boy but is instead a rather wonderful man.  Of course, all this depth of psyche makes it harder to think of R as a piece of meat, but hell, I like a challenge!  I'll give it my best shot.  Physically, R is a tasty specimen: tall, lithe, athletic, in delectable shape, and he has the kind of build that inspired Armani to make exactly that cut of suit.  He has a terrific smile that gets into the very corners of the room, an easy laugh, and gorgeous convince-you-of-anything big blue eyes.  He is also  sensational  when ticked off.  I happened to be a member of a group of people he yelled at one time (not entirely undeservedly) and the experience was absolutely dizzying.  He was like a mountain lion whose territory had just been stepped on: bigger, louder, more taut, ready to fight, and those gorgeous eyes darkened and flashed.  It was, for lack of sufficient description, totally hot.  I wanted to do something really BAD just to see what would happen.  For the first time ever, I understood why people say things like, "You're beautiful when you're angry."  Rrrrrrowrrr!  Also, on the few occasions when he's seen me out of context, he has had the most flattering deer-in-the-headlights look.  I'd show up unexpectedly more often, but I don't want to dilute the reaction.    The standard R fantasy as it has evolved to this point goes like this.  We are talking or something, and he is leaning against a wall.  Provoked by his beauty or wit, I take his left hand in my right and pin his left arm to the wall over his head, kissing him passionately.  My left hand traces down his right side, following the contours and eddies of his beautifully defined body.  He either struggles a little in defiance and then gives himself over to it, or he frees his hand and holds me, or sometimes he even pins my right arm behind my back and kisses me harder.  He is deep and sensuous, and whatever he does, I love it.  So far, this fantasy hasn't gotten any further, but the more time I spend around R, the more likely it is to evolve.  The alternate fantasy (I guess that would make it #913) takes place in his bedroom, which I have never actually seen.  I picture a large room, sparsely furnished, hardwood floors, maybe painted brick, probably in desperate need of color.  He has something on me, and I'm bargaining for his silence.  Part of the fantasy involves a very logical, left-brain negotiation component (inspired by his very logical, orderly mind, again: rrrrrowrrrr!) which has already occurred.  I agree to buy his silence with his pleasure, and open with something like, you supply a quiet, comfortable location and a glass of water with a low center of gravity and three ice cubes, I will supply any additional equipment I deem necessary.  I bargain for complete control over the rest of the experience (you will make no plans for later on; I am an artist and I will not conform my process to timelines), guaranteeing nothing but one shattering orgasm.  We have reached an agreement I've come to make good on it.    I come into the dark, quiet room just after dusk and he is lying on the bed grinning.  I set down my bag of tricks within easy reach (contents vary: rose petals, restraints and lubricant, a Thermos of peppermint tea, something silky I slip into, but whatever is in there always turns out to be the perfect thing, because it's what?  My fantasy, yeah.).  I sit next to him on the bed and pull off his shirt, but I almost always remain clothed.  My intention is to play his body like an instrument, to take agonizing hours of teasing, deliberate, focused and intense, approaching the brink and then retreating, so that when I finally allow him to reach that all-important crescendo, its force defies all comprehension.  He thinks that by getting me to come here tonight, he has exercized his power over me, but the truth is I would have come quite willingly, and he is about to become utterly helpless to me.  It always begins with soft kisses: his mouth, his collarbone, that line where the sometimes unshaven part of his neck gives way to smooth skin.  My touch on him is so light as to be barely perceptible, a slight shiver of sheer curtain in a cool breeze, the gentle falling of a butterfly's wingscale.  I kiss the insteps of his elbows, closing the distance to the pulse point of his wrists with the touch of a shy airy current, the initial touch felt far less than its lingering, phantom fingerprint.  I am light and playful at the beginning, silent, thoughtful, observing.  There will be plenty of time later for deep, echoing adaggios and his tortured (ignored) pleadings for release.  This part of the fantasy becomes a Buddhist meditation: the soft, tentative and barely perceptible giving way to the light but firm to the deep and slow and sustained in the tiniest of increments.  Like most men, he has rarely if ever had the distinct pleasure of being passively driven to raving ecstasy, and he does a terrible job of containing himself, his senses having been starved to the point of overheightening, now spilling over and completely overwhelmed.  When I finally deliver on my guarantee, he comes completely unglued and has a religious experience.    Is that my Internal Editor cringing in the corner?  Ah, good.  My work here is done.

      Sexual fantasies and liquor  Okay, I don't have too much to say about liquor.  The truth is, I'm not much of a drinker.  Since my stomach lining got chewed up from the stress of the intellectual hazing I received during my graduate work at Harvard (rather like the Marines, really, where they tear you down and build you back up to be The Man They Want You To Be), I have rarely been able to consume much alcohol at a time and keep it down long enough to make a total drunken ass of myself.   Tant pis .  I often end up driving the drunks home rather than joining them.  I do have a few passions, though.    I LOVE good scotch, maybe enough that it's a real vice.  It's okay that I can't consume a whole bunch of it on my own because that would be coarse and unappreciative of the art, not to mention ruinous of the bank account.  I favor single-malt Highlands, although there are a few Islays that are quite nice, too.  I also consider myself too old for cheap beer (as well as things like furniture made out of cinder blocks or milk crates, and sex with strangers).  Fortunately, Colorado is well known for good microbrewed beer and there's plenty of it here.  I'm also a fan of good wine, and occasionally of crappy wine as well (which you know if you've been reading my travel blog).  There is really nothing like a gallon jug of Carlo Rossi Paisano, which is by no means a chianti as it claims to be, but isn't bad.  It's good for Italian cooking and drinking out of jelly jar glasses.  And I do like the occasional liquer treat, but that stuff hits my coarse-burnished stomach lining at a dead run, so I tend to reserve it for cold nights when I'm really bored, or as part of my patented "4 B's" muscle pain treatment plan (have a Belt, get in a hot Bath, put some Ben-gay on it, go to Bed).  Now then, on to sexual fantasies.  This is sexual fantasy #384, involving a particularly inspiring co-worker, let's call him M.  I believe it was the first in the M series, so it may now be a classic.  M is inspiring for a number of reasons: First off, He's a big Todesco (complete with requisite posterior moving Michelangelo to tears of appreciative joy), and you know how I feel about those.  Cute as opposed to pretty, boyish smile, about my age but smacking of fresh-off-the-farm, slightly awkward shyness.  Shoulders I'd like to mount on a trophy wall like moose antlers, big powerful hands, suggestion of delectable cyclist's thighs, and ohhh, the chemistry.  The chemistry!  You know what I mean: you stand close and your knees are like liquid glass.  Any accidental touch is a zap of electricity, a solenoid discharge of sexual response, thunderclouds gathering over an overbaked desert, carrying with them the promise of drenching rain and the scent of ozone.  Prolonged eye contact causes the room to recede away down a railroad tunnel while you stand fluidly locked together in the darkness, your fingers furiously tracing each other's clothing for exit points, until the oncoming train of voices in the room yanks you back to your thunderstruck body.    And here, the Internal Editor (IE) shakily lifts his Wild Turkey-lit nose to slur through a bristled mustache, "Hey, aren't you married?"  Shut up, this is a fantasy.  Have another snort.    It's late and we're alone in the shop.  Somehow, he exposes my profound attraction to him: he hands me something awkward and when I drop it, he sees my hands are trembling; he comes up behind me and I shiver when I feel him there; I stumble into him by accident and I am half breathless against him.  I find myself looking up into those grey-blue eyes, my pulse tapping hard on the collar of my charcoal poly-cotton mechanic shirt.  I've been found out: he knows all my tough talk is just a front, that I am more raw temptation than blustering tempest.  He kisses me and it is as if my entire body is a reflection in water, little ripples of pleasure teasing out to its blurry edges.  My fingers land like splashed droplets on those trophy shoulders and they are even better than I imagined, smooth and taut like warm polished marble.  His powerful hands find that sensitive place at the small of my back and I course closer to him in a sort of delighted displacement.  After I have poured over him, seeking those ticklish spots where a well-placed kiss causes murmuring ecstasy in the most reserved of us, just as the tiniest trickle of a stream wears down the mountain, I hop up on my workbench leaving my feet to dangle in space, no longer grounded and slightly quivering, a suspended pool on a high ledge.  He presses close to me and my thighs grip him almost involuntarily, water over stone.  Soon he is inside me, plumbing my depths, both of us drenched and breathless, water over stone, and the tide comes crashing in, knocking tools off the pegboard over my bench with each successive wave.  Water over stone.  There, Internal Editor.  Now go watch some HGTV and try not to think about  that  when they bring out some hokey quasi-Japanese water feature.  Hah!

      Reclaiming content  I haven't written much in the last week or so here because my internal editor is feeling hyper-vigilant in response to a heightened awareness of expanding readership.  I promised myself that I wouldn't be self-censoring here, but dammitt, I'm having a hard time sticking to it.  A large part of this is that my "Disclaimer" entry of July 5th was largely prompted by the Freudian comedy that is my relationship with my mother.  She found my blog, read it, and was pretty hurt that I had barely metioned her while my old man wanders across my blog plotlines from time to time in size 11 hobnail boots.    Now, my relationship with my mother has never been easy, but it has always been close.  I think the initial tensions began shortly after conception, when my mother had a very difficult pregnancy and threw up for 10 months, after which I was born, in a 24-hour-long extravaganza of excruciating labor, a month late and apparently incensed at having to be on the karmic wheel for another lifetime turn, and promptly refused to sleep for the first several years of my life.  During this time, I was also colicky, fussy, and difficult and willful in all things from what I would eat to how much sunlight I wanted on me to which socks I would wear.  Kinda like now, except now that I dress, position, and feed myself, my preferences and demands are usually no skin off anyone else's nose.  We had a particularly difficult period during my early adolescence when my parents divorced, but that was really the lowest point in our relationship: it has gotten progressively easier and better since then, and I do enjoy my mother quite a lot.  Still, nobody can push each other's buttons like mothers and daughters.    The way in which I think I push my mother's buttons the most (although she denies it) is that I behave under pressure very much like my father does.  Under any sort of social pressure, I will clam up and wait for tension to subside rather than talk about it or possibly say something hurtful in the heat of the moment, especially to my mother (unless I think it's really, really funny).  This particular brand of silence drives her crazy.  Ironically, I haven't written much about our relationship here because it's too complex to be put easily into blog bites, and because I didn't want to say something potentially hurtful in my accounts of all that complexity.  I think it was that same silence that really got to her.  She felt she was absent from accounts of my life, as if the story of my creation were not one of the hard pregnancy, labor and rearing she rose to and the relationship we both work at and usually succeed at, but as if I were saying I had sprung, fully grown, from my father's forehead during one of his Sunday morning migraines.  In so many places in the process of this blog, my internal editor has been passed out somewhere on Wild Turkey with his little green eyeshade all askew, or given a quarter and sent to the movies, or just glowering in the corner after being told to shut up while I'm writing.  I'm about as uninhibited as a person can be and still stay out of jail on a regular basis, so the things I decide not to say are almost always for the benefit of others.  I would gladly tell Bobby, for example, that I think his ass belongs on a dessert cart (really, it's like one of those magnificent petits-fours or French pastries that are delectable and perfect, but you can't bear to bite into it for fear of marring the culmination of hours, nay, centuries, of artistry, and the sensual viewing is almost as good an experience), but I think it would fluster him to know I think so.  It certainly wouldn't upset me to say it.  I think it's clever.  And quite apt.  Then last week when he was wearing these blue shorts, I just had to say SOMETHING.  I mean, he'd lean over and I'd want to smack myself in the head with my own shoes.  So I went with, "flattering fashion choice," which was well enough received.  Now, that's an internal editor being put to good use.    For the last week and a half, though, that internal editor has just been a big ol' pain in the ass every time I've sat down to write here.  He's trying been to get me to stick to subjects for the whole family, and I am just not writing for the f*cking Disney Channel.  I think my next few entries are going to have to be about sexual fantasies and liquor.  Stay tuned.

      Now, some of you know that I'll pet just about anything that will stand for it: your dog, random ferrets, spiders, sea creatures at the aquarium, strangers, weird plants, the list goes on.  Part of that is because I'm very tactile and I like to touch everything, but part of it is because I like animals, and animals who will stay still long enough to be petted generally like it, or at least don't mind it.    I petted an ancient giant tortise at the San Diego Zoo once.  He dug it.  He extended his head as far as it would stretch in my direction and closed his eyes.  He was either smiling or tortise faces are just naturally pleasant.  I also petted a wild squirrel once.  It took several days of morning granola feeding and being small and still nearby, but it was totally worth it.  Its tail felt like a bottle brush, and its fur was nowhere near as soft as I'd expected.  I've petted dolphins, too, and they definitely dig it anytime (just not on the head--too much sensitive equipment).    So aren't I worried about getting punctured by things that don't care for a pet?  No, not really.  The few times I've been bitten or scratched have been for things like breaking up fights between critters, never for an attempted pet.  Animals will generally let you know whether or not they care for one.  I've also discovered that my interest in petting things is not, well, normal.  Most people, when they list things they hope to accomplish, their life goals to do not include, say, scratching tiger ears.  Me, I'm waiting for just the right tiger in just the right mood to come along with those fuzzy leathery ears.  If I had ears like that, I'm sure I'd want someone to scratch them.    In reflecting about why I'm like this, I think the fact that my first direct interaction with free-range wild animals was so positive has a lot to do with my interest in petting things.  I was about two, and my mother had made us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  We were eating outside on the back porch when a particularly bold squirrel swooped down and made off with my sandwich.  It was one of those moments in a toddler's life where there are no points of reference at all.  I looked to my mother to figure out how I was supposed to react.  Had she freaked out at this pivotal moment, it's highly likely I would have gotten the message that animals were upsetting, and I might never have attempted to pet much of anything that wasn't a vertebrate member of my household.  Instead, though, she was laughing.  Really hard.  She has a terrific free, musical laugh.  Aha, so that's entertainment.    We went inside and made more sandwiches.  Some for us, some for the squirrels.  News of that one squirrel's big score had apparently spread far and wide, because there were a number of them in the yard hoping for similar luck.  We fed them.  I remember being really amazed by how round their tails were, and how they moved.  They were delighted, we were delighted, it has always been one of my favorite memories of my mom.    From right around that time, there are also pictures of me reading to a friend's dog.  I am showing him a picture and he is looking at it with what appears to be great interest and focus, head cocked, ears forward.  We are side-by-side and he is at least twice my size.  Not all my friends are people, and Harry was probably my first friend who wasn't.  We became friends because my parents let him knock me down and lick my face and laughed about it instead of being all freaked out that the initial barking on the other side of the door was worrying the baby.  Having friends who aren't people has really enriched my life.  You can't really say the wrong thing to an animal, and once you like each other, you pretty much always like each other and not much gets in the way of that.  Animals make very loyal and reliable friends.  They're always happy to see you, often with total abandon, like your mere presence just lifts their spirits.  And then, of course, there's the part where they're fun to pet.  So for this great life enrichment and interest in petting things, I blame my parents.  Especially my mom.

      DISCLAIMERS  Since a link to this blog has been posted on our travel blog, it has come to my attention that a lot more people are beginning to read this one, where previously it was sort of hidden and invitation-only.  This has resulted in some feedback I've had no idea how to respond to.  I've grappled a little bit with how to deal with this.  I entertained hiding or re-editing a number of my postings that I wouldn't want certain people to see, as well as taking the link off the travel site and keeping this blog on the QT, and rating various postings so people would know what was "okay" to read.  Ultimately, though, those solutions are just too candy-assed for me.  I've decided to be okay with random people I know discovering this site and finding stuff out about my inner life, but I do feel the need to let my increasing readership in on a few things.    1.  This blog is really quite a vain enterprise.  I use it to practice my writing because I hope to use it again someday in a non-academic context and I don't want to forget how it works.  I also use it as my own personal therapist from time to time, so sometimes it can get self-indulgent, but mostly I use it to entertain myself.  I'm really not thinking about an audience, I'm thinking about ME.  I don't have any rules about it, but I also don't want any.    2.  If you're a family member, there are some aspects of my personality represented here that you are not going to want to know about.  I'm sorry about that, and it's really okay to skip anything that makes you uncomfortable, like my weird sex tips, or that you find upsetting, like my experiences of sexism in the workplace or my various recent struggles.  This isn't really a coherent body of work and it can be read as a pick-and-choose sort of thing.    3.  If you don't like what I've said about you, I'm a little sorry, but basically: tough.  This is my freewriting space and if I start censoring it based on how I think other people will react to what I write (or don't write), I won't be able to write at all and this whole thing will become useless to me.  You can get back at me by starting your own blog, though, and I encourage you to do that.     4.  Exception to #3.  Bobby: after getting to know you better, I want you to know that I do like you and I do think you're doing a good job.  I'm afraid that isn't sufficient cause, however, not to poke fun at you.  5.  I do take requests.  (Just not dictation.)  That's everything I can think of offhand.  I hope you enjoy my writing.

      Biscotti All'anaci  Today I'm trying a new recipe.  Well, new to me.  Biscotti has been around for a damn long time, some biscotti more than others.  So I have a delightful loaf baking away in my oven right now, which I've sprinkled with cinnamon.  Those of you not familiar with such ethnic foodstuffs may recognize biscotti as being those horrible dessicated cookielike items at your local coffee shop.  But they don't have to be that way.  Unlike scones which are a black hole of moisture and could drain Loch Ness if anyone decided they really wanted to solve that mystery once and for all, biscotti are intentionally dunkable coffee cookies.  You even bake them twice to get that "dunk me!" imperative feel.  Trying this recipe is inspired by a few things.  One, my old man had a fabulous Italian baking phase several years ago that I miss fiercely.  He's a kickass cook, my old man, and I got this recipe from him.  Two, I've started driving my boss at the bike shop to work, and he's a Paisan', so I'm taking pity on him from an ethnic wasteland point of view and planning to occasionally feed him treats from the homeland while he's a guest in my car.  I know what you're thinking: the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  I assure you, gentle reader, that if I were to list the organs of his I was most interested in, neither of those two would top it.  But today's entry is not about lust, it's about another fine Italian tradition: biscotti.  Third, biscotti is a flour-heavy number that doesn't require a lot of rising, so I figured it'd make the jump to a delightful high-altitude recipe without much adaptation at all.  So here's the old-a fam'ly ray-cipi:  ************** 2 eggs 5/8 c sugar 1 1/4 c pastry or cake flour (not all-purpose flour!) 1 tsp. anise seeds or flavoring  Put eggs and sugar in a bowl, beat 10 minutes.  Add flour slowly, blending gently.  Add anise flavoring.  Butter and flour a loaf pan 4" wide.  Put batter in.  Bake at 375 for 20 minutes.  Remove from pan, leaving oven on.  Cut loaf into 1" slices.  Put slices on buttered baking dish.  Brown slices on one side, then the other, about 5 minutes each side.  Makes about 20.  Finish with powdered sugar or lemon rind if desired.  These can also be made as drop cookies, omitting the second baking.  *************** This is interesting stuff.  The first phase yields a sort of fluffy sugar-egg deal which expands seemingly beyond its own mass, but the flour brings it back down while making the batter much heavier.  The first baking yields a poundcakey sort of deal that seems pretty appealing just the way it is.  Maybe I'll omit the second baking sometime.    Rather than anise, this time I'm using a vanilla nut extract and a little cinnamon.  We'll see how it goes.  I do love to bake, I just rarely have the time these days, and Phillip is not into sweets, leaving me to either find people to feed or eat it all myself.  Well, I must dash--time to flip the slices!

      And a couple more I just thought of...  There are two things about interpersonal relationships I both suck at and can't stand:  64. Drama. I hate it.  I don't need it, I don't want it, and I don't want to get caught in someone else's desires for drama.  Oh, but I have a flamboyant personality you say, and I like attention.  No no, when I make loud jokes or do something silly to get attention, that's comedy.  65. Talking about my feelings. Really, must I?  Can't I just keep them bottled up like a civilized person?  It'll pass, just leave it alone.  This is another way in which I seem to relate a lot better to my male friends than my female ones.  Other women seem to delight in exploring and expressing a full range of emotional stuff, but I would really rather not.  Depending on your perspective, this may be another case in which I'm "as bad as a man," like when I won't ask for directions.    Speaking of which, I have a story to convey about that.  When I was in Vienna in February with my friend Stuart, we looked high and low for the Albertina, the big heavy art museum.  We couldn't find it, in part because it was covered with a gigantic drop cloth, and in part because we couldn't see the sign featuring Munch's "The Scream" announcing that it was closed for renovation because it was 50 feet directly over our heads and not visible from our vantage point.  In any case, to pass the time during our long search, I told him about how I'm apparently "as bad as a man" when it comes to asking for directions, and he caved and asked for directions before I would.  Therefore, I am no longer as bad as a man, I'm WORSE than a man, an observation that kept me laughing hysterically (much to Stuart's mild irritation) for about 10 minutes.  Then we discovered a Starbuck's on the Albertinaplatz and were sufficiently horrified to stop laughing.

      And a few more...  61.  Finding girl shoes.   With my big ol' wide feet, I usually just wear men's shoes, which last longer and are often better made anyway.  Still, I can't help but feel a little left out when shoe stores have gigantic sales and women with "normal" feet can stock up on really cute shoes.  I'm sure if I had feet that were within acceptable parameters for shoe manufacturers, I'd have a million pairs.  As it is, my girl shoes are usually European, which are cut wider but are a lot more expensive and usually somewhat frumpy.  Recently, though, I found a few cool pairs in a rather mainstream discount store.  I've never come home with so many shoes in my life.  62.  Solving problems without a spatial map. With my terminally spatial brain, often the only way I can sort out a problem (especially a logistical one) is to put in on a grid and sketch it out.  I can't just talk through it or imagine how it would work.  63.  Expressing affection in a grown-up way. This is really very juvenile, but I frequently resort to teasing to express my affection.  In some ways, I think it's sort of flattering: you have to know someone well in order to be able to tease them about something that's funny about them, and it can certainly be done in a way that's not mean.  But here's a revelation: I use teasing most when I'm attracted to someone but don't feel like I can express that attraction openly.  Worse, that's when the teasing is at its most intense (which is to say, somewhat merciless).  I know, it's like I'm stuck in junior high school.

      You know what I haven't mentioned in MONTHS?  Things I suck at!  I'll never get to 100 at this rate...  55.  Auditory or visual learning.   Whatever it is, it doesn't sink in until I can interact with it with my own hands and get a feel for how it  works .  It might look like I'm fearlessly jumping into whatever task I'm supposed to be taking care of, but really I'm just memorizing the instructions--which make absolutely no sense to me yet--until I can put my hands on the task at hand.  56.  Selecting suitable meat.   Not having eaten meat during the time I've been shopping for myself, I have no idea how to pick out a reasonable cut of meat.  I do eat the occasional piece of fish, and I can kind of go by what looks appetizing there, but I half expect the meat case in the supermarket to contain things like hands and feet--it all looks sort of bloody and horrible to me--nothing's remotely appetizing.  So I have no formal training and no instincts to fall back on.  However, the prospect of spending a bunch of time learning about meat is just too yucky for words.  I intend to just keep guessing.  57.  Concealing my competitive streak during sporting events.   When we're talking about ideas or success or love, or any of those other important things in life, I'm actually quite supportive of others and not competitive at all.  I've even directly refused to compete for various positions and accolades with friends and colleagues.  However, on some level, I have always thought of my participation in athletics as an outlet for aggressive behavior, and do I ever maximize it!  For example, I played softball at school a few years ago, and being a good hitter but not very fast, I generally whack the ball as hard as I possibly can (often after waving the other team's fielders in a little bit because after all I'm only a girl--how far over their heads could possibly I hit? Heh-heh-heh) and then as I'm barreling toward first base like a freight train, I make as much noise as possible and look as if I'm about to run over the first baseman, which I have been known to do with pleasure when he has gotten between me and the bag.  He almost always gets rattled, and I frequently get a double or even a triple out of the deal.  Even when I'm not playing, I've been known to heckle the other team.  The funny thing is, I often don't even care if I lose.  It's more like a therapeutic process (for me--NOT for the other team!).    58.  Letting go when I know I'm right about something I think is important. I suppose this is loosely related to the above, and also loosely related to my aversion to tolerating injustice.  As a researcher, this sort of tenaciousness has served me well, but pushing the argument until I win is not always an attractive thing, even when I am right.  At least it's rarely about something trivial--I'll usually cave or agree to disagree for those just to maintain civil relations.  59.  Controlling others' impressions of my personality. I don't quite know how to express this.  I've known for several years that many people I meet are somewhat intimidated by me, sometimes even downright frightened, but I don't know why and I can't figure out how to fix it.  I try to be funny, put others at ease, be complimentary, charming, polite, etc., but these things don't always work.  In some cases, I think it's in my best interest to have certain people keep their distance and I don't attempt to change their perception, but frequently, I work for months or even years to seem more benign, to little effect.  It recently occurred to me that some people seem to have a hard time separating my personality from my character, and that that could be part of the problem.  Beyond that, though, I have no insight as to how to keep people from being freaked out by me.  I would almost always rather they weren't.  60.  Tanning. As last fall's treatise about redheads attests, I don't have enough melanin to keep from getting char broiled, even with brief exposure to the sun.  Going to the beach before 3:00 p.m. without being encased in canvas might as well involve A-1 Steak Sauce rather than sunscreen.

      My scandalous tuxedo shirt  I have a white tuxedo shirt that I sometimes wear over tank tops and the like during the summer.  It's lightweight and comfortable, and the detailing on it is nice: that flat, close-ridged front concealing the first few buttons.  It seems pretty straight-laced, even when I roll up the sleeves and wear it open, but it's really quite scandalous, and I'll tell you why: I have no idea where I got it.  Now, I have never bought a tuxedo shirt, so clearly it came off a man whose tuxedo shirt I removed or at least borrowed (and subsequently kept).  It's not my husband's size, though, so it seems to have come from a former lover.  The thing is, I have no idea which one or quite how long I've had it, so I can't even hazard a guess as to whose it might have been.    This of course leads me to mull over the lovers I've had, what their shirt sizes might have been, and who among them might have owned a tuxedo, or at least a formal shirt (however rendered quite informal by me).  And this is the really scandalous part:  Nobody springs to mind .  Apparently, somewhere along the way I slept with someone who was memorable enough for me to take his clothing, but not enough that I now remember who the hell he was based on that clothing.  How terrible is that?  Furthermore, it brings up an interesting mental image: I am wearing the shirt and I just happen to bump into the guy.  Will I even know him if I see him?  Would he say, "Hey, that's my shirt!"?  I wouldn't think so if he let me take it (I certainly wouldn't have taken it without his permission) and has been without it all these years, but maybe he was kind of a jerk about those things and that's why I stopped seeing him.  Who can say?    What a checkered past I must have.  Too bad I can't remember more of it.

      Okay, so getting back to the sexual abnormality thing, because a few of you have expressed curiosity about it, and we all know sex is one of my VERY favorite topics both in conversation and especially here.    So up until July when I posted a few specific sexual fantasies, I thought I was a pretty normal, healthy sexual creature with normal drives and appetites, and that any variance in that normalcy was likely caused merely by an abiding comfort with being a sexual creature.  Like I said in the last posting, while socially I identify more with men, the biological and neurological pieces of myself are undeniably feminine, and I expected this element to be governed by the latter.  I might have ventured into vague notions about the Legendary Redhead Sex Drive (loose hypothesis available in the archives from my October 12, 2002 posting) or about how my being tactile gives my fantasies a full-contact quality, but I would certainly have assumed that most women in their salacious thirties were like that in one way or another and that I was pretty normal.    As it turns out, though, I'm a freak.    In conversations with female friends about this and related topics, I learned several things.  First, it seems that most women don't fantasize so much about actually "doing it" as they do about what leads up to "doing it".  Their fantasies are about the atmosphere, the kiss, the moment, not about the actual boinking per se.    Second, they seem to have erotic dreams only once in a while as opposed to several times a week, and they're not that vivid.  For example, I had an erotic dream not too long ago about R where he was wearing only a pair of red Spandex bike shorts (in which I could watch him walk away all day long, and seize every possible opportunity to do so) and lying on top of me, and I could feel the warmth of his body against me, the light perspiration on his rough palms where he touched me, and everything about the kisses he placed on my neck.  While it was happening, it was absolutely real.  If I had woken up to red spandex bike shorts hanging off my bedpost, I would not have been alarmed.  If the subconscious is the producer of mind-movies, mine is definitely into porn and possibly has gigantic gold chains, chunky pinky rings and a bad combover.  Third, now that I'm really paying attention, I can't help but notice that my girlfriends seem at least somewhat, well, shocked at my sexually-related "I'd like to..." comments.  See that pale soft part of his thigh just above the tan line when he shifts positions?  I'D LIKE TO suck on that spot for about three days.  Look at that big, clean-cut, fresh-off-the-farm state trooper. I'D LIKE TO get pulled over just so I can wad up that clip-on-tie.  Yeah, it'd look great in a ball under the bed in a nearby motel room.  Oh, now that guy over there really needs a good spanking, and I'D LIKE TO give it to him.  I'D LIKE TO get M drunk and take advantage of him.  Check out that stockboy: I'D LIKE TO get *that* alone in a cool dry place...  I probably grow little devil horns when I say things like that and don't even realize it.  Now initially, I thought it was just that a few of my girlfriends are a little repressed or interested in being at least somewhat ladylike, but that is not the case at all.  Even those women I would consider to be quite comfortable with their sexuality and entirely rejecting of gender roles are not that comfortable with my eyeing men like a lioness contemplating a slow, fleshy antelope with poor herding instincts.  Until I got to be about 30, almost all my friends were men (and the vast majority still are), so I'm aware that my "I'd like to"'s are only mildly shocking to them, and in a different, more pleasing and less alarming way.  The folks who most seem to appreciate my blatantly sexual comments with mildly destructive elements, though, are my gay friends, who are looking at other men in much the same way.  I'd say I was a gay man trapped in the body of a woman, but I just don't have the style to back it up.  Could it be that the way we approach our sexual fantasies and go about getting our sexual needs and desires satisfied are more social than biological, I wonder?  It seems like what we WANT should be internal, dictated by bio-neurological makeup, by our physical bodies and our brain chemistries.  As a vegetarian (sometimes a bit of a pescetarian, but I swear it never goes beyond that--I never need a steakknife except in emergencies with really stubborn cheese, and I barely use my canine teeth), the only remotely carnal cravings I ever get are for the responses of living flesh.  I definitely don't give a rip about the sheets and the candles.  Not having been part of the locker room conversations, though (I was in the other locker room at the time, after all), I'm not sure how I would have learned to be different.  Whaddya think?  Does sexual appetite come from the internal sources of biology and neurology, or from external social ones?

      Happy Birthday!  Saturday was Megablog's first birthday.  I have been workingworkingworking constantly, so haven't had a chance to post any sort of special birthday thing.  Lisa likes to repost the 10 best posts from the previous year as an anniversary thing, and I might do something like that.    Right now, though, there are two things I'm thinking about a lot, in addition to my cluttered schedule and how I'm going to get anything else done, ever: 1., My job at the bike shop, which has been really a lot better--rather a dream job, in fact--since late July when I got groped by a customer and subsequently received more support and kindness than I thought possible there, is about to disappear, and I'm pretty sad about that.  2., After my fairly recent postings about sexual fantasies and multiple conversations with girlfriends about them and about related sexual topics, I have discovered that I don't seem to think about or pursue sex the same way that the women I know do.  I thought this would be one of the few areas governed by biology and sexual differences in neurology, so therefore I would have more in common with women than with men (often true with the biological things, but rarely with the social/learned ones), but apparently that is not the case.  I've been feeling like I'm sort of abnormal when I have felt for most of my life that my sexual tendencies were entirely normal and healthy.  So I've got plenty of material going into Year Two.  I promise to expound soon!

      People tell me stuff.  I've had random strangers confess crimes to me on the bus.    Brand new co-workers have taken me to lunch to tell me about their incredibly tawdry lives, completely unsolicited by me, or pulled me into their offices to ask me whether they should declare bankruptcy.  Fresh acquaintances have discussed with me in great detail their sexual dysfunctions, alarming things they've survived, physical and psychological, and other incredibly personal stuff like they were paying me $120 an hour to lie on my tufted leather couch.  I've never been sure why.    Needless to say, this is one of the major factors that makes my life weird.  It's not the #1 factor, but it's certainly in the top 10.  There's something very surreal about having people expose themselves to me like that.  Enough people do it, though, that I have of course attempted to analyze it.    Lisa once hypothesized that it had to do with an impression that no topic is off limits--maybe I make it seem like the stakes of saying something outrageous to me are relatively low (and they probably are--what the hell), and then when I don' t freak out at what someone just told me, she feels free to pile some more on top of that.  But how does she know I won't tell the frickin' world?  I won't, but how does a near stranger detect that?  It may also have to do with the fact that although I don't like to talk about my own feelings, and my own problems are annoying to me, I am fascinated by what vexes others, in an almost voyeuristic way.  Only my problems suck.  Yours are incredibly interesting.  Usually, despite the surreal-ness of it all, this kind of thing is harmless.  People tell me outrageously personal things, it's weird but interesting for me, and I frequently learn something about the human psyche.  Every once in a while, though, it brings up a human dilemma.  Several years ago, for example, I found out that half of my favorite couple was having an affair with one of my friends, who told me all about it.  At first I was devastated.  After that wore off, though, I had to decide what to do, since I couldn't un-know that information.  Part of me wanted to tell the other half of the couple, but I thought that the only thing worse than hearing that kind of news would be hearing it from someone other than your spouse.  So instead, I decided I wasn't going to make any effort to hide or assist the affair itself, and that I would try to support the individual people involved as much as I could.  It was going to be a train wreck and they were all going to get very badly hurt, which they all did.  Eventually, the couple healed after a great deal of hard work, but I lost the friend because she thought I had replaced her in the affair, which of course I hadn't.  But none of the folks involved were all that rational at that point.  Anyway, I'm thinking about this today because I have a co-worker who is sort of verging on being my friend, and I don't think he's okay.  I know why, I know what's missing and what he wants and what has recently happened to him, and I sense his hurt consuming his life.  I have some important things in common with him and I want him to be okay, but getting involved enough to draw someone out of their sorrow costs.  It costs time and energy of course, wear and tear on your own psyche, sometimes your own sweat and tears, but it can also break your heart even if you do everything exactly right.  On the other hand, I think if you see a fellow human being slipping off into darkness and you realistically think you can, you should try to offer a lifeline of some kind.  Sometimes, though, you just make it worse by drawing attention to the fact that he has stopped treading water.    I guess the upshot is, I'm a pretty good listener, but at what point do you have to stop just listening and DO something?  I haven't been able to work out the answer to that yet.

      Confessions of an all-too-accomplished wiseass  Now, I've already admitted to the powerful role sarcasm has played in my life, and in the ongoing Things I Suck At (TISA) feature, I've even confessed that I can't always keep sarcastic comments to myself when I feel them welling up inside.  I've also copped to the fact that I am unbelievably juvenile with the merciless teasing when I'm attracted to someone and don't feel like I'm allowed to express it.  Now, usually, all this is more or less okay.  It tends to entertain myself and those around me, and on the rare occasion when I do actually hurt someone's feelings, I always apologize and explain my relevant character flaws.  However, this time, I've really f*cked up.  You all know it's a big goal of mine to live a relatively regret-free life, but right now, about this one f*ck-up, teeming with regret.  More regret than I would have, say, walking away from a petting zoo on Pet Sedated Tigers FREE Day.    This big fat regret-infested relationship snafu has to do with someone who has been mentioned several times here, by a few different names.  Let's go with calling him R.  I used to have conscious interactions with R a few times a week, and subconscious ones from time to time.  I like him very much, and he's also luscious, so in addition to missing whatever early friendship I might have enjoyed before I f*cked it all up, I also miss the sexual tension.  After all, sexual tension is sort of the gravity that holds my universe together, and he was like a singularity waiting to happen.  He is also too sensitive a guy to take much of my particular brand of teasing, and I knew that, but hell if I could stop.  It was like a sick compulsion.  Now, there are two different brands of regret here: Things I said, and things I didn't say.  Top 5 faux-pas:  5. When asked jokingly if I thought he had a fat ass (what an invitation!), I should have told him that the magnificent ass in question belonged on a dessert cart, but instead I just smiled and said no.   4. When he was explaining to someone else how he didn't have a very good sense of spatial relations and he said it was just a part of his brain that didn't work, I should not, while casually strolling by, have said, "Another one?!  You should sue."  3. When told me he was just the boy next door, I should not have said, "Yeah, if you live in a crack house."  2. When we had a mixup about whether I was picking him up or not one day, he came to the door adorably sleepy-eyed and wearing only a pair of shorts.  Instead of telling him he took longer than my grandma to get ready, I wish I had told him that if he kept coming to the door half naked, I would have to show up early and wake him up right.  It was there in the multiple-choice wiseass lineup, and I didn't select it.  Instead, I picked the comment that would elicit a more predictable response.  1. I'm sorry.  I should have said this a LOT and I didn't.  Did I mention all the many times he was sweet to me?  All the considerateness and coffee-getting, and the time he bandaged my hand after I hurt it...  Oh yes, I've been a cad.  Now I did explain to R at one point that I only knew 3 ways to express affection: compliments, teasing and sex.  He doesn't do well with the first two, and because of the context of our interactions, I didn't feel like the third was on the menu (or what?  I wouldn't have resorted to being so unbelievably juvenile).  So anyway, now that I've thoroughly f*cked it all up, I miss him.  Thankfully, I miss the teasing least of all.  I sent him an email a while back, apologizing but not explaining my character flaws (which, after all, in this case would be all too telling).  I told him about how every time I look at the scar on my hand from where I hurt it and he bandaged it up for me, it's a reminder of how sweet he was to me and how I wasn't paying attention.  I didn't get a response, and I don't blame R one bit.  I intend to keep working on it, though, gently and patiently.  I really feel like I have to make it right, that is, if I can possibly turn off the sarcasm spigot.

      Joanne Pratt Day  Tomorrow is Joanne Pratt Day, the second annual.  It would have been my friend Joanne's 33rd birthday had cancer not taken her from us all too soon in July of 2002 while I was away at a conference in Portland, Oregon.  I still miss her, sometimes I think rather selfishly so.  Last year, when I instituted Joanne Pratt Day (see November 21, 2002's posting for details), I was still too immersed in grief to tell you about a really wonderful moment in it all, so I'll tell you now.    When I returned from Oregon, I called Joanne's mother because I knew I wouldn't make the memorial service in time, and because I wanted to offer my support.  Joanne's mother is a pretty remarkable woman, full of nurturing life energy, and she is currently raising Joanne's little boy, Alex, with the help of Joanne's large family.  We talked about Joanne, and about Alex.  She told me that Joanne had really prepared him very well for what was going to happen.  Still, the family wanted to make sure he was okay, and to comfort him.  Joanne's mom took him for a walk at one point and asked him how he was feeling.  He said he missed her, but he was okay.   "Is it becuase you know she's in a better place?" she asked.   "Yes, and because she can see now," he answered.   After that story, I just couldn't keep it together anymore.  Here I was trying to support Joanne's mom in her grief, and I kinda lost it on the phone.  What a wonderful woman she raised, and what an amazing little boy Joanne raised.  Her spirit and gentleness live on in them, and in me too.  So tomorrow, on Joanne Pratt Day, I task you with celebrating Joanne's pleasures, talents and finer qualities.  I will be raising a pint to her in a hipster bar with a hot astronomer with whom I recently perpetrated an elaborate and funny prank.  Other possibilities include: engaging in joyful artistic expression, especially creative writing or music (you don't have to play an instrument--singing or listening is good); raising a glass (or a doobie); engaging in saucy flirtation with whatever sort of thing strikes your fancy; spending time with good friends and really enjoying just them; playing with your kids or pets and really savoring it; looking at something from a whole different perspective; or just doing something that feels really good.  To me, the glass raising is a key element.  Happy Joanne Pratt Day.

      So the distance learning class is coming along quite well, and I'm really enjoying the experience.  Yesterday, though, we had Pat Buchanan as our guest in the class.  Now, I'm all about listening to people who don't necessarily agree with me--dissention is often the quickest route to change and growth, and I don't have to agree with someone to think their opinion is valuable, or even to like them.  But Mr. Buchanan is really quite appalling.  In describing the experience to Lisa today, this is how I put it:  Yesterday, we had Pat Buchanan as our guest in the distance learning class.  Sheesh, what an asshole.  I was totally traumatized.  Top 4 most offensive moments:  4.  When he compared Judge Moore to Dr. Martin Luther King and said King hadn't done anything, really, and he got a national holiday.  One of the students took him on on this point, asking for Constitutional support for that (insane) comment, and I thought really kicked his ass.  Judge Moore, incidentally, is the Alabama judge who just got thrown off the bench for erecting a big ol' stone slab of the 10 Commandments.  I think that would have been okay if he had also offered other primitive legal systems, making it more of a cultural exhibit.  But that's not what happened.    3.  When our Muslim student asked about his view on the war in Iraq, and he said that now in every mosque from Mecca to Indonesia, they were telling students to bomb Americans.  Suraiya reports that in her mosque, which incidentally happens to be right here in Denver, they are told to vote.  2.  When he talked about his ridiculous views on immigration and forced language acquisition, and mentioned Operation Wetback.  I really wanted our Hispanic students to kick his ass.  Our student who is from Mexico is terribly shy, and when he said that ridiculous shit, her face just kinda fell.  It was like the professor and I had spent the whole quarter making that classroom a safe environment in which to express oneself, and this asshole reminded us all that you're never really safe from hate and ignorance.  Not only have all our students earned their places in class, their different perspectives really contribute a lot to the discussion, discourse, and process of the course.    Furthermore, America is a success story of people living together--we're NOT becoming an uncommunicative polyglot, and we won't, either.  Needless to say, I was personally offended by this, too.  My grandfather, not considered white until 1922 when the INS decided Italians were no longer "colored", fought for his family's new country at Omaha Beach.  Heroes are defined by what they do, not by where they're from.  Anyway, Mr. Buchanan's family is not FROM here, either.  We're all immigrants, whether our families got here 10,000 years ago or last week.  1.  When he attributed Bush "winning" Florida in 2000 to divine intervention in response to his prayers.  Apparently God guided the hands of all those people who meant to vote for Gore and instead punched his sorry-ass chad.  I guess the God he believes in thinks democracy is basically crap.  Fuckwad has no idea what a walking monument to irony he really is.  I was pretty fucking horrified.  One nice consolation, though, is that All The Rest of Us: women and gays and minorities and immigrants and everybody else faaaaar outnumber his bad-$400-suit-wearin' cracker ass.  He will NEVER get elected.  I have never used the n-word when not talking about _Huckleberry Finn_, but I have no compunction about calling Pat Buchanan a honky cracker.  I am not fooled by the by-line and full compliment of teeth.

      Training Regimens  In response to my posting of about a week ago, when I referred to my old cycle training regimen, a few of you have asked about what the rest of it was like, if I'm going to go back to it, etc.  So a few answers:  It worked really well for me, so I will probably go back to some modified version of it.  At the time, I was anticipating doing several rides that involved a lot of climbing, so one of my goals was to be a better climber.  Ideally, it was a 5-day weekly rotation.  I didn't always hit every single day, and some days the thought of doing sprints just made me feel like throwing up, so I did another climb or another regular ride instead.  This regimen gave me about 150 - 200 miles a week, depending on where I went, what I focused on, and how much time I had.  * 2 days with standard, regular riding.  I used these times to work on something specific, get better at handling a certain piece of trail, or just get the mileage up and get the time down.  This was usually in the neighborhood of 2 hours door to door.  * 1 day with climbing.  I would try to do about the same amount of time as those two days, but with as much uphill as I could find.    * 1 day with sprints.   One minute of pedaling as hard as I could, one minute  winding down (still on the bike).  I had to start with 30-second sprints and work my way up.  My goal was to engage in this sort of crazy behavior for a full hour, but I don't think I ever got to more than about 50 minutes.  I would usually  do this in a more or less closed, controlled environment, like a really deserted road or a loop around a park.  * 1 day of distance.  This is the part I felt I was best at, and I would look forward to it all week.  I would pick a long-distance route (40 miles minimum) and just ride for hours.  Times ranged from 3 1/2 hours to most of the day.  Right now, I'm not strong enough yet to do that regimen, but I could do part of it.  The goal these next few weeks is just going to be to get on the bike and put in the time--that's where the base strength comes from.  As I get stronger,  I probably won't use this exact regimen because I'm not all that interested in climbing.  I'm also not very good at it, and I've discovered that there are plenty of events to do that don't involve much of it, and I'd rather focus my energies on doing things that I enjoy than dreading the climbing parts of events that aren't that well-suited to what I do well.  I'll replace Climbing Day with whatever skill I think I need to work on for a particular upcoming event and see how that works out, and there are always a few things I work on no matter what.  One, I'm always working on getting the mileage up and the time down.  If I never consulted my onboard computer, I'd just mosey along at about 12 mph, looking at the scenery.  The numbers motivate me: go a little longer, now do it faster, go a little longer, now do it faster...    Two, I'm kind of a slow starter.  My first couple of miles almost always bite.  My pacing isn't even and I'm fidgeting with stuff getting comfortable.  I've cut down the fidgeting quite a bit, but it still takes me the first few miles to find my groove.  The next 30 miles are great, but I don't settle into them right away.  I'd like to shrink down that finding-the-groove time.  I think I can do it to some extent, but I'm also sort of like an Alaskan Malamute in that regard.  Huskies and smaller sled dogs are faster but need to rest from time to time.  Malamutes will pull anything at a steady 8 miles an hour over any terrain, all day long.  But those first few miles are like a garage sale until they find their groove as a team.  Three, I have a funny little break point at the 40-mile day.  When I'm getting back into it, 38 miles is not significantly more tiring than 25 miles, but for some reason, 40 kicks my ass.  Once I break through that wall and 40 miles is reasonably comfortable, 100 miles is okay too (maybe more--I've never gone more than 118 miles in a single day).    The nice thing about this time getting back into it is that for the most part, I feel okay.  I was afraid that since I'm in my 30s now, it would suddenly take a lot more work to get where I wanted to be, but that's yet another myth about your thirties that's basically crap.  It's no harder than it was in my late 20s, and that a few years should make that huge a difference seems ludicrous to me now.  I'm not terribly worn out or anything, I just have to be careful with my hamstring.  If I'm too sore and stretching doesn't help, I give my muscles a break and don't ride that day.  It's disappointing, but probably a lot less disappointing than reinjuring it and having all those months of frustrating patience with it go right out the window and having to start all over again.  I have to be really sure to keep that hamstring warm, and I stretch before and after I ride.    As for the incidental stuff, like what did I eat and what-not, I took a multivitamin and a calcium supplement every day, made sure I got at least a couple of glasses of (lowfat) milk and and lots and lots of water--easily 8 - 10 cups a day outside of my rides.  Before I went out on a ride, I had something with both protein and complex carbohydrates in it, I usually brought some kinda fruit with me if I was going to be gone for a while, and I always ate light protein when I got back, like lowfat yogurt or cottage cheese or something.  Beyond that, I generally let my cravings direct what I eat.  I think the most important thing I did, though, was to record my progress.  I kept careful track of my stats with my onboard computer.  Sometimes I journaled a little bit; other times I just kept a spreadsheet with a few short notes.  On those days when the training is a struggle, it's really important to be able to see how far you've come.  Sometimes it was the only thing that got me out the door the next day.  So this week, I was pretty much on track to break 100 miles--I had three days of about 25 miles each, but I didn't get the fourth in.  Yesterday morning, my hamstring was pretty tweaky, and stretching didn't help it.  Plus, I've got a huge pedal bruise on my lower left calf from a near-crash trying to avoid hitting an unleashed dog who was really excited to meet me, and a mysterious sore stiffness in my right wrist (probably I pranged it during the same incident).  My body needed the rest, so I didn't get my fourth day in, or the mileage it would have given me.    This is kind of a case in point: I really wanted to get to that goal, but my hamstring just wasn't up to riding that day.  What the f*ck are you gonna do?  So I look at my spreadsheet.  Mileage and average speed are coming up steadily, and considering that a few short weeks ago, I was happy to get 5 - 10 miles without screaming, the precipitous rise to an average of about 25 miles is pretty good.  I spent longer on my bike doing three rides this week than I did two weeks ago doing four rides.  And it was even a lot colder this week.  I know I'm stronger than I was.  What the numbers tell you about your process is more important than a single number.  So next week.  100 miles.  I'll get there.

      In reviewing some of my old postings, I realize how morose I've become of late.  Yecch!  Let's stop that, shall we?  Here's something lighthearted and fun.  I've discovered a new delight: platform shoes.  I love them because they accentuate my fabulous Amazon-ness and they don't munch my feet to do it.  I like being nine-foot-six, and if I put on a pair of those babies, I can be nine-foot-TEN and still walk around!  I always loved the extra height of heels, but as I got older, just didn't want to be bothered with the discomfort and said the hell with it.  But now the thrill of being painlessly over six feet tall is mine!  I always wanted to be at least 5'10", but I didn't quite make it (I must have stunted my growth with all that ill-advised behavior).  I'm about an inch shy, so pretty much there in a pair of well-engineered sneakers.  The extreme of another 4-6 reasonably comfortable inches is irresistable, though.  When people ask me if I consider myself a feminist, I usually reply that no, I consider myself more of an Amazon.  That statement makes a much stronger impact from a slightly higher elevation, I must say.  Shoe manufacturers must sense that there are Amazons out here just waiting to be Amazonier, because these mega-heels do actually come in my size.  Sure, it's possible that they're just making them for transvestites, but I can live with that.  Really.  I know I've said unflattering things about 70s revival shoes, but in this case, I'll recant.  I've been wanting to wear stilts out in public ever since I got to walk around on those little buckets with strings through them in nursery school.  Now I can even do it at work.  Makes me wish I had some underlings to stand over.  Students just aren't the same.

      Coming back from yet another career-ending injury  Wow, have I ever been falling down on the blogging job!  I was working insane hours trying not to lose my house, but now that I've lost half my jobs to seasonal and other funding cuts, I have a little bit of "spare" time!  I know, I barely know what to do with myself.  So when I'm not scrambling for funding, or taking care of little items that have been neglected for months, I've been back on my bike.  Those of you who read my postings from December of 2002 know that I tore a hamstring during a dance performance and was laid up for quite some time.  Now, I don't recommend this particular injury AT ALL.  It is excruciatingly painful, inconvenient, debilitating, slow to heal, and takes a lot of patience and physical retraining to regain anything like your former mobility.  It was weeks before I could sit in, never mind drive, a car.  I could only sit in one position, sort of on my left hip, and I walked with a cane for a while.  After about 6 months, I was about 90% back to "normal," but if you're a dancer or an athlete, that missing 10% really sucks.  I still can't really run too effectively, and I've noticed in dance class that, although I didn't lose much flexibility on the right (the injured side), I lost a LOT on the left because the rest of my body compensated for my injury for several months.  It's been a struggle to bring my placement back to center, and it will take a long time to get closer to symmetrical in my flexibility again.  I've also been wanting very much to get back into cycling.  I think I've mentioned here before that I was drawn to it initially because I have always lusted after ground speed and it's the one land-based sport where torque=speed.  I also became drawn to it because it's a non-impact sport, and many years ago, I smashed up my knees in a car accident.  I would consider that knee-smashing to be my first "career-ending" injury.  I had been interested in a number of sports at the time, and at 14, was just discovering my athletic potential.  After the accident where I was the passenger in a Dodge Omni that went head-on into the grille of a Mack truck, I thought I might walk with a limp for the rest of my life, and I gave up on sports completely (and dance, in which I hadn't yet had any formal training, but already loved) for quite some time.  Whenever it was cold or damp, which is pretty much all the time in New England, my knees swelled, ached, and some days felt like they were shattering with every step.  I remember a few particularly cold, raw days a even few years later where I used at least one of my crutches.  Oof, it sucked.  Still, I consider that accident to have been a rare gift.  Getting a sense of my own mortality at such a young age gave me a much better appreciation for the life I could have (even if it couldn't be one of a professional dancer or fencer).  I don't think I would have tried so many new things just to see if I could do them, or gone out of my way to see new places and meet new people, or taken so many risks just to see if I could do better or do something more interesting, or grabbed at opportunities, or based my whole life philosophy on trying to be fearless and without regret, if I hadn't gotten a major wakeup call in my early mid-teens.    So several years after the accident, I seized an opportunity to take my first real dance classes in college, even though by most standards, I was unbelievably old to begin dance training.  After years of knee pain, dance was terrific therapy, and in a few months, my knees felt like normal parts of my body again instead of barely-compatible alien implants.  I considered it another terrific gift and resolved not to take up things like running or skiing, because getting your knees back is a miraculous gift from the universe, and not to be f*cked with.  Shortly thereafter, I bought myself a bike, although I rode it only occasionally until I moved to Colorado and became really passionate about cycling.  The majority of my dance training, and all of my real dance performance experience, has also happened here.  I consider my more recent hamstring injury to have been "career-ending" as well because, had I been a professional dancer (instead of a mere serious amateur and occasional performer), it would have sidelined me for a season and a half, maybe closer to two seasons total: more than enough time to have been cut from a company and not have another shot at a good role for too long to remain on any director's mind.  Plus, for a dancer, I'm about retirement age anyway--I would pretty much have had to step aside.  As it is, I have dance teachers who have watched my progress very carefully, and been very encouraging while gently urging caution.  I still have a long way to go to fight my way back to where I was a year ago, and they will certainly help me do that, and more.  Fortunately, my intended career doesn't require healthy hamstrings, and I'm barely old enough in that arena to be taken seriously, so I haven't really lost any ground there either.  But a serious, long-term injury really changes your life, and changes your head.  The hardest part for me was being patient, not overdoing it, being careful not to do anything to tweak or reinjure it early on.  Now that I'm getting stronger, I can begin to fight my way back to where I was, and I find I'm much better at that part than the patient and cautious parts.    So a few weeks ago, I got back on my bike.  I'd been testing the waters intermittently, seeing how my hamstring felt, being careful not to overdo it.  It had been terrible.  The back of my right leg felt like an overchewed piece of gum, stiffening and spasming.  I couldn't go very far because it could become very painful at any moment and I'd have to stop right away.  About two weeks ago, though, I discovered I could go about 4-5 miles before the pain started to set in.  I decided it felt strong enough to start building it up again, so I tried to get a little further.  The next week, I broke 10 miles without screaming, then 17 (I got lost that day--there was some quiet but emphatic swearing toward the end--it was a little too far), then 20 miles, then 25.  When I was in regular training a few years ago, my standard everyday ride was about 18-25 miles, so I thought I'd level off there to try to do about 25 miles consistently, maybe shoot for a 100-mile week.  That's where I am now, on track for my first 100-mile week in nearly 3 years.  I'll keep you posted.

      I send Christmas cards to dead people  No, gentle reader, this is not the upbeat yuletide sequel to "The Sixth Sense".  In three separate cases, I actually did have to follow up my annual holiday carding with sympathy cards.  If you got a Christmas card from me this year, take some vitamins and look both ways crossing the street, okay?  Although, if you have actually  received  a card, you're probably out of the woods.  My godfather's dad and my great uncle died the same week, just after I had done my annual mass-mailing, which was pretty sad.  They were both really good men who had served in World War II and been hardworking union guys.  Then, the other night, I got a letter in the mail from Wichita.  The only person I know in Wichita--that is--KNEW in Wichita was my grandmother's step mother, technically my great-grandmother by marriage.  I send her a Christmas card every year, even though she never sends me a damn thing, because I'm nice, and she's old.  Or, she WAS old.  So I was intrigued by the letter, whose return address I didn't actually recognize.  I opened it to find a brief note from this great-grandmother-figure's nephew, telling me she had died several years ago.  Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!  Now that explains why she hasn't sent me a damn thing for the last several years, but not for the previous twenty-some-odd.  How could I not know that a family member had been dead since the last century, you may ask?  The answer is this:  she is literally just as prolific a correspondent since her death as she had been previously.    Sure, I cut people slack for not writing back to me because of extreme old age, or stupidity, or total lack of interest in getting any sort of mail that doesn't have those pernicious little windows, and I can certainly cut them slack for being deceased at the time of receipt of my epistles.  However, having sent three--count 'em--THREE Christmas cards to people who were already dead THIS YEAR ALONE (apparently, I've only been sending the one for quite some time), it does make me feel like there is some sort of problem here.    Now clearly, since I didn't KNOW these people were dead, the fault is not mine.  I blame people who refuse to communicate under any circumstances.  I think we should all think of the Christmas card as a sort of annual beacon, announcing to your acquaintances all over the world that You Are Not Dead Yet.  Indeed, next year, I may send out cards with that simple, plaintive holiday message:  I still draw breath.  Happy Holidays.  I'm going to start right now.  Happy New Year.  I remain sentient.

      One of the things I use this blog for is to figure out what I think about stuff.  So I have something sticky I'm trying to work out my opinion about today: personal perception and poster sessions.  These days, I'm on a couple of committees of the chaos society I belong to.  One of the committees is the education and training committee, which is currently discussing what the different kinds of structured conference interactions should be like.  We've talked a little bit about workshops, and now we're talking about poster sessions.  Something happened today in the poster session discussion that made me feel a little squeamish, and I'm not sure quite why.  I'm going to try to get at it here.  Now, I dig poster sessions.  You can get exposed to a lot more ideas at once, you can stroll around and absorb at your leisure, and unlike with a paper you're reading, if you want to ask the author what she means by something or how she arrived at that conclusion, or whether there's a good source for this area, there she is.  Ask her.  I also think it's a great way to include more folks.  You only have so much space in a conference program for speakers, and poster sessions can give voice to a bunch of other ideas and are a lot more interactive.  It also allows for greater participation by folks who don't necessarily feel comfortable giving a presentation to a large group, and a more comfortable format where they can share their ideas.  So poster sessions: good.  The point that came up today was that some people just feel the need to talk about their stuff, so we should have an introductory set of brief remarks (say, 5-7 minutes each) by the authors to kick off the poster session.  Now, for the people who wanted to talk but there wasn't enough room in the program, this is a wonderful thing.  They'll take 15 minutes and say some fraction of what they wanted to say and get herded away from the podium.  For those who actively like poster sessions because it gets their ideas out without having to make a speech, it's a terrible idea.  I greatly identify with this segment, and inwardly, I recoiled from the suggestion.  I dealt with it in the moment by suggesting that we make the speaking time optional: if you don't want to get up and talk about your poster, you need not.  Why recoil, though?  I've done a lot of public speaking and performing, I'm not uncomfortable in front of large groups, and on various videotapings, I even look pretty natural.  But for some reason I feel differently about scientific stuff.  I think that the truth is that I like poster sessions because nobody can see me.  They just see my ideas and there is no reaction to my physical presence.    To tell the truth, I often wander off from my poster during poster sessions and look at other people's stuff.  I come back if someone looks especially interested in my poster, but honestly, I think I prefer to, well, hide, at least for a little while.    I think part of this goes back to some things I mentioned in my posting from April 2003 about the Sigma Xi poster session I participated in then: scientists (both male and female) are often not nice to young women, and many of us are frequently assumed to be morons until we can prove differently.  I want people to have some opinion about my ideas before they get a look at me, before they see I'm female (I usually author my stuff as M. rather than Meg),  and young.  I feel like every time I have to talk about my ideas in a scientific context, a great deal of my energy goes toward proving I know what I'm doing so I won't just be dismissed (which I wouldn't have to do if I were, say, a middle-aged man), and a lot less of it goes toward discussing what I came to discuss.  Sure, I prove myself, but it really makes my ass tired and wastes my time.  I like it when people see my ideas BEFORE they see me, because then I don't have to deal with much of that crap.    At least, I think that's what's bothering me about this.

      And a few more things I suck at  66.  Making margaritas.  I know, it seems like I should make really great ones, but I don't.  I mean, they're terrible.  Seriously, these hands have created the worst margaritas I've ever had.  Feh.  67.  I'm not a very good juggler yet, but I think I will be sometime soon.  I say I suck at it, though, because I'm at that stage where you can actually tell what I'm trying to do enough to know that I'm doing it badly, and that's progress!  I mean, being a sucky juggler is still being much more of a juggler than a non-juggler.  68.  Being in the military.  Okay, I don't have 100% confirmation of this, but I can't imagine I'd be any good at it.  It's on my mind because I recently applied for a linguist job... with the Navy.  It would be hard enough for me to work for the Navy WITHOUT enlisting, but it might be worth it to get paid to learn and use a whole pile of languages for a while.  I'm waiting to hear if I actually have to join up, in which case, I'd have to give the Navy an emphatic f*ck no.  69.  Respecting authority just because I should.  Yeah, that's part of the problem.  The admiral, the president, the pope, my thesis advisor, whatever boss I end up with, they all just put their pants on one leg at a time, that is, if they can even dress themselves.  I'm afraid my respect has to be earned by the satisfactory completion of respectable deeds.  I know, it's limiting.

      So I'm home today, feeling kinda sick and crappy.  It seems to be a sort of low-grade sick rather than the sweaty, body-wracking, gut-squeezing illnesses just about everybody around me seems to have contracted, and for that I'm grateful.  It's like I got cowpox.  Still, I didn't sleep well, I didn't ride my bike, and I don't have quite enough energy to deal with a lot of the things I'd like to accomplish today.  On the other hand, I'm not SO sick that I can justify sleeping and just blowing it all off--I'm merely uncomfortable rather than miserable.  This seems like an excellent time for a chat about flu shot roulette.  I know lots of people who are just scrambling to get flu shots.  I've never had one myself, and so many people are into flu shots out here that there's often a waiting list or at least a priority list, and being a healthy person in my early 30s, I am WAY down on that list.  I might not be able to get a flu shot when I wanted one in any case.    Now, this is a rough year for the flu in Colorado.  We've had a bunch of people go into the hospitals for the flu, not to mention drop dead, and let's face it, what a lousy way to die.  However, the "killer" strain of flu is not included in this year's flu shot.  The flu shot we have this year protects against a mere 4 strains of flu, and that's not one of them.  So I think, do I really want to go through a bunch of bureaucracy to prove I deserve a SHOT so I can haul my butt to some flu shot outlet to let someone with minutes of training stab me and give me a mild case of four flus that won't even kill me?  Hmm, it's a tuffy.  I think I'll stick with cowpox and taking my chances.

      The Commonwealth of Massa-$%@#!-chusetts  Now that John Kerry has surged into the lead for the Democratic Presidential nomination, the nation has again turned its attention to Massachusetts politics.  As well it should.  In the cradle of the American revolution, politics is still a spectator sport.  Government means something, and is much more in the hands of the people than it is elsewhere in the country.  As usual, though, there are some things about Massachusetts and its politics that outsiders just don't get, and it's, well, really frickin' annoying.  For one thing, over the past week, I have heard more pundits rave about Kerry having been Dukakis' Lt. Gov. (prounouced, "Lite Gov") than I ever heard about it while it was going on--and I LIVED in Massachusetts then.  The fact is, in Massachusetts, the Lieutenant Governor is elected separately from the Governor.  I would blame the lack of good high school civics programs in this country, but George-fucking-Will is old enough to have had one of those, and he still rants about it like he doesn't know any better.  Because apparently, he doesn't.    It's like when you're watching a movie set in Massachusetts, and they've gone to all the trouble of making all the details work and be convincing about the fact that this movie really is set in Massachusetts (except for the really horrible accents), right up until the Wedding Scene.  And in the Wedding Scene, the officiator says, "Then by the power vested in me by the state of Massachusetts..." and it makes any native Masshole cringe.  Massachusetts is a COMMONWEALTH, okay?  NOT a state.  There are enough commonwealths that we should all know which ones are which.    It's the same kind of thing.  Basic political ignorance.  Because we're political junkies in Massachusetts, it is that much more annoying.  We know when YOUR state is really a commonwealth.  We know when YOUR electoral process is hinky.  Take this election as an opportunity, willya, pundits?  That, or take a damn civics class.  You sound like a bunch of retaahds.

      How I learned to stop worrying and love the twang  Ladies and gentlemen--I think that takes in most of you [insert Groucho cigar wag here]--I have a request.  Our fabulous hostess Lisa has expressed an interest in learning to embrace the faith...  of country music.    Now, if you're from most of America, liking country music is sort of natural, like liking Pepsi or liking hamburgers.  It's just sort of part of the American landscape, it's around, and you get sort of a taste for it after a while if it's not already innate.  But as Lisa mentioned in our travel blog over the summer (this is actually one of my favorite postings of hers, it's right  urlLink  here   on August 4th), if you're from New England, especially urban New England, it's a whole 'nother ball of wax.  I quote:  "When I was younger I was filled with misconceptions about the United States. For one thing, I thought I lived there. After traveling, I now realize that I don't really live in the US: I live on top of a small geologic figure that accidentally got grafted onto the East Coast after getting lost on a museum tour with its fellow Europeans."  So true!  And in the case of country music, true of the much of the urbanized eastern seaboard.  Go inland 20 miles and people can't get enough of the stuff (we have both types of music here, country AND western).  But where Lisa and I are from, nary a twang.  Lisa also has an excellent point in that getting into country music can be a lot like getting into science fiction: potentially lots to pour through to get to the good stuff.  So I will describe my conversion and a conversion in which I participated, and hope that offers some guidance.  Now, the first thing to know is that the current pop-country crap you get on the radio sux.  Don't bother.  The second thing you need to know is that country is a broad genre like classical: there are so many zillions of sub-genres, you are bound to find something you like.  And once you like that one thing, the rest of the larger genre starts to sound pretty good, too--what was once grating and corny sounding starts to sound sort of gentle and genuine.  So the trick to country conversion is to find that one thing you like, and the rest will just fall into place.  Finally, the best reason to like country music is a lot like the best reason to like the blues: it's very genuine, honest stuff.  It's also uniquely American, with a sense of individualistic pride, so everybody's experience is a little different.  I've told parts of this story on our travel blog, but here's how it happened to me.    It was 1992.  I had just graduated from college (in fact, I think I missed Lisa's graduation party at which a cheerful priest grabbed her head in a bless-and-stun manuver).  My dad and I drove to Albuquerque to my godfather's wedding.  I was a tragically hip 21-year-old in cotton, Spandex, and cotton Spandex, mostly black.  We took turns choosing tapes to play in the tape player of the 1978 Mercury Grand Marquis my dad drove at the time (which was, sadly, demolished by some out-of-control speeding Fitchburg cop on a wet curve a couple of days before my wedding).  I picked cool stuff.  My dad invariably picked country.    Now that I think about it, those were mix tapes--I bet he sensed the opportunity for conversion and was trying to hit on the one thing that would get me hooked--on purpose!  The landscape probably helped a little: America flattening, rolling, broadening, and finally baking outside the window.  All the way there, I winced every time it was his turn to pick a tape.  It might have grown on me  a little .    Once we got to Albuquerque, though, something clicked into place.  I've always liked the desert, mostly because it's suprising and spooky.  Albuquerque is a friendly city with great food, long, broad boulevards and music pouring out of most of its orifices.  Not quite as much as New Orleans, where all that tuneage overlaps and you are never out of earshot of a brass instrument, EVER, but certainly melodic.  Even McDonald's had a country station on.    One night, we went to a huge dance club.  We don't get those "back east".  (I use quotes because here in Denver, "back east" starts in Aurora.  Yeah, go look at a map.  It's funny.)  It was the largest enclosed structure I had ever been in, and the dance floor alone was bigger than my high school's gymnasium.   People danced only in couples, even during the fast songs.  There were scores of tables and multiple well-attended bar counters inside and also several giant screen TVs showing rodeo, which I had never seen.  Seriously, more foreign than anywhere I had ever been.    There was a single live band (Denim Blue, maybe?) playing mostly newish country, which was still pretty good then.  I got asked to dance by a cute cowpoke or two, and I learned to two-step that night.  Somehow, in the right setting, the twanginess wasn't quite so grating--it just sounded like regular music.  Plus, it was a really fun time, kind of an anthropological expedition turned party.  Everybody was nice.  The liquor was cheap by east coast standards.  The band was musically good by any standard.  I had a great time.    After that, I heard the country tapes my dad picked in the car differently.  I listened to the ones I thought had been kinda funny again, and man, they were hilarious:  "Had the lit end of a cee-gar pressed against my belly / whupped m' head with a crowbar 'til my eyeball turned to jelly / Had a toothache so severe my jawbone split in twoooooo.... / But nothin's ever hurt me half as bad as losin' youuuuuu!"  That remains one of my favorites.  After that, other stuff started to appeal to me: Garth Brooks' "Rodeo," some of the old-timey-sounding stuff that came out in the 70s that my dad used to listen to when I was a kid, it all stopped sounding like country and more like regular music.  And after that happened, it was hard not to like it.    I used that same eyeball-whuppin' song to help convert Phillip.  He heard it, he liked it, and then when he heard Joe Diffy, ("Junior's in Love", "Pickup Man") he liked that a lot too, and it was all over.  Now he can't get enough of Dwight Yoakam, whose sound I would describe as next gen Bakersfield.  Kinda hard core, you ask me.  He also got to like George Jones after he found out that George Jones makes most of the rowdy rockers he grew up admiring for their badness look like a bunch of preschoolers waiting for the bus to the zoo.  And everybody likes Johnny Cash.  "But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him diiiie" indeed!  Anyway, since most country radio stations these days play a pale, bubble-gummy shadow of country music, I don't recommend them.  Find a terribly local station on the Internet to see if something grabs ya.  If you can't find anything local enough (and you may not--most of the best stations are probably not on there) and you don't have time for a long, cross-country drive looking for one, I recommend your local used record store.  Especially on the eastern seaboard, the used country CDs are going to be cheap enough to afford to buy a few things you don't end up liking.  I recommend "greatest hits" albums, or better yet, mixed-artist ones, to get a feel for stuff you might like.  Then, get more of that.  This is actually a good tip for getting a taste for just about any genre.  Root around through the "various artists" section until something looks good, A Bunch of Artists All Cover This One Guy's Great Stuff.  And sure, go ahead and buy a few albums based on goofy titles.  Country music has a pretty good sense of humor about itself.  Like many novelty songs, though, sometimes they're only one-liners, but sometimes they're well crafted too.  It's kinda hit or miss.  Beyond that, a few suggestions:  Chris Isaak can help with a sticky transition from rock to country, being sort of on the edge of the genres himself, and his stuff is bluesy, passionate and cool ("Wicked Game", "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing") however you want to label it.  Dwight Yoakam is musically terrific, ranges from rockabillyish to true country, and is sometimes pretty darned hilarious.  Johnny Cash is always fun, as previously mentioned, and everybody knows a Johnny Cash song, and of course, there's a reason why Garth Brooks outsold Elvis as a recording artist.  If you're going to go for folks who are on the radio now, I'd look for their earlier stuff.  Shania Twain's current stuff is indistinguishable from adult pop, but her older stuff is pretty cool.  I remember hearing "No One Needs to Know Right Now" and thinking it sounded very Buddy Holly influenced, both musically and in its sweetness.  I liked Dolly Parton as a kid, and I like her now, too (even though as an adult I bear a striking physical resemblance to the unfeeling "Jolene").  She has a terrific voice if you're into female vocalists at all.  Finally, there are some crossover albums out there that may help you come into the fold, albums put together by country artists and blues artists doing duets and such of familiar songs (I think I have one of them called "Rhythm Country & Blues").  Those albums are nice no matter what you like, so they're a good thing to have in your music library anyway, and then you can turn yourself on to artists on there you really liked.    Like most conversions, though, it's sort of personal and hard to say exactly what will work for someone else.  But the twang will find you if you want it to.

      The Navy is also a crappy correspondent  So a couple of postings ago, I mentioned that I had applied for a linguist job with the Navy.  This caused no small amount of consternation with some of you, until I explained that my intent was to get the Navy to pay for me to learn a bunch of languages, and then at my earliest opportunity, run off and use my skills for peaceful purposes, thus both doing good works AND screwing the military-industrial complex.  There, that's better, isn't it?  One of my very first postings, from September of 2002, mentioned the only other time I voluntarily contacted the Navy.  I called the Pacific Fleet Op Center to get the skinny on time zones in the hopes of subsequently teaching emergency broadcast equipment how to deal with them (yes, not unlike teaching a pig to sing).  That guy was delightful.  The folks in the human resources end of things, though, not so good.  They should be, because the idea of humans as a resource takes on a much more ominous implication for the military, doesn't it?  They should be really happy that people are calling them at all, and thrilled to pieces when the callers in question aren't requesting the Office of Cannon Fodder (or OCF in military parlance).    So the Navy gave me the impression that they thought I was quite the rock star, based on my resume, which, to be fair, is true.  They emailed me with a number to call for a phone interview, which I did.  However, they did not answer their phone, perhaps because they were busy determining how well another applicant could take a shark bite, and they failed to call me back ever again.  So I didn't take a job with the Navy, in part because they're only slightly better with the contact thing than the deceased whom I mention in my last posting.

      Returning to the shop  I'm going to start back at the shop on Monday, and I'm really looking forward to it.  I've taken on a great deal of paid research work over the last few weeks, and while it's fun to get paid to think, learn, analyze, and write, I've really missed the kind of problem solving I get to do as a mechanic, and the immediate tangible effect of implementing solutions.  Plus, I don't have to look "professional" or watch my language.  I imagine this is going to be my last chance to get paid to do mechanical work, maybe ever.  I hope to be able to savor it.  The money's not terrific, but it sure is good for the soul.  Maybe the thing that I'm really looking forward to most is working for my friend Matt, who is also my juggling coach (I've gotten pretty good and am currently trying to back up from the wall and maintain ball control).  He's one of very vew people I've ever met who processes information in exactly the same way I do: spatially as a tactile learner.  Learning stuff from him is almost osmotic.  He also worked next to me for six months, understood my frustration with some of the members of management, and saw the quality of my work every day.  He also has never treated me like an alien and understands that all I really wanted to do there was get to be a really great mechanic.  Now, he's the shop manager, and so far, he's really good at it.  So tomorrow I'm going to cut my fabulous long, red nails and have mechanic hands again for the next 6 or 7 months, probably for the last time ever.  I'm also going to have to come up with a strategy for being nice to Bobby, which will be a lot harder when I see him several times a week.

      Enforced Heterosexuality Day update  I sent out a bunch of e-valentines, as some of you encouraged me to do.  Amy thought hers (which included the title, "Happy Enforced Heterosexuality Day!" and encouraged her to have sex with a goat in protest) was quite hilarious.  I also got a lot of responses back, which was a lot of fun.    My favorite response came from my friend Calisse, who sent me a "love quiz" valentine in return.  It asked me a bunch of questions about her, like what color her eyes were, what her favorite animal was, and what not.  I had to guess on a few of those--her favorite color has never really come up in conversation.  Then I submitted it for grading.  I'm pleased to say that I got 100% on the Calisse Quiz.  She's a fun lady, and has a weekend job as a clown.  She makes a damn fine balloon hat, too.

      An update from the caucus trail  One thing that my role in the distance learning course has given me is a new dedication to the political process that I haven't had in a while.  I'm liking that the outcomes of the presidential race are not foregone, that it's a fight.  I miss the spectator-sport quality of Massachusetts politics, and this race is beginning to bring it to a national level.  My job also obliges me to follow it, which is a lot of fun.    In class, we've recently been talking about how the delegate-selection process changed after the 1968 convention, and how it was opened up to allow broader participation among voters.  Primaries and caucuses became a lot more important, but now the national party convention is kind of like the newsmedia's convention.  Colorado has a caucus, but it's not until mid-April.  I'll probably still go, but I can't imagine there'll be much to do there by then.  My mom, though, participated in the Maine caucuses on Sunday, and I'm posting what she had to say about it because I think it's cool.  Also entertaining is her response to me when I asked if I could post it:  "Okay, sure you can post it. Just be sure that when you do, you're  wearing a nice warm sweater, not forgetting Lincoln's birthday, and have a clean hankie."  Check!  We're good to go.  I'm also wearing clean underwear, just in case.   The Maine caucus was a hoot. Fifty or so people jammed into the mine-oot town library cum fishing license bureau. A stringer for the NYT was there, and she actually got into the next day front page coverage--town of Hope, rural folks, hardy, moose-y, the whole deal. My fab quote about the percentage-apportionment-of-votes-formulae giving us new appreciation for what delegates to the Loyajerga(sp) went through did not, alas, make it into her copy. I voted for Edwards. Most intriguing candidacy. Then, in the second round, I walked over to the Kerry corner. Final tally was (more or less) evenly split among Kerry, Kucinich(sp), and Dean. Maine as a whole went 46% for Kerry, a 20-something chunk for Dean, and gave Kucinich 16%--his best showing thusfar. Maine has an interesting primary/caucus record, having provided both Jessie Jackson and Ross Perot with victories in past years. At the Hope caucus, I restrained myself from getting up and saying that I'd been acquainted with John Kerry since the mid-seventies, watched him run unsuccessfully for Congress three times (John Nash used to feel really sorry for the guy). Worked against him in the Lt. Gov's race (remember when I wrote for Lois Pines?)--he won that one. Worked for his opponent again -- Jim Shannon -- in Kerry's first Senate race. Kerry has hit on me more than once--very polite; he wasnt married at the time--asked me out to dinner. I remember him as leader of Vietnam Vets Against the War. He wasnt always a stiff. I think he'll be fine. He was never a bad candidate, just didnt connect with people emotionally--wanted the office, but seemed a bit sorry about that he had to wade through a pesky voter-infested process to get it. He has a first-rate mind. Maybe he'll loosen up, have a good dinner once in a while, dye his hair, inject Botox, and buy a stovepipe hat.

      Enforced Heterosexuality Day approches!  My friend Amy calls Valentine's Day Enforced Heterosexuality Day.  Although I do have many gay friends who really like Valentines' Day, I nonetheless find Amy's assessment quite entertaining.  Still, various websites are currently being very aggressive with advertising about dating services and personal ads.  The ones I've seen are all straight, and I don't think that's right.  Furthermore, they're pretty gross, and I don't think that's right either.  NO, I do not want to send this goofy-looking guy a flirtatious message.  Swear to God!  Or her either, thanks for asking, you homophobic pandering agency.    There was one insipid ad I had to wait through before the content I came for would show up, and I actually had to put down my coffee and leave the room.  The goofy saps they'd been trying to hook me up with all week long all hooked up with each other.  Where to begin?!  First, I am not looking for dates / partnership / love / sex / tawdry pairings off, and to assume that I am kind of offends me somehow.  Second, all six people were dorky in their own way.  Nothing you could really put your finger on, but I found them all totally unappealing, so apparently, not only am I supposed to cheat on my husband, but I'm supposed to do it with some Internet-forsaken goof.  Third, it was like they wanted to force me to get involved in their unappealing lives by insisting that I really wanted to get in touch with these idiots.  Finally, it was apparently some kinda bait-and-switch scam because they all ended up with each other--I had no chance to begin with, which, let's face it, is just bizarre.  I actually wrote the website folks a message about that one.  It did make me think, though, about how much this culture is geared toward selling single heterosexuals crap they don't need, including each other.    If I weren't married by now, I probably wouldn't do it at all, and that is NOT sad!  I'm set in my ways and I value my own space and my privacy.  The older I get, the less I want to share my space and my inner life with new people on a constant basis.  I think the stats about women over a certain age getting married so infrequently is much more of a reflection of women really being their own people than of desperate spinsters who may never Get A Man, like that should be every woman's life goal.  Being your own person is much more important, and I think those stats are actually a pretty hopeful indicator.  The purpose of life is not to partner off like some seventh-grade kissing game, it's to use what gifts you have to create your true life, and to try to contribute something good to your world.  Me, I got married too.  In some ways, it still surprises me that that's how my life shook out.  It's so conventional, you know?  I expected to be living in a tree or something by now.  But hey, so far, so good.    Anyway, I'm entertaining ideas as to what to do for Valentine's Day / Enforced Heterosexuality Day.  I'll probably make my husband a valentine to thank him for "saving" me from "spinsterhood," and making "an honest woman" of me and "buying the cow" when he could have just "gotten the milk for free" for as long as I was willing to be some sort of sexual dairy denizen.  Or more likely, because he's cute and I like to play with stationery supplies.  Should I otherwise boycott the Hallmark holiday?  Should I send out raucous valentines to everyone I know?  Should I use the day as an excuse to send valentines to everyone who inspired me to erotic dreams and sexual fantasies this year, male AND female?  Certainly M and R and others deserve some sort of credit.  The muses got invocations, honors, and snacks.  Guys like M and R might consider a bag of Chee-tos a less puzzling tribute, though.    I still have a week and a half to sort this out.

      Once again, I'm working a pile of jobs: TA'ing for the distance learning course, teaching writing at DeVry, working at the dance studio, and the bike shop, and the occasional freelance research project.  My current plan for somehow writing a book while doing all this is to get up reeeeally early and try to get it done before I start my day.    What's on my mind the most, though, is the DeVry class.  I used to think I had been spoiled by my teaching experiences.  My first teaching job was teaching English to European high school students.  They were mature, well behaved, abnormally respectful, and rather delightful.  More recently, I taught graduate students.  They were good writers for the most part, and all smart and hardworking, making my job pretty easy and pleasant.  The distance learning course, flagship that it is, is a plumb assignment to be sure.   While I've listened to my colleagues talk about their teaching experiences, I've thought that I had just gotten lucky in my assignments.  They would tell me about students they had who didn't care, or were lousy writers, or weren't very talented, or were just sort of refusing to learn, or whatever.  They dreaded going to teach class.  I thought about how I looked forward to going into the classroom every time, that it was always sort of a highlight of my week, and how my students were engaged and for the most part, trying their best.  I thought about how my students always surprise and delight me, and I hoped my friends would have better luck.  I hoped they would have the kind of great luck I had had.    Now I'm finally teaching a course that isn't advanced, or a flagship, or European, or particularly special in any way.  It's a core curriculum writing course at a school focused on practical technical skills, and the students are regular college-aged folks from regular American backgrounds, many of them farm kids.  Yet, the students are still amazing me.  They work so hard and with all they have.  They are making such incredible speedy progress from being capable of putting an essay together to developing their own voices and really becoming *writers*, I can't believe it.  Even the students who didn't consider themselves creative before have, after three weeks, begun creating work with glimmers of terrific images and clever storytelling.  It's like magic.    I am especially knocked out by the students' dedication.  From their journal work (there is a weekly journal requirement, plus an additional assignment--these students are cranking out several pages a week.  Hey, I'm fun but I'm not easy), I'm aware that most of them are working in addition to their full courseloads, many of them at night jobs.  It's stressful for them--I can sure relate to that--but they're a lot younger than I am and they already have this stuff on their shoulders.  Not only are they somehow finding time to write, they're finding time to write really impressive stuff that shows progress on every single assignment.  On top of that, several of them have been or have begun writing their own stuff on the side, so I'm getting to read that stuff, too.  A lot of these students are going to produce publishable-quality stuff by the end of the term if this keeps up--more than half, anyway.  I'm so proud of them, I can't imagine how I'd express it in a way that wouldn't embarrass them.  If I could give them only one thing for this experience, I hope it's a creative outlet that can help them manage all that stress and remind them they're good at stuff.  One of the great benefits to me is that in teaching writing, it puts writing on my mind.  It makes me think about my technique and process.  It helps me focus on my dissertation and getting down to business.  When I tell them that they can do this, I remind myself that I can do it.  In teaching anything, you find out how much you really know about it.  It's a cliche that teaching is really a learning experience, but it's hard to capture that feeling of surprise and delight you get when you feel like you're introducing students to something they will enjoy and use, and somehow, you feel like you're still the one benefitting from it.  So I guess I've gotten lucky again.  Either I love teaching so much that I stand a pretty good chance of having a good experience most of the time, or I am chronically lucky with my classes.  Either way, I figure I can expect to continue having a great time.

      Brief birthday update:  1.  Got wrecked on the drynx and snax plan, never did make it out to hit the town.  My friend Jeani makes the best margaritas ever, and she is extremely generous with them.   2.  Attempted film festival, but it was probably a little too short notice, so it was sparsely attended.  Not that THAT affects whether or not I had a good time, and let's face it, that's the index of whether or not an event I attended was a success.  It was.  The de facto theme ended up being Jackie Chan movies, of which we own several. 3. On The Day Of, I had cake for breakfast, gave the final exam, went to the Botanic Gardens afterward, then teatime at St. Mark's (a great little coffee shop at 17th and Race), and then I made my way over to Le Central, my favorite local restaurant.  The bus I got on to take me the last leg of that particular journey also carried Phillip, which was a delightful (unplanned) surprise.  We had a great meal courtesy of my mother, then retired to Pints Pub, where we met up with several of my friends for scotch and heated socialist debate. 4. The following Saturday was Cheap Fun Day, featuring museums and good cheap eats.  Phillip wasn't working on the Saturday after my birthday for the first time in years, so he was able to join in the Cheap Fun, which was in itself a treat.  We also got the Megmobile back the day before as an added bonus.  The Museum of Science and Nature had an exhibit on loan from the Yale Peabody Museum (where I spent many a delighted hour as a kid and from which I somewhere have souvenirs including a dessicated blowfish) about Machu Picchu.  We also saw the Imax film, "Coral Reef," which was a bit preachy but otherwise quite spectacular.  This was especially satisfying to me, because as many of you know, the Incas were a favorite topic of mine while I was working on my master's degree; and I will always stop channel flipping to watch an underwater show.    So all in all, a good annual 29th.

      So a week from today, I'm turning 33, otherwise known as my 5th Annual 29th Birthday.  I like to make a big deal out of birthdays.  I know when Millard Fillmore's birthday is, as well as the birthday of gerrymandering, although I suppose that's more of an anniversary.  Usually, by this time, I Have A Plan.  The last few years, I've had a day of cheap fun planned (art museum on free day, miniature golf, tea and treats, that kind of thing).  I submit an itinerary to my local friends and they just show up where they can--it's like a surprise party at every stop.  This year, though, I've had a really stupid February in so many ways that I am just not my usual organized self.  So I'm trying to come up with good, cheap, fun ideas.  Cheap fun day this weekend?  Next weekend?  Both?  Getting wrecked in between?  Going out dancing or something?  Video film festival?  My agenda includes cake and ice cream, but also scotch and cigars.  On the day itself, I have to give a final exam, so I won't have the WHOLE day, but I will have all the rest of it.  I plan to go to the Botanic Gardens in the morning.  I started doing that a few years ago and it's a cool birthday contemplation thing that I really enjoy.  I'd like to have afternoon tea.  I'd like to have a nice dinner, but I don't care if it's at an actual restaurant or not.  Also, I get wrecked maybe once or twice a year, and my birthday is a good occasion for that, so somewhere in here, that might be nice, too.  Plus, that's some cheap fun right there: I can get pretty wrecked on a mere $10 - 15, and I am highly entertaining liquored up by all accounts.  Mostly, there are a couple dozen folks I'd like to spend time with if I can--that's sort of more important to me even than doing specific stuff.  So far, I've had the following suggestions: 1. Yes, let's get wrecked, preferrably this weekend.  2. Come over to my place and we'll have a few drinks and snax and then hit the town.  3.  Cheap fun day both this weekend AND next weekend, and get wrecked in between.  I've vowed to do the 3 best ideas I get by tomorrow night.

      With her battered old suitcase in hand, she looked for the bungalow number that matched the key in her hand.  Bungalow 2 was set far apart from its siblings, a pariah among outbuildings.  What must have been Bungalow 1 lay scattered nearby.  She smiled.  Nothing dies of old age in the desert, not even motel bungalows.  With some persistent wrenching and jiggling, she coaxed the door open.  The bungalow was a pleasant, free-standing cell, about 10 x 12, with mistmatched linens on the bed and what could only be called Motel Art on the walls.  In one, a dewy-eyed bunny contemplated a shaft of light among four-petaled cartoonish flowers and a fallen hollow tree.  In the other, a bowl of either fruit or lumpy billiard balls threatened to spill out of a terra cotta bowl.  Cezanne would have lost his technicolor lunch, she thought.  She set down the suitcase near a once-yellow particle board rococo nightstand and headed back toward the bar.  Both her hostess and her favorite male companion, Jose, had invited her, after all.  The bar was surprisingly cheery, with country plaid curtains, the occasional blue cloth flower poking out of the occasional plastic earthenware bud vase, and rather good lighting.  She ordered a shot of Jose and massaged her stiff right knee after sidling up onto a barstool.  Half a dozen patrons were strewn about the room in much the same way their cars had been outside.  For a few moments, she tried to match the patron to the vehicle, but got stuck and gave up, turning her attention to the salt shaker, lemon and shooter in front of her.  Was it really important who belonged to the motorcycle?  At the other end of the bar was a very young man.  He looked down into his drink, slouched slightly forward and occasionally looking around without actually raising his head.  Underage, she thought, and shy, inexperienced.  A half-smile pulled at one corner of her mouth.  Yeah, that was about to change.  As he self-consciously got up to inspect the jukebox, she took the opportunity to stare at him.  He had short blond hair, dark blue eyes, and the beginnings of a fresh sunburn.  Freckled shoulders, she imagined.  Somehow the taste of freckles on a man's shoulders was just irresistable, salty-sweet and somehow wholesome, like the scent of fresh mowed grass.  His were broad enough to suggest strength, even if they hadn't reached their final adult angles yet.  He was tall, maybe just over six feet, and nicely put together, with the kind of delicate ears that she knew would be sensitive and fun to lick.  The way his pleated khakis sat low on his hips gave her a good feel for the flat of his side, taut and limber, and perhaps not quite defined.  She could think of nothing else but getting a pint of Jose (Jose was understanding about these things--they had an open relationship), and licking her pre-shot salt off that sweet sinew.  She eyed him hungrily from her perch as he made a song selection, something she had maybe heard coming out of a record store door, but nothing she would know.  It probably wasn't ethical, she thought, and it was at best barely legal, but she slid off her high duct-taped perch and spread her wings like any other bird of prey.  Making eye contact with the bartender, she gestured toward where the veal chop of a man had been sitting with a sideways nod, picked up her salt shaker, and moved down there.  The bartender smiled and shook her head, momentarily casting her eyes heavenward.  She smiled back, smugly, and sat on the stool next to the one where he had draped his black leather coat.  Perhaps he belonged to the motorcycle with the sandblasted blue gas tank.  As he moved back toward his seat, he only made eye contact with her for a moment at a time, prefering to look down, as if he had never seen his feet before, or didn't remember how to walk.  She ordered another shooter and steadily watched him approach.

      Interjection of an update:  Some of you have been asking about how it's going at the bike shop.  It's going well enough,  and I'm enjoying working with my hands again.  More of you have been asking how it's going trying to be nice to Bobby.  There have been a few tense moments, such as the one where he was telling a group of people, including me, about having gotten a massage with lavendar that morning.  Jesus, what am I, made of stone?  It was almost painful to let that one slide, but I did it.  I'm holding up.

      Oh, now she's gone And I'm out with a friend with lips full of passion Black coffee in bed  From the lips without passion to the lips with a kiss, There's nothing of your love that I'll ever miss...  She let the clutch out slowly as she reached crusing speed, and sang out loud to the desert.  A few miles later, a sodium light flicker popped up from behind a yucca patch, their leaves stabbing up through the sign announcing a vacancy at the Desert View Inn.  It wasn't quite dark yet, but the sun was gone.  The shimmer across the road was likely a reflection of sodium bulbs in alkali flat--was that the Desert View?  She was tired enough to stop, and the Desert View's coyly winking sign offered anonymity and a quiet bed, but as she drew closer, the small red unwavering "BAR" sign tipped the scales in its favor.  She began to downshift.  The parking lot of the Desert View Inn might have been its front yard, or merely its setback from the road.  Several vehicles lay there, at different careless angles, none of them less than a dozen years old.  A faded blue gutshot Buick.  A primer-colored Lincoln with an orange fender.  A few trucks, two or three crossbred motorcycles.  Maybe you could guess by how much of the desert had blown onto the windshields how long each had been sitting, how many rounds each driver had gone through.  Saturday night at the Desert View Inn.    She killed the engine and the headlights.  The stunning silence of the desert assaulted her ears, and she smiled.  The deep muffling sand swallowed everything.  She sat a few minutes and watched it swallow up the last of the lingering indigo bruise in the western sky.  She took a deep breath, let her shoulders drop as she watched the purple pinholed sky, and sighed.  Jose was nearly empty, but he would not need to be replaced until tomorrow.    An orange flickering sign announced the way to the oice, both F's burned out.  Inside, the counter was just in front of a wide doorway that led behind the bar.  The bartender, a doughy bottle blonde with her hair in a tufted ponytail gave a cheerful "Evenin'!" as she trundled through the doorway, pulling her hand along the one gray spot on the otherwise white wall.    "Evenin'," she replied with a polite smile.  "Single room for the night?"    "You betcha!" sang her hostess.  "You've got your pick of the rooms tonight, hon, nobody else has checked in yet.  Once you get squared away, why don'tcha come join us?"  "Sure.  I'd like a quiet room.  Something on the end, maybe?"    "We got the bungalows out back," the desk clerk-bartender-social director offered.  "They're nothing but end!"  "Great," she said.    "Near or far?"  "Far.  I don't have much luggage."

      The shot glass had gotten warm in her hand.  Once it was cool and smooth, offering agave obliteration.  Now it had warmed up to her and it was just another toy.  She spun it, batted it around on the bar, asked for another.  This one was finished.    The convertible offered so many possible recesses for holding pints and half-pints of Jose Cuervo, the only man she could count on, the only man she needed.  Dusty from driving all day and a little stiff in the right knee, she craned her graceful neck toward the next rill on the gunbarrel highway looking for a glimmer of busted neon glow announcing a cheap bed.  Nothing but desert, dusk falling in veils of translucent color, pink through blue to purple, aggressive early stars.    Back in the 'vert, Jose greeted her from the driver's side map pocket.  "My man!" she sang out as she uncapped him.  She took a deep pull, dabbed at the corners of her mouth with the back of her wrist, and put him away again.  Always there when you need him, never hanging on you when you don't.  Good old Jose.  She started the 'vert and got back on the road.  The tape deck spat out "Black Coffee in Bed"--perfect.  The hum of highway under fast and aimless wheels loosened her shoulders while Jose caressed the bare calf of her idle clutch leg.  Yeah, maybe tonight she was ready.

      I'll get back to the story in a minute, but first, I have a few items I want to get off my chest.  Oh yes, it's RANT TIME!!!  For one thing, Bobby knows I'm working hard at being nice to him (so far, so good), and he's beginning to bait me.  The other day he told me his housemates let his dog in while he wasn't home, and the dog tore up the bed and chewed up a book.  What am I, made of stone?!  I can't believe I didn't say, "Hey,  some body's gotta tear up your bed," or offer my sympathies in the loss of his only book.  I didn't even say, "So, I guess that's it for  Hop on Pop , eh?"  But man, did it HURT!  AND, I vaguely know this guy from the chaos society I belong to who is coming to Denver.  He apparently wants me to help him with some stuff, but hell if he will tell me what that stuff is.  He's giving a lecture, but I can't get him to tell me what he wants me to do about that.  Now he apparently also wants to talk to some people about setting up independent research institutes, or about his work some more, sometime around the 10th or 11th of June, but hell if he will tell me what that might look like: who he wants to come, what kind of venue he wants, what he'd like to talk about, or again, what he wants me to DO about it, for the luvva mike!  I don't even have time to question the guy, much less set up a conference.  But  does  he want me to set something like that up?  Does he want me to put him in touch with someone?  Does he want to spitball ideas?  I don't fucking know!  But whatever it is, I am apparently not doing it because he keeps emailing me about his vague availability!  Makes me want to send him to those people who chant for things they want.  Maybe if he just chants, it will happen for him.  Maybe I'll chant too, just to help him along: WHATDOYOUWANTFROMMEEEEEE!?!?!?!?!?!  THEN, just when I need my rantspace the most, Blogger goes and changes up their whole deal on me.  I require certain tools and formatting stuff (can I just say those stupid formatting buttons up there don't actually do DICK!?) and they appear to have left the building with all the haste and abandon of George W. Bush exiting an ethics conference.  Not being able to get it to work, and not being able to get any answers as to why, I emailed tech support.  I waited six days for this dopey "we're moving on--join us!" message.  Well, as far as I'm concerned, making me open multiple windows, log on multiple times, and toggle back and forth between them is a step BACK, not a step forward!  It is NOT a streamlining!  It is--  whatever the hell the opposite of streamlining is!  The fucking  opposite !  Destreamlineifying!  Roadblocking!  You know, pissing me OFF!  Furthermore, DeVry recently required me to waste a bunch of my time on this online instructor training thing.  I thought it would be about how to use their in-house software to manage courses, and some of it was, and that was pretty much okay.  But the rest of it was CRAP!  Now, I understand why they do that.  It is DeVry's policy to hire people who are expert in their fields and then expect them to teach about it, which, according to the students, doesn't work so well.  Teaching is a whole separate skill, after all, and it can't be taught in a brief orientation and several hours of online hoop-jumping.  Furthermore, my credentials were reviewed, I was interviewed, I had to give references, including TRANSCRIPTS fa' chrissake--who gives a rat's ass about my frickin'  transcripts ?!--I was evaluated by my class, observed and evaluated by my dean... You'd think after all this surveillance, they would pretty much know who is a good teacher and who needs help.  But everybody is supposed to go through this bullshit, and I agreed to do it because I believed it was a condition of employment.  I just can't help thinking that if they were that worried about my teaching credentials, I really shouldn't have been hired.  Several hours of my online time that I could have been doing something meaningful like looking at porn, GONE!  Stupid linear experience of time.  And I'm not even talking about my frickin' dissertation committee... but I do feel better.

      I'll get back to the story in a minute, but first, I have a few items I want to get off my chest.  Oh yes, it's RANT TIME!!!  For one thing, Bobby knows I'm working hard at being nice to him (so far, so good), and he's beginning to bait me.  The other day he told me his housemates let his dog in while he wasn't home, and the dog tore up the bed and chewed up a book.  What am I, made of stone?!  I can't believe I didn't say, "Hey,  some body's gotta tear up your bed," or offer my sympathies in the loss of his only book.  I didn't even say, "So, I guess that's it for  Hop on Pop , eh?"  But man, did it HURT!  AND, I vaguely know this guy from the chaos society I belong to who is coming to Denver.  He apparently wants me to help him with some stuff, but hell if he will tell me what that stuff is.  He's giving a lecture, but I can't get him to tell me what he wants me to do about that.  Now he apparently also wants to talk to some people about setting up independent research institutes, or about his work some more, sometime around the 10th or 11th of June, but hell if he will tell me what that might look like: who he wants to come, what kind of venue he wants, what he'd like to talk about, or again, what he wants me to DO about it, for the luvva mike!

      She could see his indecision as he reached his former spot and tried to figure out whether to stay.  She smiled softly and looked down at her hands, just as Jose arrived.    "Thanks," she said to the bardtender.  Gesturing toward the evening's acquisition, she added, "and another for--?"  "Seth," he filled in.  "Fine," said the bartender, echoing business dinners and quarrels with mothers, then turned on her heel and briskly moved away as if she hovered rather than walked.    She shuddered a little as she watched the bartender retreat.  That kind of gait always reminded her of nuns, and her head was all too teeming with impure thoughts--there was no room for Sister Mary Catherine in tiny, mismatched Bungalow 2 tonight.  "Seth," she repeated as she pulled her gaze away from the bartender's brassy wimple.  "Nice to meet you."  She extended her hand and he shook it, a rough honest hand with a finish of slightly trembling fingertips.  For the next round, he joined her in a menage a trois with Jose.  After the following one, she tentatively placed her hand on the inner surface of his closest knee, looking up into his eyes with practiced shyness.  He tensed a little, looked at her hand there, blinked twice, then gently placed his hand over hers, as if he might frighten her away if he weren't absolutely careful.  She smiled.  "I have more of this stuff in my room," she mentioned as casually as she could manage.  "Care to join me?"  The battered suitcase in Bungalow 2 contained a few changes of clothes, maybe two and a half outfits' worth, plus socks, underwear, toothbrush, and two fifths of Jose.  Why travel alone?  She hadn't bothered with the mess of packing salt and lemons.  The suitcase itself usually sat in the trunk of the vert, ready in case she needed to go somewhere.  Two days ago, when she got in and started driving, she certainly needed to go somewhere and was glad not to have to think about packing or look at her things in their drawers at home.  Later.  She poured a generous shot of Jose in each of two styrofoam coffee cups and passed one to Seth.  She set hers down under the disapproving dewy eyes of the bunny and stepped close to him, placing that same lucky hand on his chest.  She sighed slightly as he kissed her, savoring the barely awkward novelty of new kiss.  Was there anything in the world so luscious?  Yes, she concluded as she began to run her hands down his body.  Oh, yes there was.

      Hey, what the hell happened to the storyline?  Well, gentle reader, Blogger, the tool I use to publish this and my other blogs, changed its formatting.  A lot.  I've been attempting to write something good for several days now, but I'm distracted by the logistical problems I'm experiencing with the new version.  I'm trying to find out how I can best supplant, ignore, or learn to live with them.  In the meantime, I find it hard to write.  Anything.  But I'll do my best...

      Okay, I've been getting a lot of interest about my last few postings, mostly along the lines of, "What are you doing?  I like it."  Well, folks, in making my students write at least a few times a week, I'm aware that I'm both missing my own fiction writing, which brought me a lot of pleasure and occasional recognition, and that if I'm making them do it, it's good for me to do it from time to time, too (not because of some sort of weird sense of fairness--pah!--but because of the insights into teaching other people how to do it that you can sort of only get by doing it yourself.  So I'm writing a sort of serial short story.  I don't know how long it is yet, or what's going to happen next.  I'm as surprised as you are by each successive posting.  But I am following the Raymond Chandler school of writing: if *something* doesn't happen on a given page, throw that page away and write it again.  I only get about one shot a week to write something, so this is how I'm using it at the moment.    I'm also getting a few sex column questions from new folks flipping through the archives for the first time.  (Remember that?)  So if you have a juicy question, send it along: mspohn@du.edu and I'll see if I can't get to it soon.  I'd like to do roughly three per column, so multiples are okay, too.  And now, back to the Desert View Inn...

      She was back on the road a little after sunrise, after saying an affectionate goodbye to the luscious, sleepy-eyed Seth.  She had to make Reno by afternoon, she said, and was gone with his scent still on her hands.  The 'vert sang along beneath her, as if it were just as happy to be there as he had been.  About 20 miles into the drive, the streaming road began to sputter tiny houses alongside it, mostly bright white ones, almost seeming to be their own sources of light.  The houses consolidated somewhat, and organized into a small town.  She found a white stucco building not much bigger than Bungalow 2 with a Tecate sign in the oversized window that overwhelmed it, and restocked Jose.    A handsome creature, fortyish, with rugged features, a slightly greying mustache, and a flannel shirt wearing at the collar and elbows, looked her over as she came in the door.  She smiled and glanced away.  Clearly he was the local operator, and she didn't like them too smooth.  Alan was smooth now.  He had been awkward and sweet when she met him, shy about looking at her or talking to her, often looking at his beautiful, perfect hands.  She thought it was adorable.  Now he argued like Socrates, glaring right at her, full of evidence and high sentence, having completely forgotten that he had hands at all.  Smooth was entirely unappealing.  She asked for a fifth and two half-pints of Jose, and Mr. Smooth reached back behind himself and pulled them down for her without taking his eyes off her.  Flattering, perhaps, but much too steady.  She handed over two 20s and pulled her hand away before he could "accidentally" brush her fingers.  He gave her her change and placed the bottles in a brown paper sack, still not watching what he was doing.  Beginning to feel like an antelope haunch, she looked past his well-built shoulder and caught a glimpse of the stockboy, shirt off, in a pair of not-quite-snug jeans with a telltale band of boxer brief just barely peeking out of the waistband.  She watched him for a few seconds and let him catch her at it.  She smiled, looked him over, and left, tossing an afterthought of, "Thanks," toward Mr. Smooth.    In the parking lot, she tucked the fifth and one of the half-pints into the suitcase, and dropped the other half-pint in the map pocket that would sit next to her calf.  As she perched on the seat, car door open, she could see the stockboy watching her from the open back door.  She slowly pulled her long, mostly bare legs into the car, smoothed the left calf as if it were covered with a fine, slighly rumpled, organza, closed the door, and fired up the 'vert.  Just as she pulled away, she took one more look, up and down, and blew him a kiss.  He half waved, but mostly blushed.  She grinned for the next several miles, and got started on the half-pint.

      This just in...  I've gotten several queries about life at the bike shop.  As anticipated, the shop as run by Matt is a great place to work.  He has that rare combintation of being supportive of his staff while at the same time being rather hands-off as a manager.  It makes one feel as if one's boss trusts one's work.  I know, just imagine!  Currenly none of the reservations I had about going back to the shop have panned out.  I'm being treated like everyone else and I'm able to use and expand my skills, just like I always wanted.  So the short answer is that it's going really well.  And now, a brief rant:  In other news, Ronald Reagan is still dead!  Seriously, when the hell is  that  news cycle going to be over?!  There are two, no, THREE things I really resent about this.    One, the media is talking about Reagan as if everyone loved him and he was just the greatest president we ever had, as opposed to the reality of having been the asshole who institutionalized greed and scared the hell out of anyone with the capacity for critical thought.  Furthermore, he did NOT end the Cold War singlehandedly!  Nobody did.  However, if any one human being deserves the credit for this, it's Misha Gorbachev.  Last I checked, seizing the credit for something you didn't do is a serious impediment to being a good person.  The national amnesia right now is astounding.  Two, one awful dead man completely eclipsed two unbelievably important events: the death of REAL American hero Ray Charles, and of course D-Day.  Ray Charles wasn't just an unbelievably cool cat.  He wasn't just an incredible musician who overcame real adversity to become wildly successful.  He has influenced just about every soul/rock/blues and sometimes even country musician who came after him.  And who could forget his duet with Kermit the Frog?  He lent a whole new dimension to "It's Not Easy Being Green" while still keeping it playful.  Why don't we get a week and a half about Ray Charles?  Huh?  WHY?!  Where's  his  state funeral?  I would argue Ray Charles' life is the stuff of the American Dream, and he stayed happy, humble and kind his whole, hard life.  His accomplishments were monumental, his struggles uplifting, and he never took credit for anything he didn't do.  How is Ray Charles not a national treasure?  Fortunately, his spirit so permeates American music that he lives on, even if his consciousness is bookended by recent events.  And D-Day!  Can you believe it?!  At a time when America has started DOING the very things that we used to fight to FREE people from, we have a proud moment in American history to observe... except we don't get the observation we should have.  Some things are worth the cost of human life: stopping real evil, freeing enslaved people, defending against direct attack...  Was Òhalting the spread of communismÓ in a tiny agrarian country 10,000 miles away?  Is Òfighting terrorismÓ in some nebulous way?  Is occupying Iraq?  People and governments have behaved dishonorably in war since there have been governments and wars, but surely there is a giant moral chasm between occupying a faraway third-world country in which we have no interest but oil; and combining division-sized forces with other nations to land on several beaches on a single fateful day in the fervent, shared hope of snatching the world from the powerful jaws of fascism and genocide.  My grandfather was proud to have fought at Omaha Beach.  IÕm sure he was scared, but I understand he felt like part of something larger and important and right.  My friends who have served in Iraq take pride in having served their country, but are still somehow uneasy, as if they are not quite sure if they did the right thing.  Was there ever a time we might be better served by the lessons of D-Day than this very year?    Reagan is partly responsible for putting us on this path to begin with: institutionalizing greed, deepening our dependence on foreign oil (totally ignoring the lessons of just a few years earlier when the oil crisis crippled the country), and starting off the Bush legacy, now more disturbing by the day.  How ironic that his death overshadowed the observance of true American patriotism when his administration also wrapped itself in the flag while doing some very questionable things and ignoring the consequences.  Carter is now the loudest ethical blip on the presidential timeline of this country since Kennedy was shot.  How do you like them apples, America?  Now will you please either vote well or take the streets already?!  Sheesh!  Third, I don't want to see some stupid backward-booted horse or some lameass military flyby, each shown dozens of times a day, for that attention hog (well, at least until Iran-Contra--then he was conspicuously absent from the screen...), and I resent that there is so little else available from the media, even a week or so after the actual death in question.  One of the many events being eclipsed by this, this intelligence-insulting deathfluff, is my fellow Americans' heavy protesting at the G-8 conference in Georgia.  I have a very dear friend who is there right now, risking life and limb to be a voice for social and economic justice.  A few nights ago, he was obliged to get four stitches in his head after a cop hit him with a state-issued blunt instrument, breaking his lacrosse helmet and declaring him to be a homojewboyniggerlover (my friend had responded to this honkycrackerredneck hatespeech by blowing said cop an inflammatory smooch).  How DARE the media subject me to one more INSTANT of Reagan-related saccharine lies while good, unarmed Americans are being publicly beaten in response to exercizing OUR CONSTITUTIONALLY-GUARANTEED RIGHT to peaceable assembly?!  Either put that f*cker in the damn ground and let's try to forget about him already, or stuff him and stick him under glass like Lenin (or a roast pheasant) and let everyone who gives such a tearful rat's ass file by at their leisure.  I want some measure of media programming back, or barring that, effusive coverage of the deeply felt loss of Ray Charles.  As it was, I watched my DVD of The Blues Brothers today.  Thank you, Ray, for the music.    Finally, there is a part of Plato's  Republic  that I always find incredibly moving, and I can't say exactly why.  For those of you not familiar with this work, I highly recommend it.  It's a 2500-year-old justice rant, and it still carries a lot of currency.  At the very end, Socrates is describing what happens to the souls of the dead as they pass through the Elysian fields and choose their next lives.  Odysseus, warrior, lover, and action hero, chooses the life of an ordinary man.  He could have been anything, anyone, with that high lottery number, and he just wanted to have a quiet life minding his own business.    It also makes me wonder about the lives the recently dead may be choosing.  Might Ray Charles choose the life of music teacher to the world again?  Or perhaps that of an obscure painter?  Or of a quiet frog herder who minds his own business?  If Ronald Reagan is not honoring my decades-old request to rot in hell, perhaps he is choosing the life of a beauty queen, soulless but looked on with adoration for a few short years.  Or perhaps he is choosing to improve his soul with the challenge of the life of a true patriot, sacrificing his own blood at the hands of a corrupt state that has forgotten its mandate to receive and protect all homos, jewboys and nigger lovers, and instead serves only its wealthiest clients.  If he does, perhaps he can begin to atone for some of the damage he did the last time around.  The truth is, money pools at the top.  Only justice trickles down.  Be safe, Dan, in working to pry open the floodgates.  And now back to our regularly scheduled program...

      2:32 found her standing at the window of Bungalow 2.  The moon, the giant desert moon, was reflected by something in the sand.  The desert floor twinkled as if it were placid water.  Inside the bungalow, everything was blue and grey and black.  She looked down at her bluish arms and turned suddenly as Seth stirred behind her in the bed.  He was beautiful as he slept, she thought.  It gave her a little twinge to think of leaving him.  At home, Alan would be moved out by now.  Most of their apartment had been his, and he would have taken every living thing: the fish, the cat, the plants.  The red velveteen garage sale couch might still be there.  They had bought it together, but Alan didn't like it anymore.  He had wanted to replace it with a hard antique leather one.  Her clothes would still be there of course, and her pictures.    She had a wall's worth of images of American landscape icons: the Grand Canyon, The Las Vegas strip, a Key West sunset.  She picked the best shot from each trip she took and put in on the wall in a plain glass frame.  The wall used to be in the living room, but after Alan asked about her trips he wanted the pictures in the dining room instead.  They hardly used the dining room, but she started to drink her coffee in there in the morning.  The last two weeks, she had been looking at her pictures a lot.   Outside, the desert sky teemed with stars.  As she sat on the edge of the bed and looked down at her pale blue thighs, she couldn't see the moon through the window anymore, but the same bluish-grey light shone all over the room.  She leaned over and brushed Seth's shoulder with her lips.  Maybe he was a light sleeper.  He murmured softly and the sheet slid away as he rolled toward her onto his back.  For a moment, she just sat there, the enchanting starlight saturating them both.  Pulling back the sheet the rest of the way, she kissed that one spot she found so delicious, the flat of his lower belly just over his right hip.  She would only have a few more hours to explore this luscious beauty and wanted desperately to make them count.

      Afternoon and Reno came and went like casual slot machine quarters.  Gas stations, diners, convenience stores, they had all started to run together.  Was the bony 20-ish waitress with the fading Ronald McDonald Red hair and multiple face piercings in a diner or a truck stop?  Off which highway?  As the clear edges of recollection melted and pooled together, she began to breathe more deeply, and her shoulders began to relax and drop.  Her right knee, slightly stiff from driving for days, had risen to the challenge and no longer ached.  Her shoulders felt warm and tan.  She could start back soon.    The approaching sunset promised orange and gold on a purpling backdrop.  She turned west so she could watch it while she drove.  The highway narrowed into two lanes, then a small, barely paved road into the scrub, and finally gave into dirt track in a surprisingly gradual fashion, ending at the edge of an arroyo.  She stopped the car and got out, still looking west, the eastern sky stretching a purple blanket of stars toward the western horizon.  She got a faded red sweatshirt out of the trunk of the 'vert and sat on its warm hood, heels on the front bumper.  With the falling temperature, she knew the hood would soon be covered with a fine coat of droplets.  The air was dry and still, as if the wind held its breath in anticipation of the last sliver of fireball sun's descent.  The sweatshirt had been Dale's, and it was long on her in every possible direction.  Dale had faded and softened in her mind as the sweatshirt had on her body.  Now he was just big and sweet and pretty, standing in the doorway in mismatched socks and rumpled boxers with his dark wavy hair all sticking up at crazy angles, and that lopsided grin.  He had understood about the pictures, and even drove to Philadelphia with her one time.  In the end, though, she hadn't needed him desperately enough.  She wouldn't have been crushed, or dead, or worse, without him, and it seemed he couldn't quite live with that.  She loved him enough, but she was somehow too... regenerative, perhaps, as if she could slip off into the desert and regrow a lost limb.  She spread her arms out in the faded red sweatshirt like a road-dusted starfish and stretched.  After watching the stars for a while, she got in the vert, pulled the top up, and slept.

      Yikes, I have been really remiss of late.  Sorry about that.  I've been spending most of my blogging time and energy on the new team blog.  You may be asking yourself, what does a foxy chaoticist mama  do  on a Saturday evening?  Apparently, the answer is: blog.  So here's what's on my mind right now.  Driving home from the shop this evening, I saw something in the road that appeared to be moving.  95% of the time, things in the road here are not roadkill, but merely odd discarded items.  Denver is very clean, so trash never hangs around long or anything.  As I drew closer, I realized that what was dancing about in the road was a paperback book of some sort, a big bulky novel or something: smallish, thick, pulpy pages.    This of course made me wonder about the circumstances under which it came to be there.  Did a dissatisfied reader (presumably in a passenger seat, although you never can tell with some of the inattentive crappy driving that goes on around here) cry out, "This is pure drivel!  Drivel, I tell you!" and fling it out of the window of a moving vehicle?  "Enough heaving bosoms for me--I require a PLOT!", like that?  Did someone lay their paperback on top of the roof of their car, only to forget about it and have it fly off on Santa Fe Drive?  Did it merely fall out of a pedestrian's bag?  Pah-hah-ha!  What am I thinking?  Nobody walks in Denver.  Did the paperback in question take flight in a windy back seat?  Did it fall off one of the many literary "trucks" from which Lisa and I used to occasionally "find" reading material?  Did it somehow make an escape from a nearby building and strategically buffet itself to that location, only to be stranded in the middle of the busy road it was attempting to cross?  Did it fall through a dimensional portal, plunk, into this universe, and that was just where it landed?  I think it would be fun to explore each of these scenarios, or to use it as a future writing exercise/project: an ordinary object in an unlikely place.  I bet Lisa's got a good idea about it...

      So today I'm home because I'm sick.  I feel a little bit guilty about it, because I changed my schedule around at Matt's request so I could cover someone else's shift.  But if I went into the shop today, I'd do a lousy job because I feel terrible, plus I'd get everyone else sick, so I'm trying to tell myself that one day of the shop being really short-handed is better than it being short-handed for a week or two because I didn't stay home and got everyone sick.    I'm going to take a nap shortly, but right now I'm sort of enjoying having the downtime.  I'm almost relieved to be sick.  I can catch up on some stuff.  One thing I didn't blow off today, sick or not, was voting.  Colorado had its primary today, and I could be on my friggin'  deathbed  and still vote.  I'd call up my favorite candidate's headquarters and ask for someone to come give my dying ass a ride to the polls.  I don't even care that only a few offices are even contested between Democratic candidates at this point.  Like the sticker on my shirt says, "I Voted!"  I'm pleased to see that Colorado seems to be waking up a bit politically.  I saw a fair amount of streetcorner campaign sign waving over the last few weeks.  No one at the polls in my neighborhood, though.  I miss the hustle and bustle of Election Day in Massachusetts.  You'd have to wade through a veritable papa-razzi-like THRONG of vote pleaders.  Please consider my candidate.  You'd almost have to elbow past them on the red carpet area there, because YOU, the VOTER, are the STAR of the day.    My students in my Critical Thinking and Problem Solving class are curious about politics, too.  They've been asking me a lot of questions, some of which are rather complicated and sophisticated, which is really cool.  Fortunately, I'm one of, like, a hundred people in this time zone who knows the answers.  What I'm learning from them, though, is that history and civics courses are all but dead in the American high school, which is just about the shittiest thing that could possibly happen.  There is NO FUCKING EXCUSE for any person of voting age in the United States of America not to understand the Electoral College, and probably about 90% of my undergraduate class didn't.  Not that I'm blaming them--it's not their fault they weren't properly taught, and they have no control AT ALL over their high school curriculum in any case.    Lack of understanding of the democratic process is a disaster of Hindenberg-esque proportions.  There are terribly few younger folks in public office these days, and you know what that means: a sharp decline in quality of our leadership with WAY less competition.  It does make me think about running for office, though.  Phillip keeps saying, "A couple of Somerville ward bosses and we'd have this whole state wrapped up."  I've been to Democratic party events in Colorado.  I'd have to agree.
