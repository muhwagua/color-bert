      I should really write in this at night, instead of here at work. Problem is I can't find time to write at night. I'm too sleepy and am really tired of thinking. School and work will do that too you. Grr...oh well. I get to go see Ferrick tonight. That's all way exciting. Problem is I won't see Ferrick friends there and well, Lauren will be there and not that Lauren is a bad person, she's just not my favorite person to go to a Ferrick concert with. I'm supposed to go see Catie Curtis with her too, I'm almost hoping she backs out and I have to find someone to take the ticket. Perhaps I'll have a better time. No, that's a really bad way to think of things. Think of the evening like that and it will be bad. Ugh...ok well, I'm going to go find Mark now, so I can get some work done before Ellen shows up. Grrr...Ellen...

      Ok so I finally have a phone. That's always nice. Not necessesarily beacuse I need to call anyone, but because I'm an internet junky.  Not that you didn't know that already, seeing as though I have a web journal. ;-) Concentric doesn' t have a local access number for where I am in Cleveland. I was forced to steal an AOL disk from my neighbors mailbox (it had been there for 3 days, I swear) and sign up for my 3 free months. That will take me till the end of November. Hopefully I can sign up with Juno or Netzero for the rest of November and December. God that seems so far away. Living alone really isn't all it's cracked up to be. I miss Abby, but even more than that I miss the idea that there is someone who would notice if I never came home, or never left for that matter. There's no one to talk to, no one to cook dinner with, for or for you. I can even go as far to say there's no one to be annoyed with. At least that makes life interesting. Ugh...I have what's going to become a very nasty cold. At this point it's just the runny nose, but I can feel the sore throat and the coughing coming on. Ick. I hate being sick. I think I'm going to go ahead and leave work a bit early. Only by like 15 min and you know what, I plain old don't feel good. I need to drive out to CSU though. Get my book and in general figure out where the place is and about how long it takes to get there. Should be fun. Right.

      Ick...I've been neglecting this haven't I. I really shouldn't be typing this at work. I will get a phone in my new apartment by Wed. I'll catch things up then....or at least that's the plan...

      Ugh...I still have one more final to go. My Circuits exam didn't go as well as I expected. I'm pretty sure that's a bad thing. But oh well, it's over now. Reno is no longer coming to visit. Not at all surprised. I've learned to not count on her to follow through on anything. At least she gave us more warning than usual. Perhaps that's a sign of improvement. I officially came out to Janice and Carolyn. I'm making Carolyn a CD as we speak, as something special for that dumb silver ball thing my mother started. Ok it's not dumb, simply corny, but that's ok. I'm heading to Cleveland tomorrow to check out an apartment that I'll be sharing a lease on. Or at least that's the plan. Hopefully it will work out. Anyway, that's what's been going down the last few days, I need to get to some studying and make a CD cover for the mix I'm making. later...

      La La La, here I am again...procrastinating the writing of a paper. At least it's a different paper, eh? Ugh...one final down, 2 to go. It won't be long till the semester is over. I am very excited about that. Reno is coming up for a visit, thurs through Sat or possibly Sun. Then Sun, Abby and I are heading home, then over to Oxford to pick up Binnie and then down to Cincy to see Michelle Malone in concert, playing a solo and band set, for only 3 bucks. How incredibly exciting is that? On a less exciting note, I will be home till the 15th. I hate going home. It's always so incredibly stressful. At least it's only 3.5 days. It's Abby's birthday soon. I need to figure out what it is I'm going to get her. She messed me up by buying those, I'm sorry to say but, ugly shoes she wanted. I've got the new Catie Curtis CD...but other than that I'm completely clueless. Oh well, I'll figure it out I'm sure. Man...the paper is calling me. Since it's due at 5:30 today the earlier I get started the better. ttyl,

      Hey there once again...I'm supposed to be writing a paper right now. I skipped out of going to Target with Abs, Lauren and Tom to do so. It's not going very well though. Perhaps because I signed online as soon as they left. I'm finding I miss those friends I have on the east coast. I wouldn't even mind hanging with Jen at this point. I just need to be with people who are real, people who only let you in on the amusing drama, not expecting you to deal with the heavy shit. I miss Julia's straight forward, here I am, take it or leave it personality. I miss the wisdom and girly girl persona of Lisa. I miss the craziness of Jen and Norine's odd ball comments. I miss Amanda, her openess and her new crush every other day. I miss Boston. I miss snow, I miss the freedom of living 800 miles from ones parents. I miss being the person I was out there. So free, and true. Never was I afraid of seeing someone I know and having to explain. I mean, what is there *to* explain. I'm out to most of my friends from High School. Those that are left are highly religious, or I no longer care about enough to let them in on who I am. I was thinking I might try and re-establish a friendship with Sanjida while I was in Cleveland. I know I've grown a lot since High School, and while I didn't like where she was going for a while. I think perhaps she calmed down and found a middle ground. I think it could be good. Good conversation on the ways of the world. Only problem with that, I don't know how she would feel about me being gay and I know I can't talk to her and lie about it. I can't lie about it anymore. It's just not possible. Ugh...why is life so complicated? I just have to get through next week and life will be at least a bit happier for a while. Till I figure out I hate my job. But hopefully that won't happen. I'll find some new friends to hang with, and everything will be cool. Think positive. *sigh* I best be off. . .

      So there's a whole lot of stress going down right now. Finals ahead. Figuring out where I'm going to live next semester. Finding out how to register for a class @ CSU and whether the credit will even transfer. Wondering whether the job @ Keithley will be horrible. It's just mostly insane.  I started this blogger to continue the expression of my ideas through written words. I have an old word document filled with 'journal' entries from high school. I remember it was always helpful to write out what I was thinking and feeling, since most of the time I would not permit myself to express them publicly. Most of my stress today comes from a test in Gender Studies and the e-mail I recently sent my professor wonding why the f*ck she gave me a D+ on a "nicely written paper". I hate confrontation and for the most part, while it felt good when I sent it, completely regret it now. I spend all kinds of time and energy worrying and speculating upon what will happen when I go to class this evening. I'm trying to ignore it and simply read the assigned pages so I will have some idea what the test will be over. Other than that I turned in a completely non-working, not even close to adhering to the assignment program in Op Sys today. I barely even tried to complete the assignment correctly. Makes me wonder if I have chosen the right major. I believe it once again comes down to the professor. I have always had trouble in classes where I don't respect the person standing in the front of the room. It's not that I'm doing bad in the class, I simply could be doing much better and therefore help offset my Circuits grade and apparently my gender studies grade as well. Ugh....no good. Op sys final on tues, (he expects us to show up for class on thurs....riiiight) then a Circuits final on Wed and Gender Studies on Thurs. I'm not sure if I have lab next friday, but it won't be anything too destressing I'm sure. Anyway, that marks the end of the semester. Something I am eternally greatful for. I'm not sure I want to be going off to work, but I sure know I don't want to go back to class. I need to contact Larry...again...and ask about start dates and if he actually did send me an official offer package since I haven't recieved anything yet. Bastard won't e-mail or call me back, neither will my future supervisor, Mark. Oh well, I have other things to worry about at this point. Like 2 papers, finals and laundry. It'll all get done and everything *will* work out for the best. Lets just hope they don't assume my start date to be August 13th. That would be *really* bad. Especially if they expect me to do any work. Sheesh...I still have another 40 min till Abby is done with class. I spose I'll go off and read my gender studies stuff...I got a lot of it done in Op Sys this morning. (Should tell you something about the respect I have for Dr. Salari eh?) I'll be back later...

      So, I came to Toledo this weekend. Didn't do much other than watch TV Friday night. Although I did have a brief visit from Lauren and another from Jason. Yesterday was a long day. I went with Lauren and Jason to campus where we participated in Parents Day activites. Ok, we got free food and um...wondered around campus, spending at least an hour in the Spectrum office reading magazines. After all that excitment we heading to the Glass Bowl for the football game. Toledo 41, Northern Illinois 20. Not all the surprised as our team is actually pretty good this year. Running 4-0 with Chester Taylor looking like he might be ellegible for the Heisman. After the game, I went to Bretz's with the boys. Oh my...what an evening. I ran into Troy and surprisingly enough Tiff. Tom, Troy, Vern and I spent most of the evening hiding in a corner simply chatting. Troy fixed his wide eyes on Vern so we had the pleasure of his company most of the evening. Jason claims he has kicked Brian. Which is why he came clubbing with us. He also had himself a drink or 2. I really hope he has. It'll be good for him. He needs to be his own person and concetrate on fixing his own problems. While Brian started out good for him, it definitely didn't turn out that way. So yeah, go Jason. About 3, Tom and I had had it. We looked for Jason to take us home and when we found him he said he needed to find one more that was ready to go to fill his car. Since we could not fund that other person, Troy offered to take us...or rather Vern home. Last I knew Troy was strategically planning a way to end up in Vern's apartment. Well, that may be unfair. All I really know is he wanted to be alone with Vern so they could "talk". And he wonders where the "slut" rumors come from. Sheesh. Oh well, I had a lot of fun, dispite the absence of my Abigail. In general, I'm glad she decided to go camping. Oops...laundry is done. Best be going . . .

      So let's see...what's up for today. I got up, came to work. Did some work related things and then went to a very boring co-op meeting that Nick and Joe decided not to wait for me before going to. Speaking of those two, I still haven't figured them out. Joe doesn't say much, I'm getting the vibe that he doesn't like me, nor care to talk to me. I really don't know if that's his personality, or if he actually has some sort of grudge against me. Jesus Freak Nick is amusing at times, but for the most part just really not my style. The straight guys I hang out with tend be either a: liberal or b: outgoing. He is neither. Makes for very boring conversation. Anyway, I came back from the meeting and ate lunch. Now I'm installing solaris 7 on some older than dirt Sparc's. Which takes *forever*. It's nuts man. So yeah, I had dinner with Sanjida last night. It went surprisingly well. She was completely cool w/ my gayness and was, like everyone else, not at all surprised. We didn't stay on the subject all that long so I didn't get the chance to tell her my gf is Abby. I'm not sure why I didn't bring it up right away. I guess for me easier to just come out as myself and rather than as a couple. Couple...what is that anymore? I feel so distant from my Abigail. I'm not sure which it is, the miles or the time spent apart. There's just something missing. *sigh* I don't know, I simply don't know. I spose we'll find out when I finally do see her again. Um...yeah...that's about all I know for now....later....

      I slept very well last night, and uh this morning. It wasn't all that bad, but I didn't get here til about 9. I walk into my cubicle and there's a note from Mark saying that when I get there I should join him in conference room D. I'm like...ok. So I'm walking down the hall and there's a bunch of marketing bigwigs in the CR and I'm like...no way...sure enough as more of the room can be seen, there's Mark and some other engineers sitting at the other end of the table. Great. So I walk into the room, find a chair and sit down. Being like, Mark you are a bastard, you just made me look bad. Since I had no prior knowledge of the meeting, I was not aware I had to be here for a 9am meeting. Anyway way, it was a product feasibility meeting in which they kinda decide whether to move forward on a proposed project. The meeting lasted until 11:30. Ugh. So anyway, after the meeting was over, I talked to Mark about what went on yesterday and what I should do today and he apoligized for not informing me that he wanted me to be there and whatever else and now I'm eating lunch. Or perhaps pretending to still be eating lunch, but that's not really the point. Anyway, I got directions to go pick up Sanjida this evening. I'm a lot less nervous about it today. I think it's just the difference in my moods in general. I'll let you know how it goes later. Um yeah, I spose I should head off and find myself some work to do. Sounds like fun eh? eh. ttyl,

      I am having an icky day. You know the ones where nothing seems to be going right, and no matter what you do, you feel bad for doing it b/c you should be doing something else? Yeah, one of those days. I've been @ work for almost 5 hours, however I have gotten next to nothing accomplished. While that's not entirely my fault (ie Dave Rose took the eqipment I need to use and Mark, nor Tony are here to answer questions to the little work I do have) I still feel all guilty about not getting anything done. I spose that's a good thing. Last co-op I got to the point where I didn't feel the slightest twang of guilt not getting anything accomplished for days. I definitly like the job, but at this point I'm kinda running out of things to do. Waiting on a phone call from Abby. After she calls I'm going to go find Dave and get his calculator from him. Then I get to pretend I know what an S-Parameter is and go about calculating them for data I don't have. Yup. Should be fun.   Just about as much fun as Diff EQ tonight, oh wait....no, as fun as my dinner with Sanjida tomorrow evening. So incredibly nervous about that one. I don't believe she's seen my short hair, and really it's a bit *too* boyish for me at the moment. I now have a gay sticker on my car which she *will* see and yeah...Don't know if I can avoid coming out w/o compromising my morals, and if I do come out, what will her reaction be? I spose it can't be worse than my mother's. Still, I'm not looking forward to it.   Speaking of not looking forward to things. It looks like I'm going to be spending the weekend in Toledo on my own. Abby is rather adimit about going camping. Which I don't blame her for, and I know I have to let her be her own person, but I would really like to see her this weekend. If I don't it's only one more week, but man, these past two have been so long already. Hopefully I'll be able to have some fun in Toledo. I have at least the football game to go to. Other than that I can spend time thinking, writing, doing homework, laundry. Perhaps I'll actually get to revamping my old web page. What a novel idea. Been almost a year since I've touched it.   Beginning to wonder if Abby is ever going to call. I need to go talk to Dave and hang out in the lab where there are actual numbers, but who knows. I wonder if Alex is here today. I haven't seen him at all. I need to find out from him what numbers I should use to make the calculations easier. Ugh...this is absolutely no good. I need to get *something* done today. Hopefully Dave Rose will give me the VNA back so I can loop the test KTM overnight. That would be *something*, I spose. Ok well, I think I'm giving up the wait. Sheesh...I'm off to find S-parameters. Yay!

      So, it's been almost a month since I last wrote. How nuts is that? All kinds of stuff going on in the world and in life. I would like to sit down and write it all out. Organize my thoughts and such. However, Mark is supposed to return any minute with help or so I'm told. I promise I'll get to this eventually. For now there's been too much for words and well, not enough drive to even turn on my computer @ home. It's been pretty insane. Of course if you're really interested in what's up, check out 'Us' that one gets updated 2 to say 5 times a day. Lots of info there. Not that the random reader even knows where it is. But my future self does, that's all that counts. La di da...I'm off...

      Nothing much exciting here. I'm simply trying to kill some time at the moment. I'll think of something profound to say eventually, promise. sigh...today has been one of those days. I simply wish I could cease to exist for about 24 hrs. Just to give me a break from life. My brain's been full of all kinds of things recently and therefore I haven't been sleeping all that well. Not that this state is something new, but I had been rid of it for a few weeks. That was nice. Sleep is nice.  I miss Abby...just thought I'd share...  Back to work for me I spose. How fun is that? Not very...*thbbth*

      So I visited  urlLink ephiny  today, and it seems as though she appreciated my "I'm a freak e-mail" That makes me happy. I'm glad it brought her some comfort, or whatever. She seems like a cool chick and I'll probably be checking out her site every few days to see what's up. :-)  Spent the weekend in Toledo. It was way fabulous to see my Abigail again so soon. I finally got to hang with Britt, Jan and David a bit. Not sure I missed much. They are, for the most part, really cool people. However, they have an air of superiority about them. They are extremely condesceding toward anyone that's not the three of them and are in general, simply imature, yet slightly intimdating. Just the fact that they are always together is a bit unerving. I don't think I'll be spending much 'social' time with them in the future. It's simply not fun.  So yeah, I think the 'we need new friends' conclusion Abby and I came to this summer is still relevant. Lauren manged to get on both my nerves as well as Abby's this weekend. I don't really know what it is...her self-centered nature I spose. Dave is, well Dave and will probably simply become 'the roommate' rather than a friend. I have an odd feeling money will clutter those ties and I'm willing to bet he'll move out in May. If not, he'll have grown up a lot. Which, in theory, is what the Army did for him.   Eek...I have a test to study for and a meeting @ 1. I should probably get cracking at something that's slightly more productive. uh...yeah...

      So I was supposed to discuss Lauren. Right, I kinda forgot about that. This could be a bit tough, as I don't remember all the details of what I wanted to say. I spose I should wait on that one till after the weekend, as I will be seeing her again Saturday, at least. Ugh...she is a very fabulous person...I can't stand that she lets herself be treated like crap. Sheesh...Anyway, nothing much exciting going on here. In the midst of several trades and I have come to the conclusiont that a trip to Best Buy is needed. More MD's, blank CDR's and tapes. Should be a fun trip. Probably stop on my way into Toledo this evening as I need to make tapes to mail out on Saturday. I'm not entirely excited about what I'm getting in return, but a trade is a trade, that will help set up more trades. It'll be good I'm sure, as long as I get all that I am promised. We'll see. I spose I should try to get some work done. Not that I really have any. I guess I'll go read and try and find Mark in an hour or so. We might set up a meeting to go over PR's, how boring would that be? Like I said, back to work. You should to! :-)

      So I did one of those "Are you a freak or what?" kinda things today. I was bored, searching the Blogger.com database for interesting blogs. I ran across  urlLink this one  and it just sorta said "you know exactly what this chick is talking about" at the end of the post she listed her e-mail address, it said to me "e-mail her". So I did. She just sounded so alone, so neck sticking out, out there. Figured I'd give a "Hey, you're not really alone" kinda e-mail. I don't know...just kinda screams "Yes, Becky, you are a freak" But then again I already knew that and frankly, it doesn't bother me all that much. I try to do what it is I want to do, despite what others might think. While that's not always the best course of action, or even the action I take, I still try. It's the thought that counts right? Hmm...probably not, but whatever.

      Hmm...this is getting long...probably slightly boring as well. Oh well, just because I added a link to my webpage doesn't mean anyone is actually reading this. For now, it's amusing me and that's all that really matters. Uh...the archives seemed to have reappeared. That's kinda random. Don't really know what's up with that. I guess it's just as I said, random.  Anyway...moving on...  Sunday:  Sunday morning my mother, father, Abby, Maddie and Mrs. Valley (god, I can't even type it...sheesh..I spose that issue could use it's own post, eh?) went to 'brunch' @ Friendly's. Not all that interesting. Mostly talked of Centerville High School gossip, as that school is all any of us really have in common...well, unless you count all that unmentionable stuff. (oh...I mentioned the unmentionable...even in such vague context, it's still cause for alarm. If you're my mother...) Though I spose it's a bit of a step in the right direction. A tiny baby step forward is better than standing still. I left my parents @ Friendly's and returned to the Valley's. Switched another load of laundry and then Abby and I went and got my car an oil change. It's really much happier now. Back to the Valley's finished laundry, chatted with Binnie for a bit (who had returned with car, which was the whole reason I picked her up in Oxford, but I'm not really sure if I explained that...hmm...) and then got in my car and drove 2.5 hours to Toledo. (Yes, here is where the Lauren story comes in) ..Oh wait, no it doesn't we're going to make issues with Lauren into a seperate post at a seperate time, b/c I want to finish this before I go home and frankly...I've lost the desire to think that hard. OK...basic events of the evening w/o superfluous philisophical thought: **Jason scares the shit out me, honking and screaming at me "Hey Sexy!" while I'm digging through my trunk for clothes to wear to work the next day. Chat with him breifly, apparently he's off to work, no useful or interesting information obtained from conversation. **Enter apt, Dave's not home (big surprise), call Abby and Lauren. Msg for Abby, Lauren asks if we can leave asap, she wants to stop at her parents house before going to the venue. (Yes, another Ferrick concert, get over it) **Get in car with Lauren, stop and get Wendy's (yup...again) drive to parents house, get new to me, old to them Britta Water filter thing. Drive off to venue. **Get lost, no big surprise there, Lauren calls father. Father for once knows where we are. Find venue and park. **Long line, as we are late, but the doors have opened so it moves fast. Enter room, decide we're not close enough to the stage to make standing through the show worth it, find seat at table along the side of the room. Chat till Ferrick comes on stage. "Chat" is reason entire post on Lauren and her relationship with Becca is needed. **Listen to fabulous concert (boot turned out wonderful, yay!) **Concert over, drive home, call Abby, voice mail again, leave cute message, go to sleep.  Um...yeah...that's all I got. At least for now. I'm going to go back to actually working and hopefully get some stuff done. Sounds exciting eh? Not really. yeah...

      OK then,  Saturday:  Um...got up, watched 2 episodes of ER (the one from 2 weeks ago and last weeks) Made/ate waffles, baked cookies, played with the Mini Disc recorder. (Ok, so Abby really did most of the first 2 while I played with the MD. So sue me...) Just a rather lovely, relaxing morning with Abigail. Then we drove to the Valley's, chatted with Abby's parents, started laundry, raked leaves and buried Madeliene(where the hell does the extra 'e' go?) in them. Then went to my house. Listened to my parents argue, my mother tell me I look awful and other such fun things. Went to China Cottage with my family for dinner. Michele drove my old car and we had to go around all the hills. Very cute. She's getting the whole driving thing down. Kinda amazes me that I got my temps and then one month later my license, now there's all these rules that I don't really know about, but they basically force the driver to take a lot more time before getting his license. After we returned from dinner Michele inexplicably had to have *me* give her a ride to the movie theater. In general, it allowed Abby and I to get out of the house (with no plans to come back) and Michele to get out of having a parent pick up her newest 'love' interest, namely Matt. So Abby and I play chaufer picking up Stephanie as well, throughly amused with the whole 'high schoolesque' situation. Nostalgia, pure and simple. We then returned to Abby's house, where her parents beat us at Euchure. Just as we were about to switch to playing spoons, Michele calls asking for a ride, the use of a cell phone and a list of 'legal' things to do on a Saturday night. In the end we drove them to Border's and Wal-Mart, then home. Not all that exciting, but it was worth the effort. Michele was all way cute with the boy and Stephanie is always fun. She's the one Michele brought to spend a weekend at college with Abby and I, neglecting to let her know that I was gay, that all my friends are gay and that my gf lives in the same room with me, but she was way cool about it...so whatever. It was good to spend some 'quality' time with Michele as a peer, rather than as part of a family unit. Although it was obvious that Abby and I were, 'keeping an eye on them'. I inadvertantly educated them on matters of human genitaila. Demonstrating my lack of respect for the origin of male pride. It was definitely one of those, 'Oops, did that come out of my mouth? That's what I was thinking, but not really what I meant to say' moments. Anyway, we dropped the boy off, and then stopped by my parents house to get Michele's things (apparently she's sleeping @ Steph's), dropped them off and returned to Abby's parents place to get some sleep.  La di da...Sunday -> Coming Soon. :-)

       urlLink  Alrighty then...where was I...uh...yes.  So Megan and Binnie show up and after Binnie tries on just about all of Abby's clothes we head off to Wendy's to get some dinner. (notice my trend in food for the weekend...this makes twice in one day...yum) Sitting in the restuarant...eating and talking. Megan and Binnie begin to 'argue' over who gets the most 'action' on the floor Binnie is an RA for. Two, probably 15 y/o, girls in the corner begin to laugh and mock us. Lesbians this, lesbians that. Binnie makes a rather loud and obviously directed toward them statement to the effect of "Obvioulsly *they* have a problem with that" (It worked into the coversation somehow...I don't really remember *exactly* what happened) So the chicks stand up and all get in Binnie's face or whatever. Eventually ending with the oh so brilliant remark "I wouldn't eat that chilli, I mean, I don't know you, but I wouldn't eat that." Then basically sprint out of the restuarant yelling something about lesbians and how they have to get out of here. Well, now we were rather amused and well, proud of ourselves for forcing 2 girls to leave our presence. I mean...perhaps if it had been 2 large guys things would have been different, but really, we just found the homophobia to be rather funny. We finished our meal and then headed to the parking lot, hanging out by the cars waiting for Binnie to satify her nicotine addiction. A car that had just left the parking lot, circles back around and from it one of the girls yells something like "Fuck you you stupid fags, Fuck you" Megan immediately hollers back "If you're going to insult us, at least use the correct derogatory term, bitch" We then get a choice finger, a few more fuck you's and some lesbos! Hmm...that was interesting. First of all, the pair had someone else driving for them and second, they never bothered to leave the shelter of their car. (An oh so fabulous blue  urlLink Celica  btw, which is why I noticed the car in the first place) A drive by shooting off of the mouth, if you will. Really rather odd and simply amusing. Which completely undermines any conceiveable goal those chicks may have been trying to obtain. Ineveitably, the four of us will turn into large deisel dykes who tried to hit on them, but whatever. After that we headed to the  urlLink Southgate House  for the  urlLink Ferrick  concert. The concert itself was fairly fabulous. It was a nice change to attend a show with Abby rather than Lauren. Not that Lauren's a bad person, but well...we'll get to that story shortly. Or perhaps not so shortly, but you know what, fuck it, I'm having fun and it's keeping me from murdering Mark for giving me an insanely tedious job. Anyway, it will be described eventually. So yeah, the show. Um...I saw Ann there, watched her get drunk and do a horrible job at bootlegging. If you don't want people to hang out around the equipment and talk and perhaps sit on it. Stay close to your equipment. Sheesh. My bootleg came out fairly well, a bit bassy but still listenable. The new MD's took care of the skipping during play back, the random stoppage of recording and the 1/2 hour TOC edits. I also gained too much information regarding Binnie and Megan's sex life. Which I didn't know existed before that evening. As far as I had been told, they were just friends. [ Mental note: How much did Binnie drink? If at all...would that have had some effect on the amount of information she was willing to share? Information came more readily out of her mouth as the evening went on...maybe? Hmmm... ]Speaking of Binnie and Megan....I really don't know what I think about that relationship. First of all, Binnie is a Senior and Megan is a Freshman. Robbing the cradle much? I mean, yes it is college and that's different from high school and age in love shouldn't matter and all that jazz, but really Binnie, you couldn't have come up with someone more mature? Or perhaps that's the point. Binnie has always started her new relationship before ending the old one. One of those, can never be alone kind of things. While I will agree with her that Liz was probably no longer good for her, I can't pretend I think Megan is a better match. She's gone perhaps from one extreme to the other. A more responsible Liz to a less responsible Megan. Megan represents college, fun, few responsibilites and the possibilty of sex w/o emotional attachment. (One could describe Miss Megan as a 'slut'...however...I'm not sure I'd go that far) As Binnie heads toward that dreaded graduation, she's realizing she's not ready for the real world and hence clinging to the past. Perhaps there was too much future with Liz, perhaps the parenting by Liz was too much a reminder of what she should be doing. I don't really know, and it's all speculation, but in general...Binnie does not act the way a senior getting ready to graduate should. There's a reason for it somewhere, probably similar to Abby's fear of being alone, but it's there and it's not going to go away until she acknowledges it's presence and does something about it. And that's what I think, at least right now. Ask me later, I'm sure it will have changed.   Well then...I'm going to leave Saturday for a later post...must return to work...at least for a little while. :-)

      Hmm....looks like it's been a few days since I touched this. Not all that surprised seeing as though I didn't touch a computer for more than 15 min all weekend. It was a welcome break from what I do just about 24 hours a day. I'm going to be blind and have horrid arthritis in my wrists when I get old. Oh well, so is everyone else I know. The PC generation...in more ways than one. Hmm...basic break down of the past few days.   Thursday:  [ See last journal entry for early in the days events. ] I drove for four hours from Cleveland to Cincy. That was much fun. I had several revelations I was supposed to take time to write in here, but at this point in time, I have no idea what they were...so we're going to skip that portion. I arrived at Abby's. It's always such a surreal experience to see her after however many weeks it's been. Almost like it's not happening...almost like I don't even know her. The feeling quickly fades and I return to the bliss of holding my Abigail in my arms, but it's there nonetheless. We watched  urlLink Will and Grace  and planned the following days events, talking to my parents, Binnie and Abby's mom (even though I've been told to call her Janeth...I still can't get it out. I'm such a dork.) on the phone. Then went to bed...taping  urlLink ER .    Friday:  Abby got up way fucking early and went to work. I just kinda layed there half concious like. Eventually I got up and headed to  urlLink Oxford  to pick up Binnie and apparently Megan as well. While wasn't aware she was tagging along, I was rather grateful for another person to converse with. For whatever reason I never feel all that comfortable around Berina. Kind of a 'what to say' delima as we have absolutely nothing in common other than her family. She can be amusing enough, but I would never hang out with *just* her. Too weird I guess. As I found out last evening, her parents are rather worried about her and issues of a pair of ambercrombie jeans (with the security tag still on them) and a DVD player that's supposedly Liz's. I don't know exactly what I think about that. I know I don't put stealing past her, but I like to think that's she a more responsible person than that. Then again when we told her to meet us @ 5:30, we did so knowing full well she wouldn't show till at least 6. Anyway, the drive was rather uneventful save some amusing conversation involving Megan's intelligence as well as driving ability. We arrived at the  urlLink High School  and I left them in the art room to find Isbell for lunch. After some searching I found her and we headed to Wendy's drive through. We returned and ate in the teachers lounge surrounded by Neidhard yelling at someone on the phone, some sub and Mrs. Ransbottom. Isbell is one of those lady's that thinks she's way cooler than she is. She is always sure to ask me about Abby but when it comes to disscussion on real gay issues she fumbles. I'm don't doubt she's ok with it, but she has much less information about such subjects than she lets on. My opinions of her have shifted since high school, I think that has a bit to do with my being 'an adult'. All in all, Centerville is the perfect place for her...it's all about social status and the way you appear to others. After some gossip and failed philisophical discussion, I headed back to the Art room to meet Michele. I felt bad, I was a little late, but she got over it, got her lunch and Stephanie and returned to the art room office where I watched the two of them and Valley eat their lunch, disscussing random topics of boys, teachers and school work. Very amusing half hour or so. Spent the rest of the school day hanging out with Valley. Loading a kiln and talking of Berina and Abigail, life goals, gossip and other random points of interest. Hmm...I wonder how many times I've used the word random. Oh well, at least it seems I've broke the habit of apparently...I was beginning to fear turning into Jen. Anyway, after school we drove to Jennifer's (Maddie's babysitter) and picked up Madeleine and a friend (Amanda?) and drove them to an art class. Returned to the Valley household, talked bit. Geoffery came home. Talked some more. I left about 4:30 stopped by my house to grab somethings, then drove back to Abby's apt. Apparently I woke her up from a nap. We gathered things together for the evening's activities and waited for Binnie and Megan to show.    .....going to have to finish this later...damn work....sheesh. ;-)

      Ok, so the archives dissappeared again. What is up with that? Sheesh. I'm at work, bored out of my gourd, wishing it were 5pm or better yet 9pm so I could be in the arms of my Abby rather than here. Ick. Work normally isn't bad, but today, today is just horrible. Mostly to do with my attitude, which I spose it what made Compaq so horrible as well. But the attitude comes from somewhere. In this case it's lack of work and my evening plans to be in Cincy as opposed to talking to Justin and doing all that tedious coverage shit. I don't know whatever. I'm just hoping for a fabulous weekend *away* from Cleveland. Not that Cleveland is all that bad a place. If I knew people here, it probably wouldn't be bad at all. No worse than say Toledo. I spose I could go and join Lesbian Avengers or something...but really...I'm not *that* desperate for people to hang out with. I enjoy the time alone, time to think etc. but at the same time I crave social contact. More importantly, social contact in which I can be totally myself. However, I spose it would be good if I knew what that was. I have the idea of who I would be and what I would do, and then I have the things I actually do and say. Very different concepts. For example, I'm in the elevator in Rhodes Tower on my way down from DiffEQ class with some random guy. This guy looks at me in the...ok are you male or female kinda way. Apparently he decided to take the 'safe' approach and asked me a question. (The voice will nine times out of ten give gender away.) I politely answered, *really* wanting to remove my self from such a tiny space with a random older (50's?) man. He then proceeds to say "That hair cut *actually* looks good on you". I looked at him and wanted to say something like "That fake hair *actually* makes you look younger" instead I said, "uh...thanks". So the question is, should I have insulted him back? Or simply assume he doesn't realize what he's saying and politely remove myself from the situation? Which person should I/do I want to be? In my head I've always wanted to be the insulter...the one that says what's on her mind and fuck what other people think. However that is not *always* how I act. I don't know...good questions to be thinking about in life. I spose there's good and bad qualities to each side and in general I just hang out in the middle, hopfully taking the best of both worlds. Not sure I like the idea of mediocrity, but I spose it means I'm not inferior. Whatever...too much thinking...my brain is jumbled into some form of incomprehensible mess that some how continues to function. Kinda like when your room is a complete and total disater area, yet you know where everything is...well...except that other shoe you need so you can leave for school. Yeah...exactly. Ha...wow...off to get some lunch. . .ttyl,

      Ugh...so *very* sleepy. I met Lauren at the Beachland Ballroom last night for a Ferrick concert. While I had tons of fun, the show wasn't over til just before midnight. Didn't hang around all that long, but by the time I got home and settled down enough to actually fall asleep, it was way past 1am. Problem with that being I had to be at work this morning by 7. Why that early you ask? Well, the plan is to work my 40 hours in 4 days, rather than five and seeing as though I slept through my alarm yesterday, I have plenty of time to make up between now and Thursday. I spose it doesn't matter all *that* much. Just money I don't get. Whatever. I'm looking forward to seeing my Abby and well, another 2 Ferrick shows. Speaking of which, my MD was acting out again last night, as well as this morning when I was trying to play back what I recorded. I missed at least 3 songs, including Mercy, Hello Dad and most of Then So It Is and on the songs you do hear, bass drum drowns out most of whatever you're supposed to be hearing. I think I need to figure out how to either a: turn the bass down or b: simply turn the recording volume down. Either way, I'm not sure how to do that. I'll get the book out tonight and play with it. Hopefully I can work some magic on my PC and the boot while incomplete, will sound half-way decent. I also need to upload photos and work on my newly updated w/o much content web page. I'm really rather excited about this batch of photos. I think I got a few more 'keepers' than usual. So yeah, I should probably get back to that whole work thing. Even though I really don't have all that much to do. Later gators. :-)

      So, I'm pretty sure I am officially bored. Even the prospect of updating my webpage doesn't sound appealing. I figured I should take some time to try and write something. Perhaps that will help kill some time, at the very least. I've done absolutely nothing this weekend. I had 2 goals: 1. Grocery shopping and 2. buy new mini discs. I only completed the first of those two goals. Not that I didn't try. I drove out to K-mart, but they didn't have any. How incredibly sad is that? What's worse is the closest Best Buy is like 15 miles away. How can one live *that* far away from a Best Buy? I mean, come on. So yeah, I guess it looks like I'm going to have to record with the ones I have at the Ferrick concert tomorrow night. I'm rather depressed about that. I really want to know if that damn MD just doesn't like 80 min maxell's or if it's truely defective. That and in theory the recording will ineveitably miss a lot of the concert. So like is there a spell check on this thing? I spose not...don't see one. You're just going to have to deal with my typo's and incorrigable spelling skills. Case in point, eh? Sheesh. Anyway, other points of interest for the weekend. Madeliene. Whose name I think I'm spelling correctly, but I never really know. She is such an amazing child. What's more amazing is it seems she likes me. Childern don't normally like me. She was asking all kinds of, 'When do I get to see you' type questions. I spose it simply means there's a connection there. I spose dating her sister for the last 2.5 years has something to do with that one. I don't know...just kinda hit me. The Valley's really are my family. What pisses me off is it seems they are more family than my own. I'm sure my parents don't enjoy that fact much either. My parents, especially my mom, really have no idea who I am. I've gotten better about showing my father my true self as opposed to the "I'm straight...really I am", self. Michele is pretty cool in general. She told me I sounded like a grown up the other day. I told her, "I pay rent, electric bills, phone bills and work 40 hours a week. I am a grown up darling." Somehow I want to save her from the terrors of High School. However, being heterosexual and somewhat popular, I'm sure she doesn't have the same kinds of problems I had. Still, I want her to be true to herself, and not one of those fake people. Basically to adopt all the principles I have, which in theory will make her happy. Which it won't, cause she needs to do what works for her and obviously I'm not quite so happy myself, but well, you know what I mean. The idea of 'parenting' someone to be like you. Which I guess is where my mother runs into problems. I'm not like her. Man, I wish I could get my thoughts and feelings to conincide. Although, I spose then I would have no emotion. That would probably suck. So never mind, scratch above wish. However something along those lines would be nice. I'll let you know when I figure out exactly what that is. I had other thoughts...but got distracted and no longer remember what they were. Oh well, this post seems to contain a sufficient amount of randomness anyway. Till next time. . .

      In the midst of updating my webpage. It's kinda fun. I've added a link to this journal. I figure, what the hell eh? I changed my template and for what ever reason I still can't get the archives pages to work. I don't know what's up with that. Talking to Jen on the computer. She always seems to get hit with the worst...all at the same time. I spose eventually she'll get her break in life...but dude...that sucks. Been a slow weekend so far. Staying in Cleveland alone is never all that much fun. However, I get things like webpage updates done. :-) So yeah...I'm off to write some more html. yay.

      So, in general, I wish that I were more motivated to write. (and that when I am....blogger doesn't loose my posts.) However, when I am motivated to write, I tend to be depressed. I don't really want to be depressed....however I want to be able to, with ease, place words on a paper that make sense. I don't ever want to return to the pain of my middle school, or high school years. However, I wish the prowess with which could compose poetry, short stories and such would return to me. That's really about all I've been thinking about lately. That and how to redo my web page, what to make for dinner and trying to plan this weekends activites. My life is uber exciting right now. Really. It is. This semester is much better than say my first semester in college, or even my second. But I believe the 3 between then and now to be a bit more positive. Gaining friends who really know who I am, working and living in MA and then a semester with fewer friends, but more time with my Abigail. Coming out to just about every one of my friends from High School, knowing the rest are inevitably aware of my status as a gay woman. The last year or so has been good to me. I hope the following years are just as kind. Looking at my schedule for next semester I can't help but wonder how that will change. Knowing that Spring is the semester for drama with in Spectrum and wondering where Abby and I will be in the summer. Just a bunch of question marks really. I spose there's no need to worry about them now. Just pondering...when I should be working. What's new eh? It's not my fault really. If Mark would give me some work to do I would do it. He just simply hasn't. Speaking of Mark...he's probably returned from his meeting. I'm off to engage in the second have of the game "Hide and then go Seak out the Supervisor". Should be fun...

      Well, well, well, today has just been scrumptious. Ha...ugh...my uterus hurts. xp Can I go home now? I'm thinking I might, but I don't really want to make up the hours. However, I do want to be paid. I could just work ten hour days on Wed and Thurs. That would more than cover it. Leaving a little time to leave early Friday. (I get to see my Abby and Kris Delmhorst :-D) Well, first I would have to drag my ass out of bed. Drats. Oh well, if I can't find anything to do in the next oh 1/2 hour, I'm outta here. I'm wondering where it is that Mark is hiding. I can only read manuals for so long before I demand some kind of hands on activity. Sheesh...well, I spose I'll do some documentation of my own. Should be a blast. ttyl,

      It's snowing today. Not a horrible storm or anyting, but just enough to let you know winter is on it's way. Lots of stuff floating through my head today. Not much of it is comprehensible, but from what I can gather it's a general discontentment with life. Not that life is bad, it's just, distressing. For example, class last night actually got hard. Doesn't it know it's not supposed to get complicated? Sheesh...it also can't help that the holiday season is upon us. I usually enjoy this time of year, however, this time, I wouldn't quite use the word enjoy. I'm aprehensive, not sure about the whole visiting with family thing. For T-day, I'll be at my parents house. From Wed evening till sometime Sunday. It's going to be a *long* five days. At least we're not driving up to Mich. I don't like the idea of having to pretend to be straight and conservative. Nor do I enjoy my grandfather telling me I "look too butch, put a dress on and use less hair spray". Hrumph, I also have to find a B-day present for my sister, and figure out Christmas presents for just about everyone. Ugh, giving isn't supposed to be stressful. Oh well, I best get back to work now. Enjoy your day...

      Ugh. This is going to be a long day. I feel horrible bad and I don't like the work I'm supposed to be doing and *thbbth*. I just want to go home and go to sleep. However, that is not an option. I do however get to go home, pack for Toledo and then drive there. That should be amusing. Really. Talking to Lauren on the computer. She's, as my grandfather would say, 'on my shit list'. Basically, she can do absolutely nothing right, until something occurs to remove her from said list. (Usually lots of time not seeing/talking to her is needed) In general, I feel my blood boil and my eyes shooting daggers whenever she says *anything*. She was added to 'the shit list' after our trip to Inkster last weekend due to, well, general annoyance and for whatever reason, has yet to be taken off. We're supposed to go to the football game this weekend. I really don't think I want to go, but Abby does. Although I believe she also sees the pitfalls of attending a football game with Lauren *and* her parents. Apparently, Jason's parents are attending as well. That could be um...interesting. Hmm...best be going now I spose. Work. Ick.

      La di da, hanging in the computer lab waiting for class to start. Maple days are always fun. Mostly cause they are pretty brainless and allow access to the interenet via a T1 line. Nice stuff. Nothing all that exciting going on. I talked to Reno last night. First time in a long time. She was wondering if I was coming home for Thanksgiving. I assume we'll party or something. Sounds fun, but it's never quite what one expects. We aren't the same people we were in High School. Planning to see Manda as well. I'm really excited about that one. Haven't been able to actually chat with her recently. She never seems to be around when I'm online. Not much to be done about that I spose. Hmm...seems class is starting...I must abandon you for now...bye :-)

      it's been four years since that day when the news fell from the sky you took "until we meet again" and turned it to "goodbye" and I hope that you won't rest in peace because that would bore you right to tears you always made the richest feast of the dangers and the fears it was almost fine, you were almost mine it was you and me and love made three on a broken white line well that night was long, there was one more song and then we were on our way driving slow, no place to go and nothing more to say and the rain came down around that car like we were underneath the sea in the back seat, almost drowning, holding on to me it was almost fine, you were almost mine and from town to town we chased it down on a broken white line looking in your eyes was just like staring at the sun always thought that I'd go blind or end up all undone and in the end I turned my face away from where you shone so bright now I wake in all this darkness crying for a little of your light it's been four years and now I find I've been living all this time I built myself a little world of rhythm and of rhyme but sometimes I take your picture and I turn it to the wall because you are still a cliff and baby I still know how to fall it was almost fine, you were almost mine but day by day you slipped away down that broken white line  it was you and me and love made three  		~Kris Delmhorst~ 		      Broken White Line

      Watching stupid sitcoms, contemplating life. Feeling the need to be productive. Haven't found much of anything to fulfill said need. Hrumph...off to reorganize my CDs or something...

      Hmmm...back again. I spose I should be sleeping at the moment. Or at least trying to. Must get up for work in the morning. I'm not really dreading work. Mostly just the thought of that empty bed. It's almost easier *not* to see my Abby. At least what I'm missing is not quite as fresh in my mind. I can't imagine what life would be like without her. 4 hours seems trivial compared to forever...still, I miss her. I miss us.

      Another weekend gone...seems they come and go so fast. Nothing all that special this time around. Friday we (Abby, Lauren and I)attended a Michelle Malone concert at the skanky dyke bar in Inkster. (Stiletto's) This place was classic. Walk in, old school Melissa Etheridge playing over the sound system. Those of us underage were given glow necklaces to wear, rather than the usual marked up hands. That was pretty cool...for the first 5 min. Then you realize you have to wear this damn thing the rest of the night. That and *everyone* knows you're under 21, which I guess is the point. The waiter (yes he was male...interesting) was asking us if we wanted a pop or something. Surprising phrasing being in Michigan and all, 'pop', hee hee. The place has two rooms, one with a dance floor (I assume, not that I actually went in there...probably had pool tables and darts too...not a Lesbian bar w/o those) and one with a stage, complete with catwalk. Seems they have drag shows...as well as strippers on certain nights of the week. Sucky sound system, drunk off their ass 'chatters' and people traipsing back and forth from the oil wrestling to the restroom. (Uni-sex restroom no less) In general, it sucked...but not because Michelle sucked...she was great, you simply could barely hear her over the stories of who fucked who, the pumping bass and screaming from the next room. Oh well, such is life. Saturday was spent sleeping, playing nintendo, watching movies and eating ice cream. Today we cleaned, went to Target, played more Nintendo and ate more ice cream. A fabulously relaxing weekend, spent with a fabulous girl. Dave was conveniently in Cleveland this weekend...leaving the apartment to just Abby and I. Very nice. Something I wish I could do more often. Back to work tomorrow. No class though. Yay for Veteran's day. Off to unpack and watch the X-files...

      Guess who I received an e-mail from. Yup. Exactly. Apparently she does want to 'chat about life'. I replied, although not really knowing what to say. Wondering what exactly will come from this new found communication. I've closed that portion of my life. At least I like to think that I have. I'm not sure I want to revisit it. Then again, I spose I can use this as a test. Tug a bit at the stitches used to close those old wounds. It's about time I find out how developed my sewing skills are.

      So...speaking of random people reading my journal...I'm at work today, being incredibly bored. Perhaps not in so many words, but my basic job description for most of today was 'surf the internet'. So I willingly complied and caught up on my mightybigtv.com reviews and read a bunch of message boards and whatever else. I run a search on bootlegs and surf on into a rather familiar site. I headed back out to the main page to check out what was up with a 'onetime high school friend' as her 11.04.01 update put it. From what I can gather she found my newly linked to the world journal, just as my father had. Now I spose I'm simply assuming she's speaking of me, and that could probably be labeled rather arrogant of me, but I don't know...just seemed to fit. So I spose if you're reading this again... urlLink drop me a line ...we'll chat about life or something.

      Hmm...haven't written in a while, eh? It's not really that I don't have anything to say, it's just well, I don't really have anything to say. I've been given information that may be changing my view on this whole online journal thing. That information being my father read it. I spose that's not quite as bad as my mother...but still, a bit nerve racking. I realize that I can't let the fact that others read this, change the information I put here. That would completely moot the point of writing. This is an outlet for me. The fact that someone, somewhere might be reading it helps me to feel that I've gotten something off my chest. However, it's a bit scary to think that the subject of such writing is the one reading it. Ah...not much more time to type about my fears now. The journal is here, and it's staying...at least for now.

      I'm just about ready to leave work for the day...ok I'm more than ready to leave work, it's just I need to be here for another 20 min or so to get my hours in. Unless I'm really into something, I'm usually worthless about this time of day. Which is why I'm writing here instead of coding those damn KTM's. I guess they really aren't *that* bad, but they get extremely tedious. Hopefully I can finish them up tomorrow.   Abby may or may not be visiting me in Cleveland this weekend. I hate that she tends to get me all excited about something, then tells me 'oh it was nothing' or something. Not that she does these things on purpose. It's her whole roller coaster ride of emotions. I still can't figure out how her moods change so quickly. I want to ask her to just come see me. At the same time, I want to tell her to stay there. Probably the same conflict of emotions/logic she's dealing with. I don't know. I guess I mostly want to know if I should bother cleaning this evening. The plan was to do it this weekend, but if she's coming...I should really do it tonight. Whatever, it'll work out.  Apparently Michele made the JV basketball team. Yay for her. Makes me wonder if I should of stuck with bball. Then again when I think back, I hated every second of playing with the high school team. I dispised most of my teammates, hated the coach and almost wanted to be constantly sitting on the bench. Basketball wasn't like soccer, I had never figured it out. Playing for Lupia we always had set plays, I knew those plays and I could handle it. Soccer was a larger space, more one on one, less confusion, fans further away. I think in the end I put too much pressure on myself, and perhaps my Dad didn't help much, that it got to the point where nothing I did was good enough. I felt like my every move was scrutinized, critized. Hmmm...just odd I spose. Soccer is better. That's all there is to that.  Time to go...thinking a lot...perhaps will write more later...bye

      So, I just had a wonderfully delicious conversation with Amanda. That child is simply amazing to me. So different, yet so exactly the same. She is what I would be...had I the guts to do so. Waiting for Abs to call...I signed off while typing this...my conversation with Amanda left me connected past our usual phone call time of 9pm. I've already talked to her once this evening...I'm not all that worried. I've realized a several things in the past month or so...  The matriarch~ I need to talk to my mother. In theory to help start our healing process. I so badly want to connect with her. I really hope that I can. I just have to remember that her insults and put downs have nothing to do with me. They are all about her. They serve a purpose for her and pin pointing that purpose, will help to resolve these issues. If I can just have a chance to talk with her. To really talk...perhaps things can work out for the better...  The patriarch~ This weekend, Abigail accompanied my father to Cleveland to help pack up most of my stuff. I tried to stay 'stoic' and 'straight' but it simply didn't happen. It had only been a week since I had seen her, but still I couldn't be *that* close and not express my feelings. Dad seemed to take it in stride. We acted mostly as if we were around her parents...it was nice...no it was fabulous to be that honest in front of my father and it was wonderful to know that he was at the very least, trying not to show any discomfort he might have, and the most, not even having any discomfort.   The sibling~ I wonder how the parents are dealing with Michele's boy. I almost envy the relationship she carries with them. Hell, it can't be much fun from her point of view, but all that making fun and teasing, is something I never had. I hope she knows how significant it is. I'd like to think that she never had a problem with the whole 'gay' thing. She was barely surprised when I told and for the most part has been nothing but supportive since. To me. However, I have a feeling it's still a bit of a sore spot with her. Something she doesn't want to admit, so as not to be seen as some sort of outsider to her peers. I'm not sure she's explained everything to this Matt boy yet. I hope that she does, and I hope that she realizes that, in the end, someone who can't accept me, is simply not worthy of her heart.   This whole gay thing~ I'm realizing just how large a part of ones life their sexuality is and that if they don't match those around them, it's hard to connect on any other level. The relationship I have with my gay friends is entirely different than that of my straight friends. Sexuality is rarely a topic amongst those who 'family'. Sure, there's boys talking about boyfriends and girls about girlfriends, but these are simply taken in stride. I am simply me and I am part of the whole. Around straight friends the air is slightly heavier and a large sign is placed over my head. 'DYKE' I am gay. I am constantly reminded of this and sometimes almost feel I have to prove that I really am a lesbian. Somehow the conversation is always steered back to sexuality and no matter where I was before, I'm pointed to as the outsider. It's strange really, and something I plan to study further over winter break. I'll let you know if I come up with anything...  10pm~ Haven't heard from Abigail yet...perhaps I should start to worry...nah...if she was alone in Cincy, I would, but as she's in Dayton this evening, there are plenty of other things and people to distract her. I'm glad she has her family. I'm glad *I* have her family. In the end, I'm glad I have mine too. I have them to thank for the person I have become.   10:45pm~ Abby called, we had a good talk. Discussed Reno and Amanda, and the fact that while we have a problem with Reno's drinking, we don't with Amanda's. A combination of our trust in her, and the fact that while perhaps it brings her down a notch or two, she's still too high up for one to notice. :-) Reno's just frightfully irresponsible and immature. I hope that one day she gains the wisdom to regret some of her actions. I spose that's enough random babble from me for tonight. I should probably head off to sleep now, or at least do something productive such as...well...packing. I need to do that. I also need to figure out what I'm going to do with the damn mattress and box spring. *sigh* Like I said...I'm outta here...

      So yeah, today has not been fun. Not that it's really been all that bad either, but ugh...I'm just so confused. I don't want to do the few things have on my plate. Once they are done, then what? I'm not sure I can force myself to go find more work at this stage in the game. I spose I'll just eat my lunch and surf the internet for a while. I'll figure out what to do eventually. *sigh* Time to go home yet?

      I blew Abby off on the phone this evening so I could watch a tv show. *sigh* My life is no where near where I want it to be. Not that I even know where that is. I just know that this isn't it. I feel so out of my element here. I'm supposed to enjoy the work I'm doing. Now I simply can't wait to get out. I spose if work wasn't my only life I would be able to enjoy it more. Still, I wonder if I'm even heading in the right direction. I think what scares me the most is I can't imagine myself going anywhere else. Nothing other than a boring engineering job comes to mind when I think of my future. My only joy in life comes from a stupid television program...and my Abigail. She made me these cute little cards. One for each day between now and the next time I'll get to see her. She is just so amazing to me. As you can tell I've been thinking about the future lately. I must admit that every scenario I've ever thought of involves her. I don't even care to *think* about life with out her. Too bad we can't get our act together enough so that we even live in the same city. I love her with all my being. I just wish I could find a way to express it adequately. I wonder if she feels as loved and taken care of as I do. Perhaps the best way to find out would be to ask...however, I've found that trial runs are always a good idea. God, what on earth did I do to deserve her? If I may reflect on the past for a bit...we were 'friends' and then I kissed her, and I told her I loved her. I don't even remember making the decision that changed our lives forever. Hell, I didn't think about any of it. I never even considered the possibility of her following in others footsteps. Leaving me, after the admission of my true feelings. A day or two later, she wrote me a note. I don't remember the specifics, however the gist was...I'm ready to jump. I never thought about the status of our relationship, or even that there was a decision to be made. I had jumped a long time ago, and never bother looked back, or down for that matter. So far in life, I've never had a problem with commitment, or loyalty. However, Abby's talk of commitment ceremonies and babies leaves me, well...typically male. Those ideas have *never* been figured into my equation for life. I've never wanted to have children, then again, I always thought I would be the one to do the 'having'. I never wanted to have a wedding, I don?t like the idea of that much attention focused on me. I think that explains a lot about me right there. I don't think I can say I've ever put my full heart and soul into *anything*, cause then I might get noticed. While at the same time, I'm writing this in an online journal. The wonders never cease...ugh...too much thought for one evening. Time for sleep...

      So, all of a sudden I'm all productive and shit. That's really odd. Not that I'm complaining...just a bit confused. Which I guess isn't really all that new now is it? Ha...it's time for work to be over. Only a little over a week left and I am so counting down the hours. Time has to be spent packing, cleaning, christmas shopping, planning the final details for the Boston trip and probably several other things. A lot of time has been spent thinking about the coming out process. I think I need to work on that this holiday season. I'm out to all of my Dad's side of the family, but I think I should probably work on at least part of my moms. Hell, I need to talk to my mom in general. Find out exactly what she's thinking and feeling, rather than simply assuming that I know what that is. Lack of communication is a big problem in my family. *sigh* Hmm...I spose I should get my butt back to work. Not that I have all that much to do, but I do have some. Sheesh, what are they thinking, giving me work to do...ah well...I'm off...

One of my new favorites:  As usual the door is secured with a muted click and a closing of the eyes finally we face each other bodies sterile for the rites soon she folds me in with coca-cola eyes and the never-ending everywhere kiss  she's always pure in love in anger she's a poet although accidentally she said it's like tasting fire or kissing god   so alive curled in her secret corner i drink the different tears and  afterwards asleep her breath a low whistle i listen long and breathe deep   she's always pure in love in anger she's a poet although accidentally she said it's like tasting fire or kissing god                                      Then harsh light invades we linger and linger until our growling middles force us to rise like mischievous children we clean up our mess and we dress quickly sneaking one last gorgeous glimpse   she's always pure in love in anger she's a poet although accidentally she said it's like tasting fire or kissing god   ~Edie Carey~ Accidental Poet

      Haven't seen me in a while have you? I spose I should apologize or something, but I don't really feel the need to do so. I could claim I've been busy, but in reality, I've just been lazy. My 'To Do' list looks about the same as it did a month ago. I've just returned to the human race. Although, I'm not quite up to 'productive member of society'. Lots to be doing, none of it is getting done. Procrastinate, procrasitnate, procrastinate. I think I may have brought new meaning to the word. Reguardless, life has been moving. I finished diff Eq, two weeks of work remain and I am more than ready for this whole 'winter break' thing. I need to relax, I need to be free of resposibility and most of all I need to be around other human beings. Preferably those I can be myself around. I don't like living alone. *sigh* The semester will be over soon, I have a few weeks to relax and then school. Class, I'm looking forward to that I think. Time needs to be fueled by a gas pedal controlled by me. Faster when it's bad, slower when it's good. I spose that's one of those 'be careful what you wish for' but it's an interesting concept nonetheless.

      So much for my mental note. It lasted a day at least eh? Anyway, I have an hour between classes here, I need to either do my signals homework, or read Othello. I don't think the reading is going to do much good since it's due in less than hour, so I think I'll just stick to signals. Yay. K...I'm off. la di da...

      Perhaps signals will not be as tough as I originally thought. While it's not at all fun subject matter, at least my professor is amusing enough not to make fall asleep and conhearent enough to help me understand what the hell is going on. Thursday is the easy day. Only 2 classes. That's nice. However one of them is Reading Conference. I don't think I'm going to like that class too much. Although I have an odd feeling my prof is either family or bitterly divorced. Miss, I'm Dr. not Mrs. damnit. Whatever.   Spectrum meeting tonight. Could be interesting. Hanging out in the office has been amazingly enjoyable. I think as long as Abby and I are not seen as Lauren's allies we'll be ok. Lauren's been *really* good at making that a hard thing to do recently anyway. Arrogance is not the way to make/keep friends. Anyway, I'll update you on the evenings events tomorrow.   Off to stupid readings conference, wish me luck. :-)

      hmmm...apparently I haven't visited here recently. Oops. Mental note: remember to publish entries in blog. There, that should do it. As long as it doesn't get lost amongst all the other crap roaming around in my brain.  Classes started this week. All I have to say: it's going to be a *very* long semester. Ugh.  La di da, hanging out waiting for Abby's class to end so we can go home. I'm hungry, bored and in procrastination mode. This does not make for a happy Becky. I have homework I could and should be doing at the moment, but 4 chapters of Machiavelli's _Prince_ is more than enough until I can get some sustinance to fuel my overwhelmed and perpetually lagging brain.   My hand hurts. So not used to this whole taking notes thing. Write? You mean like with pen and paper? Huh?  *sigh* of to the parking lot to delve in the world of Machiavelli whilst waiting for my love to emerge...

      Ugh, what a day. Nothing in particular really, just really long. I'm still at school. I think I should have taken the bus home. Waiting for Abby to return from her 'Art of Living Class' so we can go home and eat food. Not feeling all that inspired, but I thought since I couldn't bear to fiddle with that stupid tomcat server anymore I'd move on to something slightly less tedious and brain sucking. I have other homework I should be doing, but miraculously it's really not that much. I've been extremely good this week about getting things done well before they need to be. All that I have left are items due this Friday. Hey, I'm proud, you should be too. :-)   *yawn* I had a lovely little chat with Reno this afternoon. Imed Jen for a brief jaunt through insanity. Brings on thoughts of all past friendships and the comparision to those I have now. I think that they've all served their purpose, things that I needed at the time. But sometimes time gets the better of things.

      Hanging out in a computer lab....story of my life. Only this time, I'm not avoiding anything. At least I don't think I am. While yes, there are other things I could be doing, I don't have the materials to complete any of them. In a way it's nice, at the same time, it's really hard to be unproductive while not procrastinating...if that makes any any sense. It's been an incredibly long day. Especially since it started later than a normal day (yay for Wed). Got a not so spiffy, but perhaps better than I thought I would do Statics exam back and then spent 2 hours studying for my Software Engineering exam. I suffered through Electronics (one of those prof-writes-really-fast-in-green-ink-on-the-board-on-the-opposite-side-of-the-room-while-muttering-completely-incomprehensible-things-that-will-undoubtably-be-tested-upon kinda days) then headed to Software Engineering to take a *really* long exam. It wasn't all that hard, just long and exhausting. I couldn't feel my hand afterward thanks to the four essay questions and my speed note-taking from the class before. Hell, the hand *still* hurts. Then I headed to a completely worthless group meeting for my project in Software Engineering. It might not have been worthless had I not been the *only* one with their previous assignments done. *sigh* I left early and came down to this computer lab to do my additional assignment. Apparently, if you finish your work and someone else hasn't, you get to do their work too. Whatever, it's done and I don't have to worry about it.   Waiting, waiting, waiting...it's not a good sign that I'm still here. Abby was taking an exam...usually she's really fast at exams and seeing as though I have not seen her yet, it must have been a horrid one. *shiver* Poor Abby. Hopefully she'll emerge soon...   Damn...they took spell check away again. Oh well, you'll just have to deal with my lack of spelling/typing skills. I'm off to work on the Spectrum web page...which, since I don't think I've told you before, can be found  urlLink here . Have a good one. . .

Most of that will be over this weekend, then one week of class followed by finals. I would be really excited if I had a place to live during co-op. Too bad that's not quite set up yet. It'll get done, it will all get done and life will be fabulous. I hope...

      So, once again with the "why are people so stupid?" Ugh...no good. Abby and I have decided to be done with Spectrum because dealing with children who think they are adults sucks. Fighting a constant urge to react as a child yourself isn't much fun either. I think the dread before each meeting kinda clued us in to how much it's sucked this semester. Perhaps not that it's sucked in general, just that it has sucked for us and no longer contributes positively to our lives. To me, that says done. So we're going to be, hopefully with the smallest amount of repercussions possible.   What else...my Software Engineering project has kept me rather busy. Along with all the other classes I'm taking this semester. I'm going to try to write more, as the amount of stress I forsee in the future keeps growing. Hopefully I'll be able to curb most of it....  Um...yeah...that's about all I can think of right now...off to learn Statics...*thbbth*

      So I was driving home this evening and my "I'm going to listen to everything on this, in order, from start to finish" mp3 disc started into the folder containing MF's album "Everything I Need". I always forget how powerful her music is until I play something after months of not hearing it. It blows me away everytime. This is one I had completly forgotten about:  Stand Still  Seems my words have gone down with the bottle and my fear is my only defense stand still behind a wall of anger stand still yeah, but i'm still by myself  you can't tell your heart how to feel you can only get out of the way  and it seems as though my pride has wandered yeah, and my voice is false so now i'm left here wondering who it was that i thought i was being when i was being myself  but you can't tell your heart how to feel you can only get out of the way  so now my love she's turned a corner and i'm stuck at a train and it seems as though  my god has got a plan for me but it's different from the plan that i've made  you can't tell your heart how to feel you can only get out of the way you can't tell your heart  how to feel you can only get out of the way get out of the way  ~Melissa Ferrick~

      This is really frustrating. I'm not sure I like this whole Abby having an online portal to her soul. Not that I think she shouldn't express herself in whatever ways she wants, but that I have to make that connection with her through the blasted blog. That I have to read about these life altering battles going on in her head and insightful conversations with her mother, rather than having her tell me about them. Now the fact that this is the second time I've been told of warnings from her mother well after the fact has me slightly worried. This cycle of 'Abby seems happy, Abby talks to mom, Abby's seems unhappy, withdraws from me until some major explosion occurs where she tells me she's been thinking of breaking up with me' sucks. The stupid and seemingly simple solution to this would be: don't let Abby talk to her mother. However, it is so not my place to tell her that. Besides, I respect her mother's opinions. I think she's a fabulous person and if she observed us 24/7 she would hit the nail on the head. But she doesn't. She only sees us together in the unusually stressed environment of being home. Now, I haven't lived as long, or through as many things as Janeth has and in theory, I haven't known Abby as long as she has, but I really don't think Abby is truly the person her mother thinks she is. Therefore, the motherly outlook is skewed with, once again, the corrupt data thing. What really gets me, is that I'm telling this to a computer and not to Abby. I just keep telling myself that if I was actually planning on seeing her, I would talk with her then, but since I'm not and I have an extreme hatred for phones, here I am.  *sigh*      So, the next question on my mind, why is it that we only truly question our relationship when we're living apart? There are several possibilities that I see, some obvious (we see how much better life is without the other), some not so obvious (it's harder to face a break-up when you're truly together and therefore you don't want to think about it, where as while on co-op it seems as though you may have already split). Either way, I'm not sure anything I'm coming up with is truly the answer for us. Probably a large and confusing conglomeration of several factors. I spose then that I take my previous statement back, not enough brain power today to truly have that question on my mind. Moving on.      What else in bouncing around in my head this afternoon...not a whole lot apparently, well once Abby issues are set aside anyway. I spose I should take that as a hint to get my ass back to work. Mark...oh Mark...wherefore art thou? Ugh.

      My Abigail gots herself a  urlLink blog . She's used it to type out all of her emotions from our interactions this weekend. So I guess I'll use mine to do the same for myself.   It's amazing how someone can ponder something that will directly effect someone else for seemingly a long time with out bothering to discuss said things with said person. I realize I'm guilty of it myself, but it's still a shock when the love of your life says "I'm not ready to let go" as if she's been thinking about doing so for a while. Not that I didn't feel her pulling away. But it's only now that I recognize it as that. The biggest issue in our relationship, as well as the entire human race, is communication. She doesn't want to, or can't, or I don't understand what she's telling me she's feeling, so I place what I think she's feeling in to fill in the missing variables and vice versa. This, corruption of data, causes faults later on when actions are taken upon the analysis of the corrupt data. All and all, there is no fix for this bug. The system's design won't allow it. I'm knee deep in some 'workaround' patches though. (Yes, I realized I just placed human interaction into a computer analogy)   I love Abby. It's a fact that can't be questioned. Regardless of what happens in the future, I always will. The question that Abigail has raised though, "Is that enough?" is a good one. We've got the love, but do we have the rest of the necessities needed to sustain us. Are we healthy? Or are we slowly starving ourselves to a point where we will no longer recognize ourselves let alone each other. How do we know which path we are on? And then once we do, decide if its time to make an exit.   From my point of view: I think perhaps I've taken 'us' for granted, at least a little bit. Forgotten, or desperately wanted and tried to forget, that while life, in general, is work, life with someone else is inconceivably harder. Over time we've created an auto-pilot of sorts, she does this, I do that. She says that, I say this. It was inevitable that we would grow out of it and now that we have we need to remember how to adjust, re-learn where and when to roll with the punches, to give slack, or to yank hard. It takes time, as do all good things in life. I need to find the motivation to work at life. Instead of just watching it go by. I need to dig down deep below the depression and apathy to find me again. Find out what I really want and need. Rather than relying on the auto-pilot, parts of which were created so long ago, it's going to be next to impossible to unravel it from my existence.

      Today I'm going to get to play with a $20,000 thermal imaging camera, that is if I can ever get this guy Andy to call me back. At least I think that's his name. If I don't hear from him fairly soon I'll have to call Gary and ask who it was again that was supposed to contact me because he hasn't so I'm going to contact him. If that makes any sense. Other than that I've played go-fer for Gary and chatted with several people abount random things. Very productive day so far. I'll have plenty to do once Scott returns though. I'm not sure I'm really looking forward to that. Then again, that task may be easier than this thermal stuff where I'm going to actually have to know circuit theory. Though I spose while it may be scary now, perhaps I'll actually learn some circuit theory. Bastard Johnson. *thbbth* More office rumors, Gary's quitting and Mark may be applying for his job. I'm wondering where that leaves the co-ops, cause if they think Tony can do Mark's job, they should really think twice.   OK, so that's work. What else is up....oh yeah, NOTHING! Though it is Thursday and that means that I get to pack to go to Toledo tomorrow. Not that Abby will be in Toledo tomorrow, but at least I get to go somewhere and do something. I'm not sure what I'll do all weekend, but I'm sure I can come up with something. Abby will be back Sat evening and then I get to hang there till Monday afternoon sometime. Yay for Memorial Day.

      So I'm out of work until Scott returns and I'm shifting through random blogs on the net. I came across one where a girl was talking about her new tattoo. Seeing as though Abby and I are thinking of getting tattooed for our 21st birthdays I was interested. She had a word, which she did not disclose, tattooed in morse code. Putting a word or phrase in a form that looked more like a pattern sounded fun. Hmm...food for thought...

      Nick and I started our hourly e-mailing up again. Not quite as fun as when we were on the same server and you could e-mail every few seconds, but he's still doing a rather fabulous job of keeping me sane. He amuses me greatly.   So yeah, still living all by myself in a not quite spacious 1 bedroom apartment in lovely Broadview Heights. It's only Wed, yet it feels as if it should be Wed 3 weeks from now. Work is kinda slow at the moment. I'm putting off going to talk to Mark so that I don't have to do work I don't really want to do. I'll have to go evenutally, but what harm could 15 mins do? I spose that could be a loaded question eh? hmm...  So yeah, nothing exciting here. Off to e-mail Nick and then play 'Hunt down the supervisor'

      So, finals are over. 2 went pretty good, 2 went rather bad, the last was a paper. Any points I lost on that paper were covered by extra credit so that was nice. Too bad Signals and Statics weren't. *thbbth* Stupid finals. At least they are over. I finally have a place to live this summer. Dave's working at Cedar Point so Abby will be alone in Toledo. Not really looking forward to the summer. Working and being away from my Abigail. Although 2 hours is better than the 4 we had to travel last Fall. Hopefully I'll find more time to write in this soon. Living alone leaves you lots of time to think. I hate living alone. Ick. *sigh*  Binnie and her friend Sarah are about to invade our apartment. I just have to keep telling myself I like Binnie and sometimes I do, but most of the time I just resent her existance. I want to smack her. Perhaps it's just because she's so comfortable with who she is, and doesn't give a damn what others think. I dislike her, cause I can't be like her? That combined with several other qualites that I find rather offensive could be the source of the ickness. I don't know. Just a thought.   Well then, I think I've run out of things to say. I spose I should try to find something slightly more productive to do with my time. Or perhaps not, SCHOOL IS OVER!!!! :-) hee hee...

       So, I officially changed my blog title to 'So, Blog'. It amuses me. What doesn't amuse me, is powering up an s600, waiting for a light to flash, powering it down, waiting thirty seconds and the repeating...100 times. Yeah, that was exciting, let me tell you. Now, my only task to to read a book called "How to Break Software" *sigh* it's going to be a long hour and a half.

       So, it's Friday. Yeah. That's exciting. Really. If it's after 5pm. Before that, it's torture. *sigh*  My sister returned from Germany last night. Didn't hear from her the whole two weeks she was gone and when she gets back, she returns my phone call on the *same* day. Althogh apparently it's only because Dad dialed my number and tossed the phone at her. Regardless, she called. We chatted briefly and then I went to bed. What do you expect when you call at 10:30? Sheesh. Hopefully I'll get some time to chat with her next weekend, although that's doubtful.  So, I'm getting a cell phone today, or rather Abby is adding a phone to her plan. The 'family share plan'. Doesn't that just smack you in the face and say commitment. In general, I think it's fabulous. In the back of my brain, I'm screaming, what the fuck are you thinking? Ah, who listens to those stupid voices anyway.   So I think I should call this blog 'So, Blog' cause I start every entry, hell every damn paragraph, with the word 'So'. I'm such a dork.  Other plans for the weekend? Michelle Malone and Melissa Ferrick in Detroit on Sat and a lot of time with my Abigail. Yay! Meanwhile, I'm going go find something to occupy me that won't make me feel guilty about being paid $20 an hour.

       So I've been listening to Melissa Ferrick's "Listen Hard" a lot recently. Perhaps that's because it's one of the few CDs I actually have with me in Cleveland, but that's not really the point. When I first listened to the album, I almost hated it. It was so 'pop-y' and the songs that I had heard before and *loved* just weren't the same on the disc and the title, I *hated* the title. It was just horrible. What am I going to do now that woman who's music speaks to my soul the most, is speaking a new language? I guess I just kind of forgot about the album and rarely listened to it, until recently. Now, the album just seems, well, perfect. (as long as you skip 'back in love', I still don't like that song) The title, at first seems to come out of nowhere. Huh? After a few spins, you actually start to learn the lyrics and find the one that seems to have spawned the title in 'You': "Who else would listen? Would listen so hard?". (I try really hard not to read the lyrics until I've memorized the song. This has led to some interesting interprations of what's actually be said, but still, I think you get so much more out of a song by analyzing what you hear, not what you read.) Anyway, so now there's at least a superfical connection from the album to the title. Now, this is Ferrick's first studio album to be recorded in an actual studio since 'Everything I Need'. It's evident immediatly that a *lot* more money was spent on this album than for 'Freedom' or 'Valentine Heartache'. So, initially, it just sounds produced, which in general, is bad. The production on this album has allowed every song to be layered with sound in a way that hides the layers and makes one sound. Well, that's what production is for, right? Maybe, but here, if you 'listen hard' (and wear head phones so you're more aware of the specifc placement of sounds in space) you can hear each layer, and every time you listen to a song, you find a new one. A violin here, organ there, back-up vocals you never noticed before. To me, this is what makes it a great album. Yes, it's 'pop-y', yes there are some *very* superfical (corny?) lyrics, but the music, the music is simply amazing. The disc changes every time you listen to it. This is why I've listened to it 3 times through today, and probably will again tomorrow.

      So, I don't remember if I mentioned it or not, but the people who were hosting my web site, well, they were stupid. So, I'm back to good 'ol *free* geocities. I'm going to see if I can use my domain name (as long as I have it for a year) to point to either the geocities address or to my concentric site, or perhaps even my school account. I'm not sure if it would work out, but it's worth a look into.   Otherwise I've been writing perl scripts, verifying a few random PRs and e-mailing Amanda, Nick and Abby. Nick is always amusing and seeing as though our relationship is largely superficial, there's nothing all that exciting on that front. Although I hear Sum of All Fears is a bad movie, Mark lost his keys and python is an evil language. ;-) Manda is currently experiencing some relationship issues, ie, the one she was in no longer exists. I don't envy her at all. There are times that I wonder whether or not Abby and I will last, whether she's the one that right for me and all that jazz, but I always come back to the fact that she's what's right *now*. The future will always be uncertain and there's really no point in worrying about it. Being proactive against pain and suffering in the future will only help you to miss what's going on in the present. Similarly, being proactive about pain and suffering in the present will, for the most part, only cause more pain in the furture. My conclusion, don't be proactive. Fix what's wrong, not what could be wrong. Worry about what is, not what could be and most of all, be honest about what pain you're feeling currently.  K...I think that's all of my philosophical thoughts for the day.  Kinda sad isn't it? *sigh*  Perl, here I come!

      So...apparently the cat, along with the dishes we put out , has disappeared. It's sad, I really want a cat, but we can't *really* afford to take care of it and aren't *really* supposed to have pets in the building so I spose it's for the best.  Mark has me writing perl scripts. The one I'm working on is almost 300 lines long and only half way through. It's getting tedious as each function does basically the same thing as the next just in different places with different files. Tony had some PR's for me to work on, but I don't know how to verify them and apparently, neither  does he. Mark to the rescue I spose. *sigh*  Tis going to be a long week. I just want to be 'home' in Toledo with my Abby and a cat. :-)

      *sigh* we found a cat. Not just any cat, a kitten. A small, dirty, malnourished and dehydrated kitten with goopy eyes. :-(  I of course, desperately want to keep the poor  thing. Abby at first, was like, hell no, but I think she's pretty much all about the idea now. Even Dave seems to like the idea of having the cat around. Too bad our lease tells us we're not allowed to have pets. *thbbth* Abby's feeding him and keeping an eye out for him, if he's still around in a few days, we may take him in. Goober and me will hang out in Cleveland till August and then we'll hope they don't notice the cat. I guess...whatever. We'll figure something out.   I spose I should get back to work. Not that I really want to, but you know, sometimes you gotta do what ya gotta do...

      It's Friday! Thank God. This week has been less than enjoyable, at least at work anyway. And I've missed my Abby. It'll be nice to feel her touch this evening. *sigh*. I spose I shouldn't think about it too much considering I still have 7 hours of work to go. Ugh.  Spend most of my evenings playing with the website and talking to Abby. I think I'm going to have to learn php. Not all that excited about that one. I spose I could just use perl. At least I have a book about that language and I've used it before. (Thanks Mark, really.) Also going to have to do some searching for some cgi-scripts, or perhaps learn that too. So more transfering to do, mostly from my Ferrick page, but it's up and running for the most part. I think I need a new bio section. Any thoughts? Hee hee...I'm also planning on putting up a comment section here so that, well, Abby, can answer my questions. I also need to help her put up her page. la di da...  Apparently the Sample's will be at my house for the 4th. I'm not sure what I think about that, I'm not sure what my mother thinks about that. According to my father, she hasn't uh, informed, Denise of my uh, delinquent sexuality. Which makes me wonder why. Is she just aftraid to 'come-out' as the parent? Or does she think Denise will take it badly? Ha, of course she thinks that. Everyone thinks that the first few times around. I'm confident Greg won't have any issues and if he does he'll keep them quite. A little worried about *the* 'boy who's heart I broke'. Sorry, Chris, nothing personal. Then there's Jim....*that* could be interesting. Still he's a gentleman and in someone else's house, doubt there would be much of a fuss. Regardless, I think Abby and I will be staying at her parents house. Less people fighting over the shower.     Hmm...I spose I should get back to work. I'm sure there's something I'm supposed to be doing. Later gator...

      I've done a lot of driving lately. It wears on the soul. Too much time to think I spose. My most recent conclusion? Abigail is my knight in shining armor, my soul mate, my forever. I love you...  Lay down now Your mouth is mine Put your arms around me Let's stop this place and time Your hands are on my face There's nothing her Nothing speaks here But truth in this space  Sky above, ground below Your lips move, and my heart lets go  NIght covers us As we undress The quiet is broken By my heart shooting through my chest My legs are heavy, my eyes wide awake I want nothing else out of life But you in this place  Sky above, ground below Your lips move, and my heart lets go  The heat takes over And I lose myself You reach over and say "Hold on to me, hold on to no one else I promise you all of my love" So I take a deep breath And wish upon a stars death  Sky above, ground below You whisper to me "You know this is the real thing" 'N I look in your eyes 'N say "baby I know"  ~Melissa Ferrick~

Anyway, I'll let you know how it goes. Why do I do this to myself????

      So, this morning I received a *very*, shall we say, disturbing forward from someone I graduated with. Not that I hadn't read it before or that I was even surprised by it's content. Anything beginning with, "Billy Graham's daughter..." has to be something that will shake my very existence. In fact, Abby got the same forward from her Great Uncle. Although, I spose it's not quite as horrifying to receive such a thing from an old man. It's a piece of religious bullshit aimed at scaring people into being christian. Be like me, think like me, act like me and no harm will come to you. I desperately want to e-mail this person and give her a taste of what I believe. However, seeing as though I'm well aware of her religious beliefs and her reaction when questioned about them I didn't feel it would be appropriate to e-mail her. She, just like everyone else, is entitled to her beliefs and has every right to express them. However, I have that same right, so I'm venting here. Let's start with the first paragraph of Anne Graham's response to the 9/11 terrorism:   Anne gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said, "I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government, and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand that He leave us alone?"   First of all, god is not a gentleman nor is god male. God is not someone we can talk to, we didn't ask him to do anything. American was founded on the principle of religious freedom. So no, your god, miss Graham, is not in our schools, government, or my life; nor is anyone else's. At least it shouldn't be, but we don't need to get into all the details of how christian our society is.   In light of recent events -- terrorists' attacks, school shootings, etc., I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare complained that she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. (She was murdered and her body was recently found.)   Ok, can we say low blow? Lets find some poor women who was murdered and *happened* to think differently than us and use her as an example to deter people from 'heathanism". [insert eye roll here] Next you'll blame 9/11 on feminists, abortion doctors and gays...oh wait, you already did that.   Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said that we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem. (Dr. Spock's son committed suicide). We said that an expert should know what he's talking about. And we said OK .  So know you're advocating the beating of small children? OK, so I spose that isn't really fair, but seriously, why are you taking another man's pain and using it to further your agenda? This Dr. Spock is just as human as you and did you ever think, that maybe he came to this conclusion *because* he spanked his child and that child later committed suicide? Of course not, there is only one side to every story.   Then someone said that teachers and principals had better not discipline our children when they misbehave. The school administrators said that no faculty member in a school should touch a student when they misbehave because they didn't want any bad publicity, and they surely didn't want to be sued. (There's a difference between disciplining, and touching, beating, smacking, humiliating, kicking, etc.). But we said OK.   Apparently capital punishment is the only form of discipline, and if you're an adult, you can do anything you please to a child or teenager, because obviously you know better. The line must be drawn somewhere and the line that has been drawn seems to minimize the gray area.   Then someone said, let's let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won't even have to tell their parents. And we said OK.   Anti-abortion and pro-death penalty. I will never understand that contradiction on a moral level. It's a woman's choice, damn it. Bodies are not something to own. Someone's parents nor should the government be allowed to tell anyone what to do with their own body.   Then some school board member said, since boys will be boys and they're going to do it anyway, let's give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they want, and we won't have to tell their parents that they got them at school. And we said OK.   Right, cause if you're not getting any, then of course your teenage son can't get any. This is not the dark ages and sex is not our enemy. Teaching children to deal with sex responsibly is the only way to keep teen pregnancy and STDs to a minimum. Humans want to have sex for a reason. It's instinct. It's natural. And it feels good.    Then some of our top elected officials said that it doesn't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. Agreeing with them, we said it doesn't matter to us what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as we have a job and the economy is good.   I don't ask what you do in private, why should I ask what the President does in private? As long as it's not illegal, I don't give a shit. It's their life, not mine. One person cannot represent the ideals and morals of every person in this nation. No matter what the president does, it will offend someone. That doesn't make you special. I mean really, you don't bring up George W's DUI do you?   Then someone said let's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome, down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body. And we said OK.   Ok, so I might agree with you on this one: pornography is not wholesome and down-to-earth. However, it's not wrong. Yes, it may be demeaning to women, but so is the Bible.   And then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then further again by making them available on the Internet. And we said OK, they're entitled to free speech.   First, I believe it is illegal to place pictures of nude children on the internet. Second, free speech can be a bitch when you don't agree with what's being said. It was never used to defend child pornography and have it succeed in convincing the masses. Hello! It's illegal! Third, just for the record someone who enjoys pornography is not necessarily a pedophile. Just as 'a homosexual' is rarely ever a pedophile and not all christians are close minded.    Then the entertainment industry said, let's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. Let's record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said that it's just entertainment, it has no adverse effect, nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.   The entertainment industry makes movies with such things in them because they sell. G rated movies only make money for Disney and the Olson twins. You're all about capitalism right? The music industry...once again, capitalism. They sell what will make the money. Which I guess is your point. We as a people shouldn't want to see these things, but we do. It's called curiosity. It's instinct. Without it, religion never would have been created in the first place.   Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no consciences, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and even themselves.   Interesting your use of the world "our". Their children, but not *your* children, right? Your children were raised with christian values and would never *ever* beat the shit out of the smallest boy in class and call him a fag. They wouldn't commit suicide because they can't bare to dissapoint you by living life as a sinful gay. They wouldn't light Muslim Mosks on fire, lynch a black man, refuse service to someone of a different ethnic background or simply tell a racist joke.    Probably, if we thought about it long and hard enough, we could figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with "We reap what we sow."   Uh...exactly. Hate and intolerance will not pave the path to Utopia. Nor will stripping away the diversity of this nation.   It's funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. It's funny how we always believe what the newspapers say, but always question what the Bible says, or dismiss it as not being pertinent in this modern, space age world.  It's funny how you can send jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding God, people think twice about sharing, and delete them before anyone sees them.  It's funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and the workplace and that's supposed to be all right with us.    I question the newspaper, I question the Bible, the Koran, Budda, Allah, God, my god, my government, myself. That's my job, my duty to myself as a citizen of a nation and human being in a civilized society. You have questioned the laws and have served your duty. I applaud you for that, I just don't agree with your answers. I wonder why the world isn't a happy place to be, but I don't believe god has anything to do with it. Use your God and your lack of obedience to him as your scapegoat, I'm looking for answers to the worlds problems, all the while trying not to place blame. There is no point in trying to place blame when there's no one to place it on. Like you, I believe God should be discussed in public places, amongst people who *want* to join the discussion. I also believe that other religions and belief systems should be discussed in public, but I don't believe that any idea, including my own, should be forced upon any one else.   So these are my ideas, responses to someone else's ideas. I cower here rather than facing those whom I disagree with. However, I have learned that people rarely change their minds or learn something new if they have no intention of doing so. I try to learn from those around me, be open to what they have to say, and then form my own opinion. My biggest criticism for those following organized religion to the "T" is their lack of thought. Spoon feeding the masses will only result in upheaval, look at history, you'll see it. We need to find a way to be united, but not the same. Adhering to Christian ways in not the answer, Nationalism is not the answer, and bombing innocent people is certainly not the answer. Perhaps Ferrick has it right, "Acceptance is the answer". Or, perhaps there just isn't an answer.

      Hmm...archives aren't working again. Why are they so damn fickle? *thbbth* [edited to say: Archives are back...my point exactly!]  I received an e-mail from may father this morning, after he had looked at the changes to my site. There's more, but the important part is as follows:  As for journal entries, I'm glad to see you can express some of your inner self (some people can't begin to describe feelings). I hope you and Abby find ways to communicate more over time so you can assume less, know more and hopefully find out if you're headed in the same direction after college. (will you both want the same city and will you have enough in common for your relationship to survive when your out in the working world at different jobs all day and no longer have daily college life experiences in common? All relationships hit auto pilot from time to time and your problems as a couple of love and wants and needs and parents and attention are not much different than most heterosexual couples your age. The difference is that you also have to sometimes be stronger as a lesbian couple to deal with outside stresses from a society that's not always supportive. The phrase "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" is not always true and long distance relationships have more stress and more communication problems. Overcommunication and lots of tlc is an ideal rule of thumb while you are apart. Assume makes an ass out of you and me. The good news is that questions you are asking will answer themselves over time, the bad news is that it may longer than you want. Anyway, I hope relationships and jobs and life all works out like your hopes and dreams want it to!   He is way cute. I think I'll keep him too. :-) Thanks, Dad!

      So this whole blogger template thing is giving me some issues. It simply won't do what I want it to do. *thbbth*  It looks really funny when you see the page itself, but it's ok when linked from the website. I'm trying to decide if I should lighten that pic any. I think you can read it ok, but if everything else is lighter, should this one be too? I don't know. Not going to worry about it now.  Work all of a sudden got boring. I finished all the interesting work and now all that's left is the stuff I'd rather not do. Ugh...As much as it pains me, I should get back to it though. *sigh*

      Ok, so I'm working on a new webpage scheme. I know, I just changed it...what...last time I was on co-op? Whatever, I was bored. I learned a lot about style sheets and frames and tables and stuff when I was working on the  urlLink spectrum page  and on my software eng project. So, I have 3 different, although kinda the same designs set up at the moment.   The  urlLink first  one I made is closer to what I've done in the past. I think the sides and stuff are messed up so I can use some of the files. I hadn't really decided what to do for the back ground anyway.  urlLink Let me know  if you have any thoughts. ( I spose I'm making the rather large assumption that people actually read this...but go with me here...)   The  urlLink second  page is pretty cool I think. I haven't decided what to do with the main page section...color etc. Nor have a made a nav bar, but it will probably just be links along one of the sides.  urlLink Any thoughts?   The   urlLink last  page is a lot more image intensive, but it shouldn't be too bad once you get them loaded in the first place. There's info on the page as to what I'm thinking about it, but to reiterate, there was supposed to be a top frame, but the pictures weren't matching up right and it was driving me insane, so I nixed it. I also need a nav bar for this one, probably an image map on left side. (less picture there, and besides, it's fun to be different) Um...yeah...let me know if it shows up, more or less, as one large photo. ie the 3 images match up. They fit perfectly on my computer, but I have no idea what would happen on different resolutions/moniter sizes. (probably get really fucked up...ha...Uh yeah...don't try to look at them if your resolution isn't 600X800 ouch...)  So yeah...that's how I've spent my evening. I don't think there's anything else to report. Over and out.

      I love music that makes you think. When it hits home, seeming to express everything you're feeling. This one came close to doing just that this afternoon:  Never Be Back  You and I for so many years It's just not that easy to pack up the tears and the pain And forget  We just can't end it when I'm not through with it yet  We build our walls and divide And it's so much simpler when we don't have to decide  Who is right . . . as if it matters There's never any doors and we've burned all our letters  But it's wrong To live life without you It's gone, I know it's gone  But I can't let it go Knowing it will never be back  You and I through so many fights And it's not about the one that we had the other night It's the ones we've never had When you close your eyes to me and pretend you're not mad  But it's wrong To live life without you It's gone, I know it's gone  But I can't let it go Knowing it will never be back  What if this is our one chance  What if it's a test  And we failed We failed  You and I for so many years It's just not that easy to pack up the tears and the pain And forget  We just can't end it when I'm not through with it yet  And it's wrong To live life without you It's gone, I know it's gone But I can't let it go Knowing it will never  Well I can't let it go Knowing it will never I can't let it go Knowing it will never be back Knowing it will never be back  ~Lori McKenna~

      *sigh* Life is rather boring at the moment. I don't have much to do at work, although I guess I'm supposed to have things to do, cause Mark simply ignores me when I ask him for more tasks. There's no Abby in my apartment either, that's no fun. With no computer at home and being off on assignment in Michigan somewhere for work, I only get to talk to her for a short amount of time over the phone. It doesn't make for a happy Becky, or a happy Abby I suspect. We're heading home this weekend and staying at her parents house. Due to previous events I'm a little nervous. Nothing like deliberating putting yourself someplace you know others don't want you to be. I spose it's not *really* that bad, but if feels like it. It's hard to know that the most important person in your life, has a very important person in her life who doesn't think you should be the most important person in her life. (If you got that the first time through, A+ for you!)  Ugh, why the hell isn't life simple????  On a lighter note, I decided I need to get my hair cut again. Ok, so I watch the Matrix last night and went back to wanting Trinity's hair cut. Although I spose you we're privy to the changes in who's hair I wanted, but they happened and now I'm back where I started. Regardless, this weekend, Abby and I are getting our hairs cut. :-)  I spose that's all I have for now. I spose I should go back to looking busy. I've gotten rather good at that. Sheesh.

       So, I was watching  urlLink Boston Public  last night  (Note:  This isn't a *normal* occurance, but since when is my life on co-op 'normal'?)  and the  urlLink episode  got me thinking a bit. One of the issues covered dealt with race and the use of the 'n-word' by the African American culture and how it's ultimately different when used by a white person *despite* the context in which it is used. I'm not sure how I feel about the whole 'reclaiming' of words. On the one hand, I use hateful words in a 'loving' context all the time, 'dyke' being top on that list. On the other, is that a good thing?  Does 'dyke' have the same overall connotation of hate that 'nigger' does. No. Should we place words such as these all under the same umbrella of 'don't go there' despite the level of hate behind them? Yes. Because, ultimately I feel the same horrible things when I'm called a 'dyke' as some else would were they called a 'nigger' or 'fag'. In the end, I don't care what you call me. The hatred one may feel for me is based on them, not me. However, mental rationalization only soothes the initial pain.    So would using the word more help to desensitize the word? Ease that initial pain? Perhaps, for an individual, but not on the whole. So what can help the whole cope with the hate? Beats me.   Personally, I think that I should use certain words a lot less. Mostly, because even if the person it's directed at is 'family' they may not place the same 'okness' on words that I do. And in the end, there's always people who will over hear and take things out of the all important 'context'. Spreading hate is not something I think that I do, but in the end, I'm just as human as the next guy and perhaps even less aware of the damage I can cause.

       Have I mentioned that I'm bored?  Work is once again moving oh so *very* slowly. I don't have a lot of work to do and what I do have to tedious and boring and of obvious unimportance: "Here, do this so you'll stop bugging me for work." *thbbth*  On the plus side, it's Friday. Even better? I get to see my Abigail in approximatly 4 hours. And the Icing on the cake? I don't have to drive anywhere. Yay! :-) Trekking all over the states of Ohio, Indianna and Michigan has been fun. Really. I've met fabulous people, hung with those I love and had lots of fun. But, the driving gets old after awhile. It may not have been so bad if I didn't have such a long commute to work, but I do so it is. So yeah, I'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend with my Abigail, sans driving 2+ hours.  In other news, speaking, as a co-op mind you, in front of the person that owns the company you work for is *not* fun.

       Nothing to do, nothing to do. *sigh*   Such a long day this has been. 1/2 hour to go. That's not too long right? Uh-huh...  I'm so bored, I can't even come up with something to write about. Usually there's something. I mean really, I'm not *that* much of an airhead am I? Don't answer that...  Fan-fiction has scrambled my brain. Remind me to try to break my addiction to it. Soon.  La di da. Mark is a bastard.  I'm currently on the look out for inspiring quotes/lyrics that would make good steps.  urlLink Let me know  if you have any suggestions.  The internet is not a good place to find someone to teach your gf how to improvise fiddle tunes.  10 min down, 20 to go.  Manuals on version control are boring. So are books called "Surviving the Challanges of Software Testing: A People-Oriented Approach".   urlLink This site  is good for hours of entertainment. Just be careful not to laugh out loud when you're supposed to be working.  A discman without batteries is not at all helpful in eleviating bordem. Not matter how many times you change the batteries around, it's still not going to work. Promise.  Clicking the 'Check Mail' button will not necessarily provide you with e-mail. In fact, it usually doesn't.  20 down, 10 to go. :p  Apparently 'Trading Spaces' isn't all it's  urlLink cracked up  to be.   urlLink Today's list  is really very amsuing. But I think you have to be Abby or I to really get the full effect. Sorry.  E-mailing Nick keeps me sane. Or perhaps it's what keeps me insane. Either way, Nick is good peoples.  Eek. I can't take it any more. I'm going home now. 6 min early. *thbbth*

A link for  urlLink this , a link for  urlLink that , but really, I'm not sure I could come up with that many  urlLink different  links, or places to use them that  urlLink make sense .

       I keep thinking...   However, a good thought process has been hard to come by recently. When they do, they've been expressed in the form of coversation and lost to the oblivion that is communication. Nope, no hard core thinking here. Not that I've had much reason to. Lots of 'just getting by' going on. "If I can just make it through this, then I can work on that." That's how one misses out on life kids. Must remember to not think that way. ha. Easier said than done.   At any rate, lots of inconsequential activity here since my last post. All that really matters is that I've been happy.   Happy is good. Different, but good.

       So, it's been a whole year since my first post here. Seems so much longer. My brain is really not quite up to anything philosphical. Perhaps it's all the grunt work I've had to do the last few days. Not that I'm complaining too much. Brainless activities are always much easier to complete near the end of a co-op term. Almost like 'seniorits'. Your brain just shuts down. 11 and half more days to go. I can make it.   My parents are coming up this weekend for Toledo's 'Rib-off'. I invited my Dad so that I could spend time with him around his birthday. I knew that my mom and sister would be tagging along as well, but I wasn't aware that 2 aunts and grumpy grandfather were part of the package. It'll be interesting having Mom's side of the family in the apartment. They have to know, right? *sigh*

       So, busy is an absurd substitute for the correct adjective that would describe my life. Since classes started I've barely had time to breath. *sigh*  Class starts in approximately 15 min....what all can I cram in here in that amount of time? Not a whole lot I spose. 18cr hours of eng courses has rotted out the creative side of my brain. If I'm not in class, I'm doing homework, if I'm not doing homework, I'm eating or sleeping. Being bored is actually welcomed at this stage in the game. 2 exams tomorrow. Studying for those is my task this evening. Really exciting stuff....*really*. Off to class...

       *sigh* Today is not going well. I can't place my finger on exactly why today isn't happy, but it isn't. Lots of dumb things adding up to "blech!". Up late last night, running late this morning, class being dumb, Abby mad at me, Nick not being prepared, the office being locked, spilling food on myself...*sigh*. So the day goes. After class I'm going to go home and be productive. I think that will help. If not, I'll just take a nap. Naps are good, though they usually don't help bad days...only allows for them to fester until I'm awake again to fufill the need to be crabby. Sheesh.   CHIC (Crazy Homo's in Costume) Halloween party this evening. AKA Spectrum meeting. Could be frightening, but not in a good way. I'm not sure I can handle such things this evening. I spose we'll find out soon enough.   Off to Microsystems...Yippie Skippy!

       So, now that I've returned from the depths of the Microsystems Lab...   I can finally get caught up in the 4 *other* classes I'm taking. *sigh* Apparently we're not supposed to have other classes. Just Microsystems. I spent 5 hours in the lab yesterday, skipping 3 classes to do so. Add on top of that the time I've spent on that class over the entire week and you're 10 hours short of a full time job, with no pay. I never would have guessed we only had 3 days of classes last week. Seemed more like 10. Sheesh. In reality, I enjoy Microsystems. I would much rather be spending my time on that class than any of the others, just not *that* much time. Now I'm behind in the rest of my classes and feeling overwhelmed. There's never time to catch your breath. The second round of midterms is just around the corner, followed by more Micro Lab deadlines and eventually finals. It'll all be over soon, right?  So, Abby and I went to a Halloween party last night. The first social gathering I've attended in well...I'm really not sure, it's been a while. Regardless, it's the first 'party' I've been to in at least a year. (with 'party' being defined as one which serves alchohol) I was reminded, once again, of all the reasons I've chosen not to drink. Anyway, the real point in bringing up the costume party was to share this little antedote:  Tom:  So, what's up that's not engineering related?   Abby and I:  Blank stares. Exactly. The party was fun though. Abby danced with Tom (careful not to step on the guy passed out on the floor) and I spent time chatting with Tree and Mike and other random party goers. Socializing is good, on occasion.  In other news, Abby and I are hosting a party this Friday (notice the lack of quote marks). True to our style, the main event will be the viewing of "The Princess Bride". We're rather excited. Mostly because we're planning on this being a party with our *friends*. Not hosting a Spectrum event or any such nonsense, simply all the people we like in our apartment watching a fabulous movie. It's been awhile since something like that has occurred. Invintees include Nick and Chaz and Tom and a group of cool people we met through Spectrum meetings (most of whom are actually straight, go figure). Hopefully Dave will clean the bathroom and it will be a fabulous event. I'll keep you posted. Though, I'm not sure I'd count on it.  Well, I have at least another hour to kill. Then off to the football game. I came to school to get homework done while Abby attended the UTEC tailgate. I haven't been quite as productive as I had intended, but I did complete my Electronics homework. That leaves Mirco lab, Micro homework, Energy Conversion and well, learning E-mag and Electronics. I can do this. I can. *sigh*

       So have you writting in your Blog recently?   Yeah...right. Like I have time to do that. Although obviously I found time now. Procrastinating is bliss. I've forgotten what it's like.  "The difference between almost completing something and actually completing it is infinite." I know because I feel so much joy when I pick up my palm and check off a homework assignment and I don't when I look at my to-do list and think "Oh, I worked on that" Check "Wait, it's not quite done yet." Uncheck. *sigh*  I spose I should get to working on the 30 page lab report I should be writing. However, that's much easier said than done. Especially when the report in question isn't due until *after* fall break. Wed by 5pm, but it's still *after* fall break. I think that's just plain evil.

       Killing time in computer lab   It's been a while since I've had to do that. Yay for Thanksgiving break.  Hmm...I don't think I have anything else of substance to say. My creative brain cells have all been smashed into some dark corner to make room for assembly coding, feedback circuits and induction motors. Sheesh.

       So, I think today counts as a bad day   Taking a hard test, getting a test back (with bad results), a pop quiz, unreliable/crappy lab equipment that causes your code to think it can jump into no man's land whenever it wants and trying to do homework *no one* understands...all these icky things happened today. Therefore, I deem today "Becky's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day".

       Why is it that people want others to be the same as them? And if they are not the same, they are inherently bad people? I just don't understand. People are different, and they should be, but they are all still human. A person who has the right to just as much repsect as you do.

       So I'm currently ignoring Electric Energy Conversion   Sure, I have a midterm in that class tomorrow, but who really cares about AC motors and magnetization curves anyway? Right? Right.   So, I was assigned two more homework assignments this afternoon. That makes 4 homeworks and 1 midterm during a week where there are only two days of classes. What are they trying to do? Kill us? Sheesh.   In other news, Geoff's mother passed away yesterday. This event, along with Janeth's birthday on Sat, has prompted us to head home for the weekend. Hanging out with Abby's parents comforting and celebrating will be good I think. I also made plans to do some sibling bonding with Michele. Should be a nice breather, not that I can really afford one quite yet. The only problem? This trip will cause us to miss Spectrum Game Night on Friday. Which is only really a problem because it's supposed to be at our apartment. *sigh* I don't think it's all that big a deal, it hadn't really been advertised yet. At least not much. Perhaps Tom will be able to have it at his place and it can go on in our absence.   Speaking of Spectrum,  urlLink David's LiveJournal  has been causing a stir lately...with good reason I suppose. As an online journal writer, I must defend his right to free speech. He can say whatever the hell he wants to say. Sure, his words aren't based in any reality I'm aware of, but they're still  urlLink just words .

       Online journal's aren't meant to be used to bash others   And that's all I really want to say. I spose I could put in a disclaimer about how I've done it before and that was bad and blah, blah, blah, but I don't want to because that's not my point. ONLINE JOURNAL'S ARE *NOT* YOUR PERSONAL PUBLIC BEATING GROUND! So just don't do it ok? Sheesh.

       So, last night's meeting was interesting. I guess interesting is the right word. All I know is there was enough crap to keep me on edge for the next week or so. I really need to figure out how to let things roll off my back, instead of having them roll around in my brain leaving me perpetually pissed off. I can't think about anything else, and right now, I really need to be thinking about school, not how dumb people are. What messes with my brain even more? I know I can't do a damned thing about any of it and in the end, I'm hurting myself more than anything else.

       Classes are stupid   Today Dr. Smith pushed back our exam...again. And he tried to assign a 'new' homework set that consisted of all the problems we just turned in. Sheesh. I'm going to have to take the time to learn all of that stuff...god knows he's not teaching any of it.   Speaking of dumb classes...Dr. Salari's Probabilistic Methods exam this morning was hell...unless you wrote down the right example/homework problems on your half sheet of paper. Luckily I did. (4 out of 5) That man doesn't teach either...however there's no point in learning any of it when his tests come straight out of the book. Why do we have to take that class again? *sigh* I should have just stuck to CSE courses...  I think that's all...off to main campus to hang out and such before coming back to class and then homework all evening. Spectrum tonight. Safe Sex education and officer nominations. BTW...we now need 5 new officers...Sheesh.

       One down, one to go...for this week at least   The week from hell continues: exam #2 tomorrow morning, hmwk due in the afternoon and then another hmwk due Friday.  Saturday and Sunday will be spend on Microsystems: Lab 3 report and Lab 4 program. Did I say week? I meant two weeks: Mon: hmwk due, Tues Lab report due, Wed Exam, Thursday hmwk due, Friday Exam. Happy happy, joy joy!

       I should have done more homework this weekend...   I guess I just didn't realize how much there was. *sigh* We're 15 pages into our micro lab report...that's good right? I still have that to finish plus 3 assignments and 2 exams, all by Thursday. Yippee! So yeah, school's my life...but what's new?  Looks like I'm going to be Webmaster again for Spectrum. I'm not exactly looking forward to it, especially if next semester's course load is as bad as this one. But I think it will be good, as long as I can keep it from becoming a "task".   Day at Abby's Dad's house was uh...relatively uneventful. Not at all fun, but it could have been much worse. I best be off to class. Yay E-mag! Sheesh.

       A few edits to my ramblings last night (they make sense now, or at least more sense) and a comment on the comment system: For some reason Enetation thinks it's Nov 10th. I thought that maybe the time zone settings were just screwed up, but I checked and they seem to be right. Maybe it's a conspiracy or something...the English are messing with our minds. Sheesh...I guess just don't expect the time and date to be correct. And that's all I have to say about that.

       Sometimes I dislike myself   Although, who doesn't right? Everyone has moments in time when they think "I'm scum". Moments when we wish we were different in some way. Better than who we are. Thing is, these changes can never *really* take place. You are who you are and that's that. When one can accept that, in theory, they will no longer wish they weren't themselves. The trick is to actually believe that.   I think that people can change. Change is a basic part of life. Things happen that cause other things to happen and with this chain reaction, something will inevitably be changed forever. But I don't think people can choose to change. Change happens *to* them. Which leaves me in conumdrum. What should I do when I find myself saying "I'm scum!". I can't say, "I don't like that, I'm going to change it" because I don't believe people can choose to change. Therefore, I gain no comfort from such words. So I'm left with nothing. I'm hanging out, waiting for change to find me.   I think the ego is a weapon of mass destruction. Used by people to tear eachother down. If it were just me, I would be god to myself. Perfect in every way. I would be happy. Perhaps. As I stand now, surrounded by other egos, I feel inferior. I have yet to find what is it that *I feel* distinguishes me from everyone else. I saw a bumper sticker the other day "Remember you're unique. Just like everyone else". I find truth in that. In the end, when you boil it all down, we're all the same. We're all of one...something or other. Connected by six degrees of seperation, the earth, the universe. There's something out there that defines me. I'm still looking for it, I think I will be for all enternity.  Sometimes I dislike myself. Sometimes I wish had done something different. Said this instead of that. My worst nightmares consist of embarassment and humilliation. I fear I will say something stupid. That people won't like me. I've somehow left myself to the mercy of others. I have to remember not to let others control me. To live for myself, rather than for the praise of others. I'm worth the air I breathe, and most importantly, so is everyone else.

       Intra-personal relationships are...well, interesting   So is it intra or inter? Whatever...the point is, I've been thinking about how it is people interact. What is it that causes us to like some people and dislike others? What causes me to be drawn to some people and yet desperately want to get away from others. How is it that those feelings can reverse themselves in a matter of seconds? Is it emotional and therefore simply chemical? Personality clashes? Completely based on past experience? What about the whole first impression thing? *sigh* I think this thought process is bigger than myself. Probably shouldn't attempt it at 11:30. Then again, that's probably why I'm still wide awake.

       Stressed? Who's Stressed   Between school and the newly aquired  urlLink Spectrum issues  life has been interesting.   I sent David an e-mail. He insisted on talking about it. He came here, we talked. I neglected to tell him what I *really* thought and all was well. I have yet to figure out what color lens it is that he looks through, but it's not even close to mine.   Two midterms next week. Both in classes I'm currently behind in. At least e-mag was moved back a week. Massive Micro Lab report to write, plus general homework and studying. Should be a fun filled week to say the least.  Binnie's coming up Sat and Sun we're going to visit their father and aunt. I can't say I'm looking forward to it, but I think Abby would really like me to be there for her and I *really* want to be there for her. I'll let you know how it goes, but just a forwarning...it has disaster written all over it.   Movie night tomorrow. Yay for social gatherings. Hopefully it won't turn into one huge bitch fest. Regardless, it'll be fun.   I'm off to check on the Abmeister...she's not feeling well this evening. :(

       So it's a little late but...   I got an e-mail from Amanda. How much does that rock? She got our package and had a fabulous birthday. We need to figure out how to go visit her. Hopefully we can keep up communication like we did this summer...I miss Manda. :(  Speaking of e-mail, I got a really random one from my father this morning. It was good and it made me smile. Still, he's an odd guy. At least I can appreciate his 'oddness', though a little less of it might not be all that bad.  Not too much else exciting here. People are being idiots. Class this morning sucked. Class this afternoon will probably suck again. Ah...such is life. Off to e-mag! Yippie Skippy.

       Surfing the web...   I did some legitimate web surfing this evening. Something I haven't done in while. Mostly read blogs. I love reading blogs. Makes you feel like you're socializing...without the pain of actually doing so. Fun sites I discovered/re-discovered:   urlLink Story People   urlLink Nobody Here   urlLink Happy-Clicker   urlLink SeanShannon.org   The last is the personal site of someone I know. I actually mentioned her previously in a not exactly positive post. *sigh* Sean is an amazing person. I'm not sure how it is she makes it through life. I don't think I could were I wearing her shoes. However, I find it next to impossible to socialize with her. I blame a combination of differing interests and lack of skill in such areas on her part. I spose I should also include my non-existant skill in small talk and other such pleasantries. Whatever the issues truly are, I hope that at some point, if only for a few minutes, they can be overcome. I'd like the chance to add a piece of her to my existance.

       Sometimes I hate the internet...   Our party this evening made it on to the Spectrum website. Just the fact that it's happening, none of the details. Still, it's pissy that Sean posted about it. It is so *not* a Spectrum event. If it were, it wouldn't be at our apartment.  The icing on the cake, a particular president dissed my Abby in his online journal. I know I shouldn't read it. All it'll serve to do is piss me off, but he's the one that put it in his profile. At any rate, he is a very political individual, which is fine, for him. However, there's no need to shove those polictial, or any other, views down other's throats. He has no respect for the opinion's of others and asserts his as the view of the group. That's just not cool in my book.   It's been hard to be a part of Spectrum this semester. Though I spose it's been easier than last. I know it's important to be involved, even if it is in the smallest of ways, but I'm just not sure I want to deal with it any more. *sigh*

I'm off to Detroit to hang with mom's family for 3 days. Supposedly everyone, even Johnny, will be there, at least for dinner tonight. Now *that* should be interesting. Mostly I'm just excited to get to hang out with my sister for more than 20 min at a time. Back to cleaning the apartment and otherwise getting ready to leave for a week or so...

It's always fun when you take a test that has a problem that *no one*, (even the smart guy) knew how to do. *sigh* At least we're all in the same boat.   I finished the take home portion of my e-mag final today as well. Heading to school tomorrow to turn that in (why didn't he make it due when we took the final???) and spend time studying for the two exams I have on Wednesday. Yay party! Off to pretend I have nothing to do...

       Late Night TV Rots the Brain   Have you ever thought that maybe people are watching *you* on tv? That once a week, someone, somewhere, tunes in to laugh and cry with you? Maybe you have your own show, or perhaps you're just a supporting character in someone elses. Maybe you're simply an extra; Girl #1, Boy #35. Have you ever thought that maybe pepople aren't watching you on tv? That your program is *so* boring that it should have been cancelled years ago? Maybe you don't make for a loveable character. Maybe people don't love to hate you, they just hate you. Have you ever thought about that? What kind of tv show your life would make? No? Perhaps you should, it could change your life.

       Life, in it's most basic sense   There's not much to say at this point in time. However, I felt the need to type *something*. Not sure why, but it's there. I am suitably happy with life at the moment. Sure, there are bits of drama and stress weaved in between the fibers of my happiness, but I don't think I'd have it any other way...much more interesting, not to mention the sweeter taste of the good things in life. I've been thinking recently, about the person I was in high school, about what life for me was like then. How, every once in a while, the person I was then still finds her way to the surface of who I am now. I can't say I'm entirely different, but there is enough of a difference to allow me to deal with my emotion in a much healthier fashion than she ever did. To me this is the key to happiness, knowing when to dwell on an emotion, when to deal with it and move on, quickly, and most importantly, when to ignore it, completely, for the time being anyway. At the very least, its the main difference I see between her and me. I am, for the most part, no longer a pack rat of feelings. I actually deal with emotion, instead of ignoring it, I can relate to others for reasons other than to simply seek their acknowledgement of my existence and the biggest achievement? I have grown to the point where I can say that I am happy, and not be lying about it.

       Toledo Museum of Art   So, yesterday, a group from Spectrum went to the art museum. I don't always enjoy the museum, especially with a large group of people. However, I must say I did have fun. We even managed to catch a performance of "Sing Out Toledo". (Obviously, we have superior gaydar. ;) Abby is now more sure than ever of her plans to become an Industrial Designer. I'm really excited for her. It's not often that a possible career choice sticks around for more than a week or two. : )  1 week till finals, 2 till the semester is officially over. Stress abounds. Yay! Not much else of consequence here. Off to engineering...

       Somtimes people surprise you. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they act exactly how you expect them to. When that happens, it's very disappointing. I like to think that overall, people are decent. They are aware of what's acceptable human interaction and what's not. That people are in the end, just human, and in this country, enjoy the same rights you do. Sometimes I don't understand others. Sometimes that causes friction, drama. Sometimes I don't deal with such things as I should. Others probably encounter the same difficulty. Still, I just don't understand. It doesn't make sense.

      *sigh* It's been a long week. Insomnia sucks. So does homework you have no clue how to complete. Sheesh.  On more exciting note, I added a bunch of stuff to the  urlLink writings  section. Surf on over and check it out.  Spectrum meeting tonight. I can't say I'm looking forward to it. I mostly just want to sleep. Sleep is good. Off to check on dinner...

       It's Alive, ALIIIIIVVVVE!   Well, not quite, but it does work, *perfectly*. Nick and I *finally* completed our Microsystems lab project. We are the proud parents of a happy, healthy, fully integrated, i80C186XL based micro system core complete with memory testing software. We rock! :) Now all we have to do is write *another* report about it. Sheesh.

       Productivity is good...   So, it seems I've been rather productive this evening. Sure, none of it was homework, but it was all stuff that needed to get done: Specturm page updates (there's always more of that, but I think I'm done for the evening), bootleg trading stuff, b-day stuff for my sister and getting stuff together to mail to my dad. Fun, fun, fun.  I sort of went into hibernation over break. I greatly enjoyed the time away from my computer, school work and all other responsibilities. I completed only the bare minimum of everything I had to do. Of course that means there's more to do this week, but it's not all that bad. At least comparitively.    Upcoming events:  Homework Spectrum stuff Christmas shopping/making Studying for finals Taking finals RELAXING! (if you call hanging out with my family relaxing...)

       I feel all out of sorts today. Nothing has gone wrong per se, but it seems as though there are too many possibilities for something not too. I should have done this or that. Why didn't I think of such and such before. All of a sudden I feel as though I'm supposed to run a marathon and oops...I forgot to train.

       A Sense of Emptiness   Dave's been gone for almost a week. I still pull up to the apartment and look for his car. Open the door and look for signs that's he's been there. It's odd really. We never saw all *that* much of him. With him working nights and whatever else. Still, I miss his presence. Good friends are hard to find. We haven't heard from him since Abby dropped him off at the airport. I hope everything is ok. As ok as it can be when you're being sent to war. *sigh*

       Nothing like boredom to make you want to write in your journal. ; )   Abby and I went to see "The Hours" last Friday evening. I must say, that if you haven't seen it, you should. It's the first movie I've seen in a long time that provoked discussion *before* leaving the theater seats. Lots of story-telling through set-design, costumes and other on-screen images. Fabulously emotional scenes with good thought provoking dialouge. I think I need to see it again though. After reading some reviews and talking to people, apparently I missed some things. Next on my list of "things I would like to do but probably won't get to them" is to read the book.   I've reached the point in my up and down and this way and that cycles of my life where it's time to get healthy. Not "go on a diet", cause I have no need to loose weight. Mostly I just want to stop eating quite so much fast food, exercise a bit more, and perhaps build back up some of the muscle I used to have...should be interesting.

       Computer lab time again...this time I'm in one of the older labs. Yes, the computers are slightly slower here, but the satifaction from the older, 'clicker', keyboards is well worth the extra processing time.   Classes are going well. I'm praying for a smaller homework load this semester. Looks like it will happen, aside from the usual frenzy that always comes at the end of the semester. Went to guitar class this morning...I call it my crap class, which, compared to the others I spose it is, but I'm thinking that in the end, I'll be spending the most time on that course. Simply because it's productive and infinitly more fun.  It's amazing how fast the semester got under way. There's already stress, though very little of it is school related. Learning new schedules, last minute meetings, figuring out who needs the car when, completing tasks that should have been done over break, dealing with people again...fun fun fun. The weekend can't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned. *sigh* Off to class...

       I'm the midst of a break between classes. An hour seems like such a long time when faced with it while having nothing to do. I'm sure this time will come in handy in the future, but in the meantime...I'm bored.   I've sat through 3 of the 5 classes I'm taking this semester. So far so good. The first is "Group Guitar for Non-Majors". It looks like it will be good, by then end I'll have enough knowledge to actually play songs. Unfortunately, it may be more work than I was hoping for it to be. The nightmares of the playing tests gone by have returned to haunt me. The second, "Feedback Control Systems" won't be cake, but it's most basic sense is a subject I actually enjoy. The course is being taught by a professor that a. I'm not scared of and b. teaches to my learning style. The third course, "Communcation Systems" is based off the same subject as the previous course. The professor, however, is one I've never had before. He's a short, balding (with a lovely comb-over), slighly hyper-active, Korean who, while his english is good, seems to forget at least one syllable when pronoucing multisyllabic words. I don't think it will be impossible to understand him, but it is certainly going to take some time. I like his teaching philosophy...it should be good, provided I can learn to follow him. The last two courses are "Real-Time Embedded Systems" taught by the most fabulously boring Dr. Stuart (of "Electric Energy Conversion" fame) and "Digital Design" taught by a prof whom I've never had before. Embedded systems may get the axe this semester...as I've learned it will be taught in the fall by a professor whose reputation is much less devilish. I don't know...we'll see how things look @ 4:15.

       As winter break comes to an end...   I'd just like to say, that it was no where near long enough.   I spent *way* too much time in a car driving all over the midwest. A brief summary can be found below: Toledo, Ohio to Detroit, Michigan Detoit to Dayton, Ohio Dayton to Toledo Toledo to Alma, Michigan Alma to Macinac Island, Michigan Macinac to Toledo Toledo to Dayton Dayton to Bloomington, Indiana Bloominton to Dayton Dayton to Toledo *All traveling done between Dec 22nd and Jan 7th...  In other news, Dave's been called up for possible active duty. He's flying to Minnesota tomorrow for training, followed by either deployment to god knows where or a ticket home. So much for classes this semester.   Not much else exciting at the moment. Classes start on Monday. I'll let you know how it goes...

I think, for once, I'm going to have a stress-free week before Spring Break. What a concept.  The plans for Spring Break in Toronto are being finalized. Looks like it's actually going to happen. Sweet! Abby and I will be in Canada for the 4 year mark....    "Four Years Dude! Four Years!" :)

       A Simple Act of Kindness   This morning, as I was preparing to leave for class, I heard a car, stuck in the snow, desperately trying to get out. I watched the blue geo for several minutes, as the tires spun. Eventually, the owner got out and placed his car mats under the tires in an attempt to extricate the little blue geo. No go. He's sitting in his car seemingly wondering what to do next when a beat up chevy pulls up next to his car. The owner of the chevy rolls down the window speaks, rolls the window back up and pulls his car to the side of the road, his intent clear. The man in the geo gets out and places his floor mats back in his car, exchanges a few words with the chevy owner and returns to the driver seat. With a push on the back of the geo, and rev of the engine, the car is free from the piles of snow. The driver waves to the man behind his car and drives off. The owner of the chevy, waves back and returns to his car, starts it and drives off.

       MBLGTACC - AKA Big Gay Conference   Last Friday, after a 2 hour lab (who has lab @ 5:30 on a Friday night???? Sheesh), Amy, Nate and I drove to Columbus to join the others at the 2003 midwest bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, ally, college conference. This years theme "Loving with Pride". (How appropriate for Valentine's Day weekend...) There we listened to speakers, attended a Drag King show, a Toshi Reagan and Dar Williams concert, participated in several workshops and overall, had a grand time. (We'll just for get driving around columbus in a level 3 snow emergency looking for someone to fix the hole in my tire.)

       I've spent a lot of time over the last few days simply writing. Trying to express what I'm feeling, what I'm not feeling. An attempt to keep myself moving, afloat in the river of life. Most of what has come out has been crap, which only seems to make things worse. I'm currently living in a sphere of apathy. Any emotion or action that would force me to reach out side of that sphere has been impossible. One should not despair though, the space I'm confined to is relatively large and rather familiar. I just need time. I always need time. Time to force the barriers outward, slowly, but surely. Time to write, rest, reflect. Time to complete the rebooting process. I'll be up and running in no time. Promise.

       So, every week I write out a 'To Do: Week of   insert date here  ' list type thing. I write everything out day by day with sections of hours and what is to happen during those hours. Anal, eh? I'm not really even sure why I do this every week, mostly to cure bordem during class on Mondays I think. This morning I wrote out my list and found that, although usually Mon-Wed fit on one side of a sheet of notebook paper, this week, it doesn't. *sigh* Lots to do.   I took a playing test for guitar this morning. I ended up with 100%....mostly because he's a nice guy. Still, looks like that grade will help balance some of my other, shall we say, less promising grades. 4000-level eng courses aren't much fun. Just in case you wondered.

       Money, money, money   I'm in the process of applying for several scholarships. One (a lovely grant of a TBD size), will hopefully cover the costs of my many books this semester, the others all pertain to the coming semesters. Writing essays, filling out applications, securing letters of recomendation. With all this work at least one of them better pan out. Sheesh.

       So, I'm supposed to be writing an essay for a scholarship at the moment. It's not going all that well. I thought perhaps some typing here might help get those creative juices flowing. Ha.  I've always found it hard to write "I deserve   insert noun here  , please give it to me instead of all the other better qualified people" essays. I hate how arrogant they sound. The ability to sell oneself (or anything really), is simply something I don't have. Either you want it, or you don't. Nothing I say should change your mind. Then again, I have to assume that the 'buyer' has done their research and *knows* what they want. Which I suppose is where the whole 'selling' thing comes in. *sigh* Off to sell myself to a scholarship commitee...

How much we hate taking midterms and finals and writing lab reports and doing project after project after project. I had the same type of conversation with Tiffani as well. Although, while she dislikes the stress of school, she'd much rather be here, doing the school thing, than in the 'real world' being a *real* adult. I think I might have to side with Amanda. Get me out of here as soon as possible!

       Button up that shirt your supposed to wear. Don't forget that airline ticket or to brush your hair, Show that family that you care Couldn't you wear something that celebrates Everything you love and maybe what your family hates Cause that might be what it takes.  That's your fire, that's your soul Shouldn't have to go That's your fire, that's your soul You shouldn't have to go  First thing they say is take off your shoes And they say they want your story But they get confused By all those words that you use. A year ago your car went off a cliff And you saw an angel in mid air Who said you'd live That's a story you can give  That's your fire, that's your soul Shouldn't have to go That's your fire, that's your soul You shouldn't have to go  And they say you're family You belong to us You can stay at home And have our love and trust Any day one of us could die, If we make you suffer Don't you want to find out why Cause we love to watch you try  It's your fire, it's your soul It's your fire fire  And you'll fly home and get the flu And you'll keep staring at the ground you, always do When they get their time with you You are not a punching bag, my dear I think your darkest days Should have some light this year I think you should stay right here  With your fire, with your soul You shouldn't have to go That's your fire, that's your soul You shouldn't have to go It's your fire, it's your fire, it's your fire  ~Dar Williams~

       Writing is Therapy   So, when I get bored in class, I write. Usually nothing all that exciting, just random things that I'm thinking/feeling. When I finish a page, I fold it up and stick it in my pocket. Then, when I get home at night, I place the paper on my dresser. Periodically, I pull out the sheets of paper and read them. I did that this morning, here's some of what I found:   her eyes slip past my defenses, penetrating my soul, sifting through its contents with ease. i can feel her,  running over the scars, touching my pain. she tries, desperately, to heal the old wounds, to shed light upon my darkest corners.  the troops are coming i say, youd better run.  she looks at me, with certainty, a sparkle in her eye.  i'm not afraid, she whispers, i'm not afraid.   ----------   Sometimes, I find human beings trivial Sometimes, I find them offensive, appalling disgusting, Other times, I find them interesting, An infinite wealth of information. Sometimes, I find myself trivial, insignificant, meaningless Most of the time I find myself below the bar. The rest of the time, there is no bar. Sometimes, I offend myself So grotesque am I, I cant even look Cant bring myself to witness the hideous essence that is me Other time, I like myself so much,  It dissolves my fear.  Allows for actions I will most certainly regret. At times, I find human nature fascinating. Most of the time, I find it disappointing. Sometimes, I wish I were anything but what I am Alas, I am me, and me, I will continue to be.   --------   All I have to say isGood Riddens to Bad Rubbish. See you in my next life. Where inevitably, I will have moved on to a higher plane of existence. Youll be left here, to learn your lesson. No one likes a sore loser, but you cant do anything without making enemies. Gain some respect for you fellow man. Learn to love yourself with out the narcissism you currently wear to hide the chip on your shoulder, the hole in your soul. Learn from your mistakesthats all I ask.   ---------   I feel the need to write. I need to express something, only I have no idea what. I need to feel intense emotions, only I cant muster up anything more than general apathy. I feel stuffed in a bottle, unable to stretch, breathe in fresh air. I want to get out, I *need* to get out, but I cant move. People talk to me through the glass, I can mostly make out what theyre saying, but its all muffled, lacking any inflection, emotion. They dont seem to notice my bottle.

       Coincidence? I think not!   Last Friday, as I studied with 4 others for the midterm from hell, I noticed, as my companions flipped through thier notes, that every single one of us has something similar to "Is it time to go home yet?" doodled in the corners of our notes.

       Amy lent me Ani's r/r. Ani is....well, Ani. I like the music she releases, but for reason, I never *love* it. Nate is supposed to be getting me a copy of Pink's 'misunderstood' (although I believe she spells it uh...incorrectly). I think I need more new music in life. Any suggestions?

       A Day of Nothingness   Today is one of those days where I must coax myself into doing things. Promise myself small bribes and other such things. Only with great effort do I get out of bed, get dressed, go to class. I couldn't even get myself into the shower this morning. I will be lucky should I get one productive thing done on a day like today. Luckily, there's not much to do.

       2 weeks...   The end of the semester is near. Sure, this brings about a bit of extra stress, the 'end' always does. However, this one is a bit different. Most of those I graduated from High School with will be graduating. It's odd. On the one hand I feel like a total slacker, on the other I know that when I finally graduate, I'll have over a year of work experience + 2 degrees. Most of 'those' won't. Still, I almost feel left behind. Like I'm going to miss something...or something. I'm not sure I'm ready to be thrown into the real world yet. I've dipped my toes in...I know on a basic level what it will be like...*sigh* I think perhaps I'll hang out here in the pseudo-real world for a bit longer.

       The end of the Semester is Near   Which means it's crunch time. I just finished the last of my midterms for this semester. All that remains is two finals in midterm fashion (ie not during finals week and not exactly comprehensive), 2 playing tests, 2 final projects, a variety of small homework assignments and 2 finals. Yeah, that's all. Sheesh.  In Other News: The search committee I'm on will begin interviewing candidates for the CSE co-director position tomorrow. At least I think we start tomorrow. I don't really have all the details. It would be nice if I did though. Dr. Randolph???  People are frightenly stupid sometimes. Join any e-mail dicussion list, eventually, you'll find out what I mean.

       Abby and I had dinner last night with PJ and a few of her friends from UT. They kept telling us what fabulous young women we were. I wanted to tell them that you don't know me. You don't know how much I struggle in school, how much I don't really know, how much *better* so many other people are than I. Not sure what exactly that says about me, or them. I just know I felt like an imposter.

       I don't think I have anything left to say. Between 'journal entries' and character note cards for Philosophy, and poems for Creative Writing, I'm all thought out. My right brain just isn't used to this much work. I think my left brain is feeling left out. It's beginning to rebel. "Mathematical proofs? Yeah...right. Not with the way you've been treating me." Sheesh.

       I'm not sure what it was I was looking for when I signed up for Philosophy of Feminisim. Something mind expanding? Right brain oriented? I could have just taken stick fighting and still fulfilled the particular requirement I'm using the class for. I guess I just didn't expect being able to predict the next words out of the professor's mouth, wondering when or even if a point will *finally* be made. Maybe I'm not cut out for Philosophy. I'm used to fast paced, complicated material that if you don't get, too bad. This course is anything but that...so far. We're diving into Bell Hooks tomorrow. Hopefully, it'll get better.

       Home is Where the Heart Is?   We just returned home from a week in C'ville. I think overall it was a good week. I usually can't say that after spending so much time there. Hell, *any* time spent there. My mother is in the last stages of turning 'my room' into a guest room that only sparsly resembles me in any way shape or form. I think I'm ok with that. I no longer think of that house as 'home'. It's a place I've lived in... there's been many of those in the last four years.  So yeah, we stripped wallpaper, painted walls and ceilings. Hung out with Michele, watched movies with Geoff. Helped Janeth with the High School Art Show, had lunch with Isbell. Drove to down to "da 'Nati" to pick up Nate and his friend Jess to go see the first showing of "The Matrix Reloaded" (appropriatly dressed in black pleather, of course)...way cool movie btw...I think I need a second viewing though. And then the highlight of the week: dinner with Ms. Warren. Three hours of good food and fabulous company. What more could a girl ask for? (aside from more peanut butter in the peanut butter chocolate pie, there's never enough peanut butter...)

       The End Is Here   It's been a while since I've been sad to see the end of a semester. I'm happy because I don't have to move anywhere, but I'm sad because I don't get to go someplace new, do something different. I'm sad because most of my friends will not be in Toledo this summer. Those from class, nor those I spend time with away from Engineering. *sigh*  Abby's parents are coming up this weekend. The plan is to hang out on Saturday evening and then go the art museum on Sunday. Janeth is very excited about the Van Gogh exhibit they currently have. So we'll go there, see Van Gogh, eat a Mother's dat brunch and then we'll be heading to C'ville. Once there we'll be hanging out with my family. Redecorating rooms in my parents house for mom's b-day/mother's day, taking the cats to the vet, and other random things we can find to fill the time. I think perhaps it's going to be a long week. At the very least, it's a change from Toledo, and I won't have to do a lick of homework!

       Sleep? What is this sleep you speak of?   I hate finals week...I really do. Regardless of how well you think you've prepared for it, you haven't and you will inevietably do nothing but school work for a week straight. I spent 4 hours on Sunday and another 5 on Monday in a computer lab completing my Digital Desing project. I was up till 2:30 this morning completing a 25 page report for that damn project, 1am the night before studying for Feedback and I will no doubt be up late again tonight studying for Comm Sys. (The Final From Hell...don't worry, it's only 50% of your grade) *sigh* comes with the territory I spose. I'll graduate some day right?   I did get a brief repose from school books and computer screens when we went to get Ice Cream with Spectrum people last night. That was fun...another outing is in the works for Wednesday evening...that should be a nice end to my Finals Week.   On a much less happy note, I got an e-mail from Dave yesterday. He's currently in Iraq...I don't know what I think about that...I need more time to process it I think...think safe thoughts for him please. Thanks...

       So, apparently I've been neglecting this. I think it's mostly because I've been writing journal entries for class. Not much else left to express once I get done with those. I thought about posting them here. But since they have mostly to do with content discussed in class, I'm not sure they'd be all that interesting. I talked to Craig online for a while last night. He's trying to convince me to become a singer-songwriter. As if I needed convincing...I just need to find some time and perhaps some inspiration. I'm going to give it a try...we'll see how that goes. In other news, I've found myself a new stalker...well, he hasn't progressed to that point yet...even if he did follow me most of the way home today after class. He's cute, for a boy. Next time he asks me out I'm going to have to tell him. The homework excuse won't last much longer. *sigh* How do I get myself into these things?

       Creative Writing is a Bitch   I so should have taken this class during a normal semester. I simply don't have enough time, or brain power, to devote to a class that wants you to create an original piece of writing every single night. I'm just not built that way. I think it would go better if I had two days, or three maybe to come up with a poem or a story idea. If I had time to write more than one poem for each type the prof wants us to learn, it would be better. I think. Regardless, I wish I had more energy to devote to this course. It's simply not getting the resources I would like it to have. I forgot that that is the essence of summer semester. Too much, in too little time. Of course, it doesn't help that I'm taking two eng courses and a second WAC course on top of it. Sheesh.

      Fantabulous conversation with Craig this evening. (Remind me to tell him the "Mike and the Rainbow Shoelaces" story.) I was supposed to be working on my automata project...but uh...somehow that didn't happen. Oops. Don't tell Todd!  Other random thoughts that have been floating through my head recently:  -Tomorrow I'm driving to Dayton to attend a sitting with my sister at a real photography studio. Like the kind people go to get senior pictures taken. Something tells me that while this will be more fun than going to the dentist, it may just be slightly less enjoyable than the exam I took this morning.  -Professors who leave the week of a midterm without answering any questions about what to expect for the test or even how to do the homework assignments...suck.  -PHP is an acronym that stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Now, how is it at all legal for the first letter of an acronym to stand for an acronym? Sheesh.  -Soap opera addictions are more intense and therefore much harder to break than normal tv addictions  -Is it just me or has there been a lot of 'gayness' on tv recently. I don't know, maybe it's just that I've been watching too much tv. *sigh*

       Me? What Me?   Sometimes I wish I could be a fly on the wall of someone else's brain. Not for the rest of my life or anything, but just for a day here or there. Able to tap into every thought and feeling, living not me in their lives, but as them, as an observer within them. Quite literally placing myself in their shoes. Learning how others react to things, how they live their lives. The ultimate study of human beings and how they react to the world around them. I think this need to be someone else, to live without the work involved in creating your own existance, observing someone else's. I think it's the cause of the creation of celebrities and reality tv. You focus your energy on others to allow yourself to ignore you.   I've been doing this a lot lately. Ignoring me, focusing on my 'obsessions' so I can forget that I exist...that somewhere inside of me I'm screaming to get my own attention. It's like I'm living in some sort of fog. It's soft and warm, protects me from feelings (good and bad) and makes non-superficial thought impossible. As a consequence, I haven't been *living* life. It's an odd feeling. It's not depression, at least not in a form I've experienced before. I'm happy, I have a decient appetite. On the surface everything is fine...but I don't feel connected...connected to my friends, my family, to school, to society...to myself. It's fine, I'm fine...but I don't think I want to be just 'fine'.

I need to come here more I think. Try to get some things worked out in my head. I'll start that tomorrow. Meanwhile, I'm going to join my love in bed...and hopefully get some sleep.

       Sweet!   So, while classes continue to suck (I'm keeping above the class average...but that's not very good) I'm planning on a fabulous birthday weekend. Tom and Abby and I are heading to C'ville where we will meet Nate and party (I spose it's partying...mostly just hanging out though) in my parents empty house. They took Michele and headed out to Wisconsin to hang with extended family. I was supposed to go (read: given a guilt trip by *several* family members most of whom won't be attending either), but I don't like driving the hour up to Michigan to see extended family...why would I drive 6? The bar for passive aggressive actions via mass family e-mail has been set and no one's going to beat the Leppings. Sheesh...  Anyway, in other news....my obsession for soap operas returns. Not since middle school have I stooped to actually taping eps when I won't be home. It all started with the lesbian kiss on All My Children. I began by just following that particular story line. Then I found message boards and fanfic lists and then I started to get hooked on other storylines and now I can give you the histories of most of the characters. Scary I tell you...I'm also hinging on the edge of a Buffy obsession. Damn FX for showing reruns...damn ABC for trying to enter the 21st century, damn me and my obsessive personality. I spose it's due to the lack of new X-files fanfic and NBC making ER suck.  At least I can move on from my obsessions...eventually...*sigh* I knew there was a reason I take so many classes a semester.

Brief summary below:  -Took finals: aced one, fucked up the other. -Drove to RI where Abby and I attended the Newport Folk Fest and got really wet. -Drove from RI to Boston, hung out with Amanda...lots of fun. -Drove to Toledo and spent several days doing absolutely nothing. -Started classes...way fun. really.  There...that's all I have for now. I'll work on wrenching all the crap floating around in my head out of my head and get back to you later.

      I don't suppose any of you are OpenGL geniuses are you? *sigh* You know, I think I'd be ok with this if I had some ability to imgaine things in three dimensions. However, I don't. It's the same problem I had with Calc 3 and Emag. My brain just doesn't think like that. I'll get through it, but I don't think it's going to be pretty.  Senior Design is...well, it's sucky. We have a decent project, however, the team I'm working on is driving me insane...or perhaps better stated...one member of our team is driving me insane. It's going to be a long semester. Hopefully, I'll end up with a degree or two in December.  I'm sitting here trying to come up with something to type other than simply complaining about school, or the other topic on currently on my brain, the job search, however I'm coming up rather dry. It seems you're going to have to wait for something more deep than "school sucks". Sheesh.

      So, I found this slice of time where there's not enough to get into homework and too much to just sit and stare for a bit, so I thought I'd stop by and make this posting thing happen two days in a row.   I really want to redo my website. Only I *so* don't have the time. Between school and this job search thing I'm supposed to be doing (I am working on it...slowly but surely) there's just not the time to get obsessively into web design. Cause you know for me, there is no such thing as casual web design. If I'm not in it 110%, it'll never get done. *sigh*  Things to do today: go to post office go to class take a quiz turn in homework complete lab report write pre-lab graphics program coffee watch the OC go to bed

      *sigh*  I seem to not be able to find the time (and/or inspiration) to post here on a regular basis. I've written several things during class though. (I know not the best use of tuition, but wow...so bored) I'll type a few of them (read: the shorter ones) out for you:   I don't hate my relatives, but I can't really say I like many of them all that much. Perhaps it's better to say I don't really understand them. For instance, yesterday my Aunt sent a mass e-mail to all her friends and relatives thanking them for attending her daughter's wedding shower. (Note: I didn't go, yet I got the e-mail anyway) She's all gushing and stuff for a paragraph or so and the starts a new paragraph (which turns out to be longer than the first) along the lines of: "We are missing two white handled spoons, if have them please return them to us" What the? I wanted to e-mail her back and be like "I didn't go to the shower, but I teleported the spoons from you to piss you off. If you'd like to see them again, please send me $1000 in ransom and I'll return them unharmed. Thanks."    I realized the other day that my sister and I are a lot more alike than we would appear to be on the surface. The way we react to adversity, how we deal with the need to succeed, our parents, the roles we play in social environment. Sure, she's all about boys, socializing, clothes, make-up, singing, acting, being the center of attention and well, I'm not. But we're still cut from the same cloth and somehow that's oddly reassuring.    I understand that sometimes you just have to be pissed off. Go on a rant of some sort. Throw things, cuss, stomp your feet a bit...but sometimes does not equal all the time, and all the time, makes you just not so fun to be around.    Oh, so I'm supposed to understand this eh? I supposed to remember things from a class I took a year ago that, while I earned myself a solid B+, was mostly due to memorization and pure luck. Riiiiight...this is going to be a fun semester.

      So while yes, it's been a while since I've stopped by...there's really not all that much to catch you up on. All I know at the moment is I am anything but tired, I don't want to write a lab report and I don't understand my Power Electronics homework.   Abby's laying on the couch...pretending she's watching football. She's not of course...she's mostly just sleeping, but it's rather important not to tell her that. At least not until she's ready to be 'sleeping'. She's rather cute...waking up every once in a while exclaiming "The Colts scored!", or "Another penalty?"...it's almost like she's been watching the whole time. Then again, it's probable she'd say the same things were she actually watching the whole game...sometimes football isn't all that exciting.   You can tell I'm not exactly all here at the moment...I just had to check the spelling on 'probable' cause it *so* did not look right, still doesn't. That and I'm being wordy...I always get pensive and wordy when I'm so tired, I'm not.   Sometimes I wish life were like a soap opera. High highs and low lows. Everyone is beautiful, everyone knows where everyone else stands. I love that somehow everyone has loads of money, while no one really seems to go to work. That people get to say all the things they're thinking. Then again...no one is really happy in a soap opera and if you are, no one wants to hear about it. Then I begin to think that perhaps they reflect real life a bit more than most people believe. If I lived in a soap opera, I'd be the one they pull out every once in a while to move some random story along. Important in a re-occuring character sort of way...if I were in a soap opera, I'd at least know what to feel when. In the real world, I have no idea.

      it's just gone. how could something so all encompasing, so essential, just be gone? i don't understand, i can't explain it, to you, to me. there's just nothing, nothing to hold on to, nothing to seek, to follow, to lead. just, nothing. an empty shell, surrounding the edges of my being. i remember your smile, your skin, the feel, the scent, the taste. the blue of your eyes, the warmth of your soul. i remember, but i do not know. i crawl into bed, and curl into your heat. the steady rhythm of your breath, the beating of your heart, calms me. soothes the jagged edges, fills the void. and then, i know.

      Yesterday, I was able to walk outside without a coat, in nothing but a t-shirt, today, it's snowing. WTF?  In other news, I have a midterm tomorrow. That's right, a midterm, 3 weeks before the end of the semester (not to mention the day before Thanksgiving break). Not very 'mid' if you asked me, Sheesh

      I hadn't planned on writing 85 million blog entries when I turned this laptop on. I had, in fact, intended on simply playing games. Then, for some reason, I decided to log on to message boards to check for a fic update and then I somehow ended up here. Now I'm sticking around, mostly I think, because the keyboard is way fun. I'll sit and type for hours about nothing if the keyboard is sufficiently amusing. I sacrafice oodles of processing time, just to click away on the older computers on campus. Perhaps that's rather odd of me. But I don't think I've ever claimed to be normal.

      Apparently, I'm wordy this evening....  Speaking of "Knowing him when" Nate sent us a copy of the script for his next movie. Abby's planning on auditioning for this one. Might as well since she's been in the last two. We'll have a whole collection of movies by Nate staring us. Then, when he's famous, we'll sell them on E-bay and make tons of money. ;)

      I finally made it to one of Craig's gigs this afternoon. He was set up with Phil (I think that's his name anyway...) in a used CD store nearby playing to well, me, mostly. There was another girl there and the guy that worked in the place...been a while since I've seen live music. It was good. Made me want to pick up my guitar and play. I must remember to add this afternoon's excursion to the 'concerts I've been too list', just cause when Craig's all famous and shit...I can say, I saw him when. :)

      So I'm writing to you from Abigail's new (slightly frustrating) laptop and the comfort of my couch. It's kinda fun not to have pain shooting through my right arm and lower back. (I am in desperate need of a new computer chair that will allow for less painful computer time)   Honors convocation was last night. We had an interesting mix of family members. Abby's parents, my parents, Paula, Tricia, and the every lovely Jim, Beth and Robin (er...Rene...whatever dude) Slightly stressful, though we did have a facinating conversation with Tricia and Paula. Who knew they'd get along. ;)  All and all, I'm feeling better about life. Not that I'm no longer stressed or anything helpful like that...but I have a better sense of things and that, well, that they matter. I've been floating along in life the past few weeks, not really caring what happens or placing any real attachment to what and who is part of my everyday existence. It's hard to explain really. It's depression, but not quite. Certainly I've been in much deeper in life...so I hesitate to actually label what I'm experiencing. In the end...know the cloud is lifting.

      So, I wrote a blog entry yesterday during class...or at least what I thought I was going to type up and post as a blog entry, but now, since I've written it. I don't feel the need to share it. For me, it's mostly about the actual writing...that and re-reading entries several months from now.   So yeah, I did a lot of writing yesterday (all during class...it's much less boring that way). I wrote letters to some of my cousins, an e-mail to my Aunt...and at the time, I thought they were all fabulous...just what I needed, what I thought they needed to hear. But now...none of it seems significant. I can't bring myself to type them up/mail them off. I'm afraid of what they'll think of them. This isn't some random blog entry that while I must assume there could be someone reading it, I by no means need to see these people face to face at a later point in time. I don't have to endure an agonizing wait for a response. I don't have to face the possibility of rejection. In the end I suppose I'm just a coward...but I'm pretty damn sure I couldn't handle a negative response.

      So, because I'm in procrastination mode, and feel the need to mouth off a bit I'm going to do something I told myself I wouldn't...subject you to my soap opera obsession. I'm going to preface this with the fact that it's not quite kosher for *any* of the message boards I read, but I felt I needed to get it out of my system. So...  [rant] All I've got for you guys is one big "Whatever, Dudes".  Neither group can claim to be above reproach. One side claims this while at the same time asserting they are better, while the other side simply has no apologies for the way it approaches a fictional world. In my opinion, it comes down to the fact that one group is made up of people who love the show and worship the ground it walks on, while the other is made up of people who love the show because they can pick it to pieces or because they want more out of mainstream media in regards to lesbian representations than coming out stories and hand holding and feel their fandom can make a difference. While I must admit to being part of the latter, I do understand blind love (*cough*Olga*cough*), I just can't get behind a storyline I don't like based on it. Each side is so fixated on their own point of view, they interpret the same sentence in a different way. Bammer's interpret snark as hate and Liancalite's interpret hope as delusion. People are drawn to one side or the other based on the type of person they are, not which character they would most like to see Bianca end up with. Therefore, the type of peace you're looking for will never be made. Live with it dudes. [/rant]  K...better now. Btw, my new favorite band?  urlLink The Waifs

All I know is there are 6 weeks till graduation and I have 3 projects, plus random bits of homework (not to mention midterms and finals) to finish and a job to find. Not helping the stress factor one bit.

      Merry Christmas, dudes...though I guess at this time, Christmas is actually yesterday, but it's the thought that counts right? Right. I don't have anything particular I wanted to say. I just can't sleep and thought hey, why not visit the blog, see what comes out. Not thinking there's much up there at the moment though. Mostly just stuffiness and a wee bit of pain. Not fun I tell you, not fun. *sigh* I guess maybe I'll go to bed now. Nothing more interesting to do really. Nothing to do at all. I don't like being graduated with no job to graduate to. I feel lost, like I have no direction. The worst part about the whole thing? I don't really seem to care. argh. Life will get better soon, right? Right...and that's all there is to it.

Remember last winter break...yeah...it's gonna look much like that one, only this time, I don't go back to school.  You know, I think I'm going to bed now. Hopefully, I'll actually be able to sleep tonight.

      oh, here I am again. Surprised aren't you? Ha...whatever dude.  Abby and I went to see Craig and his gf play at a random cafe in Maumee this evening. The cafe was good (if not exactly live performance condusive), Craig and Phil were good and Sara was good too. All and all, a good evening. Why the lack of expressive adjectives? Cause I have a networks final tomorrow and that just covers everything with a big black cloud. *sigh*  I was talking to Craig this evening (please explain to me our complete lack of ability to carry on a face-to-face conversation, however we *rock* at the whole instant message thing) and he mentioned Abby playing violin for some of his songs again. I mentioned it to Abs and she decided that she must get out her violin. So here it is, 11:45 on a Thursday night, we both have finals tomorrow and I'm typing here, while Abby is playing concerto's she hasn't looked at in years. Yeah...how's that for odd? (The her playing the violin when normally she's been asleep for at least an hour, not the me procrasting on the computer part...cause...yeah)  Hmm...I spose I should 'hit the books'. I'll try not to break my hand this time. ;)

      Sorry about that last post. I have to remember to stay away from such things. Sure, they're a great waste of time, but kinda pointless otherwise. Either you know me well enough to know all that stuff, or you don't give a shit. Regardless, it was fun...then.  2 Finals down, 1 to go. Then, I be graduated. Woo! I'm having a hard time convincing myself to study for this one. Ah, I can hear you now...studying didn't go to well for the last one either did it? Well, actually, it did. I think I did rather well on it. Barring my usual errors due to my special inability to use a calculator. Regardless, this last final will most likely suck, but I'm not all that sure I care. I find it highly unlikely I'll actually fail the course and even if that did happen, I just can't fail anything else and I'll still graduate...so yeah...you see my dilema here. *sigh* Anyway, you may want to check back tomorrow night to see what I come up with to entertain me whilst pretending to be studying. Then again, seeing what happened last time...you might not.

[sunshine or rain?] Depends on the day and the temperature  [rain or snow?] Depends on the temperature (well duh!) no, I mean if it's below 50, and raining, I'd rather it be cold enough to snow. Otherwise...bring on the rain.  [sun or moon?] Moon.

      Oh and a few more comments cause I'm pissy and I don't want to study...  Why would you want to watch a subtextual lesbian relationship on a show that has already written a textual one????  If one character can change her mind re: her sexuality, so can another and BAM (pun intended) no more lesbians on daytime.  I'm so over the coming out story thing. Give me two women who know what they want and are willing to go after it.  Character assination sucks. Please give me back the strong, independent women that used to live in Pine Valley.  K...I think I'm done now...Buck converters differ from Boost converters in that the former can only lower the output voltage while the latter can only increase it. The Buck/Boost converter, however, is an entirely different story....

      I should be studying for King's final tomorrow...I was...and I most likely will again before I go to bed....but I'm finding it hard to concentrate, hard to care about the stupid test. I haven't done well on any of the others, despite having a decent understanding of the material, so what makes me think I'm going to do well this time? Nothing that's what...and that's a problem. *sigh*  Soap opera's piss me off. Soap opera fans piss me off. So what do I do? I watch soap operas and read fan message boards. Really, all I want is to see myself and my relationships reflected on television. It's *really* sad that I'm hoping for that from a Daytime Soap. The thing is, unless you have Showtime and it's January...that's all she wrote (and it's really not much). Argh.

Otherwise, I'm doing everything I shouldn't be doing. I don't particularly know why. I just know I can't bring myself to do the things I should be. I simply can't. I don't want to. I don't care. I just need to be done. And I know I'll hate myself for this later.

      This is what happens when you get too involved in soap opera characters and sit through 3 hours of the most boring lectures possible:  You know I don't love you, you must know that I can't. I just can't,  because I do, because it will destroy me destroy you. I'd shatter into a million pieces and scatter across the floor, mix with the millions that came before. The ones we glued together, only to have them broken by his force. I'm hanging on the last few, picking up one, and then another. adding them one by one. So you see, I can't love you. I have nothing left to give. I can't love you, but I do.

      Hmm...so...netscape sets the update view differently than explorer...or at least that's the only thing I have to explain the difference. ANYWAY...  I went to class this morning only to find a note on the door saying that lab would be starting at 11am instead of 10am. WTF? I wanted to go to class, turn in my lab report, take the stupid test and leave. Now I'm stuck with an hour of odd time without anything to do...at least nothing productive anyway. I'm once again procrastinating a programming project. It's hard to get things done when the prof keeps moving the due date. It's one of his most annoying qualities, that and the fact that he never returns homework assignments. *sigh* I just want this semester to be over with. Not that I know what I'm going to do once I graduate, but whatever it is....it's got to be better than this. Or at least I'm hoping it will be.  Dave is home on leave for two weeks. It's nice to have him home, while at the same time frustrating as we're used to living on our own...not to mention the fact that he's actually keeping normal hours, which in itself is odd. Still, I'd much rather have him here than in Iraq. Troy came over last night...that was a trip. He's...well, he's Troy and there's really nothing more that can be said about that.  Argh....30 more mins....think I have time to go home and take a nap? argh.

      So, I've hoped on the  urlLink Friendster  bandwagon...not that I'm all that sure what the whole thing is about...but I'm there...perhaps I'll meet all kinds of new and fabulous people...perhaps not.  I've been feeling rather disconnected from people lately (perhaps this triggered the need to join friendster? who knows...)...some of by choice, some by circumstance, some for unknown reasons...I know that for the most part, I've made the right choices (when there was a choice to make) but still, I can't help but wonder how things would be different now had I not made them. God, I sound like Sean...being all evasive and refusing to discuss things out in the open. Just barely hinting at things...I hate that, yet here I am doing it. I don't know...if I could place my finger on what exactly was bothering me, I don't think I'd have too much of a problem discussing it...but I can't. I don't really know...perhaps something I ate last night is messing with my head. *sigh* Whatever...  Oh, my computer croaked...again. Argh.  Heading to Cinci today...Binnie's bday party. I'm hoping it will be fun and really, it better be, cause I don't think I can handle hell today.

      You know, just because I haven't quite figured out this publishing thing, I spose it doesn't mean I can't post updates anyway. It's not like Blogger is eating the posts completely, I mean *I* can still read them. Not that do, which is probably evident by the number of typos and such.   I've been very bored lately. I had what looked like a promising job possibility. That was exciting. But, although the door isn't completely shut yet, there isn't much hope left there. So, I'm back to square one, surfing the internet, looking for job openings. It's no fun I tell you. I wouldn't wish a job search on anyone. Argh.  You know...there's not much else going on in my brain...Ellen's starting and the laundry should be ready to switch in a few minutes. *sigh* My life is oh-so exciting...

      The following are random bits of information I decided to share with you, cause...well, I'm bored and I thought that it would be fun to spend some time typing....  Gilmore Goodness lives again. Or it will, tomorrow night.  Everwood sucked tonight. That was not fun. I *could* have been watching Ellen. *sigh*  In Style Celebrity Weddings...weren't Melissa and Tammy just the cutest things ever?   Someday, I will break my soap opera addiction. I swear!  To the writers of last week's ER episode...were you trying to take two steps back regarding lesbian representation on network TV. Cause really, I thought you were better than that.  Anyone have showtime and want to tape the L-word for me?  Aaron wants me to come live in Cincy with him, so he can get rid of his roommate and keep his amazingly fabulous apartment...I'm game...I just need a job, preferably in Cincy.  The job front is looking up...pehaps not sunny, but there's a few rays here and there.  There's something oddly hypnotizing about having a clock with a pendulum sitting above your computer screen. As if the screen itself weren't skilled enough at sucking you in for hours on end.  Last night, I went to bed a 3:26 am. Abby got up @ 4:30. Neither of which was on purpose and seriously cut down on the cuddle time.   I'm convinced my cousin Kathy knows...she called to ask me how to spell Abby's name so she could send her an invitation to her wedding. Kathy rocks. Now I just need to grow some seriously steeled ovaries.  I have four bags of Michele's old clothing in the trunk of my car to give to my cousin Amelia. Does anyone know the ettique of delivering hand-me-down clothing that isn't being handed down from you?  Sometimes, I wish I weren't me. Most of the time, I'm glad I am...and that's mostly due to the fact that I have a warm, sleepy Abby waiting for me in bed.

Certainly nothing that could be deemed productive. Hell, Abby and I haven't even left the apartment in two days. (It's cold outside dude...plus...well, yeah...) I just keep telling myself that I need this time and that it'll pass and I'll care again. Only I don't really believe me.

      I'm having one of those days where I don't know what it is I want to do, but I want to do something. I've edited my resume a bit, applied for 2 jobs, read all my e-mail and most of the message boards I frequent, I feel like I've accomplished at least something for the day...there's more I need to do: prepare for an interview tomorrow, search out some new job opportunities, eat lunch...but I still don't feel like, even after I complete those tasks, that I've done anything useful. I don't know that getting a job and going to work every morning will make me feel useful, but, for now, that's what my head tells me. I hate that I am currently of no use to society. I hate that I claimed $3.18 of income on my 2003 taxes. I hate that my bank account looks more like what one would find in a piggy bank. I hate that I have a list of CDs to buy but no money to do so. I hate that I have to sell myself when I posses little to no self esteem. I just hate it. I hate it all and I can't wait until this limbo between school and the real world is over.

       AAAAARRGGGGHHHH!   Today (or I guess it technically yesterday now) the President (and I use that term loosely) announced his endorsement of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Which is something that already isn't legal (unless you're in San Francisco) but that Bush feels threatened enough by to create a seperate class of citizens and deny them rights. Whatever one thinks of same-sex marriage, either morally or politically, no person who cares about the US constitution should support such an unecessary, unusually anti-democratic, and overly broad departure from the Nation's traditions and history. Never before have we amended the Constitution to restrict the ability of the democratic process to expand individual rights. This is no time to start. Please take this into consideration when voting in Novemeber and more importantly, if you feel as I do, that this amendment is simply crap used by a President to shield what really matters and aide in his re-election, let the government know. Write letters, send e-mails, or simply pass your opinion on to others. Spread the word that this amendment isn't only about whether or not God tells you it's ok to be gay. It's also about disgusting politics, legalizing discrimination, and desecrating our nation's most precious asset: the Constitution.

      You know, I was supposed to go to bed early tonight, (as in right around now...) but since I just finished eating what one could consider dinner, I'm thinking it's not quite a good idea to go to sleep on a full stomach. I *always* regret it afterward...so I'm going to hang out here for a while and digest. How does that sound? Ha...like you have a choice.  I need to kick my own ass into gear tomorrow. Make sure I do that, mmk? k.  Sometimes I wonder what it is I did that made my skin hate me? I mean really, I did nothing to it, I swear. In general, (I have the feeling I've already talked about this...so just ignore it if you've read all this ranting before) I'm really not at all comfortable with my body. I don't like cleaning it. It itches when I don't shower, it itches while I shower and then after I shower. I don't like feeding it. I constantly have to remind myself to do so and when I do, I'm totally bored with all the food we have to eat. While at the same time, hate almost everything new I've tried. I truely think I would be happier if I never had to eat. (Though the occasional bit of chocolate wouldn't hurt right?) Lord knows sleeping sucks. Well, not the actual sleeping, the getting to sleep part and the waking up part...I mean really, life would just be so much better if I was some life force floating around in space somewhere.

      So, I don't have all that much to say at the moment. But I'm bored, and I've got a bit of time to kill before heading off to the symphony. (Yes, the symphony) So here I am. Now what? Hmmm...let's get a bit random on your ass for a min:  I need to iron my shirt.  I think I found an outfit to wear to Kathy's wedding. Now I just need a shower gift. Any ideas?  Soap operas suck.  ER last night was actually entertaining. Most of it anyway.   It really sucks when you can't stand the character the writers think is the bomb...see above two comments.  I'm hungry.

      I talked to my sister this evening. She wasn't accepted into the OU music program. She's pretty bummed. I shared my own rejection woes and we bonded a bit. It totally sucks for her, but I can't bring myself to feel all that bad about it as she's off to Florida for a week sans parental units. (ours anyway) Dork-butt. :p  I had dinner with my aunt Paula this evening. She's always a trip. Good food, good conversation. I enjoyed it. Of course, I brought Abby and she brought a friend along, so it wasn't just us...that helps. Not that I'm afraid to be around her...it's just the coming out thing really doesn't get easier. I have no allusions that she'll be anything but supportive, and if she asked point blank, I'm not going to lie, but telling her means telling the family. Telling the family means forever altering my mother's relationships with her father and siblings. I can't do that until I've talked with my mother and basically, I'm wimp....but I think I've been over that before, so I'll spare you this evening.  I don't believe I have much else to say...I just thought I'd stop by in hopes of getting the creative juices flowing since I seem to have hit a road block in my other writing pursuits. Hopefully, one day soon, I'll finish one of them and you can read them. If not, well, know that I do do things during the day other than surf Monster.com and watch soap operas.

      There are stories that call for a bit of 'suspension of disbelief' to work. And then there are horribly written contrivances that make you wonder how stupid the writers think you are.

      I was thinking that, even though life sucks lately (or perhaps because it does), I should write here more often. Still, I really don't want to just sit here and complain to cyber space on a daily basis. Then again, what else is a Blog for? Talking about philosophical conundrums? The meaing of life? Love? Hunger? Ah...who gives a fuck, really? I don't even run spell check on this thing. (Ok, so I did to figure out how to spell conundrum...) It's not like someone will find this and think, wow, she's a smart chick, I should hire her! Bastards.  So I've found a new TV obsession. Yeah, I know, I need to stop getting those...but this one is actually a good show. (then again, so *was* ER...) A British spy series called Spooks (shown here on A&E and BBC America as MI-5).  Basically, it is Alias, only more episodic in nature, more polictical and with more gadgets and less guns and violence. I've come to think of it as a cross between Alias and The West Wing. Not that I actually watch Alias, but I've seen an ep or two. I love Spooks because it pokes fun at Americans. I love it because it's smart, because every character is overflowing with flaws and because they never tell you which is the right side of an argument. Basically, what the West Wing used to be, only with legends, lock picking and bugging. It doesn't hurt that Olga is leaving AMC to join this show, now does it? Too bad I have to wait till fall for the new epiodes...and even then, they'll be hacked to bits to fit US censors and commercials. Ah well, that's what BitTorrent is for. :)  In other exciting TV news:  They're encoring Season 1 of Nip/Tuck on FX.  ST:DS9 reruns begin April 5th on Spike TV. The end of my AMC addiction is so close I can taste it! (Thanks to the casting director of Spooks and the mysogynistic hack AMC calls a head writer.) Keen Eddie. :)  In other exciting real life news: Dave's being shipped home on the 13th of April. And uh....that's it really....

      I just feel like I need to write. Only I don't really have anything I want to write about...so figured I'd stop by here and ramble for a while. That usually works. I haven't actually written much of anything recently. Perhaps I should try to spend some time on that...since I have it an all. Time is good, and I really am trying to enjoy it while I have it, but it's all tainted by the stress of money and boredom and shouldn't I be doing this? or that? Maybe I can find a job that won't have me start till May or something...that way I wouldn't really have all those stressing while still having the time...argh...either way it means finding a job. I realize that that's all I talk about recently, but really, that's all there is in life at the moment. Every conversation I have begins with or contains the phrase "How's the job search going?". Worse than that "Oh, I thought you wouldn't have a problem finding a job... Double major, Engineer, Woman, etc. etc..." it sucks really and only serves to make me think even less of myself. As if that were possible. I need to find someway out of this hole I've dug myself into...it's only going to get worse when a job doesn't fix everything. argh....I need chocolate.

      I woke up late overslept into my life now its 5pm but to me it feels like noontime  I gotta get up gotta go out like some weird dream I just cant figure out no one wants so see a grown woman have to cry but its not far to fall when on the dirt looking at the sky but I lucked out because he didnt lie when he told me he loved me  but you know I shatter when I hear your angry voice you know me better than I know myself you told me youd be here forever whatever that is you better cause you love me better than I love myself  I could have wrote that movie about the teenage marriage that went bad one day if we broke up, it would suck but it would make a good screen play  but its a love song because youre in my bed got the soundtrack and its playing in my head  you know I shatter when I see that look in your eye cause you know me better than I know myself you told me youd show me the ocean and give me the sky you better, cause you love me better, better than I love myself  I dont know all the names for the useless burdens in my soul but I will lay them down and lay with you and let them go  feel comfortable underneath my skin can't afford to lose this love we are in   ~Lori McKenna - You Better~

       The End Is Near   No, I haven't found a job, but I have learned that *the* reason I'm still watching AMC, is leaving to join a show that's actually good. So excited. Now, I just need a job and I'll be one happy little camper.

      In C'ville for the weekend. Staying at the Valley's...everyone's been asleep for hours...except for me of course. I don't really like being here (here as in C'ville, not specifically the Valley's). It's just plain stressful...and not at all home. I'm not sure when Toledo became home...but it is. It's weird, yet good all at the same time. I don't know...Abby just yelled at me...apparently the typing is too loud...not that she said that...but that's the reason she's actually conscious. I'm not tired, and I know that as soon as I crawl into bed my mind will start spinning. Sleep is, as of late, a painful process and I would much rather not do it...but that's not really possible now is it?

      I've spent the last, oh, hour or so reading other people's blogs. I have come to the conclusion that mine is wholly inadequate. Of course, there isn't any other conclusion I could come to when reading blogs at 2am...but I know that...so I spose that's good. Anyway...figured I'd write here to uh...sound deep or something...  Fox cancelled  Wonderfalls . Bastards. Seriously, you put it in the dreaded Friday night timeslot and then move it to Thursday opposite The Apprentice and CSI and actually expect it to get ratings? *sigh* I want my smart tv! (with lesbians whenever possible. ;) Hopefully someone else will pick it up (Bravo?? You picked up Keen Eddie! Please!!!) since there's 13 eps made and only 4 have aired. I spose there's always the possibility of a DVD release...they did it with Firefly (which, it seems, I'm supposed to watch sometime...maybe when I get money...)  There's so much I'm supposed to be doing...so much I wanted to get done this weekend...and I haven't done a single thing. I'm such a slacker. Argh...tomorrow...I'll get it done tomorrow...or at least work on it...

      I couldn't sleep last night...so...I stayed up and caught a movie on Showtime. It wasn't great but it was good in that it was a 'lesbian movie' that wasn't bad. I have my complaints about it, as I do *everything* I watch, but I recommend you watch  Bobbie's Girl  because it's a movie with lesbians that isn't about being a lesbian. The fact that there were two women 'together' was just that, a fact. It had been dealt with and accepted at some point in the past and we're left where most people are in life, simply flawed characters who are dealing with what life throws at them as best as they can. A het couple could have been @ the center of the story and very little would have changed. I like that. I *crave* that. My life is as normal and fucked up as anyone else's. My whole existence isn't dependent on my sexuality and how other's react to it. It's nice to see a filmmaker who gets that. Of course, it's on Showtime...I may have to rethink not keeping it once my free month is up.  In other news...I miss Abby. But I guess that's not much in the way of 'news'.

      Mmmm....food is good. All is quiet on the working front. Most people are off to lunch...leaving me a one or two others to eat in peace. I like the guys I work with, and I wouldn't trade this working environment for any other I've been in, but still...you need a break every now and then. One can only take 12 year-old boys in 20-something bodies for so long.   I think I'm going to need to cut out some of my 'obsessive' internet activities. I simply don't have the time to keep up with all of it. It seems I'm just going to have to snark on things all by myself. *sigh* Really, this is a happy thing though. I have a *real* life.   Random note: I've spent more money (on things other than rent and car payments) in the last month than I have in the previous 6. A true test of my budgeting skills. Come June first, we'll see just how good (or bad) those skills are.

      I didn't sleep all that well last night. I had a really strange dream. It was mostly strange because I've had dreams like that before. Usually they don't keep me awake. It's disturbing to think that my brain works like that. It's embrassing to admit that it does (notice my lack of describing the actual dream). It's making it hard to work this morning...cause I just keep thinking about it. Therefore me typing here. (Not that I'm actually typing in blogger. I type it up nice and discrete in notepad and then paste it here...it's how I've always done the blogging at work thing, unless it's during lunch. *Anyway*) It's one of those pensive days. Which are always good to have when there's a long drive invovled, cause it keeps you entertained. Sometimes drives you a bit nuts, but the drive goes faster.  Yeah...I'm driving to Toledo tonight. Hang out with FF5...grab some more stuff. Things like that. It should be fun. Hopefully Abby will be coming back here. Seeing as though her plans for the summer aren't set, and hanging with me is better than hanging in Toledo with Dave. At least I hope it is.   This seems kind of inchoherent. Perhaps because I keep stopping and starting. I'm not sure what it was I was thinking before and therefore where I was planning on going with the thought process. Oh well, you'll just have to deal.   I feel kinda odd typing about work at work. Mostly because I actually like it. It's easy to bitch about things out in the open. It's harder when you don't want to get fired. The basics: I'm working for Johnson Controls in Holland, MI. I work in the Electronics department of the Automotive Interiors section as a Software Test Engineer. It's exactly what I wanted to be doing when I was looking for a job. It's why I took the job that would have me move to Holland of all places. That and I liked the manager. It's very important to like your boss. At least it is for me.  I know there's more rolling around in my brain just waiting to get out. However, they keep bumping into the programming thoughts and those seem to be winning. Not that that's a bad thing. I don't think I can really call it programming. I mean it is, but it's more scripting than programming and really, the system is annoying as hell. Oh well, at least it's stuff I can do. That's always happy. I've got the script I'm working on written, I just have to figure out if the tests are failing because my script is wrong, or because there's a bug in the software. Seeing as though I know of at least one, and all the issues I'm having seem to be related...I don't think it's me. But, I have to be sure. And I'm a long way from that.  On a not quite related note, the best thing about working here, is that I'm on a Windows machine instead of Unix and while, in general, I like Unix better as an OS, on Windows, I can play music and not eat batteries with a discman. It's nice.  "And the middle is a little like wide open space and the time in between the tides." ~EC

      So apparently I am once again lacking consistancy re: blogging. Not all that surprising I suppose, considering I'm actually busy at work. Not always with things I want to be doing, but busy nonetheless. Everything's about to get busier as I inherit the project I'm working on. A co-worker is leaving, making me head of the project. I kinda like the idea, but would rather have had it happen with more than 2 months experience. Suposedly, we'll be getting a new hire to help take up the slack. But, who knows. In any case, I have nothing but more pain to look forward to. Lovely.  Otherwise, I have lots of things I need to take care of, that, well, I simply haven't done. Hopefully, they can wait a bit longer cause really...I just don't feel like it.

      I went to a Melissa Etheridge concert this weekend. Events such as this are good, not only from a musical standpoint, but also from the people watching angle. Sometimes I wonder where all the lesbians came from, seeing as though I don't see them on a normal basis. On another note, it's always nice when het couples seem out of place. In general, fun was had by all. Especially the belligerent (most likely drunk *and* high) woman who stood in front of me the whole time.    I'm still on the Ferrick list, even though my, shall we say, awe, for her is no where near the heights it's been in the past, and was linked to an  urlLink article  reviewing her latest album. Now, The Other Side is far from my favorite of her albums, and there are some things the author mentions that I agree with, but I have some advice for her: Next time you want to give a bad review to album by a musician whom you hold a personal grudge against, don't make it so damn obvious. Oh and, review the *album*. That was the point wasn't it?   For the most part, an artist only has to impress me with one CD and then I'll pretty much buy everything that person will ever (or has ever) put out. Suddenly finding myself a fan for life. Therefore, when trying out a new artist, it's very important that I buy the *right* album. It's why I kinda like Ani, but I'm not an Ani fan. Why I recognize that Dave Matthews is a hella cool guy, but I only own 1 of his discs. An artist has to have one of three factors: good guitar (usually acoustic), amazing lyrics, or a great voice. Examples: Ferrick->Guitar, Edie Carey->Lyrics, Jonatha Brooke->Voice/Lyrics, Patty Griffin->Guitar/Voice/Lyrics. Like anyone else, I have my own definitions of such things. For instance, MLE is one of the few artists that has stuck on my playlist since middle school and I realized why the other day. It's not the vaguely (or explicitly...I mean really what straight girl is into thighs?) gay lyrics that speak to me, it's her god damned sexy voice. I would buy an album of this woman singing me her grocery list and listen to it constantly. I think that's why rhyming 'change-ya' with 'Pennsylvania' doesn't really bother me. *shrug*  My point? I don't think I have one really...except that that's what I was thinking about this morning while entering requirements and listening to mp3s. So...there you go. Don't blame me, you're the one still reading. BTW, thanks for that...now leave a comment. ;)

I'm hoping, that when I *finally* get a hold of this Linda chick, that things will go better (ie, she already took the cats to the vet or some such thing) but for some reason, I highly doubt that. Argh. I just want a kitty to love. :(

      Blogger got a face lift, so I figured my Blog should get a face lift. It's so much easier now that you don't have to write your own template. It's all pretty and new and no more than 3 clicks worth of work. Part of me thinks it's cheating and sheep-like to use a template...the other part thinks that sometimes, it's just easier to cheat and really, it's not like this kind of cheating is hurting anyone. Other than perhaps myself, but I don't think I'm going to go be a web designer anytime soon, so....yeah.  I'm looking at an Abbyless weekend, followed by an Abbyless week. I was initially kind of excited by this prospect, as I've sort of, kinda had my fill of people (think extended family, for an extended weekend) and I haven't had much quality time with the PC recently. But really, I was wrong. I think this is what I want: just me and a computer with high speed internet and cable tv but in the end, I am so totally *wrong*. So what do I want? What do I really, really want? I want to be annoyed by the fact that Abby wants me to pay attention to her when I'm trying to get something done. I want to eat popcorn and drink orange juice with her while watching some horribly bad movie/tv show. I want a new couch, so I can cuddle with her without breaking one of us. I want to break one of us while trying to cuddle on my horribly bad couch. I want a cat. I want a cat that likes Abby better than me cause any cat of mine should and, no doubt, would. I want her to beg me to go on walks with her and to watch her read her dumb romance novels. I want to pretend something she reads to me from them is actually funny and for her to do the same when I read something to her. I want to eat peach and raspberry sorbet: one spoon, two mouths. Most of all, I just want her. Here, with me. Forever.

      Murphy's law dictates that when a need to blog arises, I have nothing to blog and that when I have something in my head to blog, I have no access to the blog. It's wrong I tell you. Simply wrong.   I'm getting better at filtering what's on my mind and saying it, rather than a: simply saying it, or b: keeping silent. At least I think I am. I really have no way of gaging such things, but I feel good about my 'progress' today, so, we're just going to go with it.   Speaking of progress and Murphy's law. I've gotten Jack done today because everything, and I mean everything, that could possibly go wrong or interrupt me from the tasks I wanted to get done today, has. (I also seem to have lost the abitily to write a sentence that is, you know, gramatically correct. Punctuation (other than the comma and the parentheses) is my mortal enemy. Or so it seems. However, I don't believe that is actually relevent to my horrible, terrible, no good, very bad day.) So...wait, where was I? Right, bad day, nothing done, wanting to rip Jan-Harm's throat out. What? I told you he wasn't dead...yet. Maybe this afternoon will allow testing to actually continue...however, judging by the number of meetings (and brain cells in JH's head) I'm not holding my breath.

      It's going to be one of those days. I can feel it. I suppose I can take solace in the fact that it mostly likely can't be worse than Friday. Few days are worse than last Friday...perhaps made worse, simply beacuse it was a Friday. Days such that are tolerable, almost expected on Mondays, but not Fridays.  I'm behind, once again, so you have no idea that Michele spend the last week with Abby and I. She flew home yesterday. It was good to spend some time with her. I am, however, looking forward to getting back to a 'normal' existance.

      How come nothing ever works out right? A build and an ISR. That's what I was supposed to have in my hands this morning. What do I have? NOTHING! I'm only working a half day today (I'm driving to C'ville this afternoon so I can see Michele's musical on Sat.) so I don't have time to wait around for things I should already have. Stew told me I was a fool for expecting these particular people to actually do what they say they will do. Everything is just so fucking hard. What pisses me off more...if I knew this would be the case, I would have taken the whole day off. I could have slept in. Instead, I got up early. Bastards.   On a lighter note, I downloaded a Ferrick boot this morning. (Shh...don't tell IT.) She actually can pronounce Bejing correctly. I feel much better now.

      I believe today has been *the* slowest day in History. Ok, well, perhaps not in *all* of History, perhaps just the last oh, several months or so. Still, 4:30pm can't come soon enough. It's interesting (or well, maybe not) to note that this day comes just after some of the busiest days in recent History. I'm thinking that, as in most cases, it's all relative. You know they cancelled that show? I might have to go back to watching that Olsen twins show to get my Christopher Sieber fix. Maybe I'll just go through withdrawl.  I've done that a lot recently. Broken 'obessive' tv/internet habits. I'd like to think it's because I've gotten a life, but really, I think it's just cause I work too much.   Work...right. *That's* what I was doing.

      Such a cool piece of software...kinda makes me wish I were a software engineer. Then again, I spose I still could be...at some point in the future. It's a thought.

      We had a cook-out at work today. That's not really the interesting part, since we have cook-outs at work every other week. What's interesting is watching your boss 'hack a sack' with your co-workers. I really do work with boys. Not men, boys. However, I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.  Joe brought his girlfriend. She fell off her shoes and broke her foot. I kinda feel bad, cause it probably hurt, but...they weren't even cute shoes. What straight girls go through for 'fashion'.  I'm sure there's something else to update you on, but I don't really have much of a brain at the moment. Work is really messing with my ability to think of anything other than HFM specifications. *sigh*

      Once again with the 'I suck'. This is totally inappropriate and totally mean. However, I couldn't not save it *somewhere*.   You know you're Jan-Harm when...  Your voicemail greeting message is so long, you feel it's necessary to remind people they're listening to a message. Blowing your nose requires an above average intake of carbohydrates. The new box of tissues you brought in that morning is gone by 10am. You think whining is an appropriate way to ask for help. You create annoying nicknames for your co-workers. It's important for your yogurt to be well shook and that not a single drop be wasted. You use words and phrases like 'jeepers', 'on the farm' and 'that's retarded'. When communicating that you understand, you find it necessary to say 'sure' twice. Since sometimes people look like they don't believe you. You answer questions by repeating random words within a co-workers statement. You spend vaulable work hours hanging out by the vending machines or in the bathroom. Filling out your time card is an all day affair. And....I haven't come up with the zinger that goes at the end of these lists...so, this will just have to do for now.  Perhaps I'll add to it later...

      I really have to stop blogging at work....though I guess that will have start tomorrow. Since, well, you know.  Usually I don't have time to think, let alone put thoughts down on virtual paper. So in a way, his is a happy time. In the end however, I think I'd rather be busy. A busy Becky is a happy Becky. A bit of a stress-monkey perhaps, but happy nonetheless.  You know what else makes for a very happy Becky? JH is taking a week long vacation starting Monday. Woo! No more nose blowing, no more asinine questions, no more eye rolling or huffing or licking the top of the yogurt container or him calling me 'Becks'. For that week anyway....so *very* exciting.  Ok, back to the grind. Counting how many time JH blows his nose is hard work...

      The world seems void of intelligent people. Then, you run into that one person that makes you have faith in the rest of humanity. That is until you meet that other person whose sheer stupidity starts the cycle all over again.
