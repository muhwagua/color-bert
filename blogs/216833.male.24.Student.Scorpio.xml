      The bump came in today - a day before I expected it. That is good news. I have to pay less apartment late fees and I feel a little better about the whole mess. Still waiting on those letters from the bank to resolve this creditcard fraud mess.  Just listening to the radio in the cold room - ahh - technology - everything I love about it seems to cancel itself out with everything I hate about it.   am ordering the new 7" covers this week, if all goes well. I am looking forward to the end of the line with that shit. Looking back on the last year, all the changes that have happened seem to always have that in the picture - shows have fallen to ruins.  The band thing has run its course with me, never again. That is a stage in my life that I am over with for good. I love art, making things, music too, but I just can't deal with the bull shit anymore. Almost all my friends are from connections in music. I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. I still enjoy making shirts. I don't really enjoy building websites anymore, not like I used too. I wonder if there is more to come. Have I just not matured enough, have I not found myself like I think I have?   Since Eric is selling a few things, I also have a few things that I will through up for you guys before I take em to my parents for a garage sale:  Glass Dinning table and chairs(the chairs have seen the rath of a kitty) $100 o.b.o.   Time Killers arcade game - $160  Corner Computer Desk: $40  I am moving and I will have alot of other shit for sale. But problably nothing really cool.

      hahahaha....the morning has been great so far. Halloween. I came to work looking like a zombie with an afro. I got the fake "bloody scabs" all over my arms. I usually don't do this but latly I have been enjoying this holiday. It's fun...its just a little fake blood, it never hurt anyone. People are jumpy around here, I've just been doing my normal stuff and i get a few jumps here and there.  I guess it looks pretty good becuase i feel like a fucking animal in a cage... people just looking and going, "Hey Mark, check this guy out!" Fuck OFF! Its just a little fake blood, never hurt anyone...

       SpyAttack goes Platnium  Most of this week has been pretty insane.  The weather was really nice, well it was cold. I find chilling air exhilarating.  Some how the icy air filling up my lungs makes me feel more alive than the smoggy filth that is Dallas summer air.  On Monday the talk in the office was "Oh I hope the roads aren't bad!", and "Well, winter is finally here."  In Dallas, there is no winter.  There are three day periods in the Winter months where it happens to get below 40 F. My decrepit self spent most of the week at home or at work.  Not really talking to much of anyone esp after Wednesday when I lost my front tooth.  I find it very disheartening.  I know I shouldn't care what people think, but it just brings back the insecureities of jr. high and that's really what I hate about it.  I feel exposed, almost naked.  I have found comfort in the pages of William Sutcliffe's second novel "Are You Experienced?"  So far a great book.  I have to stay I really don't like to put it down.  Almost through with the book, when I am done, I will post my thoughts in their entirity.  So far, I am really ejoying it.  I think I am starting to cheer up.  I am totally looking forward to spending the next week with mimi's dad in California.  I think I am gonna go up in the mountians and do a little hiking.  There is a scooter shop in Sacramento called Vespa Haus that I want to check out.  I need to buy a little something for the bike so that will be fun.  Someone other than old man Garner.  And I am totally going to hit the record stores in Berkly and SanFran.  Maybe go fishing at the Delta.   Anyways.....I will try to post on here more frequently.  Till then, all my love.

        Welcome to my mind   Ah hell, whatever.  I'm so sick and tired of everything.  I'm pretty  unhappy the last few days, seems that all I want to do is bitch and  moan.  I'm looking forward to this 2-day cold snap coming up. Then sometime in december it will get up to 80 again and make me want to freeze myself through the blistering summer.  Just thaw me out when it gets cold again.  I am getting that itch to move and I'm pretty sure this time next year, I'm going to scratch it.

      Well, this weekend went to hell as far as the planned events but I made it worth my while I suppose.  After canceling the show for Lubbock pretty much on the way, pissing everyone off, and wasting about an hour of everyone's time...I went a head and took Brian's drums to him.  I thought it would be nice to eat some dinner with my brother and hang out so I asked him to come along to get some food and I would by him some dinner.  He was down, but he also invited his friends....well, my mind changed because that wasn't really what I wanted to do...so I totally confused him but oh well.  I got on the road wanted to talk to some one about the events, I called up my parents, and then just decided to roll on over there.  I was there for about two hours just talking about this and that.  I invited them to come up this weekend...so maybe I will see them around tomorrow.  I want to take them to this awesome greek place in lewisville that I know they will just love.  Plus, I think my dad is going to bring the Vespa P200 frame that I bought for Brian like almost a year ago.  I think it will be better off in my garage than just sitting in the back of their yard.   Today has totally rocked so far...  I slept till 9 a.m. which was really nice.  For the last month it seems that there hasn't been one weekend that I could just sleep in my bed without doing much of anything.  I would have slept longer but Robert(co-worker) called to let me know they were going to be up at the office going over the Saturday system backup procedures at around 10am.  I needed to be there.  I sat around, checked my email, got dressed and went up to the office. It was a pretty quick ordeal. I spent about an hour there going over all the stuff that needs to be done every Saturday.  New responsibilities...fun.  While I was away, mimi had gone up to Planet Tan to bake herself for a few minutes...she happened to get home at the exact same time I did.  So we went and got some food and went to Target where I bought a "boombox" for the garage.    I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up the garage.  I took a whole gallon of bleach and poured it on the floor of my garage.  The fumes where so intense that I couldn't breath or see.  My eyes were watering so bad I had to go outside to get any air worth breathing.  Some how I managed to sweep it all out and I used a fan to help dry it.  After all that mess I spent about 4 hours working on the dismatleing of my Vespa engine. That went Ok for the most part, I had a few problems with a few bolts....some of these problems are still pending.  It was pretty frustrating. I had to go to home depot to pick up a wrench....the real reason was to take a break from the engine. I was about to give my self a heart attack, I just get worked up over shit way to easy.  I feel like I made some head way on the project so that is cool. The real pay off is when I start putting it back together.  That is where I bet it'll get super tough. Around 7pm I am finishing up the laundry and I call up my Uncle Scott who lives right down the street.  His wife, Carrie, was going to a movie so he was going to just be sitting around the house for a few hours with their little baby boy, andrew.  I went over there for a few hours and talked about all kinds of stuff.  I really dig Scott because he reads alot and has alot of interesting view points and I like to hear what he has to say about things.  Anyways, I should be going to sleep soon.  mimi and I are getting up in the middle of the night to go watch the meteor shower.

      Whatever will I do.... I had a very bad day yesterday. I had an appointment to see the Dentist at 3:30 yesterday afternoon. Got off a bit early from work and went over to the dentist office, I didn't have to wait very long to get into a room, which was cool, but i had to wait on the dentist forever it seemed like.  I was going to check and see what could be done with my broken partial, I have it just sitting there and it is  very  annoying.  She told me I need a bridge, fuck, that sucks because that is like 2,500 bucks for a fucking tooth. Anyways, I was pretty upset, walked to my car crying becuase I know it will be a few months before I can get the bridge and that means I have to deal with this broken 'false tooth' for that much longer.  I went home and cleaned up the house real nice for the Art Collective meeting.  No one came.  I laided on my bed for about 40 minutes and read a new book I just got at the library.  the history of buddhaism. It's pretty interesting. I was about to fall asleep, but I finished the chapter and laid my head down.  8pm i was asleep and mimi woke me up at 11:30 and told me to get undressed for bed, i still had my pants on.  whatever..........

       year-end: 2001   Well here I am, trying to think of all the things that have happened in the last year and I really only see the last four months.  I have seen more, learned more, and changed more in the last four months than I have all year.  I really started to expand my worldview more after nine eleven and try to see the world with a different eye.  This led me to a new change in my beliefs on animal rights, corporations, city life, money, health, love, and friendship.  I always loved the urban life, running from street to street and taking it all in.  I still do but there is something different now, I see all these people running around, what for, I find confusion in my new found knowledge.  I don't know about you, but I go through this from time to time like most humans.  What am I doing, why am I here.  Maybe I should help people, but then, maybe not, I need to help myself.  Fuck you and your needs, but this is selfish.  So what am I to do with my time? Should I go through life to make as much money as I can and do all that I can possible dream about?  Sure, why not.    This weekend marks 5 years to the date when I met mimi, Dec 30.  I know that sounds stupid, but that is the day she started work at the Sweet Shop where I was the cook, famous for my perfect Corn Dogs.  haha.  Yeah I made em better than anyone ever.  So they say.  That was a totally different time for me.  I was a very different person 5 years ago, and that is just bizarre to picture in your mind what your were 5 years ago.  I can see myself in my mind, I had this pair of jnco's that were cut off mid-calf.  I still have them, they are in a bag of clothes I'm going to take to goodwill.  I always wore plain white t-shirts and I had a chain wallet, I had hair then and around this time it was bleach blonde and I was still skinny.  Didn't drink then.  Beer did it, that didn't happen for another year.  I was busy, with my fast food job and my bad ass 1972 Chevy pickup.  I had stickers all over the back window of the pickup. Dead Kennedys, supertones, mxpx, the specials, value pac, etc...  I was in between bands at the time, but I had all the equipment to start a band, with my work money I had bought a drum kit, guitar amp, PA, guitars and bass guitars and it was all in my room.  I had a door to the room from the outside, my closet was paneled with cedar and my clothes always smelled so good.  I'm started to feel old, but I'm just glad I can remember sometimes.  Now I'm at the brink of twenty O' two; Happy new year.  What lies in the future is so beyond me that I can't even begin to make a prediction.  I know that the person I am now is the person I think I want to be, it's always that way, but maybe I will become a better person, maybe not as pissed off, maybe I will finish things that I need to finish and move on.  Love you all.

       x-mas and more of that sort of thing   well, the holidays were more exciting than most so far. I spend a few days before x-mas to take a tour of west texas stopping in little towns that house family of my girl and i.  that was nice, i got a chance to see some family that i havn't seen in about two years, like uncles, cousins and such.  on the day after x-mas i spend holding it down at ssg.  mimi was off work on thursday and we really didn't do anything but hang around the house, hell thats all i've done for the past 4 days, it seems.  glued to the tv playing grand theft auto 3 on the playstation 2 to that mimi bought for me.  i went to a show on friday night, that was a highlight.  i saw a few people that i hadn't seening in a while, all the bands were great: el salvador b-day bash, ...of death, kill the slavemaster, and since by man.  great show.  lots of energy or drunks, can't tell, but it was my first chance to get out my camcorder that mimi bought for me for x-mas.  I owe it to her for sure.  so i have the show on tape and that was fun in itself.  from the desk of john coffman

       Dinner at Monica's   Dinner last night was quit an event.  For the first time in my life, I met some people that I actually found interesting. It's a weird twist on the feeling of meeting new people because I don't really admire these people as much as I just plain find them interesting.   mimi's mom was in town for a meeting and she had invited us out to dinner with a group from her office. I was dreading it.  I just really didn't see it as being fun, but I was hungry, and it was Tex-Mex with a vegetarian menu so I sucked it up.  The place was like a crowded bar, oh wait, it was a crowded bar filled with the cool and trendy.  It was a really cool place and it was half-priced entree night so I could see the reasons for being so busy.  Hell, tonight they have 50 cent margaritas, I can just imagine all the people there then.  We walked into the waiting area and there was this group in the middle that we were meeting up with.  Let me see if I can get this right, but there was Jerri, the old yank woman that moved her giant pear-shaped body around like a weeble-wobble. Her shepardess, Tiffiny, who was the young, repitively defensive and also over weight girl who seemed to feel the need to protect the thought of her open-mind as Fort-Knox.  Next to her was Rose(i think that's her name), not much to say about her except the fact that all of her stories seemed to be very anti-climactic.  Also, the host's of the dinner, Lee and his wife(I forgot her name).  Young, maybe late 20's early 30's, very much caught up in the city life of Dallas.  Into all the lights and sounds of city culture.  I found them to be more inspiring than the other people at the table.  Lee's wife scuplts and paints.  Lee seems to be very sucessful and I could see that his charisma is what got him there.  He really didn't seem that overy interesting but he knew how to deal with people, something I am really not good with.  His wife was able to pull out some very interesting topics and we discussed art, vegan resteraunts, and music; Lee would occational note additions to the conversation. The food was really good, I would go back.  Maybe on a less crowded night.   today  Just going through the same uninteresting things; the life of a computer geek.

       End of the workday..closing in on 4pm  I've been sitting at my desk for the last three hours trying to stay busy with out much will to get up. Now I am finally to my daily duty of uploading the shipping files to their respected shippers like UPS and the post office.  At least now I have something to do every time I go to work. What will I do with the rest of my afternoon, like I said, mimi is off today so hopeful we can go have some fun.  Christmas has completely left us broke so it seems. I think I have gone a little overboard with the presents but I want mimi and everyone to have a good christmas, its my favorite holiday and damn if I don't see people smiling.    urlLink check out dallas hardcore music

      Another day...most of this morning I've been reading about how to build a log cabin.  I don't know why but maybe someday I can build my own cabin from the sweat of my brow.  I think I could seriously find that rewarding.  I'm at work, things are alot calmer today.  I'm going to lunch with a finance guy from emerson/ssg and robert is going to.  The guy is taking both of us to lunch for...i guess our help with his bank software.  MiMi is off today.  I hope she is enjoying it.

      But the bad part was that it wasn't really cold.  We all set forth on the camping trip hoping for a cold weather trip and it ended up being very pleasant.  The rain was not bad until late at night when the fog also set in.  Good thing we were staying in a palace of a tent.  Dad had bought a 10-man tent.  The thing was huge.  It didn't even fit on the pad.

      The forest was dark at the early hour of 6p.m. but this is December.  There were probably a total of 3 occupied campsites in the entire park which made for a very people quiet place to be.  It was really just the nearby road and the forest sounds.  I get there with a headache, which I am totally upset about, but I try to drink away, while at the same time occupying my mind with the duty of Fire Chief, protector of the Flame.  Man was that Fire raging.  I absolutely love camp fires, everything about them, the smell of the smoke, the heat hitting your face while the cold wind slices up the back of your coat.

      This weekend was adventure number 2 to the Davy Crockett National Forest.  Another insteresting experience to the campgrounds of Ratcliff Lake. I really enjoy that area.  Scott, my mother's youngest brother, and my Dad were my partners in this quest into the woods in search of chilling air and campfires.  We made our way out from Ft.Worth where Scott and I met up with my Dad.  It took us a little longer than normal to get out to Ratcliff because we took I-45 a little longer down to Centerville and from there we crossed over.  The trip was interesting. It rained the entire time, from when we left to just about the time we entered the campsite.  Halfway to our destination the wipers go out on my Dad's Suburban.  That made it almost impossible to see, but we made it to the forest and got to our campsite without slamming into anything.

      How shitty all this is!  I had two pretty interesting adventures and my site was down.  David at the hosting server moved some stuff and we all had to re-upload the pages.  Well this one was pretty customized so I had to move a few files.  Luckily I had the files here at work so I can go ahead and start putting it back together.  Looks good, or the same as before.

       so what it is what it isn't.  I have some super sinky ass farts going on tonight.  oh my.  mimi and i went to a thai resteraunt in dallas called the thai rose. it was really just alright. I had the Evil Jungle Price with tofu and some thai iced coffee and mimi had the asparagus and some sprite.  i enjoyed the time we had just hanging out. it was fun. we tired to go shopping for some family for christmas and saw these awesome new toys....remember the Rudolph the Red nose raindeer claymation cartoons that ALWAYS come on around christmas.  THEY MADE TOYS of ALL the characters and they are off the hook.  I want em all so bad.  That seriously gave me chills when I saw em.  It just rocks.  I mean....i love those shows and I watched em every year, that is a totally good memory of fun at christmas.  Man.....if you get a chance....buy me some....hehe...love john

      Well from my point of view, things don't seem to go anywhere unless you move them.  Cars don't go unless you fill them with dino-blood and start them, lives dont live until you kick them in the ass.  So when is someone going to kick me in my ass.    Thing to start again by the end of the week.    Lift weights (becuase I need to be mean)   Study my cisco books regularly and get to the goal of a cert.   Find a place for wuornos to practice   Eat better for the fucking sake of staying alive.    I dunno why I just can't do these things.  Fuck it.  Tomorrow I am going to do what I want, not what my weak ass mind gets away with but what I want.   You can't have it all you say, well, I can if I make myself.  Its going to be hard.  But I guess instead of pussing out and getting fat and poor, I'll stop being a light weight and do it!   Updates coming soon!  Man, losing friends makes things go weird....I'm way to dependant on people....from now on its me and I don't care if you don't like me.

       Holy 쬶oke!   I took a trip to the  urlLink library  yesterday afterwork to pick up some refrence material for the  urlLink DFWAC  meeting.  I had spent some time online researching different sites to find books that I thought might help us come up with some ideas and maybe show us new ways to organize the group to get stuff done. mimi was sick with the cold, so I left her at home, crying and sniffling on the couch.  The  urlLink library  is only a few blocks down the street, behind an Exxon and a dry-cleaners, so it was a short dash to my local branch.    The library was packed with people, but here, the books are the majority and most of the time I would rather take a book with me than a person.  People are to edgy sometimes, and they have problems that they always seem to bring to your front door.  I don't know why, but I'm always greeting strangers on the street with a 'Hello" and "Hey" followed by some sort of nod.  I found my self doing this as I was walking into the library and going, "wtf!" I don't know that person, why do I give a flying fuck enough to say "Hello."  Fuck that guy for making me feel weak and habitual, and now I am saying "Fuck your self for blaming your weak ass on some stranger!"    weird...I had a small fight inside my head..........am I crazy??  I'm crazy, fuck you!   I got my books, and went to check them out and they had some nice calendars sitting on the counter...FREE....wow these are nice.  I picked up two, one for my house and one for the office(a.k.a. the life I am to weak to abandon.)

       Four A M Lanscape  Wind waves the reeds by the river, Grey sky lids the leaden water. Ducks fly low across the water Three flying: one quacks sadly.  Grey are the sky and the water, Green the lost ribbons of reed-beds, Small in the silence a black shadow Floats upon wide pale mirrors.   year-start: 2002   The first few hours of this year I spent with Nick, Kira, Brian(my brother) and his friend Bryan, and MiMi.  We talked the new year in with a failed attempt to celebrate simultaniously with the rest of the time zone.  Canadian wiskey and potatoe chips where the first food of what will be undoubtedly be the most unpredictable year of my life.  Towards the closing in of sleep i was in the middle of watching Planet of the Apes around 3am.  I started to feel a little sick, like alchohol sick.  I stayed awake for a while longer; trying to get through the movie with out having to lose my chips and "salsa". "Maybe I need to lay down," I told myself.  I went into the room and undressed and slothed my way under the blanket, this didn't help, just made me realize that I needed to take care of this.  I was sober, to a point, and hadn't had a drink for over an hour, why was this belated.  RRAAAAAALLLLPPPHHHHH!.  I feel better now, finished the movie and went to bed.   Its almost like stabing your hand, you know its gonna hurt, but the rush, some say, is worth it.  What a stupid way to start the year.   By the way, Nick and Kira saw the canal rat moster thing last night.  what is that thing!

      Lets see if they take this olive branch.........  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  Saudi Arabia: Peace With Israel Possible  VOA News  By Jessica Berman  Posted Monday February 25, 2002 - 06:34:18 AM EST    Washington - Saudi Arabia's foreign policy advisor said Sunday that peace in the Middle East is possible if Israel withdraws to its 1967 borders.   Appearing on the television program Fox News Sunday, Saudi foreign policy advisor Adel al-Jubeir said that in exchange for total withdrawal from occupied land, including Jerusalem, Israel would gain the recognition and normalization of relations with its Arab neighbors.   Mr. al-Jubeir called the proposal a "statement of a vision" by Crown Prince Abdullah.   "The importance of it is it sends a signal to the Israeli public by telling them that peace with the broader Arab world is possible should they make peace with their neighbors," he said. "It also sends a message to the peace camps in both Israel and the United States not to lose hope and that peace is possible and that we should re-energize our efforts." Mr. al-Jubeir says the idea was positively received in the Arab media and by Arab leaders, including Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.   Meanwhile, Prince Abdullah, reportedly upset with Israel's continued hard line against Palestinians, cancelled a speech he planned to give at the Arab Summit the end of March in Beirut outlining a peace proposal.   On another topic, the Saudis are of two minds about a U.S. base on their soil. On one hand, the country is a close American ally. On the other, the government worries the U.S.   presence could set off a wave of terrorism.   Also appearing on the television program Fox News Sunday, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Richard Myers was asked if there's been any change in the U.S. Saudi relationship. "We've had a strategic interest that goes a long way back," he replied.   "That relationship is still valid, still working." "The Saudis could always ask us to leave," he said, adding that "we have no signs at this point that that's the case." Vice President Dick Cheney is headed to the Middle East where he will likely discuss Saudi concerns about the U.S. presence, as well as any new peace initiatives.

      Nothing like some chips and sprite for breakfast.  sprinkle some pepper on it an BAMM its a meal.  Here is the start of another week. Robert, my co-worker, is taking a vactions this week.  So its me and James on duty.  Hopefully it will be light.  The weekend was beautiful.  Very nice outside the whole weekend, it might have been a little to windy yesterday, no problem.  I made a decision sunday to take my kitty to the SPCA - I feel alot better.  After that trip, I did some studying for about an hour and 1/2 and went to check my email and message boards.  Alex was online, after his 18 hours of sleep, and said we should go pass out some MELANGE flyers. I headed straight over to their apartment and soon after that we treked around dallas putting up flyer.  Where will we go next.  There is that FW, 2/3s of the name, that we need to tackle as well.  Our "west-side connection" has failed us.  We had little trouble putting up flyers.   There is always that one asshole guy, and he works at the Magnolia so spit on him if you see him!   FUCK YUPPIES, cuz they are the people who think beauty is clean!  I like clean, I hope I'm not a yuppie.  I'm hip yo!

      Went to see pinback last night at the gypsy tea room, the opening bands were ok, nothing to shout about.  Pinback was a little disappointing, they rocked, but alot of their songs were on 'crack.'  Super fucking fast.  I bought their 2002 tour E.P. and I have listened to a little bit of it.  Sure enought, penelope is fast as hell on it.  I was real impressed by the bass player, mad skillaaazzz.    We had a sad attempt of passing out flyers at the show, alex put some on one table and I put a few on the other.  We are gonna need a bottle of B.O.L.D to get some flyers out to people.  After the show, I kinda gave mimi directions home and I hitched a ride with alex and eric up the TLP(where alex works) to work on some more flyers for MELANGE at insomnia.  We cut out 11x17 portions of that brown paper roll sheet stuff and ran it through a color laser printer.  I really like how they turned out.  HOLY SHIT, im crazy and its 4:30 in the AM.  Yep, we were up at the office till some time after 4:30am and somewhere in all that mix i totally lost my mind.  I was dancing around the Mat Room shouting "melange" in a fake as french accent all at the same time waving my pretend ribbons around in the air.  I think they were red and purple....haha....french people rock!  I crawled and falled out of bed around 10:30 this morning, feeling like someone at taken a tire tool to my knees.  I had to make my way up to work to change out some tapes for the weekly backups of the AS/400.  I got that finished pretty quick and headed back home wishing I could go back to bed.  mimi went to work around 1pm and I was sitting around fight with my self over going to school.  I didn't want to, I hate that place, I always leave confused and pissed off at the people who work their for being idiots.  I took my books and went the opposite way from school.  I went to the Mall. I passed out a few Melange flyers and put one up in Fast Forward there.  Those kids were really cool and asked me a few questions about it.  I bought a messenger bag, I can't find my old black one, lost i suppose.  I can't get the cat piss smell out of my old faithful backpack so I found a bag I liked and took it.    "Shit, I guess I'll go to school!"  I went and it wasn't bad this time, I met a new guy there, he was really helpful.  He seemed to care at least, so I am gonna start going there a LOT more.  I am ready to have something to show for the money I've spent.  I'm back home now after about 2 hours of going over custom subnet masks, and IP Routing, RIP.IGRP. ARP. etc.......  I'm going to Denton tonight to see a friend I havn't seen in a while, maybe play some pool and shoot the shit.

      What an absolutly beautiful day it is outside, the birds are cirping, the air is crisp.  I love it, when I was walking in to the office, there was a mockingbird sitting in a tree singing.  It's wierd how when you say anything about a brid, esp. a mockingbird,  its like almost always deep and poetic.  haha.    Last night I rode out to the Evil Dirt Road to see ...of death (they didn't play).  I had a good time either way.  Last Nerve was generic and I wasn't impress. Just your good ol' hardcore eh!  Terms of Grey had an almost comical set, i love those guys, they are just full of heart.  Of coarse tyler is always cutting up with the crowd.  They had a better than usual performance.  USA is a Monster was the headlineing touring band.  They have some free mp3's at  urlLink infrasound  and also I found some info on their records at this pretty cool distro called  urlLink massdist .  I was very glad i got to see that.  Two guys from AZ coming to this little shack of a garage and tearing it up with all they've got.  It was great.  I had some awesome sleep last night.  Got home about 12 and hit the sack.  slept till about 9:15 and found some clothes and went to work.  I feel tons better than I did at the start of this week, I'm going to see Pinback tonight with lots of friends, I'm stoked. I'm looking forward to chilling out to some mellow tunes.

      Last night was hard for me, I spent about 2 hours studying subnetting and IP addressing and got so frustrated I wanted to cry.  I took a shower to help me feel a little better, it did, but I couldn't shake my mind from constantly tearing me down.  What do you think about yourself?  Most of the time I am very critical of myself.  I guess I set my self up for failure alot.   It's a new day, that makes a world of difference.   Girl Scout cookies are soooo good.

      So I probably should say something like - "Woah, its been a while since I've updated."  Thats is the way a journal is sometimes.  So its Monday Feb. 18th.  Tonight wuornos was supposed to play a show in ft.worth.  Non of us really showed any real effort at trying to get it together.  Oh well.  I really don't have time to be in a band.  I need to just stop all this shit all together.  I feel completely overwhelmed.  I guess that is the way it is going to be.  I am sure I would just be bored if I had nothing going on.  Its a challenge for sure.    Will power could really come in hand right about now.  I feel like all I want to do is bitch, what are the things that make me feel good?  Working out, lifting weights, reading awesome books, eating good food, making art that I like, just living and doing new things.  I'm an f'ing lazy shit ass.  I know what I need to do, I just gotta do it, seems like i write about the same things.  This journal is really more of a self-disipline thing for me.  Makes me see how behind I am.   Lots to do, better get started on some of it.

      Well, I am finally getting something done about my apartment being all fucked up.  I turned in a request in December to get my disposal replaced and the lights in my kitchen and garage replaced. Mark is the 'make ready' guy but sometimes the service manager, Tom, gives him a few tickets to handle.   Tom said he does maybe 10% of all the repair work around the complex.  By the way, both Mark and Tom are very nice guys.  Mark is always smiling and laughing but he sorta weirds me out, i dunno, he just does.  Tom, well, he is just a rock n roll guy who loves guitars.  He is always wanted to 'jam' out with me at every chance he can get; I have yet to take the time and 'jam' with Tom. Well, anyways, Wednesday I was determined to talk to the folks at the office about this lack of follow through with my disposal, lights, and now my carpet pad that was removed when my water heater broke a few weeks ago.  I really didn't want to get any of the guys in trouble becuase I wasn't sure who did the work; correction, who DIDN"T do the work.  I had been on the look out for Tom all day, he is always riding around in his golf cart so I was sure eventually I would see him.  I didn't see him in the morning or at lunch when I came home, but after work I just decided to go to the office, I hate dealing with those prissy girls, but oh well.  Just so happens, I'm backing out of my spot and ZOOM! here comes Tom on his cart; so I wave him down.  We talked for a while, about all that was wrong with my  pad.  He apologized and I said he no big deal really.  I wasn't that pissed, not anymore.  He told me I was paying for the service plenty and needed to take atvantage of it.  Your right Tom.  I need to step up.  Anyway, Tom is coming over on Friday before noon.  I'm off, so maybe we can 'jam.'

      Normally I hate Television, it's usually a waste of time and it seems to steal time really fast.  I have to admit, I am hooked on a show.  the Osbornes - has to be the funniest show on TV right now.    Ozzy is gone, his kids are characters, and his wife is NUTZ!  I love it.      ***   I worked out legs today and I am so exhausted.  Tonight mimi and I are going to different stores to register for our wedding.  That is totally coming up soon, but I'm not real apprehensive about it anymore, I'm actually super stoked about the deal.  It's really happening and I can't think of a better person to spend my life with, time will tell.   ***   I noticed that March has been a slow month for the spy attack journal. I've been busy; yeah, whatever!  I bet I could always say that.  Any point in my life, I can always say, "Oh Ive been super busy!"  I need to invent a 'busy' meter.  I just don't think I have anything to say, I need to take this journal more personal, not so broadcast like...or some shit.     Anyways,  I have been listening to:  Cave In - Jupiter Nathlie Marchant - Tigerlilly Weezer - blue Saetia and 90.1 NPR  I wish Jets to Brazil would come back through.  I love those guys.  I wish I could book them at my apartment garage.  "Don't mind the dog shit, Watach out for the piss"  By the way, I cleaned all that up last night.  My garage looks cool again.   urlLink    ZZZZZZZZZ~~@@##^^^^^^^^^____---zzZZ radom rules

      Well -  The art show on Saturday was a success, I thought.  Insomnia looks 100x cooler now, and I have to say I had a ton of fun doing it all.  What a relief to have this finished.  Surprisingly, everything went really well,   I could have used some more energy close to the end of the evening, but all was well.    I broke more glass on Saturday than I have in years.

      All week long has been GO! GO! GO!  This last weekend I went to an arcade auction and that in itself was an all day event.  I picked up two games; Mortal Kombat and Time Killers.  I think there is something wrong with the MK machine.  It freezes up and the Player One buttons don't work.  I did install coin door locks.  That's all I know how to do right now.  Still searching for documentation or something; anything to learn how to fix these darn things.  Work has been 'non-stop problems'....We have had tons of work to do and not enough strength to muster up for compeltion.  Problem, like dial-in access and running low on printer toner, ahhh, tons of shit.  Not even enough time to play a game or two of Counter Strike.  The Art show is nearing quickly.  I am looking forward to it, OH SHIT!  I just remember that we need one more band for the outdoor stage.  No Forms yet.  No articles yet,  no idea what is gonna go down!  My legs HURT so bad from doing lots of leg press, squats, hamstring curls. and those leg extentions.  I can hardly walk right,  I need some ICyhot rubbed all over my legs.  Later flizzo's   the ghost - ive been rocking out to these guys this morning

      Ah - the office birthday party.  Makes me want to vomit my taco bueno from last night.  I can't stand the off key sound of someone's birthday song from down the hall.  The fat fucks eating more cake then they should, not even really knowing whose birthday it is, they are everywhere when the song is being farted out of fellow employee.  What is up with "CUBE DECORATIONS!"  Seems bizarre to decorate a fucking cube.  I dunno, thats just me, but I don't want "over the hill" or "streamers" or "midgits with ribbons" distracting me from my work.  I got enough distractions already.  Although the midgits might be cool to have around for coffee and such!  Small people RULE!

      anyways - back to my weekend.  James perez, from denton, called me up and he finally convinced me to come up to denton and hang out with him.   I got up there around 9 and we started drinking at his apartment.  Went out on his balcony and talked and drank booze for about two hours.  We both decided we would walk over to fry street and visit a few pubs.  First we went to cool beans, had me a double bourban and coke and a shot of Jagermeister.  This was repeated several times through out the night, just at different places.  We left that bar and headed over to Muther's to find a pool table.  No dice, the place was full, James saw some people he knew so we talked with them for a while and left to go to Lucky Lou's - by this time, I am fucked up to no end.  I started calling people, I called nick, josh p. and tyler.  I couldn't really hear then, just shouted in the phone, the bar was loud.  We didn't stay there for to long before we went back up to cool beans.  Got another drink and a shot in me and we went up to roof deck to check out the band.  James had to bull shit the guys and say that I put out 7"s .  I can't even remember what the band sounded like, but they have my card.  Oh well.   We went back down stairs and boozed away, and started talking to random people, oh and fucking pedro was there.  He is from brazil and a totally awesome guy - I met him through Josh P. back a few years ago.  James told these chicks that I was in system of a down, they thought that was pretty funny, so they talked with us for a while.  I can't remeber what was said exactly, I just remeber talking about me getting married in a week and this was my lame ass bachlor party.  haha.  I had a good time - we finally made it back to his place, and I smoked a bit with his room mate ricky and we watched EnemyMine.  Fucking weird movie for sure.   I called mimi and said I was in no condition to drive - stayed up a few hours watching that movie.  James passed out and ricky went to his room so I was there, drunk, and freaking out over this movie.  I havn't done that in a long while and I paid for it the next day.    Sunday, I got home around 10am and just sat on my ass watching movies - pay it forward, proof of life, and some bigfoot show on the travel chanel.    This morning I got up at 7am and went to play some tennis with mimi - I was grumpy.  Been listening to alot of Nick Cave and the bad seeds and danzig!  M O T H E R!!!

      My weekend was pretty interesting, at least I thought so.  I got up on Saturday and went to work to change the tapes for the weekend backups.  After that I headed over to Insomnia, where we were just lucky enough to have someone let us in to get the paintings.  Alex was there about an hour before and had taken down most of the art work.  From there, I went home to hang with mimi for a while before she trappled off to work around 1.  We went to the local tex-mex resteraunt and had a weird waiter.  He gave you these blank glares that confused me.  He either had  no thought at all, or some evil plan to poison our food.  After mimi left, I drove aross the fucking country to my brothers house in white settlement.  They should change the name to black settlement.  Took me about an hour to get over there.  I had brought some coke, but brian had no ice.   No big deal - had me a few keystone lights and started painting their fire place.  Not finished yet.  Left there around 4:30pm and went to stop by my parents house to pick up the carpet steamer and just to say hello.  Hannah was playing in her pool - jumping around like a crazy kid.   Mom showed me her pumpkin plant in the flower bed in front of the house and she took me to the backyard to show me her carrots, squash, and tomatoes.  Growing plants just rocks.  I can't wait until I can eat food that I watched grow.  I finally got home, the sun was falling fast in the west.  I poured me a vodka/cola drink and started in - watched a bit of TV.  Then james from denton calls.   - - - -

      Sometimes small town's are bredding grounds for bordom.  What will a girl do to free herself from the stangle hold of idle hands?  Just like any normal girl, she went to school and tried to do the best she could at the same time having as much fun as girl can have; close to bursting like an over-filled ballon.  Her dad was a drunk but he meant well and really didn't get involved in the kids activites, she felt alone alot - all of her older siblings had moved away.   Close to her senior year in highschool she met a guy that she thought was so cool.  He was the guy that you couldn't bring home to mother, he was an 'outlaw.'   Of course, she could give two shits less what her mom thought, this guy was hot and he could have some fun.  One night, they both rode up into the yard of her friends house, the engine from the motorcycle making waves of beating sounds across the party goers.  They seemed unphased, their music was bumping and the toxins were pouring a river that babbled alot louder than any harley.  It was just like a scene out of some movie where you ride up to a cliff and there is a bonfire in the distance.  The closer you get the louder the metal \m/ gets, the louder the screams and shouts get.   Two guys on the side porch were smashing beer cans on their foreheads, one fell over the rail and everyone started laughing.  The girl was taken by the care-free attitude of the party-goers, this was everything that she had been feeling, but wasn't sure how to find it.  All smiles and sparkles, she gazed around the scene of totally rebellion and hedonism.  As she walked into the trailer house, three guys and two older women where planted on the couch with smiles on their face, like they just heard the funniest joke in the world.  There it was, the source of their humor, a joint the size of a sharpie marker.  In the back room, serveral girls were passed out on the floor.    "They musta had a little to much to drink.." she smirked.   "Their high on smack, stupid." the boyfriend grinned, acting as if "stupid" was the name of a dear friend. "Have you ever done this shit?" he asked. "Sure, I had my first taste a few summers back." she was shaking with nervousness. He didn't ask anything more of her and they walked outside to check on a few of his other buds. The amazed smile on her awe-stiken face had turned slowly more to a glazed stumble with every beer.  She was talking to another fellow that she had in a class at school, and suddenly she was struck on the left side of her face.  With what, she didn't know, on the ground, she was afraid and sweat started to pour down her face.  She reached to wipe it away, it wasn't sweat but blood.   Another sharp jab was felt in her ribs, the alcohol did little to numb the pain.   After the shock was over, she gathered her self up and began to relaized what was going on, her boyfriend was upset.  She could understand, he arm around the other fella must have looked ill.  The shouting began and he tore away on the motorcycle.  Bruised and beaten, she limped to the trailor house, with the help of some other girls, and taken to the back room to treat her wounds............   ( I will continue the story later)

      The mesquitos are getting bad around the canal... Everytime I go out on my patio, swarms flee the corner near the storage closet.  I havn't been bitten, but they just fly around, buzzing in and out my space. I keep wanting to leave my water can out on the patio, but I am worried that it will become a breeding ground for more virus-like bugs.    My plants are doing good, I brought them in last night.  Just a little worried about the high winds and possible turrents of rain, I didn't want the little fellows beaten to death. On monday, I looked at the weather report and there was a thunderstorm forecast every day of the week.  We are still waiting on those thunderstorms.  My luck, the fucking clouds will wait until next weekend to unload, and there goes the wedding outside.  There is a backup plan, just not near as cool.  Work is boring, very much so and I am very worried I am going to get ripped off by techskills.  Fifteen months can go by quick when you have shit to do.  But I really can't do anything about it by worrying.    What Passion dies so quickly with discouragement.

      I could her them chatting down the hall. Boomingly,  his voice carried through the white tiled floor of the narrow crawl-space that people travel daily towards the vending machine room.  After all,  work chit -chat is rampant in the work places of corperate america.  The whole idea of two pot-bellied, tie wearing, middle-management goons hanging out by the water cooler seems to me like those fuck heads have some sort of daily ocean fantasy.  They must always stare into the water, like they are looking for fish.   "It's fucking WATER! Are you looking for a fucking dead body! DRINK IT!"   Sounds like the guys, down the hall, are talking about fishing. . .

      Went to get my wedding ring re-sized last night.   When I got it on Friday, it was a little loose.   I sure as hell don't what the thing falling off and me pissing away a lot of money.    Didn't go to school, that nice run I took yesterday morning caught up with me around 6pm and I was dead ass tired.  I worked out my back in the gym for an hour yesterday also, but I really don't think that was why my legs where jello.  i think I am getting a headache.     * * *    I'm in such a bad mood today, everything seems to be pissing me off.  Some days are like this, some days are not.  I hurt all over, I musta woke up on the wrond side of the bed.  Also - I am intching to go camping soon.  Anyone down with a camping trip.  Winter is over, so we will have to battle the bugs!  I want to go to Big Bend, never been there before.  ATTENTION!  All boring, lice-infested, re-hashers of punk rock!  burn in Hell!

      Went for a jog this morning and it felt great.  The air was cool - just right for me, and I felt very energized.  At lunch I went home to pick up the test pressing that were delivered to the apartment office the day before.  It was so hot, 87, at least that is what the weather website says, looks like its gonna storm soon.    Well - this really wasn't public knowledge until I was for sure, I told a few friends, but it seems that everyone knows.  I am planning on moving to sacramento, ca in october.  It's is a good amount of time away - I get the feeling that some people have already marked me out as "moved."  I havn't yet, and now I really do have to move, job or not, I will look like an idiot if I have to stay.  I can't think of I would have to stay, or why my plans would change - but shit happens.  I hate computers more and more each day - the whole industry seems to me like such a waste of time.  It's always changing and you constantly have to learn new software and hardware, but it doesn't seem to me to truely be NEW knowledge or GROWTH.  Just another way of doing the same shit, making corperations richer.  Ever since I started into this, it was a job, I wanted to do something in music; but that dream has faded with discouragement.  I hope I find my footing soon.   I finished an awesome book last night - The Woman in the Dunes by Kobo Abe(1924-1993) The guy is awesome, dead, but awesome eitherway.  I bought his book - The Box Man - but have yet to start it.  I was still finishing up a book I have been reading by Henry Rollins, the same book that turned me on the Kobo Abe in the first place, when I bought The Box Man.   When I went to Midland over the weekend, I had forgot my book, so I went out to Barns and Nobles on Saturday afternoon and looked around for something to read for about an hour or so.  I found the Woman in the Dunes, and I also picked up a John Steinbeck book called The Log of the Sea of Cortez (I had heard some talk about it on NPR and it sounded interesting.) Anyways, the woman in the dunes is about an teacher/amature entomologist who travels to a beach looking for some new type of beetle, he ends traped in a hole by the locals and forced to shovel sand with this woman, protectors of the village.  Its a good book, you should  urlLink pick it up.   I need to go to school tonight, but I am not really looking forward to it very much.  Just another skill that will soon be out of date.   Knowledge that is out of date, what a fucking weird idea.

      I have been having battle after battle with sleep in the last few days.  I think maybe I have taken it for granted the fact that I can hit the bed and instantly fall into a slumber.   Discomfort is a massive head fuck.  I think that my threshold for comfort is so pathetic.  I hate being hot, I can't stand being itchy, and I feel like a fucking whiny brat half the time.  Guess I need to change that.    MiMi told me I was "obsessed" with my outer appearence this weekend.  I don't like to think of it as low self asteem - it's more of a constant dissatifaction with who I am.  I am always thinking of what I need to change to make myself work harder, be better, look hotter, and live longer.  Maybe I do take it to far, it's not that, maybe I talk about it to much.  There are those people that talk to much, my self included, and there are those people that  DO!   The wedding is not far off.  I am looking forward to a vacation, Mexico will be nice.  We bought some new snorkal gear, so I am ready for the reef.   I am also terrified - I have been dreaming of shark attacks - or just seeing a shark in the water is giving me nightmares at night. Last time we went snorkaling, I saw a baracuda - that freaked me out a little.   I am so facinated with nature that I think about it all the time - I just don't want to be eaten.    I'm sure there are lots of things in the world that feel that way - i.e. farm animals.

      Seemingly impossible to shake, I have this feeling again.  That feeling that I am not happiest where I am.  I feel boxed in, trapped by my own self with one way out, and it's a fast and furious sprint out of the way of the buildings I have crumbled.  "What sad-sad-sad scene this is.  I've troubled myself to open a locked door; blind to the inversion of total and un-natural worthlessness"  The bounty of self-beating is great.  I can beat my self to a bloody pulp and gain a wealth of knowlege only once.  I know this doesn't make sense--that is just what is in my head.  I always think clearly at these moments after the drag is over.  I can't stop my pointless bull-shit sometimes.  I wonder how many people today, on their internet journal are saying things like "My life sucks!" or "I hate everything about myself."    It's easy to feel that way, it's almost hip and cool to feel bad; maybe, it's EMO!  At this moment I am listening to some mp3's of geoff farina.  Sounds alot like an acoustic karate.  It's the lead singer/guitar player from karate.  They guy is just amazing, I can absolute connect with what I hear most of the time. The world is all just a poem or a line from a song.  Every opinion can be assumed or boldly presented from shit like that.  I feel very pretty, hot even.  I have mad sex appeal.  haha.  Do I believe that?  What a sack of poo pies!  I am getting married in exactly ONE month!   Woah, i felt that heavy sinking feeling.  Not about getting married, but about the fact that I feel so overwhelmed with preparation.   MiMi and I are getting the cake, the decor, the tux, the rings, the place, the invites, and tons of stuff.  Oh man, I hope this goes well.  I still don't have a person to marry us.  At least after today I can go get the marriage license out of the way.  Pray for me and my mimi!?!  $%&!%*!&@$#!___q434@(#*@)(#!*@)#(*!@#)$#!@$

      Today the gym will be serving up hot biceps and triceps, on fire, burning to a crisp! F U C K YEAH! My conditioning is getting more natural as the months go by. I should have never stopped, even for a week, it is detrimental.   Well, I'm tapped out. I disputed an officially posted charge today and they blocked my card. I can't spend a dime - I just think it would complicate things more. So as the days go on, planet services has morphed into other companies like ISUND fiber optics and ISUND Internet and the one that posted was B365 Stokes/Trent??? That is weird, even the lady at the bank thought that was odd. Damn fuckers!  Some times you just gotta push it to the very end of the line!

      Taking in consideration of my present circumstance, I feel apt enough to make it through the day. I still have yet to make progess with my little money problem. I opened up a new bank account today. I am not to solicitous to throw more of my money down a spiralling hole called "My Present Bank Account."  Oh well, I talked to the directors at my school - I'm fucked. I am having to work out deals and press intensely. I feel like a failure, a disappointment to myself. I couldn't make it happen, but there is hope and it starts on Saturday.  This week has just been a crap heap. I need a bigger shovel to dig myself out of this hole. I wish I could just through out all my obligations, get a backpack and travel, meet up with old friends and have a cup of Joe. It sucks to feel this way - you know what I mean. But it will pass and everything will be golden once again. It's all a big fucking circle. The burden of being an adult. A guy at work said it was harder to be a kid, you don't have the freedom, you can't make your own decisions. Well - I say bullshit. Being an adult is harder - you HAVE TO make your own decisions - there is still no option.   I think I'll go play some tennis this evening. James (the head net admin at work) just bought a boat. Soon I will be going to the lake for some water skiing! That will mos def rock!

      When a good day goes bad! FUCK! I am in some trouble. I was just checking my bank account like I do on occasion and I noticed something odd. I only had 16 bucks and just yesterday I had alot more than that.   I got hot and felt that panic feeling come over me. Oh shit - did i screw up and spend to much money. I don't think so. I went over all the things that I had bought over the weekend and it didn't add up. Not even close. MiMi's card was stolen out of her purse at a gas station in west texas the weekend before memorial day.  She called me right after it happened - I called the bank and the card was blocked. Problem solved.   I'm not sure now.   So I call the bank and she lists off a few debits that have not posted. At first she only gave me the amount. $10 $8 $1 $250 $50 $150 $100  OK - I'm officially freaked out. those are big chunks of my rent due very soon!! She gives me the name of the company making the debit Planet Services WTF is that shit??!? I've never heard of this, and so I start my search.   Oh there is one for $500 that didn't go through. Well shit! thanx fuckers. I hope all of this is some big mistake becuase I don't want to wake up in the morning and be broke while Planet Services is sittin by some pool with my money!  I'm gonna be sick....

      Sometimes I think this public journal is just a way for me to try and impress others with my life. But I know that my life is far from impressive. I just don't want people to think I am trying to be cool. I just think writing rocks and this is a daily outlet.(I edited this post to clarify my point) I wish I could be more truthful about the way I feel sometimes, but that is why I have a personal journal made of paper. I would just rather type it but I don't think I would ever write in the book this much. It's just so convienent.  Nick came over tonight and we had some quasadillas and I started up my stars wars robot grill. It looks like those little things that ran around on the death star and a cross between darth vader's helmet. I like it. Makes me feel like powerful to control fire. whatever.  I've been writing a short story for Al's zine. I think I pretty much screw it up. I will write something fresh - blah. Listened to the new Cave In sampler EP thingy. I like it, i think their new stuff is awesome either way.   Work was the same - blah. Worked out the back today - I wanted to work on the chest - I will just get to it later this week. Maybe I will skip out on the legs this week.  I feel better than I did earlier today. I'm just so fed up with everything.

      Looking forward to getting back into the gym today. I love being off work - but sometimes I feel like I waste my spare time - damn technology.  I've been making more and more small talk with the janitor, eric. That guy is for real and just goes about his day with little complaint. He is an idiot all the same, but he seems happy so thats cool.  Like I posted lastnight - I saw Mulholland Dr. That has to be the no.1 most fucked up movie I have ever seen. It was good, but I am still confused.

      Well - watched the X-men movie and Mullholland Dr. today. Went fishing in the rain. Drank a whole 1.5 liters of Martini and Rossi Champane(sp). I washed all my clothes and donated some I don't wear. DRUNK. Going to bed soon.

      Let's see! How did I kill all that time. I played video games till about 3:30, downloaded tons of music and around 4:30 decided to go find a camp site.   After getting lost somewhere around Eagle Mt. Lake, first stopping at Grapevine Lake, I found myself far from home and pissed off. Of course, I could have told you the probability of finding an empty campsite. The drive was fun. We took tons of obscure farm roads and small curvy roads with big trees. It was a really nice drive.   Stopped by my parents house and said hello to them. I think they are doing ok, never can tell anymore.  Got home about 9pm and watched some tv - now I'm off to bed.

      I got a few hours to kill - getting that craving to hit the gym and let off some steam. I'm not pissed, just could use the rush.   I woke up alone yesterday and went to denny's for breakfast. Across the room was this father and son just finishing up their pancakes when I walked in. When I'm alone at places I find myself being nosy. They were talking about what to do after graduation. The father was telling the kid to do some traveling before he meets some girl. That's fucking weak. I guess for some guys - girls are nothing but a money pit pussy worth giving up all of your dreams for a poke. I think school and a job would drag the kid down before a girl - but if that is how he see's it - whatever.  I went home and played some gta3 until my ass fell asleep and around that time mimi came home - we got some food. She left for work soon after that and I dropped off some film to get developed [I hate walmart.] I took off to school right after that - that was uneventful.  On my way home I picked up some engine cleaner and started work on my vespa engine. I have been trying to get all these parts clean so I can inspect em for wear and put it all back together. I was pretty discouraged from all that work. I havn't sweated like that in a while. It was pouring into my eyes and I felt washed out.   This went on for a while, mimi came home around 9:45 and we watched some MADtv and then we crashed like jail break. I was tired.  Today has just really begun - I've been up since around 9:30 but I had some rought sleep. I woke straight up when this HUGE crash of thunder shook the windows. It was so fucking loud. One of my jalepeno planets fell over. I put the planet back in the pot, but I'm not sure how well it will recover. Still just a baby.  Today is uncertain.   Jake and I were talking last night about challenges and how hard shit can be sometimes. I don't think time makes things any easier either. challenge after challenge and they just keep getting more difficult. There is really no one to blame for the increased difficulty - there is always something in the way. I know I'm the guy that always puts those obstacles in my way. That's fine - I don't really mind - I just need to stop bitching. I have an awesome life - my spirit is fresh and I have alot to learn and see. Just rock out and I hope I make all the right moves. Right or wrong - I can take it.

      It's pretty late for me. I usually head for the sack, exhausted well before 11pm. I had some weird breakfast this morning. no lunch but I did try the vanilla coke. I wasn't that impressed. I LOVE vanilla coke but I'm not sure I will be drinking the pre-packaged bull shit.  I got a new tattoo tonight. I drove out to Suffer City in Garland becuase I knew that a few of the artist's were scooter fans. I had seen pics of vespas and lambrettas in front of the shop. I get out there around 7:15pm. I had a little trouble finding it. I couldn't remember where I saw the place. I found it eventually. Walked in and Nathan, the first guy I met, he was a pretty nice guy. The place was 'punk rock' which is totally fine with me. There were toys everywhere. I felt like I was at eric and alex's apartment. Toys in wrappers. I don't get it really. What's the point. I talked to another guy, Steve or Steven I can't remember. He was super cool and thought the atom would look good.   I walked in wanting to get one on each arm but had to just go with the right arm for now. It cost $150. seemed high compared to the $200 i spent on the mxpx guy (supposed to be $300 but I snaked a deal.) So maybe it was reasonable. Either way I got it and it hurt and it's big.   I was listening to a radio program around 11 when I went out to the store for some soda. They were talking to kids in Moldova about their parents. Apparently the country is in such bad shape that a quarter of the population has left the country to seek employment abroad. They said that the average yearly salary in Moldova is 150 dollars.   I felt bad.  That was my tat. I could have taken those toys in the wrappers down to the kids with my tattoo money and helped a few. I coulda - shoulda - probably won't. WhY?  Anyways, mimi said she is tired and will leave from snyder tomorrow morning instead of coming home tonight.   I called j.palmer and talked to him for about half and hour. He is doing good. Thats good. I need to push people farther away - getting attached sucks. I don't really need people anyways - thats a lot of shit!

      There is always something to read.   Not alot going on - I had a weird day at work yesterday. This chick at work pretty much tried her damn'dest to stick her boobs in my face. Ugly slut. Then I go to my car to leave for the day and she is sitting in her car next to mine on the far end of the parking lot. I open my door and she says, "Oh! You scared me..."  I just smiled and closed my car door. See ya later, wierdo.  Got the fucking 7" compilation in yesterday. Also, the deposit check from our vaction. I'm fucking glad the wax is here. Now I gotta wait on the covers and this mess will be done - one fucking year later.   My legs are still pretty sore from the leg workout wednesday. Today is bi's and tri's.   I decided that I am not going camping after all. I need to finish up some things and I want to work on some shit around the house. mimi is going to snyder this afternoon for her cousin's graduation. Hope that goes well and she stays safe. She should be back around 2am. I think I am going to toy around with my vepsa - I got some skrilla so I 'm gonna clean up the parts and see If I can make some headway and get it up and running soon. Also, I need to dick around with the Mortal Kombat arcade. Maybe I should order the parts today. I will do that. Also, F.Y.I. - the Time Killers arcade game is up for sale. What's a good price?  I also need to clean up the house and finish folding the clothes. I need some beer buddies to drink some beer form my beer mugs. haha.   Sometimes I miss palmer - maybe I had a non-sexual crush on the guy - i dunno. But him leaving has really left an empty spot in my life. I feel like a dork but oh well. I guess I will have to shoot up to Denver and see him. I called him around Tuesday and Aurda answered the phone. I talked to her for a little while - I wasn't mean, I guess I'm not pissed about it anymore.

      Last night mimi and I went shopping, she needed some jeans. I also picked myself up two new CDs. black rebel motorcycle club and the new promise ring. I like b.r.m.c, that cd is pretty fucking rocking but the new promise ring I havn't had a chance to listen to much of it just yet.  I am going camping this weekend, but it looks like it is going to be by myself. That will surely be some interesting self evaluation time. Time like that can make you think about alot of things. I think mimi we come out there with me on Sunday after 3pm but I am gonna go out on Friday afternoon. I hope it doesn't rain on my ass. My tent is in good shape. I am always keeping it clean and patching up any holes that wear thin. This might be my chance to hike out into the primitive sites and camp there.  Anyone want to go camping this weekend?  My fucking leags are screaming mutiny!! I had a hard time sleeping last night because those things would never get in a comfortable position. I'm stiff - today I'm working out the shoulders. I can really see the work paying off in that area. There are lots of muscles I never really paid attention to. Still need to pay better attention to my diet.  Another ongoing battle for sure.

      ? Most of the time, I wake up around the same time every morning. I hit the snooze button three times every morning after 7:30 - I lay there until mimi says get up about two times - and then she leaves for work. No I get up - it's usually 8:30 by now. ? I don't mind a little routine now and again. A daily routine of preparing yourself for what the day holds is never a thing I would lightly throw out the window. I'm not saying I spend an hour fixing my hair. I don't think I will ever have to do that. [Unless I go for the 'comb-over'. Next of kin to the mullet.] I just feel generally better through-out the day if I took the time to iron my shirt or make sure my armpits don't stink.  ? Maybe it's all self-esteem - probably. ? I feel sorry for this dog next door. Up to a point I feel bad for the dog. Then I start getting pissed at the owners. Every morning around nine, this dog gives out the loneliest howls and bellows. I've seen this dog a few times too. She is a great Dane the size of a house. I wish I had the strength of some of these big breed dogs. Big black and white spots look like she came from the house of an 18th century novel writer who spilled a lot of ink.  ? I guess the owners leave around 8:30 or so, right about the time I am talking myself into staying in bed. This couple is extremely over-weight. I just don't get that lazy twinkie eating shit. I never see a health problem as the cause of their being overweight. To me, you can always work it off. To many times it seems that being over-weight is the cause of the health problem. I just that poor dog didn't feel so attached the her owners. She is just going to get eaten anyways.

      This morning I picked up a Met-RX bar and some water for breakfast. It's lower-body day in the gym and it almost always kicks me on my ass. It's been three weeks since the last squat or leg-press. I feel pretty drained. Last week, i just skipped wednesday in the gym - I think I was busy; but that was the only day missed.  I'm just screwing around at work uploading files to myplay.com - drawing - checking email and message boards. Not much going on, I set up a laptop for a guy, prepared the backups, and answered some calls about simple operational questions.   I drove by a Jack-n-the-Box and saw like this couple barly pull out of the drive thru and they are stuffing their face. Shit! Get the wrapper off first. Sooner or later someone is going to come out with this idea where people can ask for "Drive" instead of "To Go"   "Would you like that burger to Drive, Sir" "What's the...?" "We prepare the sandwich in the wrapper so you can DIVE right in. Would you like to me do that?" "Sure...I'm a fat lazy fucker - just calories I don't have to burn."  They would neatly fold the wrapper ready to take in hand and eat imediatly. That is just fucking lazy. If that ever happens, it would just be a perfect progression into the American dream. The president would endorse the new complementary Drive wrapper option.  I guess if it goes that far, they should just have people in the restroom to shake and wipe.  Oh well - I am going home tonight to prepare Thank you cards for all the lovely people that brought wedding gifts and helped out with the wedding. I am really glad all that went well.

      "I like too many things and get all confused and hung up running from one falling star to another till I drop. This is the night, what it does to you. I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion." - Jack Kerouac  That is pretty much what I felt like last night. I have this desire to be in a band. I love all the fun shit - playing and rocking out - merch - websites - mp3s - promotions. All of that, I find enjoyable. I just forget how much time it all takes.   To be in a fucking good band - you have to have mad dedication, commitment, and you gotta find some bad ass mofo's to rock out with every night. That being said, I have the upmost fucking respect for guys and gals who stick together, tour their ass's off, and rock out every chance they get. I just don't have the love for it like once upon a time.   Music is something I love - but it's not my only interest. No - I don't have a.d.d. I love rocking out - with my friends or in my car even, it something I totally enjoy. I am just working on time management alot and it seems that from 7pm to 12 midnight is alot of time to fuck around. Don't get me wrong - I like hanging out and just running around. I just need that strong passion about the music to spend endless hours on writing music that always seems to die in less than 5 years.  I met nick, christy [nick's friend], eric and venessa at the veggie garden. I can't stand that place. The people freak me out and it just looks dirty. Plus I can't stand the whole mock meat thing. I eat alot of junk and I'm sure its just as unhealthy as synthetic food. I just think that is a little OVER processed. I had tofu and veggies.  We rode out to the practice place south west of downtown I think. I was taking in the totally experience of going out to this place. It was right out of punk rock legends. Posters and flyers all up and down the dank old halls of this place. Looked to me like some old school - there were kids making noise for sure.  It was an event to say the least. I was the fill-in drummer for the night. I was pretty fucking sweaty when we rolled out of there. I was so thirsty and dry'd up. I went by a closed convience store - got pissed and went home.  I love going home - I sneak into the bedroom around 1AM right after I'd spend some 'winddown time' on the patio. mimi just laid there sleeping soundly in one of my button-up shirts. She always looks so comfortable when she is sleeping. I was comfortable too.      Go read a kobo abe book! I am about to pick up 'The Box Man' and start in on that.

      when i was at the mall on sunday, I show up there around 11 and nothing is fucking open but some food place and the movies. All the other stores don't open until 12. I guess I had never been to the mall on sunday morning but here I was with others around me and the store was deserted.   FUCK!  I waited around for what seemed like a long while, I still havn't replaced my watch that was stolen in Mexico. I have the hardest time finding clocks on the wall. So I waited - with no idea what time or even when the place opened. I just waited. I was stoned out of my mind - just sitting there on this bench.   Here comes the fucking little kid, and I am telling the truth, this 7-year old boy came and sat by me out of the blue. He said "Hey Mister I am waiting for this place to open," and he pointed the the store directly in front of me. It was a kids photo place and they have some fucking dumb camera kids can play on and eventually destroy. "I'm gonna play on that big camera."   "Great.." I said. I was so out of my mind. I just wanted the piosonous vermin to scrurry away under the arms of some guardian. I hate people some times. Esp. their fucking kids.   They hung around my general area for a while as I waited for this shoe store to open and I could finally get my Diesel shoes. They had the one I wanted - I could see it through the massive scuplture of metal bars enclosing the store.  I get in and they only have a size 8 in each color. the model is discontinued. The life of a super model is sooooo hard.

      well so far today has been pretty average. not to busy and not to dull - so far. i started thinking about how it was in mexico. I had no tv. there wasn't a radio station i could understand - I never picked up a paper. I was totally isolated from the happenings of the world. or so it seems. I am so tied up with information that its hard to just look beyond all the 'news' and see how the world really is. I think they only way to do that is to go to places. I am really looking for adventure most of the time. some sort of new challenge. I will have to visit india some day.

      On Saturday, I was at wal-mart, dropping off the pictures from our trip to mexico and I find this dvd that I want to pick up. It's the enitre miniseries called V. Do you remember it at all? I just remember parts of the show freaking me out. My dad used to watch it alot, I remember going up to his office and he had a TV in there. I guess late at night, TV episodes of V is pretty entertaining.   I bought the dvd.  It's fucking weird, but I totally got into the story. I didn't watch a whole lot of it - just as the aliens were intigrating themselves with the human society. What a trip man, this shit was humorous a few times. The 80's are funny on their own.

      I woke up around 10:30AM, not feeling very rested at all. The late night before has throw everything off for me today. Didn't really slow things down much this weekend. After throwing on the same pair of shorts and the same t-shirt I was wearing last night., mimi and I scurried off to my office to change out the weekend backup tapes from the servers. After that we drove out to the Ft.Worth Natural History Museum to check out the exhibit and watch thte show in the planetarium. We got there and the parking was a mess - there is some sort of farm animal show out at the will rogers area. The exhibit wasn't like I remember'd. It was small, unorganized and just seemed to be missing alot of things. Must have been another museum, I am just confused. The planetarium was ok, it was targeted at younger crowd for sure, but I still enjoyed the tips for finding navigational stars. That was very informative.  We went from there to a mexican food resturant and shot out to the mall to see if they had any more disael canvas mules for men. no dice. So I took mimi back home - she had to leave for work at 3pm. I went to get some of the pictures from our honeymoon developed. Got em back,

      Well - It is close to 4 A.M. and I just can't sleep. After dinner I decided to go see the new Star Wars movie. I thought it was excellent. Lots of Stars and lots of Wars. I was happy to see the movie heading for a familiar trend. I can see where things are going now. I am truely getting tired now. The night is very still. Not much making noise out on the porch. I am sitting out there a few times tonight wondering about things.   Oh well, more weekend later.

      Well - Brian just called, and as I had predicted, he will not be coming up to pick-up the arcade. He had a problem with his check and will not have the funds. That is cool - anyone want an arcade game to go in the casa. CHEAP! I would just wait for another auction. I think there is one coming up on June 22nd. Look out for that. haha. I will probably go home after work, roll a J and play some fucking gta3. I have yet to actually fuck off for a few hours. Keeping the apartment clean is an all day job by its self.

      Ok well - It looks I went with the crowd and got a live journal. I wish I could figure out a way to move all of my spyattack entried over here. Oh well.   I guess I am just going to let the domain name expire and go on.   Brian stopped by last-night to say hello. I guess he was in the area - at least that is what he said. We talked a little while, I got lit, and we checked out the mr.bill DVD that I got as a wedding gift from my boss. It was an odd little DVD.  He want to buy the Time Killers arcade machine for $160. We will see, he is supposed to pick it up tonight and bring me the money. It's a cool game, just ready to get it out of the garage, and I wasn't into it that much. Just thought I could make some scrilla from the game - oh well. I really wanted Altered Beast anyways. I am at work - a little bored, but I feel accomplished this week. I got alot done at work, I had a good time the other night with a little barbq going on and it's soon to be the weekend. a matter of hours.   I have to come up to work tomorrow and change out the tapes for the back up. No big deal - I might run up to school for a while are maybe learn some shit...

       ...텺ARRIED MEN ALL WISH THEY WERE STACKED LIKE ME...   Well - I wish I could figure out why my comments aren't working.  Oh well.  no one reads this anyways - cuz its not a live journal.  For me to archive anyways.  I have a hard time remebering things some time.  Maybe this will help.  I am a married man - happily married to mimi! So now married life starts.  Weird, but it doesn't feel that different.   Honey moon was eventful - most memorable recap would be snorkaling, Mayan Ruins, going to the grocery store, and getting robbed.  Some one broke into our rental car on the last day of our trip and stoke my watch and sony handycam.  FUCK! I am still a little bitter about the whole mess.  The wedding was awesome.  I should have some pictures any day.  I had a good time there.  I feel like an old man now.  At least I have the best body ever for a married man.  I love fucking pushing weights around, working out in the gym.  I think that is a good reason I was glad to be back in DFW.

       ...텳AKE TO-DO LISTS AND THE WOMEN WHO CARE...   You know your creativity is lost when you look up on a cloudy day and there are just a bunch of clouds floating around.  No fluffy white turtles meandering across the deep blue background - just clouds.  I have been hard pressed for a creative idea, something to build esp. after all the breaking I have been doing.  Being constructive is like a dream to me - a goal I feel I should achieve at all times, but for the most part I do nothing to get me there.  For example, I am at work, I have tons of things to do, but I can't really do anything about it here.  So I sit, and grow a farm of hemroids(joke).  I am going out of my mind some times - I swear.    I need to build something - like a bench or something.  I wish this blogbuddy had a thesarus - I would use fancier words.  wink wink ;)

      I guess I will start where I left off. That would be Thursday. I have to say, I wish I hadn't gone to work on Thursday. I might have been better off staying in bed.  "My alarm clock lost power and then I got a cold..."  Yeah, right. I was up at 6:30am. I had switched 'shifts' with Robert so I could head out to the lake earlier - that meant I had to be up at the office at 7:30am. No problem. I'd rather be up anyways.  My morning went really well, slow, but nothing annoying or worth causing a fuss about. I had an email problem in the Alabama office that I was 'brainstorming' over. I kept it in the back of my mind, something I do alot at the office.  Soon enought it was around that time to head to the gym, strap on some weight gloves and push some iron. Good times but not on this Thursday.  Right off the bat, I saw the foreshadowing of something bad. As I was walking down the hall, this fat, rolled-over, dick of a man named Taylor is standing in the hall looking for his 'mail.' He has been coming to the gym for about two weeks and just really gets tooled around by his co-workers. He seems to do whatever ridiculous exercise they throw at him - what a pushover. As I walked down the hall, he looked up at me and then back at his mailbox by the mailroom. I start to walk around him and he steps right in my way, without even aying excuse me or anything. It was totally an obvious move to piss me off.  I just mumbled "JACK ASS" under my breath. Another weak move by me. I shoulda just laid the guy out right there - but I let it slide right off my back like everything else.  The workout was going pretty smooth, I noticed 'jackass' had made his way over to the tredmill to do a little mall walking. We had some Oldies radio on the stereo and James, Robert, and myself were working those shoulders hard.  Up pops Talors buddy, Brian (this guy talks bad about his wife and says beer at least once a day in the gym.)  He starts changing the radio station, while at the same time asking James if he doesn't mind.  James says "Yeah, I like that station." Brain: "I can't workout to that" still changing the station  "Is this alright" Brian says as he gets closer to the station of his choosing. James: "I don't give a fuck......pause.......but if I come in here tomorrow and you change the station when I asked you not to, I'm gonna have to fight your fucking ass over it. That's bullshit!"  BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The little bitch but it back on the Oldies and went back to his tredmill. All I heard was "Fuck" and "Shit." HAHA they were pissed.   Now I hate going into that gym. It was embarrassing to see that totally lack of restrain on negative emotions. I understand James was pissed, and he had a right to be upset. It was just a bad vibe, especially with customers.  Anyways, James was hot for the rest of the day at work. 4pm rolled around and I was out of there. I picked up mimi and we headed out to Lake Grapevine to meet up with James and do some water skiing. I had a blast. Ryan, James oldest son was with us for about 2 hours. I finally got up on the water and actually skiied. Fuck yeah, that was a relief for the Thursday from hell.   I ended up forgetting about dinner and by the time I got home, I was so tired and hungry we headed over to IHOP for a gourmet meal. ha.  Today was pretty chill. There were some adverse effects of James actions in the weight room. The owner of my consulting firm sent out an email to all of MIS about proper etiquette in the gym. haha. James was pissed - time to look for another job he says.  I packed and stuffed and folded everything for the 7" comp. That is coming to an end.   Looks like mimi didn't get that job, havn't heard anything from the folks in cali - guess we'll just have to keep looking. As for me, I havn't had one solid lead.  I bought the Karate Double LP - that has to be my favorite record. Damn Palmer took my CD to Denver with him! FUCK  goodnight  p.s. - arcade auction - Sat morning at the Rodeo center in Mesquite - I will be there at 8am to play some free games.   current mood:  tired current music: Karate

      The gym was extra sweaty at 11:30 today. The A/C has been fucked in that room for about two weeks. There were wet spots on the floor where the leaks from the unit had dripped for weeks. I don't really know why it was extra hot today, maybe because there were a few ceiling tiles missing. Hot air from the warehouse must be making its way into the gym.   I am looking forward to this weekend. Another arcade auction on Saturday morning. I will try to attend a show this weekend, people seem upset. I'm also gonna help nick move into his new castle. Look it's wednesday and I am already looking towards the weekend.   I feel weird talking to my parents, something is different now and I don't like it.  Tomorrow, I get off at 4pm and I'm heading to the lake. This time, mimi will be along for the ride. That will help curb the weirdness of riding around in a baby-blue boat. I am so macho!! :)   current mood:  cheerful current music: jawbreaker

      As strange as this may seem. I went water skiing last night with my co-workers, James and Robert. I had never been water skiing before and it was a fucking workout! I am so exhausted today - my hands have blisters on them.   Jame's boat is so interesting to look at. He recently bought it in Granberry for cheap. It doesn't have the best color combinations. Actually it looks like a baby-blue Barbie? Speed Boat. hahaha. It's fast as hell though. He needs to get it painted. Three guys in a baby-blue(with a hint of pink pinstirpes) looks like a pride run on the lake. Whatever.   People were still going "ooo and ahhh" over the speed. If it was black and red, it would look like the Bat-Boat from the live action series in the 60's.   MiMi had a phone interview with a district and regional manager from the Bay Area. She will find out if she got the job at the end of the week. I am kinda interested in how this will go, so far is sounds very likly that she is a shoe-in for the position. I'm happy for her. She will be moving out there soon than expected - at least, that is the way it looks.   current mood:  exhausted current music: coldplay

      I understand alot of things latly. I understand why I am where I am. I can see the long road that got me here, I just wish it was as nice for the other travelers as it was for me, but it's not. All I can see, looking back, is pot holes created by someone else. My poor brother and sister. How can I mend those holes for them.   I can't. I can only love them. Damn the crappy way love turns sour. My parents are a mess. I can't seem to deal with it. I just wish a decision can be made and we can all just go on. I really don't have much to do with it anymore. What a mess.  Yesterday was pretty fun, I was bored for a little while. MiMi and I washed out cars and I waxed her car when she got home from work. She helped out with that too. It looks nice.   Around 11pm, her friend Cindy came over. Cindy is also manager of a Nine West shoe store. She was MiMi's manager before MiMi got her own store. Miss Cindy is super slender and almost 40. She laughs at everything and has some pretty funny stories of her own.  We drove up to Half Price Books off of 75 and Northwest Highway around 11:30pm. They had just closed so there were people still around. We got out and started looking in the dumpsters. Sure enough, my preminitions were correct. A guy came up and asked us what we were doing. I made up some shit about needing box's for moving. He watched us get a few boxes and we took off Pissed as hell - we all vowed to come back in a few hours.  We drove down greenville and came back, all the way past university and circled back around towards Cafe Brazil. We stopped and dumped the boxes that we didn't need and went in to have some food and drink.  I'm so not used to being in Dallas, I spend so much time in my neighborhood. Lots of open space in suburbia.   Anyways, we went back to Half Priced Books around 1am and got tons of books. I was paranoid being with two girls. There were lots of gawkers that would slow down to "check out the chicks" and that made me nervous. People do crazy shit to get sex and I would have a hard time defending a car full of guys trying to stick my wife and her friend. That shit freaks me out. I would go insane if that ever happened. Anyways, my nerves got the best of my and we left only after digging around for about an hour. I think we all found plenty of shit. I was satisfied.   I saw the security gaurd leave at 1am so just a tip. Go to Half Priced Books after 1am and on the weekends and there will be lots of books for free. This would be an awesome way of starting a punk rock library. Maybe those South Main kids would be interesting in this info.

      Over the past couple of days things have moved at their normal pace. Nothing extra ordinary has happened. That is fine with me. I watched a few good movies during the weekend, sat around the house most of last night, and have just been going to work at my normal time.  I read a bit of those books I got from the library. Evolution and history. The idea of evolution interests me. Unlike most people who go to public school, I was taught at home during my highschool years and my history and science books were religiously biased. Creation was taught, and the Christian agenda was splattered on every page. I was bright enough to see it, and I just went on. To me, I had to find out on my own both sides of that coin before I made a decision. I still don't know enough about evolution to make it totally clear that I could teach someone else. I think once you understand an idea well enough to pass on the information correctly, you know what you are talking about, otherwise, it is best left unearthed. I am feeling a little dull and bored.

      Who sucked out the feeling? Understanding the ultimate human cause for laughter and sobing can be traced back to serveral soruces. Pain, fear, joy; they are all just words. What is the most common thread of life between everthing living, is it that fact that we ARE alive or that we will all die. I have been thinking alot, I have been drinking some too.   I went to the library today and picked up two books on human evolution and a book on the history of mexico. I hope I can find the time to read all three. The darwin book, i dove into it already, seems like some tough reading - interesting at the same time.   The course of my goals has changed over the years, and I guess I can expect it to change a few more times. Hopefully I can stay the course, see the end of the road before I decide to turn down a side street.   Intoxicated by all around me, I only know that who I am is who I make myself out to be. Understandably, that is what faces each of us. For some reasons, I think I shall like who I am very much..

      Oh, a hunting I will go. Job-hunting that is! With cubicles and office chairs...ya'll come back now - ya hear!  All of Wendesday and Thursday, my mind as been in one single fucking place. The Move. I have been saturating myself with preperations. I'm not even sure if it will be worthwhile in the long-run. I do this to myself all the time, with out a break.   I've been looking into colleges, apartments, and jobs, jobs, jobs. Right now, I am looking for something during the night hours. If I can pull that off, I might start back to school earlier than I am planning to. We will see - I'm super stoked thought. At the same time, a lot of scared.  I'm starting all over while, at the same time, alot of my friends are starting out brand new, and some are moving up in what they love. Me - I'm starting over from the start - that's fine. I got lots of time I guess. Might as well be busting my ass during that time. The other option would be to make and spend money. Seems worthless and unrewarding but I guess I would have STUFF! Fuck that.  I have a long list of goals. Longer than santa's list, i'm sure.   current mood:  anxious current music: face to face

      I went out to nick's place last night to hang out with him, had some awesome conversations, a few laughs, it was a good time. Ate to much food and with the beer on top of that made me sleepy, fast. I headed home and read for about 30 minutes before I crashed out like a tree falling in a forest.  This morning I woke up with a head full of dreams and a face full of crust. The sleep was a hard sleep, but I tossed and turned alot last night. I woke up feeling troubled, maybe it was the dreams. There were two dreams that I remeber well, the second one was in two parts.  The first dream was late in the night, another on of those "raging jealously" dreams. I have them often, maybe once a month or so. It always involves mimi screwing some other guy, this time an older man, maybe in his 40s or 50s. It ends with me beating the living shit out of the guy. The dreams are always soo intense that I have woke up crying or yelling profanity. Last night was, "Fuck this shit." MiMi didn't even wake up, I suppose that is good, but I wanted to talk about it.   Back to sleep after a few minutes and I have another emotionally real dream. This time it was more invovled and new. MiMi and I had traveled to a small beach area, not really sure where. It's a dream so it could be anywhere, the streets were desserted for the most part except for a small fishing shop on the road facing the ocean. We were riding bikes down the road to a small square beach called "La Gu" - I remeber looking at a map and noticing that the beach was not far away from another beach called "La" - thats all, just "La" not L.A. but "La". Weird. As we approach the beach, directly inland and across the road from the beach was a mountainous sand dune with two women sitting about halfway up on the dune. They were just talking, mostly about being lesbiens and woman's rights and topics of that sort.   Right behind the dune, or just over the top of the dune back towards the fishing shop was a giant house. Old, but well kept and very dark. The color of the outside of the house was dark. I walked in and my father, who happened to look alot like Anthony Hopkins, was standing at the top of the stairs. He was a powerful looking man, who was on his way to another meeting far away. He had just taken in a girl from somewhere, I'm not totally sure. I think she was to be his wife, or adopted daughter - I can't remeber. I just know she had problems with drugs or something - and this is so unlike me, but I felt complete compassion for the girl. She was so lonely and sad. I knew that a little love from someone could turn her life around. So I watched over her, she was around 20, this wasn't a little kid.  One night she had disappeared, and I had fear the worse, my father's maid was phoning him. He rushed home and I had found her with those girls by the dunes and I rushed her to the hospital. They had released her, so by the time I had made it home, my father was standing there, a grim look on his face, careless, almost evil. He said nothing, turned his back and walked towards a limo on the side of the house. I took her up to my fathers enourmous bed and tucked her in. She was upsetting to look at, not ugly, just in pain, hurt emotionally. I held her and she cried.  The next day there was a show at a local pub, Jake and 10kDrive were in town to play and we were in the club early - planning an evil "holloween" style show. We had taken water/oil ballons up in the roof, posted next to an opening in the ceiling to drop on people during the set. There were costumes and ropes and it was gonna be scary. After getting that all set up, Silver Actions showed up and started setting up. They were the fist band, and during their set, Nick's older brother(who doesn't exsist) came up to me. He looked just like nick, taller and with more facial hair, but just like him. He was telling me that his hoodie was much cooler than Nick's and he went on about why it was cooler. Around this time, I woke up. The tossing and turning began.   Weird eh.  I also found out that alot of people around me are taking anti-depressants and I didn't even know. I had alot to say about that too but I really think it would just be a waste of time. Good luck to everyone that is having troubles. I wish you well, and her is a hug from me ((((((((((((((((((((you)))))))))))))))))))

      Unlike most weekends around Coffman house, things were on an upswing this weekend. First off on Friday I participated in one of the biggest displays of white-trash I have ever seen. On Saturday, I went grocery shopping, suit shopping and as the hours carried on, I was shopping for a clear thought. Sunday was a day to chill and clean up. I took a break and saw a film - and now it's Monday and I am thinking back on all the silly fun shit.  Let me get back to Friday night, I finished up work as fast as I could, I was supposed to meet James at 7pm and I didn't want to keep him waiting. I raced home to change my shirt and shoes(ritualistically) and pick up mimi, she went with me. All the while making record time, I pull into James drive-way just under a few minutes from 7. He had two extra tickets to the Craftsman 400 truck series at the Texas Motor Speedway. OH MY FUCKING LORD. I was floored, I was in awe when we pulled into this fucking crazy stadium of wasted energy - I was just so fucking blown away with the display of utter trashiness. Fat - fat -fat -fat everywhere. There were Turkey legs for the classic cavemen, beer by the tons for the idiots, and troglodytes for the mullet-styled fellers. There were wrecked RV's, race-car painted pickups that looked more like moving toilets and tons of really nice motorcycles. It was like a trailor park with out the houses. I would hate to be here on NASCAR day when there are some 250,00 fuckers, this was a light event comparatively. I think somewhere around 80,000 race-fans. That's is alot of - well alot of fucking idiots for sure.  The race was intense, I have to say that much. The feel of the Roman empire was strong, large arena - danger and possible death!! The cheer of the crowd for their favorite local driver was obvious, the boo's when someone gets to close to their hero couldn't even scare a fly. I was definatly charges, excited, and pumped up when those trucks would barrel down the side of the track. Oh well - don't tell anyone. We left a few laps before the race ended. I just imagine how the traffic would be at the end of the race, it wasn't so bad when we left. I have to say, I will never pay for a ticket to see a race, but I'd go again for free of coarse.  On Saturday MiMi and I woke up, wanting to do something but not sure what, so we decided to go buy some groceries - It was a good oppurtunity to handle that mess. MiMi went off to work around 1pm and I went to the mall to just shop. I was looking for a suit and that was an undertaking in itself. I had an idea of what I wanted - and after 4 different stores and about 14 different suit jackets I think I might have found the one I am looking for. I am supposed to pick it up on Thursday. When I got home after buying a new white dress shirt and some new grey dress slacks I started doing the laundry and cleaning up the house. That went pretty smooth - I didn't see anyone till about 10pm - I had a few beers and was feeling pretty warm and happy. Alex and Eric stopped by to play some board games, I think it was called Tribond, I had fun. I pretty much felt like an idiot, but after a while, I got into the groove of thinking - if you can believe that.  Sunday, once again alone, MiMi was off working at her store from 11 - 6 so I finished up the laundry and went to the movies around 1:30. I went and saw the Sum of All Fears and it was alright. I enjoyed it - I havn't seen an action movie on the big screen in a while (except star wars - but that is different.) It was a wonderful day, partly cloudy, and just gorgous - I didn't stay outside much because of the heat but I was one of those days that makes you smile and say "Summer is here!"   I had dinner on the stove when MiMi came home. Some spicy Thai stirfry with a little red curry and yummy thai rice. I dunno the name of my dishes, I just cook what I wanna eat. I also made some chocolate-covered strawberries and boy where they delicious. Watched Proof of Life again with MiMi and ironed all my outfits for the week. I am prepared - bring it on!

      Understandably, things change. For the most part, I accept these changes and move on but at times comfort is the key. I am really starting to get worried about my move - my BIG up and coming life change. One way or another, I will pull it off, but it is an unknown adventure that could crush me.  I didn't have enough to eat this morning, that will adversly affect my workout - I will be a big pile of ooze when I'm through. MiMi is off work today, I am gonna go home at lunch and hang out with her for a while. It's cloudy atleast and that makes for a pleasent break from the heat that I will have to just get used to for the next few months.  I havn't read a book since I got back from Cancun - I'm sorta pissed about that. Again, it's one of those things that no one can do anything about but me. There are several books that I would love to jump into - it just seems like I spend my free time cooking, cleaning, and stareing at some sorta screen.  I feel like a zombie - it's time to stop the EVIL cycle. This happens to me every summer - I just don't like to go out for a walk as much as I do in the winter. To me there is nothing inspiring about summer. Winter has this magic about it that makes me think and feel more positive.   This is a re-occuring topic for me, I apologize.  I was hoping to get the bump today but I found out that it looks like it will be a couple of days. bummer. I really need to either get my money back from the bank or get my paycheck so I can pay my rent. UGHH!

      Today, I am in my new office. It's not really an office - it's just a desk in the computer room. I am taking the place of Robert as the lead Operations guy. I will have a chance to learn new skills as far as SAP and IBM AS/400 but I am pretty much stuck in the computer room. I'm gonna have to bring a hoodie up in here cuz it's cold. I don't really have the option of changing the temp. I could just come in her every 20 minutes and check on shit but my phone and computer are in here now and I like to have a home at work. Some small space to call my own. I guess that is the same reason people decorate there work space. You want to feel comfortable.  I like having locked doors that have to be locked at all times. Keeps people from walking in my office without me expecting it. Sometimes I'm like to play puzzle games and talk to friends on AIM while I bored. I don't want that to become an issue if you know what I mean. Now it is less likly to make an impact. Plus, I have a new feeling of security as far as my job goes and that is nice. Everyone seems to want me in this seat, they all feel that my easy-going personality is better suited for this position that the other guy Rob. I guess there have been a few conflicts as far as that goes. I just roll with the punches like I always say. Bring it on, cuz I can always deal.   I can atleast listen to my music at a normal level in here. When I had the post in the hall I was always worried about being to loud. There are so many fans and buzzing electronic noises in here that I have a hard time hearing people on the phone. It's not that bad.  I brought my lunch today. Kinda reminds me of going to school. I would always bring my lunch. I just don't want to get outside at 1pm to go to my car with the melted steering wheel in the dead heat of the summer just to waste money and gas on some sub-par meal. I think I will be bringing my lunch from now on. Oh well. I think I will like it - I do enjoy going to lunch with the GUYS, but I have a feeling that being in here away from the everyday PC support (I'm the backup guy now) will seperate my close ties to those guys. Maybe not, I do work out with em every day.  Oh yeah, today we are working on the back. It's normally a short workout, because James wife comes in to do arobics with an instructor and he goes to lunch with her afterwards. Her workout is only 30 minutes so we cut it short so he can get out with her. I think I will just stay in there and get some jogging in. I need some of that FAMOUS LATIN STAMINA!   HAHA. Sorry - I was playing more GTA3 last night. The Asian chick was beating up the vato from the cartel and she said that. I watched a little bit of TV and cooked up a big pot of beans. They are sooooo good. I cooked em for about 4 hours and but some chilepowder, cumin, garlic pepper, fresh garlic, one onion, about three tablespoons of butter and three tablespoons of that Jack Daniels bar b q sauce and some salt and black pepper. It turned out nice, but my I got some mad gas. I think something crawled up my ass and died.   I need a stereo with a CD player in here - I have been listening to the radio, AC/DC rules.

      This weekend was pretty full of fun! On friday night I really didn't do much. I sat around at home, cooked some spicy mexican style veggies and rice and watched 'The Pledge' on HBO. Went to bed early.  On Saturday morning, woke up around 9:30am or maybe t was later. After mimi went to work I drove up to school, but they wouldn't let me work - they said my time had expired and I was supposed to meet with one of the directors. He stood me up. So I called Alex, he was asleep. I went home and got on my computer and talked to Kevin from Shreveport. He convinced me to come out to veggie garden at 2pm to eat and hang out. I had no money( I do but my account is frozen until I get my money back and my rent paid) but Nick hooked me up and now I owe him lunch. I got home around 3:45 and Brian called. He came over and hung out for a while. mimi came home around 5pm and we just sat around. We were all waiting to go over to Alex's casa and hang out. Left my house around 7pm - stopped at sonic and got a soda with quarters that I fished out of the bottom of the Mortal Kombat game.  Got to Alex's house and looked at the wedding pictures. They are awesome - THANKS ALEX! I was super stoked out all that - means alot to me to have a friend like him. We watched Brian play video games, played some 2 player Tony Hawk while mimi fell asleep. After all that - it was around 11 and everyone was asking me when Nick was going to call - so we decided to watch one of the many great DVDs that Eric and Alex have. We watched Pi - that was a kick ass movie. It made you think for sure.   I wanted to go dig for books behind the Half Price Books - it was 1am - mimi was tired.  Sunday was ok - we went to Denny's for breakfast and it was packed - not pleasent. I played some GTA3 until about noon and got ready to go to Sommer Shockley graduation. We were there for a while, after that mimi had to go to work for a few hours and when she got home, I had dinner ready for her and we watched the simpsons and some of the basketball game. Damn Lakers!   Watched 'The Seige' on TV last night. That was kinda weird to watch after Sept.11th.

      Lots of packing and studying going on. I was looking for good music on mp3.com around Rohnert Park, CA (where I am moving off too) and I found some good stuff. There is this one shitty metalcore band called the Beverly Beer Belly's :) That made me laugh - they pretty much suck. There was some lo-fi stuff that sounded like death cab for cutie or pinback. I would really like to get into something like. Just some good slow/soft heart felt music about deeper things than girls and love. Maybe a celebration of love instead of the heart-break of life. I've had my heart-breaks... I think there is more to everything than that or this or those. All in moteration, even the thoughts.  I am pretty freaked out about the FOG! Everytime I have been to the Central Valley and the Bay Area the FOG is super intense. I have only delt with fog like that in texas maybe a total of three times. There is a whole season of this morning and evening FOG. I should probably learn how to drive in it. There was a 78 car accident in Bakersfield because of the FOG. That is in the southern part of the central valley close to LA but its all the same FOG.  I almost have every fucking piece of paper faxed and overnighted to the apartment complex we are moving into. I hope we qualify becase I would hate to look for a place with just a few days notice. This shit has taken over a week so far. I know we had trouble at the last apartment we lived in. They always gave us hell about shit and then never fixed a damn thing. I hated that place and for some reason I think that I'm gonna hear about it from these people in California and then have to explain myself to them.  I am getting excited about the upcoming road trip!   current mood: super stoked! current music: edward applebee and jagjaguwar records music

      Under normal circumstances, I would feel bland and ready to kill my self. This week has been nothing but:  6:30am - wake up and get dressed. 7:30am - start my day at work 11:30am- work out in the gym 1pm - go to lunch 4pm - leave from work and drive to school 7:30pm - leave from school on my way home for food and tv 10 or 11 - lay down and go to sleep  This weeks blubs in this routine were as follows:  Monday - same Tues. - same Wedn. - no school/found apartment/went swimming/bought new undies Thurs. - 7:30pm drove to Ft.Worth to install PCs at FWD Ballet office - get home at 2am( I am very tired!) Friday - we will see!!!   I know there are a few things I need to do today. I probably won't be going up to school. I hope the guy from Brady, tx(whom purchased the Time Killers arcade) shows up tonight to get his system. Later tonight I will have to move stuff over to nicks for our garage sale in the morning. I need to pick up some signs, also, around 3pm tommorrow I am meeting the guy who bought the Mortal Kombat - I hopefully will have some money this weekend - that will help make the move easier. I sold my bass on ebay. I feel kinda shitty about it - it's just stuff. I can live in a box and be ok physically - maybe not mentally. I don't like needing stuff. :(  Come to the garage sale and buy some of my old stuff.  Do I have anything going on this Sunday - it doesn't look like it. OH! I have to watch my little sister on Saturday night. I need to tell mimi hahahaha.   current mood:  tired current music: Shotmaker - Now and Then    This is where I am moving!  If the circus comes to Rohnert Park, it can send in the clowns, but it will have to keep most of the animals in their cages. In a mostly symbolic gesture, the Rohnert Park City Council passed a law backed by a local animal rights group that prohibits the display of wild and exotic animals such as elephants, lions and tigers for entertainment or amusement. Violators would be fined a thousand dollars and jailed up to six months. Members of Sonoma People for Animal Rights urged the council to pass the law. They claim traveling circus animals are often confined and chained up to 23 hours a day.

      :( I'm really cold. When you sit still for a few hours in a room where the A/C blows 68 all the time, you tend to get a little cooler than normal.  I went to school last night for about 1.5 hours and I was surprised with the amount of stuff I remembered. I am excited, but at the same time, I can see my self getting drained. Yesterday seemed to drag on forever. I worked my ass off, busy as hell at work. Went to class, came home, washed the dishes, collected the dirty clothes and set up three more eBay Actions.  Check out my eBay Auctions  I really don't know what is going on today. Robert is out in L.A. working on moving the Emerson warehouse to a different building. He has to be there to move the network equipment. I was here at 7:30am and was overwhelmed till about 11:30. James went to the doctor, he has only been here for about an hour and a half. I dunno when he will be back, but I am getting pretty hungry. Also, I dunno when I am getting off tonight. I know I won't be home until after 8pm becuase I have school. I will just have to wait and see.   current mood:  cold current music: face to face - over it

      Forget the title, it doesn't mean anything.  Yesterday was mimi's birthday, she turned 21. She went to Ft.Worth and had lunch with my mom and while she was at lunch I prepared her birthday display on the table. Nothing to big, I am watching the pennies, and she knew that. I got her a dozen roses, some chocolate/vanilla fudge, and a charm braclet that she was wanting. I also bought a Royal red velvet cake and she said it was yummy. Oh, and lastly - I got her first "To My Wife" Birthday Card. :)  After all that, we went out to Grapevine Lake with James for some speed boat fun. James had bought a wake board, but no one knew how to ride it, so I had to figure it out. It took me about 5 tried to get up, but I finally figured it out. I have to say it is a lot easier than skiing and tons more fun. I dunno if the skateboarding as a kid helped out at all, but I felt totally more comfortable on the board. I'm not saying I didn't royally bust my ass, I landed on my face a few times. Alot of the time! The fun factor out weighted the pain, so it was cool. MiMi just chilled out in the boat, she seems to just enjoy getting out and doing something - I do too.  When we first got out to the lake and taxi'd out of the 'no wake' area - it started to pour rain.  I just laughed and said "Happy Birthday mimi, you gotta have an interesting memory for your 21st birthday.." The rain lasted at the most 15min - and we were sailing again.  I talked to Ed(owner of EJB Development, Inc) about my move to California - he was super cool about it and said my job was in no way in jepordy over the news. That was some relief. I needed to tell him, just because of long-term plans that were being made at work.  I also talked to the branch manager at TechSkills.com and gave him a background on my situation. He seemed to understand and is going to give me what I want. Another month to finish my CCNA and the books for the CCNP.  Things are looking up YO!   current mood:  pleased

      I got this in my email today | this is about the sample at the begining of track 1  ::Hi there,  United just informed me Friday that they are now listening to every  test  and looking for possible samples. Although this "sample" issue is  still in  litigation, United has chosen to cancel all projects that might not be  in  compliance.  Unfortunately, your's is one of those projects. I am offering a couple  solutions:  1. If you send me a re-done master with the offending material removed,  Aardvark will re-cut and get new stampers to United at no charge.  2. If you wish, we can pull new stampers from your original cut and  send  them to a different pressing plant. Bill Smith Custom Records is one  of  these plants that is not listening to tests, and from what I can tell,  really doesn't care. A new set of stampers would run $40.00 plus  $12.50  shipping/handling. I'll waive the $12.50 shipping/handling to help out  in  this situation. United is keeping all stampers. I don't believe they  have  the legal right to do so, but fighting them would be very problematic,  waste a lot of time, and cost more in legal fees than the simple $40.00  for  replacing the stampers. I talked with Beth at United, and they haven't  made a decision about labels that they have printed. I would think  that  they should release them as there is nothing on the paper labels that  is in  violation of copyright. United is going to charge all work that they  have  done to get the project to the stage where they discovered the  "problem".  There are several pressing plants in this country. At this point,  United  is the only one that I'm aware of that has adopted this policy. I hear  that Rainbo Records in California is now looking at this policy as  well, so  they may be next.  Let me know what direction to take, and we'll work together to get this  solved. ::   Another thing | I just found out that my record bags were delivered on July 10th - I had NO fucking NOTE! I could have taken care of this a week ago. FUCK!

      Over the past couple of nights I have met lots of interesting people and went to strange places. The dream world is so fucked up and intense. I met a track star/turned serial killer last night. It felt so real when she ran by me as super speeds. I could feel the wind push me back; in the background, my friends screaming at me to move out of the way.  She ran from one end of the hall to the other. stopping at the end, just enough to get a look at her - and then she zipped away.  What a weird mess - no one cares about dreams or even really wants to hear it.  Yesterday I went out to Burger's Lake - my mom invited me. Little did I know, it was a CHURCH event. I let me disgust be known with my brother and mom that I was not aware that this was a church fuction. Luckily there was no type of service and I really didn't even talk to anyone from the church.   For the most part, I had fun. The place looked extremly crowded but I was not bothered much by anyone. I did almost get a paddle in the head from one of the 'rowing' life gaurds. I voiced my distasted with his ability to row a boat - he seemed more afraid than most people I mouth off too. That was an ego boost.   I also did a little snotty remark to a large mexican man - he was nice about it. He was yelling out to his kid not to be S'CARD and I mocked him and he politely corrected it by saying SCARED. I was actually surprised he heard me.   Today has been about the same as any work day. I called a few apartment complex's in Santa Rosa, Ca and tried to weasel a Move In Special out of the nice ladies. No dice. Three weeks before we load up the truck and take a very long road trip.   current mood:  silly

      Time flys by when you are having fun. I guess I am having fun - I can't really tell. Since my last post over a week ago, I have been packing my ass off. Looking for jobs in nor cal, and hunting for a new place to call home.  I really have to much to say to even go into detail. I wish I had the desire to type it all out, but when you miss a few days on this - retracing the meaning shit seems like a waste. I will try and keep a better record so I can look back and remember.  California or Bust....   current mood:  amused current music: jealous sound - anxious arms

      Alot as happened in the last 24 hours. MiMi called me last night around this same time to let me know that she got the job at the Nine West outlet store in Petaluma, CA. That means I am moving soon. She starts work there on Aug. 12th - so I will have to take some time off and drive out to nor cal and get her all settled in.   Until I can find a job out there, I am going to have to hang tight back in the DFW. That's fine, I'm in no hurry. I want to get a decent paying job before I tackle the great unknown. Sad to say, I wasn't ready to move anything or anyone out to nor cal this soon. I just wasn't prepared as far as money goes. I was planning on a few more months of savings so I can make it smooth. Well - life doesn't EVER go as planned and damn if I hate that so much.  I had to give my 30 day notice today at the apartment complex. I am not going to be able to pay two rents - one here and in cali. Nick said I could stay at his house until I found another job, so that is cool. I am hoping not to be there for to long. There are TONS of networking positions all over the Bay area - I don't see a big turn down around there.   I am planning on flying out there mid-august to carry out some interviews. This is all happening so fast. I am almost overwhelmed. No big deal - just roll with the punches.  Tonight, I am going to the Houston area to spend some time with my grandparents. We are gonna go down to the beach and hang out - shoot some fireworks and have a good ol' time. hahaha. :)   current mood:  excited current music: karate

      I'm pretty tired this morning - worked late - stayed up late. I couldn't stop thinking about things as I laid in bed. Those little wheels in my head were going everywhere and I don't even remember what was on my mind.  Eric, nick, alex, and vanessa came to my apartment last night around 12 to pick up eric's bass amps that were stored in my garage. That makes a little more room in there. I seriously need to take a fine comb and clean that garage up. It's a fucking mess from hell.   My Projects (unfinished):  - Restore Mortal Kombat arcade system. - Restore 1979 Vespa Rally 200 and purchase engine for Vespa p-200 - Clean garage - Finish numbering and stuffing 7" records (order poly sleeves) - Make 10k Drive buttons before July 14th (order button pieces) - Sale Time Killers arcade system - Buy mimi birthday present (july 17th) - Find a job in California - Quit smoking pot - Drink more water everyday - Lose the extra fat around my belly - ETC...............  Other than the long and drawn out project of planning the rest of my life - those are just some temporary ones. Maybe that was the mess on my mid last night - I dunno.  I just got the bump and that is good. I can't remember many months where it has happened this early. The bad part is, i get it this month on the 2nd - next month it might be the 9th and that is an extra week to wait. I'm looking forward to a change in the way my job goes. I need to get a handle on these fucking taxes - I'm so lost.

      I had a pretty rioted filled weekend. Saturday, I napped all day, it was a mellow day - mimi was off work and we lazed around the apartment.  I went out to nick's apartment around 11:30pm on Saturday night and had some beer drinking fun with those fellas. Lots of fun people were there - we talked and jumped around for a while - watched two movies (falling down and the attic expeditions.) Very good movies, on the second movie, I had finished off more beer than I needed to and stumbled awkwardly around the living room. Good thing I didn't fall into a window.  After the movies, most of the people left. nick, jason, and i stayed out on the porch till close to 5am talking about our ideas about god and christianity and every other deity-centric cult.  The next day, or afternoon, we all went to denny's - had some food and started to move nick's large pieces of belongings to his new house in dallas. We go done with all that around 6:30pm and I was ready to get in the shower. I sweated so much - damn beer.  Got home, cleaned up and went to deliver the 7" comp to the ...Of Death kids and Terms of Grey. I was so tired and hungry, I just stopped by, said hello to a few people i recognized, and took off to get some food with mimi.  After dinner, my wife and I went home and crashed out. What a tired soul I was....   current mood: working current music: pinback

      Yesterday was pretty exciting. I did a phone interview with a Perot Systems recruiter for a Technical Support Analyst job. It sounds like exactly what I am doing now but more Novell. I'm stoked, she passed my resume on to the hiring manager and I am supposed to talk with a team of peers on Monday for a Technical Screen.  The position is located in Napa, CA. Home of wine and beatiful country side. Plus it's not as far as San Francisco. I hope everything goes well with this becuase I could really move around in a company that size. The client that I would be working with is the largest hospital in Napa County. The Queen of the Valley  That will be interesting.   I am hitting the books heavy. I want to do something fun. Metal shows suck these days.

      Last night I had the worst sleep experience in months! THANX - I guess it is still 10x better than sleeping in my car. Car sleep sucks for sure. Once, when I ran away from home I slept in my truck in a parking lot. The police ran a scan on my plates. I know this because mimi's dad happen to hear my name on the police scanner. They let me sleep. The night after that, I slept out in this lot in the country on piece of carpet I had in my bed for the drums to sit on. I just laid there listening to the rednecks rev their engines for fun late into the night. I had some many bugs just hanging out on my hear, male mesquitos i think, because they would buzz in and sit right on my ear. I would swap but they just came right back. I wonder why.  Anyways, today I am beat. I wish I would have stayed at the show - but I think I just might be even more tired. FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCK! How can you sleep at night with that shit!   FUCK AUGUST! I seriously hate this month and everything it stands for - SUMMER!

      I am so glad that this week is over. It's a relief to know that you made it through something difficult. I have worked my ass off all week at school and work, had a little fun when I could and slept as little as possible. It was fun. The plans for the weekend are work even harder at school and rest.   I went to the store to buy mimi a present, I guess it's a "I miss you" present. I got my this awesome T-Shirt that says California on it. It's looks all old and shiz. It's just a shirt, who cares, right? I also went and got a haircut - I look super sexy now. At least I feel cleaner, makes for a nice evening with a bottle of wine and my awesome self.  I think I am going to finally do something with my new domian name. www.low-c.com is now going to be a new line of artist screen printed t-shirts made by hand by John Coffman. What do you think? I like making shirts and I think it would be cool to offer an alternative to mall wear. It will be totally Hosssome. I am going to get alex to help me set up some brand mess and come up with a logo. Look for the first shirts in the winter. I think I am going to try and learn flash and make this my first flash shoot. We'll see. I have to do something productive before I start school, and working on network equipment is not productive.  I love you all, even al and lacey.   current mood: artistic current music: pele

      I am high on doubt these days. I don't think I can take much more of this homeless feeling. I have to stick it out and just deal with these alien feelings but it is just so uncomfortably agonizing to be on the edge of a cliff waiting for the bridge to be built so I can attend to business on the other side.  My eyes are clearly obstucted to the original problem. I am the constructor of this 'bridge' - I am to blame. Dammit. I am looking forward to the weekend. I can hit the books and spend the seed of my resume as far as I can email AND fax.  Yesterday evening I went out to my little sisters birthday party - she seemed to have tons of fun. The drive over there was some were around an hour longer than normal thanx to the speeding idiots and rain. By the way, the two spell disaster.  I was so beat on arrival that I feel straight to sleep the instant I laid on a bed.   >>>>>>>>>>>>BUUUUUUZZZZZZ  I jumped right up and a panic washes over me like I just realized I am terribly late for work - It was just my mom's egg timer. That was a weird feeling.  So I head back to A&E's and surf around a bit and slam a big zzzzSLUMBERger.zzzzzzz Ymmmmmm!   current mood:  energetic current music: jawbreaker - etc. rockin' the B-sides!

      I am having a most difficult time staying awake today. I didn't get very much sleep last night because of fucking heartburn. I woke up at 3,4,5am tossing and turning with pain. It's my fault of course. I had a little more wine than I should have had and a little more spicy mac'n'cheese than I really should have eaten.   At 6am all three of my alarm clocks went off, it was that unrelenting reminder that my day has begun, and like most of the time, I am not quite finished with what I was doing. The instant the TV came on, Betty the cat walks over to me and starts talking to me. It's either "get up" or "turn that shit off." I can't tell exactly which, but she sounds pissed at me.   I really should be working, I have a long list of problems and tasks that I need to attend to today - not including my personal business of going through job listings and faxing/emailing resumes. James went to see the doc so I am stuck here to work on all this shit alone. It's is just a little more than normal.  Last night I went with eric to see: xfilesx - deadfood - think i care - and some other band from lawerence, ks(who tours in a short bus) It was nice to see people I hadn't seen in a while: james delgado, josh brown, and nick and darius. I personally didn't get into any of the music that night, it just wasn't my thing really. I thought it was sort of bland - but I'm just an ass hole.   I didn't go to school last night - I need to get on the ball with that and knock it out. That is probably the best thing I can do right now as far as working towards the new cali job. Tonight is my little sisters birthday, so I am going out to Ft. Worth around 4pm to hang out with them. Maybe I will take a nap.  peace   current mood:  tired current music: me yawning

      So I am all situated in the livingroom of Alex and Eric's apartment. Things are going ok. I am just looking for jobs like mad, trying to get this school mess done with and hopefully find a job in California. I really want to get out there with MiMi. I am starting to miss her terrible. Esp. since I feel like the odd man now. Alex and Eric are all chilling with their ladies and I am alone with a cat and ferret. :) It's cool. It's only for a short amount of time. I am going to go to a show at Nick's house tonight and yell profanity and take a poop in his yard. Should be a mess of fun.  Things are going well, I am really itching to get back to school - hopefully this next spring 2003 I can enroll and start with that mess.

      Well, things have turned out all sorts of ways for me. Right now I am sitting in the airport in SanJose. I just said goodbye to my wife for a few weeks and it was alot harder than I thought. I am fighting off the tears right now. I am probably pouring my heart out into this little internet-station while people look over my shoulder.   Things are lots different now. There have been some great disappointments and some awesome adventures. The landscape is AMAZING. The weather is great, the people are so nice it scares me. I have alot to tell my friends about. Some things make me so happy and upset at the same time. I have not had alot of sleep and I can't seem to keep a natural handle on my emotions. I have seven minutes left on my web access so I am going to check some message boards.

      8:01a - .::MOVE DAY::.  It has finally come. The day I have been staring at for weeks. I hope I am ready to make the trip. The way I feel right now(really tired) is not gonna be any better after I get off work. I'm pretty sure this whole trip will be wrapped in a blanket of fatigue.  I picked up the truck yesterday with my good friend eric. He drove me out there and followed me back to my house. The thing is not nearly as massive as I first thought. It's brand new, 2002 model, and that comforts me. I have almost everything loaded except for my bed, computer, TV, and misc. stuff. I think their should be plenty of room in the truck for Leatha's stuff. I filled it up though. Alot more shit in there than I thought.   Right now I am talking to two condo landlords in Navato and Santa Rosa. The guy in Santa Rosa sounds like a good guy. He is going to call me around 12noon PST and let me know if we are in. It's smaller and lesser of everything, but I am willing to give up things just to have a little security. It's nice to have a place to live, mosdef.  I have soooo much to do today. It's mind-blowing.   current mood:  thirsty current music: jawbreaker - unfun

      On my way to get some food I saw dustin drive down my street. I honked and waved. I never see anyone I know in my neighborhood. I went to Wal-mart to buy a newspaper, some shades, and some 409 to clean up the place. That took longer than it should, what else is new.  I stopped at Subway and got some food - went home and picked up Precious. I took her to get a rabie shot. That was pretty easy, when I was waiting on the paper work - I put her in the back seat and turned on the car so she wouldn't get hot. When I walk back to the car, she is taking a SHIT in my back seat. HOLY FUCKING SHIT.   I drove to a dumpster and scoped it all out, now I gotta go scrub out the soiled spot. EWW!  Poor pupp gets all nervous after shots, she is famous for shitting in the vet's office. I wish that was true in this case.   current mood:  sick

      I don't think any of my friends get up before noon on the weekends... I guess I never stay up late enough to justify sleep that late. I went to the movies last night with John from A Faith Called Chaos. That guy is totally awesome, he reminds me of someone but I can't pin it down. We went and saw signs and it was alright. It was more about the battle with faith and the ideas of fear and hope than the aliens. The aliens were pretty freaky but I think they stole some ideas from spiderman. The poison dispenser and the shoot with the creepy fucker on the barn roof. That shoot and the footage from the brazilian birthday party were pretty creepy.  The theatere was fucking packed, hot, and the side speakers weren't working. I was seriously sweating all over.   Fuck, I have a headache. My mom is coming over today to help me clean up the apartment. That shouldn't take too long. I think I'm gonna go to subway and get some food.   current mood:  complacent current music: the radio sucks

      I feel pretty shit after hearing the news yesterday that we didn't qualify for the apartment we were working towards. I had spent 2weeks with this stupid complex, overnighting several documents - over and over. I'm just really bummed out about it. I have a few applications out with other condo's and rental houses. I really hope this goes well. I feel sick.  I didn't go up to school yesterday or today. I just don't have it in me to think about studying or stupid cisco shit. Right now I need a place for my wife to live. :(  I washed Precious today, she was starting to smell like a big bag of Fritos. haha. And that doesn't make me very hungry. She is all super clean now. I even went to far and got naked and turned on the shower. I could pick her up easy and just hold her under the spray. It was easier to rinse her for sure.  I dunno what is going to happen. I really freaked out yesterday, i had two corona's and that calmed me down. After all the kicking and shouting I was pretty emotionally drained and super fucking slumped so i went to bed at 8:30pm. 12hours later I am up - i don't feel better.   !!!!!! F U C K !!!!!!!   current mood:  drained current music: nothing - my speakers are packed

      After flaking out and not doing anything about it all week, I got back into the gym today. It felt good to get in there and do something productive - I have been eating like shit lately. Junk food, sodas, pizza, you name it. I just get lazy, the lazier I am the more I feel American, and fuck a lot of that! Actually, yesterday I put off eating until about 10pm. I was just to busy with thoughts and stuff to even think about it.  Still no word from the mountain shadows. I am pretty sure we will find out tomorrow. It sucks because, if this falls through I have to hurry to round up a backup plan.  I got a new cell phone in the mail. My home phone is disconnected and this will be my new and only way of contact for a while. It's a super tiny Nokia 8265 but mine is black and it looks all scary.

      Well, my check engine light came on this morning, thought this was a good time to get my oil changed and find out what this problem was. Found out, O2 sensor is reading low voltage, so I have to take it to a shop and get it fixed. If they replaced the 02 sensor it will cost me around $300. Now, where can I find $300 bucks.

      Since things are going SOOOO well , I think I might make an entry.   Let's see...  I feel tired, bored, drained, and super depressed. FUCK!  I was thinking today about the point in evolution where clothes were neccesarry. I wonder if we were ever really hairy, like the ape-men we see in books. Most remains of the australopithecus africanus and homo habilis are fragments of skull, teeth, and other small bones. I am very curious as to how they make the connections from skulls.  They do resembly apes, but they walk upright. homo habilis and the others were just walking apes, hence the hair. I have been looking at people differently.  I'm sitting in traffic and all I see is a bunch of smart-apes driving machines. Fuck, that is weird.

      Yesterday was my first official day, before I went to work. I found some jobs to send resumes to. Today, I am doing the same.  This job is seriously boring as hell. I tried to sale to three different people and didn't close it.  I really want to quit, at the same time, I don't want to give up.  Yesterday was my birthday and I was so happy when I got home. Mimi bought me the new Jets to Brazil CD and it is just great. She bought herself the new Tori Amos and happened to pick up a limited edition copy. The packaging on this is very very cool. It came in a box with a little charm, a map, a DVD, a little accordian like paper with poloroid pics of Tori, and the CD and a little book of art stickers. Very cool.  We went to Adel's for dinner, it's like a super old Denny's style cafe. It was fun and good and the people were super nice. I slept like a rock...i was so tired from standing around doing nothing all day.   current mood:  weird current music: jets to brazil - perfecting lonliness

      I got the job at Zale's. Blah, it is really gonna suck. It totally reminds me of the times I worked at Whataburger. You have to count shit, push people to buy crap.  I really hope I can land that sweet job in some IT department. I don't think I can deal with the general population for very long.  I felt super depressed last night. I felt super fucking shitty when I saw that I have to work 12:30-8:30 for like the next four days and I came to the realization that this is bad. I know I have a few friends that are worse off, but I just can't seem to just be OK with it. Not very many people stroll in so it's like just fucking around when you are bored. I need the internet or something.  I have to go study diamonds, so I know what the fuck i am talking about.

I pretty much wasted the day, but I had some good conversation.  I watched a bit of SNL with mimi, made some vegi-frito pie and now I am here.

      Last night I watched a bit of the World series before heading out to the Karate show at the 'Bottom of the Hill.'  This was a very rad venue, I had an excellent time. I was going to review the first two bands but instead I will just say - the first band sucked enough to make me laugh and the second band sounded like incubus.  Karate rocked my socks off. Mimi was feeling a little sick so we left before the end, I will have to see them again for sure. Oh, I just love listening to some good quality music with talent.  Seems that more and more bands come around sounding trashing and fast or catchy and they miss the main point of good music = TALENT!  So on my way home, I had a little trouble finding my way out of frisco, no big deal. I'm new at this. So we make it over the golden gate bridge and we are driving through the hills just north of the bridge when I have a fucking accident...  Four cars including mine are heading up over this hill around 65mph. two of them are about three cars ahead of me and one is behind me on my left side. As we come up the hill, I see two deer in the middle of the road: one buck and one doe. So i begin to stop, the car on the right spooks them to the left and the car on the left spooks them right back in my way. Well, the doe makes it out of the way, but I fucking slam right into the buck with the front left corner of my car. His head slams onto my hood leaving a nice antler dent. The rest of his body wraps around the front left fender and leaves a nice fucking dent in my door and worse on the fender. Also, my fucking headlight is cracked deep. I pulled off the road to take a look at the car, the deer were quickly out of sight and back up in the hills. FUCK! my door doesn't open all the way now, I am gonna try and do some body work.  My luck just keeps getting better.   current mood:  blah current music: get up kids

      My interview with Zales went well. I think I pretty much have the job, I have to come back for a second interview on Monday. I also have an interview with a staffing agency on Monday morning.   I feel pretty up and down today.  I am going to see Karate tonight and hopefully pick up the new Jets to Brazil CD. I downloaded a couple of mp3's from Jadetree and it's HOTTT.  Tomorrow mimi is off so we are going to the Russian River to watch the salmon swim up stream. That should be nice. I guess I will continue to search for a job where I can find my place again. Fuck, I can't wait to start school.   current mood: up and down current music: death cab for cutie

      My apartment is still very disheveled but I will deal with it. There has been a lot going on lately so I sure myself can understand.  On Friday morning, I woke up and fixed breakfast while mimi gathered some clothes to be washed at her dad's house in lodi. We had to return the Welsh Corgi that was found to the rightful owners later that afternoon. We leave sometime around 11 or 12 and make our way across the Napa Valley and over the Sacramento River delta arriving a couple of hours later. Most of that afternoon we goof 'd around. Mimi and I threw a Frisbee and played with the chickens and other animals. I found a nest full of eggs and road around on a little razor scooter. Darrell(mimi's dad) was waiting on a dish TV guy to come and install their new dish system so we all drove up the road to check out a salmon farm but ended up just tooling around the neighborhood for about 15 minutes and driving back. During that time, the lady came to pick up her dog and she left us 4 - $10 gift cards to chili's. Not bad. Darrell had mention that he wanted to get a large hole in his yard filled so I offered to help. As soon as we arrived back at his house, the dish guy pulls up and I run to grab a shovel. I have been feeling so unproductive this past week that I was really itching to get some work done. I fill up the hole with a little help from mimi in about 15 minutes and got a nice blister on my hand and a sore-as-hell back in the morning. It felt fucking good to use some muscle for a change. It felt good to accomplish something. I think I like yard work. We decided to stay the night so I had a few beers and washed some clothes. Jeremy went over to a friends house so that was the last I saw of him during the weekend. The next day I was up around 9am, I found some cereal in the closet and got the day started with a little sugar and corn. I sat around waiting for Darrell to get his ass out of bed so we could start digging this trench for his new telephone line.  We all had plans to go to this Portuguese Bull Fight that day, and I knew it started at 3pm. I dicked around some more outside, enjoying the semi-country sounds and watching tons of black birds devour a field of grapes that can't be sold. Finally Darrell is up, and he is sitting in the living room talking to mimi and having some coffee. He had told mimi that he was going to put off the trench till Sunday but because I was on his ass about it, he would start it today. GOOD! So after fucking around for nearly an hour, he finally gets outside and we start on the trench. We had an hour before we were to leave so we got a little bit done. I felt very disappointed that the morning had wasted away. Seize the day! The bullfights were amazing. I was a little horrified with the treatment of the animals but the amount of real fucking culture and people and sounds was like a dream.  The music was so amazing, these were real people living their lives like generations before them. I felt like I was in Portugal, the matadors were a sight! Their outfits and manners were so arrogant and proud. I was enamored by the whole event.  After that we went to a small restaurant and eat some REALLY good food. I didn't have to pay for anything, doing a little work for people is always a nice trade. We left that night and made it home just in time to watch some SNL and fall asleep. That night we both slept so well that neither of us woke up till around 11 and that doesn't happen often. Mimi had to run some weekly recap at her store, so I went with here and chatted with my dad on the phone while she worked. I learned that a good friend of my mom's had died the night before and just a few days before that, her uncle died. It's weird how these things come in multiples.  So any ways, we head over to chili's after that to cash in our gift cards for some bean burgers and boy were they good! The chili's was right next to a Home Depot so we ran in and tried to find an air filter for the A/C unit at the condo, no luck, mimi was unsure on the size. I did apply for a job there, it was all on a computer and it took me about 45 minutes to complete. The questions where awful.  When we went home, we crashed out for about 30 minutes and then both agreed to 'groom' our puppy. That took a few hours but we trimmed all of her hair, her nails, and bathed her and treated her for fleas. We found a few while trimming her. She hated us. ha ha. Now she looks and smells a lot better.  Today, I spent most of the day filling out applications. I applied at Zales, Ultra jewelry outlet, VanHuesen, CompUSA, Peir1imports, and Boarders book store. I have interviews already set up with the first three. So it looks like John is going into retail for the time being. I will do whatever it takes, I am sure as hell not scared of lowering my standards. I am still looking for a tech job but it's pretty thin.  peace out.   current mood: accomplished current music: promise ring

      Day 5: I have spent a weekend and a few days in california so far and everything is going just fine. Still no job bites but they will come, so I am not to worried about it at the moment. I finally got my DSL connection up and running so I am stoked about that. Should make the job hunt a little quicker. I was getting kicked off every 10 minutes or so from this dial-up shit.  I have three computers I need to fix up for mimi's dad by friday. We are going back out to lodi to wash some clothes and return our new puppy back to the real owners. Our lost little welsh corgie ran away from home, mimi's dad found her and mimi brought her here. Now the 'real' owners put an ad in the paper looking for their lost dog. Her name is Minnie Mouse and she belongs to a little 4 year old girl. awwwwwwww. I will miss the sweet pup.   I need to keep this up to date.   current mood: busy current music: mazzy star

      Goodbye Texas, I will miss you. I will miss those big orange sunsets, the rainy weeks, and beautiful fall weather. I will cherish all the mud and dirt I caked myself in as a kid.  I feel totally devoted to my home state, the wonderous lands and animals and people. I have had some of the best times here, times I will never forget.  This is such a big move for me, I am very excited to see another plan close to completion. Some things are not so easily planned. Often times, trouble steps in the way, but so far I've made it through just fine. It's is my last day at work, I have worked at EJB for over 4 years and it's so weird to think that I have been spending Mon. - Fri. at the same place for FOUR years. I will miss all the guys here, they are all great in some way or another. Most of all, I will miss my friends. Each and everyone of them in a special way. I have a feeling some tears will surface today, it will be tough to keep my emotions under wraps.  I am going to try and get off around 4pm and tie up a few things before heading over to Nick's House. After that, we will load up his stuff and head out into the sunset, like an old western movie.  It's going to be a long trip, I'm already super tired. I need to pick up some vivrin and redbull or something. It's gonna be a late one. I'll miss my friends.  My heart aches, but the ties are not severed and the contact will continue.  Wish me luck, I will need it...

      Yesterday, I had to keep telling myself - "Just two more days and then you are off. You can make it through." I met a pretty cool guy yesterday, he came in the store looking for diamonds for his new bride. He was wearing a Hot Water Music shirt so I started talking to him about all kinds of stuff. Maybe I will run into him again. His name was John and he was mosdef on the level. I should have invited him out for a beer, unless he was EDGE.  I started complaining about the lack of inspiration and intelligent conversation. Grant it, I talk with mimi all the time about stuff and that is perfectly satisfying for the most part, but I could use some connections. Obviously the people I work with now cannot put me in contact with anyone hiring IT pros.  We are getting a new manager at Zales, his name is Dwight and he is a fucking dork ass mofo. He is moving from Las Vegas to manage the store and he is a dork ass mofo. Oh, I said that already. Slicked back blonde hair that is going bald in the back, a molestache, glasses, and he was wearing a TAN blazer with his grey pants. I dunno, that just seems odd. He looked like a fucking used car salesman.   Well, tomorrow I am heading to Lodi, taking some laundry with me and heading up into the mountains for some fun. I wonder if mimi's mom is going to go? That would be interesting. Her flight arrives tomorrow.   current mood:  melancholy current music: pedro the lion

      Work was uneventful. I bought this awesome "dice" style game last night called Pass the Pig. I remeber playing it when i was a kid so I went hunting for it and found it at Target. hahaha. fun. Bought some beer too, and a alot of warm conversations with mimi and the TV played the mexican history in the background. It's nice to be married to someone you actually love. I feel bad for those people that get married for all the wrong reasons. Good luck to them.   :)   current mood: dorky current music: the radio and random mp3s

      I spent of the day cleaning up the apartment and watching television. I sent my resume to a few places, but I really just laid around. I never left ventured past the doorway, not even to get the mail.   I am lacking inspiration these days. I fail to self-start any project or any form of productive activity. I havn't picked up a book in a month, I havn't painted or doodled in about the same time. work-eat-workout-watch movies.  I did see Don't say a Word and Reservior Dogs tuesday night. Those were fun and late. I forgot to take them back last night. I think I am gonna go send my grandma a postcard.   current mood:  bored current music: samiam

      Monday night was interesting, we had a bit of a medical emergency. I came home from work around 9 after picking up a movie at CD warehouse. I cooked food while mimi watched some TV and after I was done cooking we started the movie. Not to long into the movie Precious started having a seizure. She has had these seizures before but never this bad. It wasn't letting up. She was on the floor flopping around, her body stiff as a rock and she was getting tired from it, I could see that. MiMi was crying and I was confused. We had no money and I could not make a decisive decision. I finally said, "Let's just take her to the vet hospital and deal with whatever."  So we took her over to the local 24 hour vet and they gave her a shoot of valium and kept her over night. The doc told us that she has epilepsy and that she will have to be on meds for the rest of her life. poor puppy.  She is fine now, just a little sleepy. The drug she has to take is a barbiturate, and it is the same medication used on humans for epilepsy.   As far as everything else, I am off for the next couple of days so I am stoked. A chance to look for jobs. mimi gets home around 1:30 so we are gonna hit the gym a little while and head back home to clean up the apartment a bit. I am looking forward to Thanksgiving because I am heading out to BigTrees, CA and play in the snow and eat some food with mimi's dad and their family.   I think I have finally decided what major I am gonna go for when I start school. I still have 10 months to figure this out. I am gonna get a BS in Biology with a concentration on Ecology and Evolution and minor in Anthropology. When that is done I can hit grad school either towards Biology or Anthropology. UC Davis has an awesome Bio-tech school so I might go for a masters there. But Berkeley is my main focus, gotta keep those grades up. That is all I am her to do, go to school. I don't need to make new friends, they just end up needing time to figure out. I think I have friends right now that will last a life time, and they are in texas or somewhere else but here. I love my friends, I just want to keep it that way. I like how it feels now, I don't have that nagging obligation to go see a "local band" and all that bullshit. Fuck your scene shit, it's a hopeless cause, and a worthless one at that. I'm a rambling man.

      Well, I am hitting the gym regularly now. 5 days a week so far. Everyday at Zales sucks and there are no jobs to be found, that I can find.   I am planning a ski trip for January in the tahoe area. Actually Bear Valley. http://www.bearvalley.com so if you wanna do it, let me know and I can hook you up with all the info.  MiMi and I went up to Jenner last wednesday and found this tiny forest road called Fort Ross Rd. We were on the curvy road for about an hour, the only ones on the road. It was so fucking awesome. I had a good time just looking at all the valleys and tiny little towns. The smell of fireplaces and the scent of pine and redwood is so "life-giving." Makes me totally feel alive.  Now I have to get ready to go sale some Fucking RINGS AND BULLSHIT!   current mood:  lonely current music: the beatles

      Today, I am off work again. Crazy huh! I went to the mall with mimi and we went looking for an insense kiosk, no dice. We ended up goofing around for a little while, looking at random stuff. This is very good, becuase I try to pick up on ideas for christmas. Mimi bought a little western-style shirt at Old Navy. I think it is totally cute and I bought some Steve Madden style shoes at Payless for like 19 bucks and they are all man-made materials. I love em.   It's just a rainy day. I read a letter from a hurting friend. I joined a gym and that is rad!

      "You say there is a finish line, but you are already beat."  Today is my first day off in seven days. I have been looking forward to today for a while it seems. I almost walked out on Thursday, I started crying and was so utterly depressed that I couldn't even hold on to myself.  I just felt so out of place at zales. Michelle, the 'fill-in' manager talked me into giving it some more time. I have to say, she was right. I can totally do this.  I've already sold a few high priced items and I feel totally comfortable talking to random people. I just had to get in that groove i guess.   We were supposed to go up to Fort Bragg and hang out in the redwoods but one of Mimi's workers didn't come in and so she had to go into work for her. Damn that cunt. Poor mimi cried as she laid her head on my chest in the kitchen. I just held her. I started to cry, this has been a change for sure. It's one of those good/bad situations. I know we will find 'normal' in there somewhere.  Oh, I wish I would have taken the time to tell some stories of the week. I have a few for sure.   current mood:  uncomfortable current music: sunny day real estate

I think I am coming down with a bit of a cold. I really hope I can shake it. I would like to do some drinkin tonight. Ring in the celebration of time. We throw everything into days, weeks, months and make up some day where it starts all over. An excuse to get wasted. There is no harvest, no renewing or dieing really. Just a bunch of made up shit!

      So I am off today! I have a face to face interview next Tuesday for a Help Desk job at Legacy Marketing Group. I am almost finished with Smile, You are Traveling by Henry Rollins and I started reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. Both enjoyable so far. Palmer actually gave me Siddhartha to read a while back. I just opened it up the other day and I have grabbed it every chance I can. In about an hour, I am going to run up to Evolution Tattoo and get some new shiz done. I was listening to some super sad fariuz earlier. I can just feel the pain in her voice.  There is still much to learn. We are not going in circle, we are going upwards. The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps. I found my paints and finished a painting last night. I like it alot. I can't think about these types of things to much. I think it clouds my head; just grab a beer and dive.   Oh, I can't leave this out! Zales sucks. I keep thinking that I will not get out until I find peace at Zales. Dammit mom, thanx for that idea. I can find peace, I can find peace......  Wish me luck!   current mood:  touched

      Christmas '02 I am 23 now, and I can't think of anything I want more than just to relax. No big meal, no family. Just mimi, jeremy, leatha and her friend hanging out. We went to lodi to pick up jeremy christmas eve and we opened presents there. I landed a propane stove and light, beard trimmer, a longsleeve shirt with monkeys, and a tree ordament. We came back to the casa is sr and opened more presents with mimi's mom. There I landed a case of Beers around the world. It had twelve different kinds of beers from around the uh world. Very rad. I also got a little red toy vespa, some food stuff for the kitchen, and a beautiful card from mimi that made me cry. I seriously was not in the spirit of getting. I was really enjoying watching everyone unwraping their gifts. I thought that was neat. So anyways, I spent all christmas day working on jeremy's computer. I got it loaded up good now. After that we drove by the santa rosa, healdsburg, and petaluma skateparks to check them over. Very rad. After that I help jeremy with a website and we listened to load music late into the night.  Now I have to go to work and do nothing becuase I doubt anyone is gonna be shopping after christmas while it's raining. I did get a call from Legacy Marketing Group and they want to do a face to face interview! Horrrraaayyy!!!

      The last few days have been full of wonderful sites, sounds, and beautiful scents.  I was off on wednesday and thursday. MiMi and I cleaned up the apartment a bit on wednesday and went for a drive to look for apartments. We ended up somewhere near the coast in a small town called Dillan Beach. Lots of surfing there. Two weeks ago a guy was attacked by a great white while surfing at that beach.  From there we made our way down PCH along the Tomales Bay. We passed through this tiny town, Marshall. It must have been a fishing community becuase we passed by a few fishing type fellows. They had their warm sweater caps and dirty rubber overalls. Probably milling over ex-wives as they threw a few Bud Lights back around the bed of a ford ranger.  When we reached the end of the bay we made our way up the otherside, our destination being Point Reyes National Seashore. Sir Francis Drake Bay was in the park as well as some 20 ft. waves crashing down on the south side of the shore. I was mystified by the shear power of these waves. The air was full of saltly mist. Things were washed up on the beach that resembled some sort of snake/bull whip/plant life. It had roots and felt like a sponge. Funny.  We had an awesome, and quick drive back to 101. We took the Petaluma-Point Reyes Blvd. and found some beautiful hills lit with green grass as bright as neon. I forget what we did after that. I believe we rented the Fellowship of the Rings extended version and watched that.  Thursday, mimi and I went through some of our pictures and found them homes in empty photo albums. Finally. Cleaned the casa more. Mimi went to work at 4:30 - I went christmas shopping and was surprised by the snow on all the hills the hug the highway. just 10 minutes up the road, the hills were covered in snow. It was very cold that day. I was filled with energy, just wished there weren't so many damn people some times. Always rushing around.  I am really itching for a motorcycle. I want something to ride, and soon. But with this rain, I really don't have the chance too. Summer is a love/hate kinda thing, mostly hate.  Right now, mimi is at the tori amos concert. I am drooling over Henry Rollins on Jan. 8th. He will be in Dallas in Feb so check that out. I skipped out on the show since leatha was wanting to go, fine with me.   current mood: artistic current music: John Coltrane - I'm Old Fashioned

      My mind is still a difficult hurdle to clear. The race will never be finished, my life will always be 100mph and there will always be spills along the way. When I come to terms with this, things will start to clear.  I still have not made it to the gym. My lazy bones have been collecting dust in the bed or infront of the television. Cry me a river, so I can float away. Work is still something I dread. I don't want to help anyone, I hate jewelry and I am doing all I can to find a way out.  I don't mind my coworkers as much anymore. I yelled my fucking mouth off at Matt last night becuase of the way he handled a customer. FUCK! I just realized that I don't care about the customer. Buy or get out, see if I fucking care. This experiment is going all wrong.  Tonight we are having an unofficial zales christmas party. It's unofficial so we don't have to invite sherry, amanda, and atty. Supposly no one likes them much. Sherry and Atty are both over 40, Sherry being around 60 and Amanda is on the brain dead side of humanity. So I guess it will be all the young, hip people. I am part of the cool crowd. Fucking kill me now. I guess I am just too much fun to miss out on. So anyways, mimi and I are going over to Heathers house to play scatagories and drink some booze. Should be fun. This new girl, shelby, is bringing her boyfriend Jason. I met Jason about two days ago and the guy is fucking rad. We talked awhile and he runs a tattoo shop in Petaluma, plays bass, guitar, and some recording, surfs/snowboards/skate, vegetarian, and listens to \m/SLAYER\m/ and other such great metal and hardcore like reversal of man, orchid, and DEP. He also is going to hook me up with a red atom on my left arm and touch up my shitty blue atom on my right arm all for 100 bucks. I am stoked. So hopefully we can talk some more tonight and maybe he will teach me how to surf and I can be all: DUDE! like I totally road this wave to the sky! DUDE! WOAH! RAD!  Eitherway, I am getting smashed. I hope I don't spill anything.   current mood: stoked current music: Sunny Day Real Estate - LP2 - 07 - Iscarabaid

      Well, the last few days have been productive. I spent my work day drinking and playing age of empires. Mimi's mom was in town over the weekend but she left on Tuesday. They got caught up in some fog on Monday night driving across the delta. From what I hear from mimi, her mom freaked and I am just glad I wasn't in the car. I'm sure I would have been pissed.  Went to the DMV yesterday and failed my motorcycle test, the written part. I went with mimi today and passed it. She got her license as well. So we are really in california.  After that we went to walmart and target to try and get a roll of film developed. We also ordered some holiday cards with out picture on them.   We went and eat at The Cantina in Downtown Santa Rosa after driving around for 15 minutes trying to find a place to park. I started the day off busy. We parked at a meter, luck me, it had an hour on it. I maxxed it at 2 hours and put the rest of my change in the fellow next to me.  After eating, we headed back to the car, and a college guy stopped us and offered me $1 for my leftovers. I hooked him up for sure with a fish taco and lots of veggies. That made me feel good, he was stoked. It would have been hard to justify me denying him food. I had just eaten, I didn't need to leftovers, plus its good karma.  We looked at some apartments in petaluma, and OH. my interview this morning went really well. I am just waiting on a call from them early next weeks to see if they wanna do a face to face interview. I hope that works out, becuase I think I can be a very volitaile part of their crew. I am about to go to bed, just got to finish my booze and crash out. I do more drinking these days then working out. Not good, I've lost weight, but you can't tell, i think i have lost muscle mass.   current mood: accomplished current music: white stripes - Fell in Love With a Girl

      I came into all of this knowing that it was going to be hard. I have to start looking for an apartment this month. We need to find a place by the end of the month so we can be moved by the first of Febuary. I am weighing the idea of staying at this place until things are a little better, but, who knows, it might be like this for a while. They still have our $2000 deposit. that would play for a nice apartment's deposit and 1st months rent. I have to go to the DMV next tuesday and take the test to get my license and register mimi's car in california. I will do mine at a later time.  YEA! I just got a call and I have a phone interview on Wednesday with Legacy marketing group!!!! I'm stoked.   current mood: accomplished current music: the vss - evolution

      I have alot on my list to get done today. I have to finish the laundry, wash my dog with flea killer, powder the carpet with flea killer just in case, plant some flowers I bought, and clean the bathroom. Oh yeah, wash the dishes and go get my library card. I have to go get more quarters here in a bit so I might get the libary thing knocked out then. I also bought a board so maybe when I am done with all that I can paint.  Mimi and I got half way up the mountain and had to turn back because it was getting dark. We started the hike later then planned but we still wanted to hike as far as we could. We got about 2.5 miles and turned back. It was still an awesome view but we will have to go back for sure. Maybe next time we will take our bikes up the fire road. We were the only ones out there until we saw this random lady walking down the mountain. She was dirt as fuck and had nothing on her. I would have to have some water for this mountain, at least. Maybe she lived in the park. :)  Well, I am off to tackle the "day off" list!  ttyl!!   current mood: busy current music: Danzig - She Rides

      Obviously there is nothing wrong with a few violent words now and again. I felt good today. I was top salesman for the day, I help people actually make worthwhile purchases and I helped one over-weight, over-indulgenent bitch. She made a statement something like You must love jewelry as much as I do since you work here.  Fuck you cunt! Jewelry is right there next to picking up dog shit on my list of things that make me vomit. I am looking forward to some meditation on the top of all this bull mess.  I have to say, I am really enjoying helping people that can't speak english very well. I am serious. Fuck all these rich-ass white people, give me some good-hearted hispanics and I will spend hours showing them jewelry. I helped this couple a few weeks ago. Carlos and Virginia. They were super nice, I was never pushy at all so today they come back and I show them wedding bands for about an hour. I was stoked to help them out. I can surprisingly understand most of what they say in spanish. That made me feel good about myself. Kiss my ass if you think I am racist. I love everyone, esp hispanics. All of my best friends have been hispanic except for jake and josh.  Integirty is something to behold and Spanish is a bad ass language!

      I hate being nice to people, dealing with swine on a regular basis is eating away at my nerves. I get these urges to take their snappy attitudes by the hair and slam them into the glass cases. Maybe I will light up some fucking 80's metal as loud as it will go and start hi-kicking random people in the gut. Tomorrow I am off and I am gonna try and make it out to Mount St. Helena and hike to the top. Being outside away from people is my only solice these days. Once I reach the top I will let out a nice tribute scream to 80's metal! Listen closely...Dee Snider! This guy I work with, Matt, has invited me to his house about 4 times now and offered to go on hikes with me several times. I feel bad, because the guy is alright but he is still a fucking insecure tool obviously looking for a friend. Poor guy hates his wife and they have been married for just a month more than mimi and I. Where Not Gonna Take IT! I can't seem to find my way out of this pit of depression. I guess it is only a pitty party, so fuck it. What do I need to do? Then Fucking get it done!! It's that simple. Since my dog went to the hospital, I havn't been to the gym. I will get some excercise tomorrow on the mountain. I will take some pictures - I hope it is not hazy tomorrow becuase I want the full on view from the highest point in the Bay Area. I really had fun with mimi last night. We played abalone and I am totally hooked. She kicked my ass 2 out of 3 times, but it was still fun.   current mood:  pessimistic current music: Iron Madien - The Trooper

      Well, thanksgiving was great. mimi and I went up to big trees state park and hiked around for a few hours. found an awesome river. I will post pictures. I already developed the pics but left them in lodi. After that I saw jeremy's band practice. very fucking good. I was totally impressed by the sheer fucking change. I'm a fan for sure.  The day after mimi, darrel, and I went to look at 10.5 acres of land we were thinking of buying. That was fun, the land was super rad.  Thanksgiving 'shopping' weekend has not been to bad. I thought it was going to be a bit overwhelming. not at all.  I got a new game. Abalone, very fun. I just need to get GO and I will board game happy. A hiking I will go Tuesday. Somewhere, maybe Mount St. Helena.   Vodka vanilla coke rules my drunk ass.   current mood:  drunk current music: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore

      So the move begins. Today we did all the lease signing and that was weird. I signed alot of papers. It's weird how writing your name in cursive is some how legally binding. ha. Who thought that clever shit up.  Work was blah. No real sales. Did alot of packing today and I am tired. The wine is nice, mimi is ill. She got sick from me and is sleeping now.  8)  I will be on dial-up shortly. Goodbye fast internet. I will see you again soon!

      It has been a week since I've posted. Sad to say, but I've been a bit down on my luck. I will try to be positive. GO HAPPY!  Last friday, like I said in my last entry, I was going to my HR interview with Legacy Marketing Group at 10am. I get there a bit early and Jennifer takes me to an interview room and the interview was pretty much just a list of questions. She wrote my answers down and it was painless and smooth. Almost all the Questions were "Describe a specific time when..." She told me at the end of the interview that there were a few other jobs available and if I was interested in those, she would like to consider me for those posistions as well. Both jobs are entry level help desk and the other entry level batch operator. I said I was interested because I really don't have the liberty of picking and choosing what job I would like at this point.  They said they would like to combine both part time positions for me and I would be working from 1 - 10 M-F. That schedule will be perfect when I start back to school. Anyways, she walked me out and said they would be making a decision for a team interview in the next week and a half.  After that, I go out to mimi's work, tell her the news and change clothes. We get everything ready and head to lodi. We pulled into lodi a little after 3pm and just sat around for a while. I was tired, the night before I was so nervous about the interview, I had a hard time getting comfortable. So I crashed in the chair for a little while. Jeremy and his bandmates showed up and started practicing for their show later that night. Around 6-7 they loaded up and we followed them out to Sacto to West Coast Worldwide for their first show. The place was pretty cool. They had a short set that was decent for a first show or a 101st show. I was stoked. After the set, they took all their equipment out to their vehicles and Jeremy and I took the guitars to his friend Nick's truck. Nick didn't have a lock on his camper so we threw em in my back seat for the time being. We were only gonna be a few minutes to talk to some folks and grab Bryan to get some food. When we got back to my car, my right back door window was busted out and all three guitars were gone. I felt so helpless, it sucked, it still sucks. My gut was twisted when I saw what had been done.  $1500 worth of guitars paid for some fucking crackhead tweekers habbit and we were the victims. After a few calls to the police, we got no help from them. They would not come and make a report for such a thing. I have yet to make the police report. I am still waiting on all the info from the guys as fars as how to describe the guitars.  So anyways, I was physically sick, with like bronchitus or something. It was mild at the time, and I thought I was beating it down but after hanging out in the cold for a while and driving 30 minutes with a window gone going 80 miles an hour, I think it started beating me. I was sick as fuck for the rest of the weekend. I rested most of sunday. Mimi and I went driving around.  Most of this week I have been dreaming about getting a motorcycle and trying to pack up for our move next week. I went to a few cycle dealerships and sat on a few cruisers. I'm stoked. I started working on my credit to get some of the false shit off. Hopefully in a few months that will all be cleared up and I can go get a fat bike to cruise on.  I got a call from Jennifer at Legacy Marketing Group a few days ago and she said that they were going to hire an internal employee for the Help Desk posistion but she would like to set up a Team interview for the Batch Operator position. It will be a few dollars less an hour, but a fuck load better than Zales and I am down! Maybe it is meant to be, with school and all coming up.  I hope so. I am royally stoked about all of it. I just need a new window in my car. The duct tape and cardboard is holding up nicly, though. I need to paint a Skull on it for fun!  Sorry about all the errors, Proofreading is for smart people!   current mood:  shocked current music: you and i

      What's going on: Well at the end of the month I move to Rohnert Park. It's official. The rent is a about 70 bucks more and 10x nicer. I think so anyways. The rooms are a little smaller, but I think I will have a better peace of mind for sure. What else: Tomorrow is my second interview with Legacy Marketing Group. Wish me luck on all that. I am going to Lodi later that afternoon. Stopping at Ikea for a computer desk, or at least to look at them. They have alot of rad furniture for cheap. Since I sold everything I owned before moving out here, I have to gather a few things. They canned two guys at work this week. They two guys that have been there the longest and the two guys I get along with most. Brenden and Steve got the ax becuase they had to cut hours. I've had to work with Matt a few nights this week. They day always starts out okay and by the end, I've heard his mouth run for hours that I just want to get out! Death may it be, anything to save me! I try to sit and read but I get interupted. I try to show as little interest as possible. I believe that it's just to hear his voice. Ugh. Friday night, I'm going to see Horror City Superstition. Jeremy, mimi's brother, plays guitar and I think they are very rad. Download their new song. Anyways, I need to clean up a bit. I need to start packing but that is never any fun. I'm halfway packed becuase I havn't unpacked alot of stuff.   current mood:  indifferent current music: nick cave and the bad seeds - o'malley's bar

      I sailed a schooner around the horn of mexico. I found my polaroid, I have pictures from my trip.   Last night, I got off work and went over to Brenden's apartment. The entire day proved one thing. People are lame. Over here, you have the guy who trys to hard. Over there, here comes some super fat couple to bitch and yammer to me about shit I don't care about. I've found my self physically cringing at the sounding kick off of another useless anecdote.  What the fuck is wrong with me? This retail shit has really made me see through some people for who they really are. I used to be nicer, at least I thought so. Fuck being nice, it's a waste of time. Just cut the fuckers off fast and kill the pain before it begins.  Hyper people, calm the fuck down! There is no reason to run back and forth like a caged dog. You'll find yourself a weak, decrepit old bag of dust. This shit pisses me off.  Don't get me wrong from my journal entries. I'm not always pissed. Just most of the time. I brought over Happiness to watch at Brenden's house. They had already started XXX. Good old Vin Disel skating around on his enormous, testosterone fuel cock rocket. Saving people with one fail swoop of his manhood...what a load of hollywood manure.  I think I might go to Lodi today, but I'm not sure when jeremy is supposed to get back from the mountains. sigh....   current mood:  discontent current music: Willie Nelson - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

      I fucking walk into a Target to drop off some film and right off the bat some bum is outside trying to push a newspaper on everyone that walks by. Inside, the photo guy is no where to be found and then he looks surprised when I give him a "Go to Hell" look when he arrives. WTF are you doing!! I go outside and some fucking cart pusher asks me if I have a cigarette to spare. I don't fucking smoke.  Give it a rest people!   I had all the interaction i can take for one day.

      Nocturnal artisans do not know fatigue. I have spent the last hour or so in a fury of writing and paint. Becoming happy with creations of any inspirational type are hard to manage; for myself.  I took off to work a bit early today to find a used book store in downtown petaluma. I presumed that I was to be at work around 12:30 so I found a parking spot around 11 and took a nice brisk stroll down the sidewalk.  The air was invigorating and I was fresh and crisp like a conspicuously clean dollar bill. My white shirt was bright and starched and I had the top button lossened. I hadn't yet thrown on the tie, so I was feeling a bit free and fairly handsome. I stopped first at the petaluma goodwill to see if that happened to have an overhead projector. I also stolled down to the basement to see what they had in the way of an office desk. From there, I strolled over to Red Devil records where I have yet to make a purchase. They have some rad Jazz, indie, and punk vinyl. I asked the gent to point me towards the used book store and it happened to be a few doors down, three to be exact. The store was rad. Open, indepentantly operated and clean. I got the following: The Metamorphasis and The Trial by Franz Kafka as well as Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk. I have today off so after a bit of sleep I have some reading to do.  By the way! Cheers to you my friend!!! Drink one for me!

      10:33a - .::BE STILL AND WONDER::.  the last two days off have been busy for the most part. On Tuesday, I went to my Pre-employment acessment and that sumed up to be 3 1/2 hours of tests. Still waiting to hear back as far as a real interview goes.  Yesterday, I started a new painting, played Vice City most of the day and went to see Henry Rollins spoken word that evening.  I enjoyed that event. If nothing else, I was turned on to a few writers; Franz Kafka and Ryszard Kapuscinski. I am going to the used book store before work to gather up some stuff. I am so behind on good reading. I love books, and I enjoy reading immensely.  I am also on the hunt for an overhead projector. I looked a bit on ebay and the shipping is high. Maybe a thrift store will have one for me to purchase.  I've been feeling a little on the humdrum side the last couple of days. Maybe it's my exhausted excuse for not being very motivated to do everything I've been wanting to complete. I am relocating to Rohnert Park at the end of the month and I am not looking forward to the cost and labor involved. Speaking of labor, I hit the gym a few times this week. That always barrages the spirit and body. I owe the gym money, so that adds an impediment to my motivation.  So now I will try to obviate my discourse by rocking to some Stryper. That shit ALWAYS makes me laugh!

      So I made it to the fucking top of Mt. St. Helena. I had a good time going up and the view was awesome. There were even a few people hang-gliding off the summit. MiMi and I just sat there for a while looking around and watching them do their thing. The trip down was rough on me. My legs were jello. We are both in some pain today. It was worth it. I saw a ton of hummingbirds and a few birds of prey. Even found an owl pellet but stayed away.  Today I am working a split shift and I have to go back in a short while. I'm on the tired side after eating some lunch. I eat some mexican food down the street and they had these little creditcard style calenders for your wallet. All of them had these elaborate and detailed latin/western paintings on them. I got the one with the aztec prince in headdress holding the sacrificial virgin. haha. I have a shorter day tomorrow. I'm glad, and still stoked about the bird training tomorrow. I want to be that guy that takes the birds to the 3rd grade classes and tell the kiddies about birds and animals and wildlife harmony. We are all on the same earth.   Peace.   current mood:  blank current music: book of dead names - Yo

      I guess I will be the first to admit that I would consider myself manic-depressant; with that out of the way, let us carry on.  I had on hell of a head ache last night at work. I sent mimi to get me some medicine out of the drug vending machine and it ate my money. I was forced to suffer, and I was trying not to be a little baby about it.  After I got home, popped some pills and it was away in a matter of a few minutes. A miricle I tell you! I have been in an awesome mood ever since.  Mimi and I are going to tackle Mt. St. Helena once again tomorrow. We never made it to the top the first time so we will get out there earlier today to tackle the beast once again. When we went out to Clear Lake and back down to calistoga, the drive took us past the head of the trail and there were tons of people parked there. I am some what glad I have days other than Sat and Sun to play. When no one is around.  This saturday, we both go to our bird rescue training. I have to say, mimi and I get along more than I had ever hoped too. I see so many couples that obviously are in some sort of economic agreement instead of a releationship. Peace, Love, and all that hippie shit from beatiful NOR CAL!   current mood:  cheerful current music: Spirit of Versailles - Track 8

      So yeah. It's been a while and I know you are all really wanting to know. ha. I've done a lot of interesting things in the last few weeks. Most of them were really something to write about. For some reason I've been taking all these inspirations and little life notes and tossing them into my short story. A dog jumping at a tree, trying to catch a cat. An ex-con trying to make up for his mistakes by joining the forces behind drug and alcohol counseling. Work is fool of good characters. New faces at the jewelry store and new drama.  I've been working on getting things ready for school. 1. Had a few meeting with councilors, that has been very helpful. looks like all my stuff will transfer. I will find out for sure in a few weeks. 2. March 1st I will start my first day of volunteer work with the Santa Rosa  Bird Rescue Center. I am really excited about that. I know that I should offer up my spare time for things worth something. 3. Job market sucks. I've almost given up. :( 4. Trying to work on a lit zine. Probably won't have time for it in the end.  Today was so amazingly beautiful. The sun was bright and warm and everything was all wonderful. That took about 2 hours to wear off at work. I was sick of people quickly and wanted out. I can't wait to get home and curl up with 'lonelyness.' The only time I ever feel real is when I am by my self.  I am so ready to sink my teeth into some learning.   current mood: accomplished current music: Hot Water Music - At the End of a Gun

      So it has been 6 months delayed, but I finally moved to Rohnert Park. I guess there is alot to talk about from the last week and a half. I am finished moving. I still have some unpacking to do but for the most part it is completed. I had a day off yesterday for the first time in a while. Zales was all super chaos, people quiting, getting sick and the rest. So I was called in to clean up. Fucking work ethics. Anyways, mimi and I went out to the Bay to Emryville to check out IKEA and fill out life with 'stuff.' Actually I was tired of working on my computer from a fucking stool and my lap. So we bought a table. We bought the table top and the legs and just built it. That was fun and it turned out to be exactly what we needed. I think we spent about an hour or two there trying to figure out what we were going to get. They have tons of super inexpensive stuff there. I was stoked. Emryville is a really cool town, all the buildings look like a cartoon.  After that we went out to Gilman St to eat at the Chipotle. Burrito! For the most part my days have been filled with putting things in their place. It's begining to look like home and I am so at peace with it all.  Another plus is a I am right down the Street from Sonoma State University and I swear, the only people that live in my new complex is SSU girls. Everywhere with their hoodies and pony tails. AHH! My eyes are going crazy. haha. Oh and I am getting DSL...woohoo. they are transfering the service so I am glad glad glad.   current mood:  satisfied current music: Millencolin - Monkey Boogie

      Dear life and love, hollowed be thy name, you seem to be the ever searching vixen of my criss-crossed mind's eye.   I spent the morning at the brc going through some simple training on how to addmit birdies and different policies and i worked out my schedule with heather. I set up a little feeding station for all the birds around my apartment. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not all mister BIRD now, i just have something to do and I feel like I am helping something besides myself.

      In Kyrgystan, "during a feast, they serve the guest the sheep's boiled head on a plate. The guest must eat the brain, then me must pluck out and eat one of the eyes. The host eats the other eye. In this way the knots of brotherhood are tied. It is an experience one does not quickly forget." I suppose this is not unlike other ritualist dinners of brotherhood in all kinds of places in the third world. I have really found a facination with this area of the world. It's amazing, all the history of the world that isn't told to us here in america, even about our own country. I love history, I love stories of the past, I pray we will learn from our mistakes on the level of humanity and on personal levels as well.  I am extremly wired on coffee this morning. I'm on my second pot and my eyes appear to prepnderate from out of my skull. I have two articles I need to start writing. Deadlines are coming soon.  Yesterday, on a whim, I signed up for the raptor handling class and made it out there around 11am. We spend about three hours going over all the ways to handle the resident raptors(hawks, falcons, and owls) and ways to read the birds behavior. In the last hour of the class we had to oppurtunity to handle some of the birds. I worked with a Dark morphed red tail hawk named cocomo and a little screech owl named blinken. Both birds we very well behaved for the session, I enjoyed the entire event.  When I got home, I recieved a call from an employer of a start up banking company. They do the banking at the local casinos and Cal card rooms. Weird, but it is 20 bucks and hour, so if it works out, i might be sitting at a blackjack table for a living, without gambling. I will probably be the only person making money at the table. Now I have to sit tight and wait for a call back to set up an interview. I hope he calls back, I am sort of weird about the whole posistion, but if I can sale jewelry, whatever. I fucked up and smoked some pot so I need to get that out of my system in case I have to take a piss test. It was just a few rips so hopefully it will clean out quickly. I was pretty worried about that most of the afternoon, not to stoked on losing a $20/hr job over a piss test. dammit.

       rode my bicycle to work yesterday. It was actually pretty fun, and I am going to do it as much as possible to save money. Gas is over 2 dollars a gallon now, and even though I drive a civic, that is still alot of money to be pumping away. I have stores and stores of fat cells that can be used instead. The ride over there was about 12 miles, not bad, it took me 40 minutes and I just changed in the nine west bathroom. The ride back was in the dark, and I couldn't see all the time where I was going, haha. There was a monster hill that I tackled and a fucking cop flashed by me at like 90 and scared the living shit out of me. Yesterday was warm too, i think somewhere around 76 F and the sun was beating down, but today it is super cloudy and cool. Should be a pleasent ride. Work was boring, still hot on the pursuit of another job. I found a few good ads today, so I had mimi fax the resumes at her work for me this morning. Oh yeah, and that Pam lady, I went to her house, in my car. She has this old Apple Quadra 605 and she is not getting any display. I opened it up and she was shocked at how i did it so easily. hehe. She said the Apple people told her that a battery had probably gone dead, well I found the battery for her and told her to try replacing that first and we can go from there. She was surprised again, and agreed. I was in there for only like five minutes. Speaking of all that, mimi and I are going to the BRC tomorrow for our 2nd training shift. Should be fun again.

      Nothing like a few cold 'stones before you go to work. Went to the college today to talk with Tia the conselor and the damn evaluation office has not finished my transcript evaluation for CSU. No worries. I went ahead and planned out my Fall '03 semester and it looks like it's going to be Biology, Math(College Algebra and Trig), and Chemistry. 12 units of pure homework hell I'm sure. That's okay, progress ahead is better than working on something in vain; I hope those other classes I took will transfer - still in the dark but I will find out in the fall. Right now, I just need to continue to review algebra so I don't fall on my ass and I should be fine.  I am going over to Pam's house tomorrow to help her with her Apple. She is the scheduling lady at the Bird Rescue Center and out of the blue she calls me to see if I want to help her. haha, whatever, i guess. I think the mother-in-law might be moving out soon. Not sure, but that is what it sounds like. That's gonna be odd, becuase then we will have to find a roommate.

      For the last couple of days I have accomplished only a few things. They weren't even really that productive. I rearranged the storage closet, in actuallity, I was searching for all the parts to my low-rider manual scooter that I started ages ago. It must be at the father-in-laws casa where the vespas are stored. I did a little painting, I am low on supplies and broke so painting will have to cease for the time being. I can make due with what I have.  I totally abandoned my good eating habits, lots of beer I don't need. It's almost just something to pass the time. I keep thinking, i can go for a jog or ride my bike around town. No matter how many times I want to be alone, I also want to share everything with at least someone. even a jog. I have another appointment with the junior college conselor tommorrow at 9am. I will find out if the classes will transfer to the local four year university and also plan out my semesters. I guess I did do something productive. I started hunting for another job, no tech stuff, just a better 'job.' I sent alot of resumes out for bank tellers, loan officer/processor, customer service rep, medical lab assistant, etc. Maybe something will come around and i can pull my self out of this finacial hole I'm in. Leatha just told me that last night, around 2am, some people were walking back to their apartment and some dude came over and took a leak right under her window. ROFL!!! wow.

      I went over to Matt's house yesterday and played some ping pong. That was some fun. I discussed a painting that I am doing and played ping pong for the most part. Made a pot of beans later that evening, the cooked all night and are excellent. They taste alot like those ranch style beans this time. I'm kinda wondering what all that animal fat is for in the ranch-style beans becuase I made em with out all that and it tastes damn close. This morning, I went to this "college skills" lab at the JC. I think it will be helpful as far as getting me up to speed with algebra and all that again. Not much else. It felt like I was in school and that was kinda neat. I fill my life with little scribbles in my calender so I feel worth something. Stay busy all the time and you don't have the chance to see home meaningless it all is. I finished Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk, it was mediocre, but entertaining for the most part. Just started reading Imperium by Ryszard Kapuscinski. I am stoked about that book, so far so good. I also finished two paintings yesterday. I need to get my online gallery up. I've been thinking about that for a few days now.   Peace.   current mood:  pleased current music: murder city devils

      I am completely wiped out today. I laided down at 11pm and some time around 3:30am was the last time I looked at the clock. My eyes were swollen and my face was weird when I shot out of bed at 7am with that "Oh SHIT! I'm late..." panic feeling. Actually, I happened to wake up at a perfect time. I totally missed the alarm at 6:10am and must have just hit the button, whatever. So after stumbling around all day, forgetting things left and right, I made it here, to my chair at my desk - the walking dead. I almost didn't realize I was at the book store, I worked and worked trying to get this shipment out on the shelves and time flew by. As soon as I have worn completly out, it was time to go. Now I am off to shower and then bed.   current mood: wiped out current music: #681 pedro the lion - of minor prophets and their prostitute wives

      So far, so good at the book store. Today was long but fun. This lady came in and bought $285 worth of romance books on tape. I caught a little 10-12 year old looking at couple's "how to" sex books. Proxcimity is the key. He managed to keep away from people for a while. I just moved over close to him and straighten'd books and he was quick to bail. Close to close two guys and two gals came in. One guy with a converge shirt and one of the girls with a Beneath the Ashes shirt. I joked around with them and tried to help them find some books but really didn't talk to them much. I suck at making friends. Maybe they will come back. I have to say, I meet alot of "cooler" people thru the book store. I got to talk Bukowski and Burroughs to some punk rock chick. Of Course, we don't have anything cool like that.  There is this cool address book that I need to get for someone. It is all filled with gay pulp art and is sooooo super rad. All these cartoon, hunky guys with no shirts on doing shit like camping and swimming. hahahaha. Some lady supposedly was offended by it a few months ago. surprise. but it is far from explicit.  I had the chance to force feed my first Red Tailed Hawk. Boy, that was exciting. One pissed off bird. I need to go to a show soon. I could use some music.   current mood:  pleased current music: Califone - Fisherman's Wife

      I didn't even get a chance to tell you about all the neat birds I got to work with on Saturday. We had 3 Black-crowned night Heron babies. These little dudes look like weird feathered dinosaurs. I was working with one in the lab, trying to get him to eat on his/her own out of the dish that I had placed in its holding box. That was a trip. At first, there was no reation to my offers of fish pieces. I would have to force em down its throat. I would check on him every hour and after the first visit he was catching on. I would wave the fishies in front of him and he would snatch it out of my hand. I did that a few times, then I waved the fishie and dropped in the dish. Viola! The food dish was discovered. That was cool.  Oh, by the way, I am on song 501 now.  Today, I started getting into the swing of running my own shift at the rescue center. Brad was my assistant today and we had everything ready to go early this morning for all the babies jays, finches, doves, and mockers. We had two admits during my shift. One was a little female house finch, the boy, probably about 8yrs old, that brought it in was awesome. His mom had drove him in and she could hardly speak english but the boy was busting out the story to me. They were walking and he saw this bird flopping around so he picked it up and took it home. haha. His mom wasn't to trilled about having a wild bird in the casa so she drove him to see us. I took the bird back and transfered him to his new basket home. I went out to answer a few questions and the boy told me he loves animals and that he doesn't like to see them hurt. DAMN! That seriously touched me. I told him the same thing, that I felt the same way. His mom said he wants to be a vet and I said, awesome, help him along the way.  I hope your dream comes true little antonio vasquez. ( I had to euthanize the bird later - what a bummer....) Next bird was a little bad ass, this dude found him in their pasture on the ground. A fucking baby Great Horned Owl a little larger than a softball. He had some giant feet on him too. I did the exam, he looked good, gave him some pedialite and called the raptor lady. Come to find out, we try to get these little dudes back in their original nest or a nest with some babies of the same general age. Unfortunatly we can't teach them how to hunt, so they don't do well in rehab. That made for a fun morning, I rushed out to home to get my Zales clothes on and get to work. I hurried over there to get started on doing NOTHING! What a waste of time. I worked with this chick named Carolyn that I totally pissed off the last time I saw her. We got into some discussion about why I don't care about people's lives. I do, but it is generally people I have woven some sort of relationship with, not random people I meet at work or on the street. She said, "If I die in six months, will you go to my funeral or just say, 'Oh, that was someone I worked with...' " I would say the later. I don't care that much I guess.  I love my friends and family, I am cautious of strangers.   current mood: geeky current music: Jawbreaker - Million

      I had this strange thought that ran through my head when I was driving back from the rescue center. I was close to my exit and going around 75mph when I looked back behind me and a motorcycle was fast aproaching my car. I moved over a bit to let him pass between myself and another car in the left lane. Now, this manuver is perfectly legal in California. It's called "lane sharing" and I normally don't think anything of it. It's a kind of benifit for using a more economical mode of single passenger transportation. When you are stuck in traffic, you can move right between all the stopped cars.  Put what freaked me out was the high speeds at which this person decided it was appropriate to make this move. If I happened to miss him in my mirror, he would have went flying all over the road.  That is seriously fucked up. No matter how many times people piss me off or in general irritate me, I would honestly say that I would never want to kill someone on purpose or by accident. I ran the question by my self as I exited the freeway, "How would I feel if I accidentally took someones life?" You take away everything they ever had or will have with one mistake. I would be devestated. I can't imagine the shear magnitude of calling to arms a military with the soul purpose of killing people on both sides. With war you are garenteed that someone will die, no of old age. Fuck that, I hate people some times and even think to myself that I might wish harm upon them but it all comes back to you. I would never really want something bad to happen to anyone.  With that said, I have a hard time with humanity on an indivual level, I can care on a global or even national level but one on one caring is not my strong point. Maybe I am hear to care for the earth and it inhabitants. Maybe I can have a hand in reversing all my destruction and the destruction of my blood.   current mood:  thoughtful current music: Hot Water Music - turnstile

      So, I just hit song 300. I am listening to all my mp3s in a random mix all the way through all of them. This will take a while, luckily I saved the one random list I made. Today had to be the longest day I have had in a long time. For most of the day I had a fucking headache and it kept hurting, getting worse as the day wore on. I just finally got rid of it with some medicine when I came home. Now I don't want to go to sleep becuase I feel like I havn't had a chance to enjoy the day.  I read alot at work and actually watched an entire hour long episode of StarTrek Voyager in the back room while on duty. The jewelry store was extremly dead, plus I really don't care what I do there becuase I seriously only have three more working days left before I am finished with this silly part of my last six months. I hope the people at the book store are a little less obnoxious.   I have a few comments that I have pulled out of the book I am reading(A Peoples History of the US by Howard Zinn) regarding our little war we have waged against Iraq. This is mainly just knowledge from past events that seem to shed some light on current events. "All men of conscience or prudence ply to windward, to maintain their wars to be defensive." - Roger Williams Regards attacks by the English against the Wampanoag Indians which ended in 1676. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners. And even a Baptist Minister had something to say that caught my eye. He said that only wars of self-defense were just, and in case of unjust war, the individual was morally obligated to resist it and lend no money to the government to support it. This was in regards to the Mexican war that had begun in 1846. Rev. Francis Wayland was president of Brown University at the time of these sermons against the war.  I bought a new watch the other day, check it out fossil watch. I wanted to get another pair of jeans but I ran out of money. Spent alot of it on food. Oh, this was from saling my white vespa frame. The guy that bought it plans to turn it into a CCR tribute bike with refrences to the Big Libowski. hahaha.

      Well, I got a call last night and I am now hired as the assistant manager at the warehouse bookstore in petaluma. I feel like I am in highschool, hopping from job to job in the same mall. I am really excited, mostly to be leaving Zales.  Tomorrow, out shifts change at the bird rescue center and I will be doing the 7:30-12 shift mostly. I get to try that out for the first time tomorrow.  What else is going on? Well, I watched a movie last night after MiMi and I went to the grocery store. The check out guy, Joshua K., was a weirdo. Always staring at MiMi and saying outloud the products like, "vegetable broth, oranges, etc." I wanted to say, "Yeah dude, that is right, you are good at identification." FUCK. haha. So I watched the Ninth Gate with Jonny Depp and the ending sucked. That is all.   current mood:  determined current music: Califone - Don't Let Me Die Nervous

      So yeah, I've been meaning to do this thing but I just keep putting it off for some reason. I dunno why, it helps me put my thoughts together, but with working two jobs. I think I have been away from home more then ever before. Away from a computer even more. haha. The bird rescue job is starting to pick up. Today we admitted 6 birds during the moring shift and I had to do a few exams, one died on me but the other(a quail) is doing better so I am stoked. I have an interview with a book store tomorrow in between my two jobs, so maybe this will be better than zales for the momment. I like books alot better than jewelry. Diamonds are a touchy thing, people die over that shit and I feel like I am only making things worse for them. This weekend I watched ringu with jeremyu and wasn't that impressed. Mimi went out to point reyes and saw three whales. I didn't get to go, I was shunned from the vehicle. haha. I think that is where we are going to be camping at the first of May. One year anniversary coming up very soon. Wow. Time flies when you are having fun.  I'm soooooooooooooooo tired. Speaking of palmer, he may be coming out to calif soon to party with his brother's bacholer party crew so I might get to see that fool.

Now, I got to run off to the rescue center. I will finish this later today.

      Fuck man.....16-18 had to be the hardest most emotional years of my life. All I worry about now is money and time and even though that sucks, love and acceptance and friendship is something of a different story. I've grown bitter and neurotic early in my life and I am some what of a hermit. I just don't like random people all that much anymore,  I found out today that my brother's friend's brother OFF'd himself. That isn't official, but that is what everything is looking like. That makes me feel so fucking sad. I know exactly how he must have felt. I know I had thought of just ending it all a few times. We all have thoughts of suicide. I just could never give up like that. Sometimes that is the easy way out and I am sooooooo glad that I never dove into that statistic.   I am glad to know everyone. jeremy, pio, bryan, corry, nate, and all the badass fellas that I have met through the very extremely bad ass caveman - stick it out. Nothing is really as bad as it seems, believe me. I would much rather have another hello with each of you than a lifetime of goodbyes. So, know this from your good friend john.

      So this morning mimi and I attended the Bird Rescue Center Orientation. That was fun. Let me run over that event a bit.   We find the place fairly easy. Pull up in the lot and it's not exactly what I thought. Right when we get in and sit is some seats we think are alright, this 'thing' turns around to ask me a question and I'm not really sure it's a dude or a chick. One of those gender bender situations. IT's PAT!!!! IT had very long hair, john lennon style glasses, large "boob' like chest that was a little on the hangy side, and a very square shaped body. Also the voice was high-pitched and there was a well groomed beard on the chin. It was very thin, more to be ambigious with i suppose. The IT asks me for a ride downtown after the class. FUCK! I so wanted to be a prick but it was really only a ride so I oblige. After that, the IT didn't bother me to much. Oh the IT's name was Mageda. W T F ! ! ! I am just an asshole I guess. I just don't want people to bother me. So I learned alot of great things and I am really excited. I found out that all of the European Starlings found today in North America-and they number in the 200 million range-are descendants of approximately 60 pair of birds introduced in New York City's Central Park in the early 1890s. A society dedicated to introducing into America all of the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare set these birds free. These are birds that we don't except at the center. They are not native. All native birds are protected and illegal to have in your home, under your care. But if you want a pet Starling, go for it. Even a piegon. There is no law saying you can't - at least in california. I'm sure you've seen a ton of Starlings.  These birds are related to the mynah bird and are very good at talking. Even better than parrots. So if you want a bird that talks alot, grab a baby starling right about now. haha. I saw red-tailed hawks that had been hit my cars, owls, kestrels, and turkey vultures. Very interesting.  Oh! I worked today, it was dull. So I'm off tomorrow, but I'm going to bed now.  bye   current mood:  determined current music: Hot Hot Heat - Bandages

I was going to burn some CDs but I will just sit here. I am full of those kinda things. I was gonna..........fill in the blank. I need to take care of my head, if you know what I mean.

      I had the chance to see Jets to Brazil again but, this time in san francisco at the Great American Music Hall. That was simply the best. I could see those guys anywhere and just be totally thrilled.  I am starting to run out of steam this week. So much is going on at my bookstore job and my rescue center job that I won't even bore you with all of that. Let me just say that it equals 60+ hours of my time this week. At least I am taking the time and money to see a few good shows; music is good for anyone. Even if it adds to the 'happenings' in my date book, I think it is worth every extra red vein in my eye. School registration is next month and, I am at least stoked on that. I have been spending my free time at home and work reading alot. I finished a few more books; most of them have been good. I actually went to the new library a few days ago and it was really nice. Maybe I will spend more time there, looks fun. I am attempting to write fiction again. Maybe I will just disregard all negative thoughts on my skills and just pour words on to paper. Oh fuck, I really should go to bed, I am creating a sleep deicit that I will not be able to catch up on for a few more days.

Today I clean up the pad and washed mimi's car, had some chinese food, took a walk over by the SSU campus pond and filled up my car with gas. Then we drove up the small mountain range behind my house to find the Fairfield Osborne Preserve. I was just curious as to where exactly it was. They only do guided tours of the area but even the drive up there was super wild. After that I worked at the bookstore and that was blah.

      This is a quick recap:  1. Went to pool party in super rich Glen Ellen for about two hours on Friday. Nice view and pool, stereotypical rich ass holes.  2. Went to Marin County Fair after pool party, saw some cool art, paid $11 to walk around with a ton of people. Lines long for carnival rides. Had the best $4 beer ever. Mild sunburn. Saw the coolest 5 minute firework show ever.  3. Saturday, finished my parakeet cage; worked at rescue center from 2-8:30pm.   4. Sunday, went out to Point Reyes and hiked the Bolinas Ridge trail about 2.5 miles deep then turned back because I was not prepared for the amount of sun. Second sunburn of the weekend. Wife and dog also hiked with me. Saw a few ravens, lots of turkey vultures, a wren, and a redtail hawk. Lots of cows, my pup even tryed to attack one - it started to charge and we all had a little freak out! Went home and cooked up some awesome shirmp fajitas on the grill and watched Independence Day on TV.  5. Today I work at rescue center for the first half of the day. Had the pleasure of working with a GOLDEN EAGLE and that was amazing. Very massive bird, alot more that I had expected. Poor guy is missing his right eye also he is still just a baby but adult size. wow. Had lady tell me at the book store that I should but all my efforts towards becoming a millionare.

      Maybe you can say that you have seen enough for a lifetime, maybe you can say that everything has been free and simple but, I have to see more. Imagine yourself young, running around in the open country, darting in and out from behind tree trunks and turning over rocks to discover alien planets. That shit was great. So let me buy you your next bottle, and we will toast to our childhood! I went to the library today to trade a few books that needed to be turned in for some fresh ones that I will read soon. I found some great ones; eight of John Muir's books in one 'volume,' an ecology book, and a biography on John Muir. I'll be stoked if I finish up a few of those books in that volume. I've already started in on "The story of my boyhood and youth" and it is stirring up a lot of good memories of when I was a boy - always outside poking at the world around me.  After the Library, I worked at the book store from 12-8:30. I had a lady bring me a House Finch that had fallen from the nest. I kept him warm and after I left work and went searching for the nest, I couldn't reach it so I placed him directly under it and hoped for the best. I would have to put him down if I took him to the center; maybe his chances are better close to his parents. He is fledging anyways so he might already start eating on his own and flying even sooner.  I also met a former professor of Sonoma State University, he was very encouraging as far as telling me that my goal was obtainable and he wished me luck. He seemed like a very interesting man, obviously paralyzed from the waist down but able to walk with crutches. Determination is an impressive quality for anyone. He taught ethics and sociology, mostly for people going towards masters in social work/public service.   current mood:  good current music: Murder City Devils - Press Gang

      So today was a pretty regular day but I thought I'd share it anyway. Worked a full day from 7:30am to 8:30pm. I had the chance to work with one of my fav birds for the second time this week. An Osprey, or Fish Hawk. What an amazing bird. This guy has talons as thick as a pencil and his feet are large in proportion to the rest of him. We got him in the center because he was down on the ground, some one caught him and brought him in - he was starving to death. So far things are looking good. Just the coolest thing to see - only the 40th bird of that species that we have had in the center for the last 20 years.   "I'm only a little pissed!"  Even rarer than that is a threatened species called the peregrine falcon.   I had the chance to work with him on Saturday, mon, and today and he is a very impressive bird as well. Fastest of them all and almost entirely wiped out by DDT. They were considered endangered for a time but have moved to only threatened with the banning of DDT in the US in the 70s.  anways, those were really cool. My day at the bookstore was simple and easy. Really just took it easy, and relaxed.  I have a few options for the 4th. In Kenwood there is the World Championship Pillow Fights, that sounds silly. Also, a guy from the Rescue Center invited mimi and i to his pool party. I think I might go to that. Could be some fun. After that, I dunno. Maybe find a carnival and see some fireworks or go see Minus the Bear in Petaluma. We will see. Have to go take my library books back tomorrow. I guess that was a 'note to self.'

      I think a temporary miracle has happened today. This extremely idiotic boy I work with will be off to Europe of r a month and a half. Thank goodness. I almost killed this brat today. He is the biggest wad of crap I have found in California. Lemme describe him; he is a lanky 18 year old know-it-all that fucks up almost everything and can't COUNT worth shit. He sings random shit to customers and is just overall the most annoying person I have had the bad luck of meeting. I know the kid hates my guts - I have never been more of an ass hole to anyone in my life. I am a straight up dick to this kid. For instance, he was helping the new girl with the register when she was doing just fine on her own, so I walk over there and ask him if he was instructed to watch over her shoulder. Then I tell him to get back to work. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He brings out things in me that I just can't cope with or handle well. Good riddance to him for a time. On a more organized note; I went to the DMV office to get mimi's car registered and our address' changed on the ol' drivers license. I could not work at the DMV - people are so insanely rude to the desk people. I am shocked at the nerve of some people.  Why can't we just be kind and generous to people - instead(me included) we are blindly led by selfishness.  You know, I have washed my hands with this senseless judgment of random people. It will give me nothing but more grief in the end. Every day is a good day for me, I am alive and my plans have not been ruined totally so screw all of these people and their bad days.  I want to share with you a poem that I came across while reading this book I bought. ----------------------------------------- Pine Tree Tops by Gary Snyder  in the blue night frost haze, the sky glows with the moon pine tree tops bend snow-blue, fade into sky, frost, starlight. the creak of boots. rabbit tracks, deer tracks, what do we know. -------------------------------------------- Man, I know the answer to that question. We don't know nearly what we all think we know about our surroundings. Take it all in, I think i might have to go off alone in the woods at the end of this week. Maybe do some meditation and find out where I ran off to.  I saw this stupid fucking bumper sticker today that said.

      We got a ton of 'new age' books at the store yesterday. lots of interesting stuff. I will have to rant about the people I work with soon. I havn't done that in a while. I am starting to hate them more and more. I really dislike most people - they probably dislike me the same. that is fine, I can live with that, but can they?

      Now that I finally found my lost little book.  Maybe I will write more.  These journals of mine always turn out like this.  Every day is a good day. I am stoked on life, just wish i could live without other people.  I can make page after page of people I hate and all the things they do that drive me insane. So ust to say what has happened since 1/15/03.  I left zales and started working at a bookstore with a paranoid obese woman and an idiot pysco kid.  Between the two of them, my generosity and kindness have disappeared in the work place.  I also work at a wildlife rehab clinic called Bird Rescue Center in Santa Rosa, CA.  I started there in March as a volunteer but was hired shortly after as a shift supervisor.  I guess I like to be an expert on everything.  So why not birds.  I really enjoy it, it has to be the most rewarding thing I have ever been a part of...

      MiMi and I went out to Point Reyes again yesterday for an awesome hike. We were dead broke and that is the best free place on earth. We drove up and parked near the Youth Hostel and hiked .8 miles down the Laguna Trail, From there we took the Fire Lane Trail about a mile to meet up with the Coast Trail. Once we hit the Coast Trail we hike up through the camp sites there. Our plan was to hike down far enough to venture off down some steep deer trails towards Secret Beach but we were side tracked but an awesome little beach that we could barly see from the trail. The valley created by the Santa Maria Creek made a little hole through the cliffs. We found a small of shoot trail and took a risk. What we found was just perfect. The little brook was emptying out on the beach making a lush tide pool that only reaches the ocean at high tide. In between the pool and the waves were a whole lot of gulls with there new young all grey and unkept. We thought we were alone but right near the cliffs to our right were two naked chicks sun bathing. They didn't seem to care, mimi and I giggled and headed south on the beach. We stopped at every tide pool and watched the green anemones and crabs just hanging out. Lots of blue mussels clung to the exposed rocks just off shore. After about a mile we ran into the Sculpted Beach and found a little rocky cove to sit and eat our lunch. Yumm, so them we hiked up another trail and met back up with the Coast Trail. From there we went back to the car. About a 5 hour hike, just a little sun burnt but not back at all. Seriously the most fun I have had in a while.  Today I worked at both jobs, got paid and filled up the tank. Was a bit annoying at the bookstore but we had a new shipment and that is fun. New stuff to check out.  Oh Jeremy, I might be out there soon, I have a Barn Owl I need to release in lodi. It was found in a truck cover in 2 tons of saw dust. In the dust somewhere. He's in good shape and hella pissed so that will be fun. ;) Maybe when we release him he will chase us all around with his fat talons.  So yeah, Good times, beach fun!   current mood:  indescribable current music: Murder City Devils - Press Gang

      I sat around and enjoyed my clean room and my spare time with mimi.  we laughed and joked around until 1:30pm when we had to head out to the rescue center.  I had to be at work at 2pm and she came along to volunteer.  I forgot our lunch so we had funyon's and coke.  Also, a few cookies that barb made.  Work was easy.  Had one mean Barn owl that wanted to kill me but I overpowered him anyway.  Today actually turned out to be pretty rad. A girl said her hands were all sweaty when she was washing the dishes.  That was odd. Another frizzie-haired blonde pulled away in a taxi from the police station in petaluma.  I wonder how her time in jail went? or her visit?

      This book is alot easier to write in when it is placed flat on a desk instead of my knee.  Today, I worked at the bookstore - scammed out of there early.  Went home and cleaned the house. I put away a bunch of clothes and rearranged my desk to make more room.  Ya know, to do more stuff on, like write in this little book.  I called hannah today to see how her birthday went, but she was busy with a few friends.  She is seven. mimi's mom is back at the apartment for two weeks.  I will be so busy next week.  I'm starting to get a little nervous.  No worries.  I'm super hip and thats all good.  I saw mars tonight.  Its really close to earth - and bright as well.

      Hannah's birthday today and I didn't call her.  I can't even think how old she is even.  There were several times I thought about calling but I guess I let it slip each time.  Today has been a really nice day, weather wise.  Lots of sunshine and a super nice breeze to cool you down.  The sun is setting behind me, lighting up all of those high clouds.

      Pieces of me fall like stars onto a black canvas night sky. The salty fish smell of the sea says it all.  Life.  Everywhere, I see traces of what once existed so vibrantly.  Now urbanized.  destroyed.  Maybe some day we will turn back the clock.  The sad state of so many heartbroken fellows bitten by commercial greed. So many things target them.  Books, songs, TV. Lonely is a way we all feel.  Not just the codependant or lust ridden, but all mankind. Money, Money, Money - is everyone weak and waiting to get taken? I'm starting to think so..

      Being broke is a little on my mind.  Being a little lazy with my health is also there. Ready to go home and go to bed.  Got hired at the Bird Rescue Center full time last week. Next week, school starts.  I don't have any of my books. I'm only working at the bookstore twice next week.

      All of my dear friends - I have missed you. I sometimes forget all about my friends and that I actually have people in the world that think about me becuase I am out on the end of the u.s. I dunno what I would do with out mimi. My pets just guard my stuff.  Well, news flash, I got hired Full Time at the Bird Rescue Center. So I will be working my little buns off there. I am sorta glad to get out of retail for a little while. I am only working at the book store occasionally. I have been reading a ton in my spare time and at work alot. I rush around from one job to another, always late.  School starts next week and the book store still only has 1 out of 4 books I need. Fucking weird, but whatever.  Anyways, my job description is changing a bit at the center. I am dealing alot more with all the raptors that we handle. That is really exciting and super stressful. I had to go feed all of the guys we have out in the rehab mews(outdoor aviaries) and was flown at a few times. Not sure if it was aggressive but still pretty hott. I was sweating my ass off worried about talons in my pretty little hairless head.  Mimi and I ran out to Point Reyes again on Sunday to have some food at the beach and watch the sunset. It was amazing. The moon was full as well and bright has her beautiful eyes. It is so dark out there and so alien. It makes my heart heavy to think that I only paint buildings and street lights as familiar in my mind. Today, in the local paper, horrays were in order for a woman who survived a cliff fall in the seirras for four days with a broken femur, hip, and other injuries. Damn, thats tough.  I just wanna say it sucks to grow up.   current mood:  melancholy current music: ben folds - still fighting it

Will be moving in to bird rescue center's studio apartment as care taker of grounds in six months to year. Rent Free.  4. Reading lots of Gary Snyder's poetry. growing beard again, becoming a mountain. Showering in the rain, wiping my ass behind a tree with a bear.  5. Winter at the rescue center kicks ass. no freaking baby birds.   current mood: caffinated current music: mogwai - may nothing but happiness come through your door

      I had to go to a sales meeting at 9am this morning. I was so frustrated with the basic crap that we went over, I almost left halfway through in high dudgeon. Besides that, I went to breakfast with Brenden and we chow'd down on some spuds. You could tale by the look on our face that we both hate our job as of now. Even more so than before, I think. In my case anyways.  Luckily, I did get a call from Legacy, and I have a real face to face interview on Friday 17th. Slow going, but good news non the less. Talked to Palmer for about 20 minutes yesterday. That was cool. Nice to have him around again to talk. I read alot yesterday. I finished the metamorphasis and started in on the chuck plalahniuk book. Good stuff, I am stoked once again with a little interesting poker. Prod away at my brain. I could use a massage.   current mood:  aggravated current music: clipped wings

      school starts again on monday, and I have that on my mind alot today. After busting my rump at work, repairing outdoor enclosures and setting up my pygmy owl friend in his new house. He is spending the night at the center tonight and I hope he will be okay. I think it should be fine.  He seemed to deal with the new surroundings well. He ate and that is always a good sign.  I had a handling class today and the people that came were progressing very nicely. I can't wait till some of them are up to speed so they can take over these training responsibilities.  Now every time I talk about shit I am going to refer to Von Dutch. I'm gonna go Von Dutch it in the big white bowl.

      I gave alot to you 2003. I took alot from you too. Now that it is over, I feel the need to catch my breath. I spent the last few waking hours of the oh three drink some booze with some new friends and joking about the accident i was a part of the evening of dec 31st. New drivers, I got banged in the ass by this 19 year old guy. Oh wait, I mean a car accident.   2004 should be interesting. Not as much crazyness, but I will find some for sure. This has been a swell group of holidays.  I wish all my friends in Tejas a HAPPY NEW YEAR!! I miss you all, and sorry i didn't get to see all of you. We need to hang at tea house in the big SF reading passages from hip books and seeing all the bueaty and art and wonder there is to life.   I wish all my friends in Cali a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! You are all hella the sickest! :)  Read a good book and then write it out in steam from your coffee cup.

       I've been feeling pretty crappy the last few days.&nbsp; This apartment search seemed to be dragging out more than it needed to, but today there was a break thru.&nbsp; I got a call from the second place we filled out an app with and they approved the application so we have a place to move to now.&nbsp; I'm really stoked to finally get out of Plano.&nbsp; It's not a bad town, and there is a really cool park next to us but it's time to get a place of our own.&nbsp; It's been a while.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I called the first place we looked at to voice all my complaints but they havn't returned my call.&nbsp; Dammit.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Tonight I am going to see the album leaf at hailey's club.&nbsp; Should be nice, I havn't been to a show since I've been back in DFW.

      I've been all alone, in the empty apartment by myself. It's pretty dull so far. I have no transportation, the bus doesn't even run down this street. There is a bike on Leatha's back porch, but there is no bike lock. I would hate to take it somewhere and it end up getting stolen. I would like to go to the library, its just one long walk. I feel brainless, just sitting at the computer all day. My thoughts and ideas wasting away in the light of the glowing monitor. It's okay, I'm not really alive today. More like a zombie. Last night, I was awake till 3am, rendering myself useless in front of my computer. I had found an awesome 1980 Schwinn Cruiser on ebay. It's on of those big one-speed bikes with the big comfy saddle and the retro-lines. I bid on it and emailed the seller with an offer to see if he would end the auction early and let me come pick it up. He is just north in McKinney. Of course, being the hour it was, I would have to wait for a response to come in the morning. I tried to sleep. At 6am, the smiling sun was just topping the horizon, mimi gets out of bed and is quickly ready to leave for work. While I was half asleep, she takes her pillow and covers my head then turns on the light in the room. I guess she was looking for something. Soon after she is gone, out to drive to Hillsburo to train at another store. I can't sleep so I get out of bed, waste some time on the computer for a few hours and finally I get an email from the bike guy. He says it would be very convenient for him if I could pick the bike up, but my offer was to low considering he has 15 people currently "watching" the item, myself included. I was bummed but what do you expect. It's really no big deal. Last night, in my bout of insomnia, I researched Denton's transit systems like I was on the verge of curing cancer. More likely curing my insomnia. Denton has a pretty rockin' bus system. There are a lot of routes, fairly frequent and the school even has its own more specific routes around campus. My need for a car is now out the window. I can ride everything for free with a Student ID. I did venture out of the hole of an apartment today. I went for a walk to the grocery store. A few blocks away, not bad. Picked up a few items for my grumbling belly. On my way back I saw, for the first time, a Killdeer luring me away from her nest by acting like she had a wing injury. I had read about this and seen a few photos but this was really neat first hand. Right next to Tom Thumb, there is a square of mowed land that is really just an island of soon-to-be developed real estate already surrounded by a parking lot and access roads. I'm sure some crap-hole JackintheBox will fit perfectly. Well, I had walked across the lot on my way into the store but it wasn't until I crossed again the second time did the adult Killdeer start her act. Making all kinds of noise and flopping around. I knew what was happening so I looked down and I'm standing less that 2 feet from the nest. Killdeer nest out in the open, on the ground, even in gravel parking lots, but their luring tactics and the camo of the eggs help them to be on of the most successful "shore" birds. There were three perfectly spotty eggs in a small gravel nest. The adult just sat on the ground, like it had just been a victim of mis-identification at the hands of a really crappy duck hunter.  Of course, when I started to walk away, instantly! she is cured of her injury. An Academy award should go out to hard working actors like that.  I left them alone, walked home, ate my food and creeped back to the terrible box. For what, I still don't know. But here I am. I finally got tired of the beating sun that comes thru the east facing window in my room. I found an extra shower curtain rod, placed it in the window and put a big heavy sleeping bag over it to block out some of the sun. Now I'm positive the radiation poisoning is coming from my computer screen.
