       The day started right for me. The weekend was amazing as I spent the night at my "best friend's" place. I got a sneak peak of how it would be to actually see him from night to day. I loved every second of it. I am growing more fond of him everyday. I have been feeling more and more love with each day that would pass. I have realized that loving indeed entails all the understanding, all the caring and all the sacrifice... I just love it! To my honey, I love you!

       Let me begin this page by saying that my life will start anew. Today marks the day that I will document the events that will unfold in my life. My life that's been filled with much happiness, sadness, hurt, hatred, joy, and love. Music played and still plays a big part of what I have been. I feel that it's one of the things which keep me going. I breath music, I won't know what to do without it. Which brings me to my page's title... life and music ... My life, and the music it cherished and will continue to hear.

       The days have been hectic for me lately and sometimes I notice that I haven't been much of a boyfriend to my honey. I haven't seen him since Saturday and I really miss him a lot. We have been growing and developing, at least that's what I notice. Somehow, texting each other has been less but I don't attribute it to the possibility that something is lacking. It's more of we know how each other is and we that we are more secure about each other.   Updated the site, added sections for different pictures. Hope it's enjoyed. Nothing too great to talk about.   Still have "Love Always Finds A Way" in my head. I can't get enough of that song. I have been dying to sing it since the time I got to hear an interpretation of it by Regine Velasquez. I'm a big fan so I hope I don't get flak from people out there.   As usual, work is not as fulfilling as when I was in Chicago. Things there were more exciting and the people I worked with had such high respects for me. It helps you know, when co-workers have a high regard for your opinions and somehow project that you are important to the team.   I miss the Chicago, all it offered me and will offer me just gets me in a depressed mood. As if I could just fly there any time. Avoid the horrible winters.  With earphones on me, no music seems to go through... argh... the player is not working. I'll check you laterz.

       I'm happy that I already made a really decent webpage for myself. I'm glad that no matter how much work there is, I was still able to accomplish something I can be very proud of. Work sucks. Coding is a total bore. How I wish I could just sing forever. Sing my way through life. Live off from singing. Get mucho bucks from performing.   Me and friends have been planning to catch the musical Falsettos which will be starting its run this weekend and will last until August. I have heard scores from the musical as a friend of mine was able to let me listen to the music which he got from another friend of his. Songs are very easy, not quite your Les Mis intense volume and emotion but still, the words used were very witty and well thought of. The musical is a story of a gay couple who has to go through life with one of the guy's son having to grow up knowing his dad is gay. Did I confuse you with that? You'll figure it out. Anyway, it triggered thoughts in my head about me having children, or at the least, a child (boy or girl... I don't care).   I have always wanted to know how a child with my genes and someone else's would look like. Will the child be as tall as me (not saying that I'm uber tall but I'm taller that your average Filipino guy). Read this book by Dan Savage called "The Kid". It was about how the author and his domestic partner went through with doing open adoption just so that they can have a baby to call their own. Mostly showed how much of the adoption stage was really spent on having to resolve issues with in the couple and outside of their relationship, including that of the biological mom's. Oh well, it would bore you and myself to actually delve into the specifics but the book is a good read.  Anyway, I believe Pride celebrations are just around the corner. Can't wait.

       My love for music, I just realized, hasn't really been made that clear in this blog. A quick history of how I found music or how music found me.  I was in pre-school. Here in the Philippines they'd have mini graduation rites for pre-school. The teacher got me and this girl classmate of mine to do a song for the "graduation". If I remember correctly, we sang that "... i'm but a small voice..." song by Lea Salonga. It was all too cheesy really. But nonetheless, I would remember getting a rush from that particular performance. So I thought singing in front of people was cool. I didn't know back then that I had a good voice mind you.   Grade school came and I think I joined almost every year in the singing competitions in school. Lucky me, I'd win everytime. So thru those 6 years in Grade school, I was able to establish a name, a reputation in school. Students from high school knew me. To a kid in the 5th Grade that was really cool.   During that transition from Grade school to high school, my mom enrolled me in singing lessons at the Ryan Cayabyab Music Studio. That was a really good decision for after that, my confidence really multiplied. I felt more at ease with tackling other songs (aside from those lung exhausting belts of Carey and Houston). I was introduced to Broadway.  High school was a bore. Did the usual performances here and there. I always stopped in the middle of what I was doing and think of how it would've been like to drop everything and pursue a career in showbiz. But then, I'd think, "nah... I want to be a stock broker".. (or something to that effect). This when I was 14 or 15... yikes!  In college I finally got my opportunity to sing more often. Joined a choir, the De La Salle University Chorale, and really enjoyed my stay with the group. Taking me to so many places all over Europe. Performances for various dignitaries and royalty. Performance venues that I only dreamed I was going to perform in but I actually ended up performing at.   Until now I still miss the whole experience of being in that group. Although us alumni members of the choir still enjoy hanging out and performing together, like we always say, being in the real thing is different.  I still listen to choral music which has been, for me, one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard. So, that's how my love for music started. Hope that sheds light to what makes me feel like my life has and always will be influenced by music.  To my honey, I will always be singing great music to/for you.

       I got to chatting with a friend of mine about this old friend of ours. The old friend used to be close to our group. He was one of my really close friends. A huge issue blew up in our faces which caused the fall out between the group and him. We ended up hating him for the fact that we felt we were abandoned by him. Makes one think, do close friends become "nasty" when they are no longer your friends? Is it bad to feel hate for someone who was once a friend you loved like a brother?  *sigh*  We miss him.

       Woke up this morning with a smile on my face. A message from my honey said he loves me. It's hard to imagine that only a few days ago, we were almost going to break up because of something I did. This got me thinking about our relationship. He mentioned to me one time that he noticed that we'd end up in a semi-fight everytime we see each other. I had to agree, he was right. I noticed the same thing. It seemed though that the semi-fights happened after our first month. Have we moved on from the honeymoon phase to the next phase? Have feelings matured between us? Has the relationship started taking on a new form or constantly improve?  Do relationships that start with sex/making love mature faster?  I have been through a few relationships and so far, all of them didn't last long. I only consider myself having had one ex-boyfriend as I only had on "official" boyfriend prior to my current boyfriend. Others came along but nothing worked out that well because it started with sex, nothing else to look forward to. But my point is, when a couple become a couple, and sex was the instrument for them to be together, will their relationship mature or move faster than usual. This goes for either straight relationships or otherwise.   I remember telling my honey that I had this theory about gay relationships. The theory goes, each month a gay couple goes through represents 6 months to a year in straight relationship years. The idea sprouted from the fact that not a lot straight relationships start off for/by/with sex. I can yack all I can about this but of course, I could be mistaken.  Last night was amazing. Dinner, onto my honey's place. I loved the STAR WARS Trilogy VCD he gave me. He remembered that I have been wanting to catch the earlier STAR WARS movies after getting the whole story of the "epic" series. Thanks honey! Love you! Here's to more months and years.

       Meeting my honey in a few. I can't wait to see him ! I got him a gift. I hope he likes it. It's been a long day as I have been anticipating the moment we see each other again after that huge tiff we had last Friday. I just want to hold him in my arms and show him how much I love him. Wish me luck!

       Start of a new week, things can never be better. It's the start of me and my honey's third month together. We have very recently went through (and maybe still are going through) some issues which I'd rather not talk about. In a way, I'm ok with that fact that it happened this early, so at least we'll be able to hurdle the issues at this stage of our relationship. It seems that I've hurt my honey's feelings and I completely lost his trust in me. That is really hard to regain. I do express my deepest apologies to him. I want him to know that I will do anything in my power to gain his confidence back so he can trust me again. (just to pre-empt anyone here, I did NOT cheat on him)   Thanks honey for giving me the chance of loving you. I will always love you. Days have been better since you came into my life. Here's to hoping to live more months and years with you.  "... sometime, that sometime will turn to forever, for all time... ... somewhere, that somewhere will not just be one place, but everywhere..."  "... our love, like love, it's what it is, it's what we've got..."  I love you!

       I have recently been absorbed in the world of Magic... not the David Blane kind... the cards kind. It came about when I wanted to get into the things my honey is into. In this case he's into Magic cards and video games. I have loved video games since I can remember, I just forgot how to appreciate them when I started high school and all throughout college. Now I'm close to getting hooked. Good thing we don't have a PS (1 or 2) at home. Magic, I did my first unfinished duel last night.  It was fun. I like the fact that I get to share his interests now.   At this time, I have to get him into my interests. Music and sports. I'm into performance music, choral music, tennis and hmmm... that would be it for now. More interests coming from me would exhaust my honey.

       Responded to my baby with the lines... "I'm glad that I am able to impart some values I have learned from life thru actions and the way I live my life. It(being responsible) is something I've really felt strongly about. I'm glad that I can influence you in that way." ..."When one is able to get a hold of himself and has control over things, it means they have control of their lives. Small things like controlling certain urges really leads to an overpowering feeling. When you know you can tell yourself what to do and not give in to cravings or the urges then you are on your way to controlling your life."  I don't know if I was able to get my message across. I hope I did.

       Woke up this morning with a message on my phone... my honey is worried about us...   Read an email from him. It was a response to this mail I sent him about a list of three words people should sincerely say in a relationship, of any form. After the mail, what was left in my heart were the words he "uttered" ... "I still have much to learn about you and your feelings, quirks and idiosyncrasies. And if it takes me forever to walk that path, I'll gladly walk with you. I love you."  To you, my baby... I love you too.

       Weekend's over and I'm back to the daily grind. Friday night was amazing. We went to this bar called Acquario. Amazing. I felt like I was in a trendy bar in Manhattan. All white with blue lights. Philippe Starck looking furniture. It was so cool. I was with friends the entire evening (including my honey). A few hours before heading to Acquario, we were at doing karaoke and it felt good to sing again after how many weeks of no singing. I blasted a few songs some local, mostly foreign. My friends had me start up with Mariah's Never Too Far Away... argh! I was like, darn. It did stretch my voice immediately but I thought it was too much. Good thing though was they enjoyed it. Then did a few 80s music like Fra Lippo Lippi and James Ingram. Some local stuff. Uhm. I think we closed with a Swing Out Sister song, Breakout. There are karaoke clubs here in Manila that have private rooms so we could embarrass ourselves more.   The next day was mellow. Woke up at 2ish in the afternoon. Had late lunch with the parental units. Slept a bit and got ready for anticipated mass at half past 5. I was going to sing with the choir. Met up with my honey after mass. We went to the nearby mall to hang around and do some window shopping. We headed off to watch "40 Days and 40 Nights" which I thought was funny. Lest for those ignorant guys at the back row whom we thought were there just to annoy the other people watching the movie. Argh! Took my honey home. It was a quite evening.  Woke up earlier for Sunday. Lounged around the house and didn't get my lazy ass working a thing. Had a heavy breakfast. Coffee and newspaper. Ok ok... there was no newspaper. I said that so you would think I'm one who's into current events. Went to the mall with my mom to get stuff for my room. My new Ethan Allen looking bed is arriving in a couple of weeks so I've been searching for the best sheets I could find.   Which brings us to the here and now... I'll check in again in a while... laterz.

       Today's been very slow and calm. We got treated with ice cream to lessen the depression with in our group. This was because of the loss we experienced last night. Things were great at work. Less pressure than usual. It's been a great day so far. Met up with my honey at the mall. We hung out at a deli and talked about things. It was a good talk as we were able to iron more things about our relationship. He said something like everything he does with me is never boring or never uninteresting. That's so sweet of him to say something like that. We're off to a karaoke thing tonight. I'm going to be singing a few songs for him. Hopefully he likes them.

       Just a quick update. We lost the game. Darn! Oh well, there's always next year. Being better prepared and well skilled for next season would be a task for all of the team members. Sometimes things we pray for aren't given to us in the time we want them because God always knows when the right time is for our prayers to be answered. FUN FUN FUN!

       Beep beep beep...  My cell phone (a.k.a. my alarm clock) woke me up this morning. As I got up from bed a sudden gush of pain went thru me. I felt most of it coming from my right leg. First thought that came to my head was what's going to happen to our game tonight (I had a volleyball game tonight, it's the last game of the championships). After telling my honey what had happened, I felt bad that he thinks he's guilty for my minor "injury". Too much tossing and turning. He he he... I was able to wrap it with a bandage and tried out driving to work. The day was slow. I wore sandals in the office for fear of stressing my leg because of the leather shoes. I thought to myself why wearing sandals in the office isn't allowed when all you end up with is being more comfortable. Bugger. Oh well. I have constantly told my honey to not feel guilty with my situation. I hope he realizes that it wasn't his fault that I gave too much... er... pleasure. He he he... The big game's up in a couple of hours. Hopefully we get the match! Right now, all I can think of is being in the arms of the one I love and just be cradled in his gentle embrace. I love him!

       It has been such a hectic and just absolutely tiring day. Almost hellish. Hopefully things get better later as I am to meet up with my honey. Miss him so much. I haven't seen him in almost a week. Pressures from work really get me so drained and I end up thinking how much more I can take. But I have never been one who quits. I can't wait for the karaoke session we have this Friday. Set me up some songs to try out. Hopefully it goes well. I feel like I need a shower. :)

       I know, I know... it's been a while since last I posted. Things have just been really great the last month. Me and my honey (that's what I call him now) are close to two months being together. I can't wait. Things just happen and all for a reason. We learn more and more about each other. I'm loving it. Each person becomes more and more mature about how to deal with situations when they arise. I end up learning how to deal with his quirks and he is starting to learn about how to deal with mine. =) we went to this country club 2 hours away from the city and spent the night there. Cuddled in bed. Amazing. It felt so right. Did things together in the bathroom, his side and my side. It was really cute. I really love it! I love him!

       Heard from a friend today that the audition piece that will be performed should only be 16 bars of the entire song. That leaves me with the bridge and the chorus... argh! I was advised to warm up prior to entering the room for auditions so as not to have that hesitating voice upon hitting the bridge. It's a pretty high note to start with. I hope my friends pray for me...  I have other news. I'll talk about that later.

       Finally... set my audition date to Thursday at 2PM. I'm just a bit nervous but that's fine. I just hope I can carry on with this feeling inside me of excitement and eagerness to belt out all the high notes I can.   Spent most of the day with my honey last Saturday. He went with me to where the registration was being held after I picked him up from his place. It was a great morning to start with. Nice weather. Sunny. Driving through the highway to exit Susana Heights. It was a pleasant drive.   It was a quick process that the organizers came up with for the auditions. I was able to pick my sched. I also noticed that I was number 130++ on the list of people who were going to audition. I wonder which parts are they openning to the Filipino leg of auditions.   That evening, my honey and I caught Minority Report at the mall. It was quite an interesting movie. Lacked the oomph! but otherwise it was good.   Caught up with my choir friends. Had coffee at Haagen Daas. Headed on off to our friend's house for a little jamming while the others chose their pieces for the auditions. Listened to some music. One of which, my friend's composition (lyrics and music). Amazing stuff. It's entitled "It Doesn't Get Easier", and mostly talks about coping with the fact that your loved one found someone else. How it is to see them together in the same situations you once were with him/her. Pretty touching. We also listened to the Lion King CD of the original Broadway Cast just to give us an idea of how the songs go and what kind of music does the musical really have. This made me think what voice is apt to be in which role. Thought of ways to attack my piece. I need to practice some more to be able to hit that high note on the bridge of the song. I'll keep on praying!

       Gawd... It's 8:30PM and I'm still at work. I leaving in a few minutes. I'm sure my honey is worried about me by now. I'm going home soon.   Tinkered with Flash MX and Dreamweaver MX during my break time. I honestly had fun. I'm a little frustrated though coz I couldn't get this particular Flash file customized. It would've been a cool addition to my site. I've been looking for templates for the website. No luck so far. I'm thinking about just changing the colors of the areas. Hmmm.. watcha think?   I'm heading off... toodles...

       The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain...  This phrase from 'My Fair Lady' is what I'd use to start my day when I was in Ireland. Usually to start talking with a mild Queen's English accent. My friend Nelz mentioned that he acquired the British tongue when had a chance to work with them. Same went for me. The Queen's English accent which I could usually switch on became harder as I knew I was starting to become Irish. Too much Guinness. (snap out of it dude)...  Good news... I think we moved up in our standings for the Bowling Competition. :) Thanks honey for the kiss. I bowled 150s across the board. I'm happy! Registration's near and I still don't have a head shot! I'm still thinking where I should have my picture taken. *sigh* I have to finish quite a number of deliverables today. Eight of them to be exact. Bleh! Wish me luck!  side note: I'm pissed, the sole of my left shoe is cracked... darn! Nasty nasty.

       Argh... it's the last day for the bowling matches and next week we're off to the finals. I'm so freaked out. I hope I do well, at least up my average to like 125. I used to have a pretty decent average. Now, with such a long time between the start of this competition and the last time I played bowling in Chicago, I'm just really sucky! Bleh!  I was invited by my former choral conductor to the 2nd recital for the DLSU Chorale members and alumni. I'm still thinking of what to sing. I know it's going to be this December and that gives me so much time. I sang Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot in last year's recital. I knew it was a pretty tough piece and that a voice major friend of mine said that it was an "advanced students piece". I never did voice. The only vocal training I got was from the Ryan Cayabyab Music Studio and our conductor from my choir in DLSU Manila. I wonder if he's ok with me singing This is the Moment from Jekyll and Hyde. hmmm...  I'm feeling good about myself lately. I know I love my honey, I know my job is picking up and I'm starting to like it again. I can't wait for the auditions. It's for Lion King Australia... not sure if it's going to be in Melbourne or Sydney. I know tons of established artists are going to try out but I'm still hopeful.  Ok... we're off to the bowling alley. Laterz.

       It's a few more days till the registration for the Lion King auditions and I'm just so excited about it. I have never been on an audition for a theatrical production. It's scary and just exhillirating just thinking about it. I just hope it goes well. I mean, all I really care about is for me to do a good showing. I really don't care if I get in or not (yeah right! ha ha ha). I am more into the experience I will gain from doing this audition. I'm so sure that tons of people will be showing up for this one so better get there early.   That dry spell I had over the weekend is now over. It started Saturday when I got the chance to catch the Volleyball Grand Prix at the Araneta Coliseum. Russia, Japan, Germany and Brazil battled it out in an amazing display of athleticism, physical strength and mental superiority. It was an exciting showdown for Russia and Japan. The game between the teams from Brazil and Germany was a bit boring compared to the earlier match. The teams did justify the ticket prices as the early evening was filled sounds of excitement.  That night I headed to the Trader's Hotel to meet with my high school friends in one of the hotel rooms. The room was reserved by one of my friends who just arrived from the U.S. It was a pretty wild party. Let's just say it was wild enough that I can't divulge any information aside from I had an amazing buzz the whole time!

       It hasn't been a good start for the weekend. Again, I really don't want to talk about it much as it would just complicate things. I'm just really not in a good mood. Talk about pooping my own party! Hope next week would be better. Hope tonight would be better. I plan on playing tennis with my friend tomorrow. I really need the physical activity now.   By the way, I failed to mention that the Chorale arrived yesterday, early morning. I'm so happy they're back. I miss them all so much! I feel as if my "siblings" have returned. It seems no one can really understand how tight the bond us Chorale/former Chorale members have. It's too complex to explain and too deep to understand. It's like having these people there, knowing every single thing about you. No inhibitions whatsoever. Always united. Love is present. We all look out for each other. I thank God that I have this group of friends. I will never have them replaced for the world!

       The day's been really such a bore. Nothing much to talk about. I got my tickets to watch the World Volleyball Grand Prix where teams Russia, Germany, Brazil and Japan will be battling it out to capture the win for the Manila leg. I also can't wait for the weekend. My friend who arrived from San Francisco got a room at a hotel where all of us friends from high school will be partying the whole night. Exchanging stories, laughing at special moments we've spent together and all the pictures another friend of ours collected through the years. I'm really excited. Hope I don't get drunk or something. I promise to behave honey.   I have thought of my piece for the auditions for the musical I mentioned. My friend who's a pianist approved of the piece. He says it will be a good song for me because it will stretch my range and show the screening committee the versatility of my voice. I really don't care much whatever the outcome is. It's mostly for the experience of auditioning and I think it's just gonna be nerve-wracking! Can't wait!

       Yeap... That's right! It's been five days since last I posted. Really feeling great today. It's me and my honey's 3rd month together. I'm a happy camper. *smile*  Lately I have been contemplating on auditioning for this musical which will be produced in Australia. I have spoken to friends about it and they were all for the idea. I consulted my pianist/superstar accompanist (he he he) about what piece I should sing. I am still juggling between a Josh Groban song (To Where You Are or You're Still You), On The Wings of Love, In Your Eyes or a male version of Regine Velasquez' To Reach You (this is really just the original version modulated 2 keys higher). I am quite excited. The auditions are in a few weeks and I am in dire need of a rehearsal just to get my voice back in shape. It hasn't really seen much performances lately so it could be rusty.   Got my honey a cool gift today. Hope he likes it.   Weekend was boring. Not much excitement. Pretty laid back. But I did get to play badminton yesterday and my game is getting better. We have another game next week. Hope I get the hang of it.   Love yah baby!

       Now I'm thinking I'd rather just keep what happened to me to myself. I'd not resort to reliving it else it'll be just another "logged" memory. Have a great weekend!

       I will have to tell you about what happened to me yesterday. I'm still getting through it so just be patient. It's not really that big but it would've changed quite a lot in my life and how it will progress.

       From my Dublin Trip last year... just reminiscing...  "Another week over... another week brewing... Last week seemed such a boring span of days for me. Not too much happening, mostly going out for dinners all over the city.  Remember when I told you guys I would be applying for a visa from the French Embassy here in Dublin so that I could fly to Paris... never happened.  I needed a multiple entry visa to Ireland first in order for me to actually get out of here and come back again. I did just that, went to the Department of Foreign Affairs and did the whole waiting thing... I was there for four hours. My turn came and naturally I went up to the counter.  As the lady on the other side of the counter was screening my passport, I noticed she seemed odd, then it happened... I can't get a multiple entry visa until I "get a green book"... I had no idea what she was talking about.  She then explained that I would need to get a green book as a document that proves that I am a "resident" of Ireland.  So I was frustrated with the fact that I wasted 4 hours of my day for nothing.    The next day, Tuesday, me and Kristine went to the Bureau of Immigration to get a green book.  We decided to meet at the compound around 6:30AM... I got there 5 minutes late and I see a hundred people lined up.  Krisitine was no where to be found. So I lined up feeling cold from the chilly Dublin mornings.  Kristine arrived after 5 minutes as well.  So we had to wait for 8:30AM as the ticket stubs (with numbers) will be given then.  I got me a Grande Caffe Mocha from the nearby Cafe Sol and also some Danish. 8:30AM, we got our ticket numbers easily and saw that we were numbers 176 and 177.  So we decided we would have time to go back to the office and come back during lunch.  Lunch came, we arrived and saw that 104 was being called.  We waited, waited, waited... finally after 4 hours of waiting, we were called.  Came up to the counter smiling with confidence.  As the person on the other side of the counter mentioned the words, "I'm sorry we can't issue you a green book because of your C-Business type visa"... my heart felt like it was being squeezed by a juice extractor... FUCK ... SHITE... DAMN YOU!!!!(side note, Kristine didn't get a green book as well)  We went to Grafton street immediately after the horrible afternoon came upon us. Grafton street is like Stephansplatz(a street where there are stores where you can do your shopping in Vienna).  I was so keen on getting my mind out of that ghastly experience that I felt the need to buy something over the top! I didn't.  I ended up just checking out the stuff on the display windows and drooling from the nice shoes, pants and shirts I would be seeing. After window shopping, I went to Kristine's place.  We passed by St. Stephen's Green Mall first to get Jennifer. For dinner, Kristine made this amazing chicken dish, I brought pasta and pizza and Jennifer came with a bottle of Chardonnay.  We had an amazing feast and ended up forgetting the whole fiasco of a few hours ago.  Toasting to our exciting week before us we then proceeded to the Back Lounge which was just in front of Kristine' apartment.  We had a couple of drinks, I sang a song(it was karaoke night), had loads of fun...  The following days were again pretty much ho hum... correction... very ho hum. The weekend though, I had committed myself to exploring the city by myself(Kristine went to Slane which is up north to catch the U2 Concert where Nelly Furtado, Ash and Moby were also performing as front acts... I know I know... but what can I do, the tickets were sold out way before I came to Dublin) anyway, as I was saying, I explored the city mostly went to the cultural sites.  Checked out all the places that would have the word "National" as part of its name... i.e. National Gallery of Ireland, National Concert Hall, National Institute of Modern Art... blah blah blah... Saw a lecture on Art as Influenced by Music... very interesting.  Got to see some great pieces by Rembrandt, Monet, Caravaggio and others.  I never thought I'd be so captured by graphical illustrations of worldly images and subconscious thoughts."  *sigh*... the good ole days... cheers to Dublin... cheers to Ireland... Slainte!

       I just realized something, I don't remember ever standing up for who I am. For my principles that everyone is created equal. That I have my right to my own happiness and that no one has the right to disrespect that.   I got into thinking this way because of an experience I read about from this guy on PEx about not answering a question on "Are all gay men effeminate?" Maybe at this stage of my life I will be able to answer that with all confidence that all gay men come in different shapes and sizes. Different personalities, different levels of masculinity. Just like straigh men and women, gay women, bi men and women, and the in betweens. Really, diversity is present in all of us. That label has really got to go. I am still wondering how it came to be that that particular label existed. I remember taking this psychological test in college that resulted in me being androgenous in my personality. Mostly, I'm capable of masculine and feminine personalities and emotions. I take that as a complement. It seems that that would be perfect because you'd have the best of both worlds.   Which brings me to a statement my mom told me before. She goes "it's a good thing I have a gay son." I'm like "why?" Blurts out "because I immediatley get a son and a daughter." I interpret that as having the rationale, firmness and strength of a man, and the caring, loving, and understanding qualities of a woman. Great ain't it?

       Yawn... I'm still sleepy. Woke up pretty early today. I no one told me the color coding scheme was suspended. Which reminds me, why do they call it color coding? I don't see any colors which traffic enforcers can code. I think my brain's just saturated enough. My head ache is killing me. Darn weather makes me want to go home and just sleep.   Read an article today from a website my friend sent me. It was about that whole issue with 19% of the Filipinos not wanting to stay in the Philippines anymore. To be honest, I have always considered myself a man of the world hence, anywhere is just fine by me. But I still have my bias for American living because I have experienced it. Having worked there for more than a year made me see what the hoopla about the U.S. was and it did seem like a better life. It was great for me since the company shouldered housing and transportation (a car or public transportation when I lived downtown). Me and a room mate lived in a nice townhouse/apartment type place and would sometimes have parties for our officemates there. It was a great experience for me. Weekends would usually be spent at the mall shopping our hearts out. At night, it would be off to the city and paint the town red. Uhm... not quite. It's usually just me and friends from downtown who I hang out with when I'm out and about.   However, I ended up appreciating what we have here more. Hmmmm... I'd have to rethink that last statement. He he he... Seriously though, I enjoy the small perks of being an upper middle class citizen here in the Philippines. I can't say the same for the one's on the threshold of poverty. Sometimes, I feel badly about how my "brothers and sisters" are coping with their situations. Makes me want to think about what I can do as a simple citizen of the country.   Ok, I'm way over myself now. I'm not good with expressing serious emotions in words. So I'll drop it at that. I might end up saying something I might take back later on.   I miss my honey. Love you so much!

       It was cold last night as I tucked myself to bed. Looking for a spot on my new boudoir, it was pretty annoying how in a matter of three months (almost) I've grown so used to having my honey by my side and somehow longing for him to be with me everytime I close my eyes. Having him there, hearing him breathe is just one of the sounds I can listen to forever.   On other stuff, my thumb got less sore from last night's bowling tourney. Our team was really off. Our scores were too low for even our own good. We dropped from 2nd place in the standings to maybe 4th or 5th out of 5 teams. Talk about a lot of catching up to do. We really need to increase our game mucho fast! I'm practicing this Sunday at Alabang Town Center. Hopefully get my rhythm back. I'm really getting annoyed with how I played the official games last night. Major bummer.   Then again, another weird discovery. My friend who has the blog I was telling you about, turns out he uses the expression "bugger" too. With me, I got that expression from when I was back in Ireland for an assignment and have been using it since. That and "shite" which I find pretty subtle as compared to using "shit". Weird, weird, weird.   Just had lunch. I need my caffeine. I want doughnuts. I feel like eating at CPK (have I told you my honey doesn't like CPK... he finds their food too sweet). I'll prolly just update my site with more pics and maybe and extra page.   Toodles!

       Sometimes doing this whole blog thing freaks me out. For instance, this morning I was thinking of what to post and it came about that I wanted to discuss what me and my honey talked about a few nights ago (or was it last night?), that I should post more detailed stuff. Then I get to read a friend's blog that absolutely gives you great details of things that have happened in the past 24 hours or so and I admire him for doing that.   When I see myself posting stuff about me, I feel like I'm on "The Real World" where people can actually get a glimpse of my life and perhaps that's really the purpose of this blog. Is so that there's a medium for mild perversion (i.e. exhibitionism). Although I won't result to much discussion on that topic, I kinda like being "read about". It adds to the thrill of living. When other people know you and read about you while you not knowing that the person beside you in a queue for getting tickets at the movies already knows part of you because he or she has read about you... err... read you!  We're playing bowling later and hopefully my average would climb up. Set up a few things for my friend's mini slumber party in a couple of weeks. Haven't told my honey yet as my friend just called me about it earlier. Honey, if you are reading this, the party's in two weeks... that week when you and your folks are out. It's just going to be an overnight thing at a hotel in Manila (Saturday-Sunday).   Funny how people miss loved ones so quickly... same as my friend who's with own honey, I miss MY honey too. We just saw each other last night but somehow, our clinginess never became too extreme. It was just right. It would always be in the right amounts.   I'm gonna de-stress before my conference call with the folks in Ireland. Argh... work is so so. Laterz.

       Went to the place where they have the model units for this new condominium that will be built in the heart of Makati.  urlLink One Legazpi Park . Amazing. That's all I could say. I so wanted the two bedroom unit but it's too expensive for me. Maybe I'll just settle for the studio type first. That's if I get the money. Ha ha ha. At the rate I'm going now, I don't think I'll be able to finance that kind of "purchase" unless of course I win the lottery.   On other things, my friend from Cali just arrived last Sunday morning and things will be hectic for him for the next month. He's here on vacation since school's out in the U.S. He works for a school somewhere near San Francisco. I might meet up with him tonight just to catch up on things and see how he's doing.   I feel good so far. Already had my... ehem... grande mocha frapuccino blended with whip, with power. He he he. I love the fact that the guys at the nearby Starbucks already know me so well that all I have to do is get my P120 (approx $2.50) and wait for them to call my name so I could get my drink. They know that I like the ice crushed good, and that I want the dome cover and not the flat one. Comforting.

       Fell in a bit of a slump yesterday. Thought about how big of a responsibility it is to support a family. Although I don't support them that much, the fact that I am the one they rely on for most of the expenses outside of the usual shit like utilities and food makes it really stressful for me sometimes.   But it is during these down times I feel so lucky to have someone to be there for me. My shock absorber. As Carrie would put it, my zip drive (someone who can back me up).  My honey threw me a question... Do I consider our relationship as added pressure or as a solace?   I told him it's both. Sometimes the pressure is there when you know you have to think of someone first before deciding on certain things. Especially things which will affect both of you. Mostly though, it's a solace for me. I know I can run to my honey for strength when I have no more left in me to carry on at that exact moment. Which got me thinking, was Carrie right about being dependent on your boyfriend. I believe that really is part of it. When you start trusting each other, the tendency is to seek each others' help. That's what relationships are all about. Another tendency is to depend on them as you have during those times when your loved one extends you their shoulder, their hand, their warm lips. It's more like how would I cope without my honey.   I'm such a cry baby. I'm too in tune with my tear glands. It's like I have them on speed dial or something. The moment I get all sad or depressed, I feel like I can easily access my tears so I could shed the hurt, or bad feelings away. It feels great though that instead of kleenex, I have my honey's hands to wipe away my tears. I always love it when I feel him touch my cheeks in a mild brush just to gently remove the tears off my face. How he puts my head on his left shoulder in a gesture that only someone who loves you can show.   I love you honey. Thanks for being there always.

       I'm happy this week. Loads of people ended up listening to "Wherever You Will Go" the past days. I got tons of congratulatory messages. Emails from Hard Rock about our performance. It made me feel good. They thought the group was a professional band. :) Coolness!  Work's been great. I was assigned to create the process for this upcoming effort the firm will have to adhere to. I also learned that our workcell would be moving to the 2nd Floor of the building. (YEY!) This is good because it would mean we don't have to wait for the crummy elevators this 20++ year old building has everytime we get back from a Starbucks break or lunch at the nearby resto. I went with our manager to check out our location and it seemed good. I'm so happy that there's a possibility of me getting my very own Herman Miller chair. After a year of waiting. (I used to have one when I got assigned to both Chicago and Dublin)  Going home early today. Need some rest. Real rest. I miss by honey. I'm horny. hmmmm... That's basically it. My throat's still sore. It's still painful to swallow. Tough! Can't go down on anyone. (kidding!)  By the way, I caught the season finale for Sex and the City (season 4). It was through divine providence that I actually got to see it. I was about to hit the sack so I turned on the TV just so my room would have some light. Lo and behold, HBO, the theme song of the show, sounds like my mobile's ringing tone. Yee haw... :) Fab ending. Cute one too. Too bad I never got to see the episode where Aidan actually proposes to Carrie. Argh. Next time I'll see if I have time to talk about Aidan. Why I love his character. But now, I'm just going back to work. Back to the daily grind.

       What a weekend... (you can say that again) ok... what a weekend!  Friday was amazing. Hard Rock performance gave me the most incredible high. Went to the venue early to check on the set and lights (I was assigned to them, God knows why). Things were ok. Had a quick check of the sounds for the band. It was a quick check, sang a stanza from "No Such Thing" (John Mayer).   fast forward...  The event started promptly and smoothly. An hour into the program I found myself getting up on stage with the band to set up for the first of two segments we're performing in. It was John Mayer time. Wearing the shirt my friend Krist gave me (which a lot of friends said screamed John Mayer) I sat on a stool, held the microphone which was on a stand, and signaled the group to give the first few beats. Then we started. The song ("No Such Thing") flew by so fast I didn't even notice it was going to end in a couple or more measures. Made a semi-spiel and proceeded with "Back to You" which was also a good rendition (I must say).  Thirty minutes later... the second segment... it was what we called "Back to Back to Back" (getting the inspiration from SOP's segment where they have all the divas and divos? perform different songs). I did back up vocals for several songs... "Power of Two", "Sunshine" (by Gabrielle), and "Someday We'll Know". I was last to perform after the four girls finished their songs. I did "Wherever You Will Go". I was so glad I did a costume change. I was in my Banana Republic Tomato long sleeved poplin shirt. So out dated. (Bought it a million seasons ago when I was in SF)... anyway... Started the first few lines... I was hooked to the song. I felt each and every word. The last lines were just blasting... Hitting note after note... higher and higher... It was amazing. I belted the last few notes. Man was that a rush. And I brought the house down. It was amazing!  Saturday was quite interesting. Went out with my honey. Drove to Makati to catch the poetry reading session at Powerbooks after learning about it from a friend, Carl. Saw Nelz, but didn't get to see Ian. I was anxious to catch the whole thing but when I noticed the time, it was past 6:30PM and we had to catch Triple X at Glorietta 4. I felt bad me and my honey couldn't stay for the session. We said toodles to the guys and headed off. Bought tickets and grabbed a quick bite. Lined up for the movie, and boy was it a queue. Finished the movie and thought of walking back to the car. I was tired. My honey wanted to spend more time together. I had not guts telling him I was tired so I made an excuse of it being late and all. Things happened. Cinematic drama ensued. Like what I said my honey, all that was needed was rain and it would've been a cool scene for a movie. We didn't talk much until I brought him home. It was a pretty bad "fight". Worse of all, I didn't allow him to give me a kiss goodnight.   After I dropped him off and drove home, I wasn't able to hold back, I cried. I cried so much I had to stop for fear of getting into an accident. It was mostly because I feel bad that that had to happen between us. If only I could go back in time to immediately say what I really wanted to say. It would've been better on both of us. But luckily, I got home in one piece.  Sunday was a bore. Couldn't resist the urge to text my honey. I had to know how he was doing. I couldn't sleep. When I heard the phone ring, I knew it was him. I heard his voice. I almost broke down. I tried to keep my tears again but they were too powerful to hold back. I missed my honey then. I was just so happy to hear his voice and know that he's on the other side of the phone line. We were able to patch things up. Apologies were given and accepted. New thing learned. We vowed to improve ourselves. We love each other more. I realized how much I love him. I love him so much that hurting him isn't even an option for me.   I'm good. Things are good. I hope my week is good. :)

       Whew... just finished with band practice. Tomorrow's the day. I get to perform at the Hard Rock Cafe. Yahoooooo!!!!  I'm singing John Mayer's "Back to You" and "No Such Thing", and The Calling's "Wherever You Will Go". I'm soooooo excited. I'm still thinking if I should sing the John Mayer songs seated on a stool or not. What do you think? Hmmm... I'm also debating with myself on what I should wear for the John Mayer songs, plain shirt (tomato colored) or striped long sleeved shirt folded to half the sleeve's length, a la John Mayer's CD cover.   Well toodles. Good luck to me tomorrow.

       Quite interesting... for some reason, the name Caselyn Francisco entered my mind while I was eating my mom's Chicken Caldreta (it's chicken in tomato sauce, with peas, potatos and carrots... with some herbs and spices... amazing stuff). So what I did was searched the internet... lo and behold... Caselyn is still making waves in the Netherlands and this time as Joanne in the Jonathan Larson masterpiece, "RENT". Here's a review I got from gay-news.com  "...Caselyn Francisco and Ellis Van Laarhoven are wonderful in every aspect as the lesbian couple Joanne and Maureen. Of the three central relationships, they are the only ones who manage to create a sense of intimacy. You believe that they are, in fact, lovers. When they sing "Take Me Or Leave Me", the stage literally comes alive with sensuality. "  Way to go girl. Hope she comes to the Philippines one of these days. I'm just dying to hear how she sings now. :)

       Got a quote from a friend today... I thought it was worth posting...  "Disce quasi semper victurus; vive quasi cras moriturus" (learn as if you were going to live forever... live as if you were going to die tomorrow) - got it from the OTEP site.  Amazing huh?!   I have just started absorbing it. I feel as if it has more meaning than what a person would initially think when they hear or read that quote.

       Memories of the past few days...  An early morning surprise will always be cherished as long as I live. A rose, so white and so pure, offered as a token of love. Timeless. Priceless. I say thank you.   Last week was chaotic, balance was unattainable. Constant pressure building. I needed a release. I found it.  Caught my former choir's homecoming concert at DLSU. Amazing how much emotion this group can show. I was sincerely touched. I'm going to miss the faces of these people who have been with the group for more than three years. I have been with them, once, in Europe. To them, I bid them luck in all their undertakings now that they are no longer with the choir. I'll see them around. I'm sure we'll always be in touch.  Thanks for the music. Glorieux De La Salle!  Four months and I didn't even blink. It has been that long. Amazing how fast time would fly when people are in love... yuck, that' so cliche. But it's true. Caught Lillo & Stitch and liked it a lot. It was really fun to watch. Wish we'd have one of those food trips one of these days. A bucket of original recipe KFC (ok, you can have the hot & crispy), super supreme pizza from either yellow cab or domino's, double dutch ice creme from Selecta, and I'll have my rootbeer, you can have your lemonade. :) Yum yum.

       Blank space in my future... pretty redundant huh... but that's all I see now. Not really because all my dreams or hopes got stolen by some life changing event (or something to that effect) but it's mostly because I feel as if I'm in a crossroad lately. Signs have been evident to me and it has been harder and harder to not take notice.   But like what Miranda said in an SATC episode ".. we could analyze this (tape) for years and never know. I mean... they still don't know who killed Kennedy." Which brings me to the point that indeed, overanalysis of things in one's life leads to much pressure. Pressure that would eventually lead to a more difficult job for my future facial mask. (read: wrinkles are not my thing, especially when they're on me)  I say blah! to the signs... take things in stride and go through life with poise.   On a more personal message: honey, thanks so much for always being there. It's going to be tough but I know it will just be a walk in the park. :) I love you!

        from the  urlLink Jealousy Test .   Thank God!   Results of the Jealousy Test General Index  Your score = 17     What does your score mean? Most people who are involved in an important relationship carry a certain amount of fear and feel threatened by the possibility of being displaced and losing a partner to someone else. After all, these things happen, and when they do, it is usually very painful. Very few people display a blatant lack of jealousy. In your case, the lack is not blatant. Nevertheless, you appear to be a person in whom jealousy can be evoked but who does not live in a permanent state of fear of losing the loved one. If you were honest with yourself while taking the test, this means that you are secure, strong, independent and rational enough to perceive the possibility of losing your partner to someone else not extremely threatening. That does not mean that you do not care; you would certainly be sad or crushed as anybody else. However, you know that if it ever happens, you will survive with your self-esteem intact, with your head up and with dignity. You realize that even though you might love your partner very much, s/he is not the only compatible creature on earth, and that you would eventually find happiness with someone else. Such feelings give you a sense of security and the strength to trust, and allow you to be comfortable in the relationship. That, in turn, boosts the chances of a lasting and fulfilling relationship. See the subscores below for a more detailed analysis.   Jealousy and your emotions/thinking patterns Your score = 18    At both the emotional and cognitive level, you seem to be relatively in control. Your test score shows that when it comes to trusting your partner, you are a downright pragmatic. You do not expect too much, nor do you expect too little. You are capable of dealing with the fact that your partner interacts with people s/he might find physically or spiritually attractive. You don't, however, get upset about minor things.   Building up your level of trust would enable you to feel more secure and in control. You could avoid feeling anxious, hurt and betrayed because of things that do not warrant such strong emotions. This would result in a much stronger, healthier relationship both for you and your partner.   Jealous behavior Your score = 14    You seem to do the right thing in many situations, but often you do not. It is true that sometimes a little bit of jealousy can put a spark into a relationship. However, it is a dangerous weapon that might easily be used against you. As such, you had better keep it under control.   From the viewpoint of a partner, jealousy is generally very unbecoming. More often than not, it can spoil the relationship to the point of a breakup. Ironically, jealousy, which originates in the fear of losing your mate, might result in exactly that.   It is certainly hard to behave as a perfect gentleman/lady when you are burning inside. However, the pain will eventually subside if you decide to work on it. You can learn to control jealous behavior through detecting the first signs and making a conscious decision not to take the shortcut to your regular pattern. With some training, you will be able to recognize and block the behavior before it starts. However, that alone will not do it. You need to address the underlying insecurity, which most likely comes from a low self-esteem. When you stop feeling and behaving as if your mate was doing you a favor by being with you, you will grow - in your own eyes, and your partner's probably too. If your mate thrives on your jealousy, then it is a pretty safe guess that s/he has a problem that needs to be addressed and that your relationship has an unhealthy element.   Irrational jealousy Your score = 13    While you do not get extremely upset about innocent circumstances, you do sometimes overreact to harmless situations. You may recognize that you are not always being entirely rational, but you have an emotional reaction nonetheless. If you have troubles distinguishing innocent actions from potential betrayal, try to put yourself in the shoes of a bystander, someone looking in on the situation. Many situations will not appear as threatening when you are not the one directly involved. Try to keep that perspective when you reassess the situation. I can assure you that it will pay off in the improvement of your love life.   Dependency issues Your score = 8    You do not seem to have any dependence problems. You feel you are an individual separate from your partner, and you do not depend solely on him/her for gratification of all your needs. That is very healthy.   Self-esteem issues Your score = 12    It appears that you do not have any serious self-esteem problems, at least not when your love life is concerned.   Control issues Number of endorsed controlling statements:  1    You appear to display controlling behavior to some degree. You might be controlling in different ways: by limiting your partner from a position of strength (physical or psychological) or from a position of weakness in a passive aggressive way. In your case, the problem is not extremely serious, but it can be resented by your partner anyway. You should take a critical look at yourself and do something about it.

       Talking to myself... has it ever occured to you what you have gotten yourself into. Your life is suddenly co-dependent with your boyfriend. That's not how it's supposed to be. A person should always be independent no matter what. One's life should never be dissected in a way that a part of you will be dependent on something, or someone, ever!  It's a beginning, that's why you are afraid, confused, pissed. Your boyfriend is less available than usual. Things can't be the same. Deal with it. Whatever is going to happen will test your relationship.   Me talking... it's just so fucking stupid to see things the way I'm seeing them. Not being able to move on with the relationship in a better way (meaning make each other more available) because of a friggin' membership. Fuck this. And what I do not like about this whole thing is the fact that I was not thought of in the entire time of the decision process, if I was, I wasn't a major factor in it. I was an obligation that can be dealt with later on after the decision has been made.   Sometimes I think he's doing it out of spite. Spite from the fact that lately I have been less available. So it seems as if he's turning the tables. I really hope it's not what I think it is. Plus what's bugging me is this whole Saturday thing my guy had with this guy who I have no other info about except that he's a friend of an "ex-date" who's interested in things my boyfriend is interested in as well. Not even getting word about what they were up to except for a message that he was already on his way home at like 9PM. I know I'm not supposed to be thinking of other things aside from the fact that he's out with a guy I barely even know (mind you ... just one guy).  Talking to myself again... and what of you going out with other people later than 9PM?  ... uhm, those people are friends of mine and God knows I never end up with friends (meaning, friends I have considered as if they were my brothers or "sisters"). If it were with non-close friends I would be with office folks... (note, plural form folks... which doesn't mean I have orgies with them)  I'm just a wreck today. I thought I was on top of things last night but it's such a hard thing to deal with. He can say sorry but what does that give me. The best and most mature thing to do is to try it out first before I pass judgement on our relationship, that it won't work. I'm really for seeing how it works out. But honestly, I don't know how... yet.  ... you'll eventually know what to do. Things will just happen, you have no control of them so they will just happen. There's no harm in hoping, hoping that they will get better.  P.S. Now I'm concerned that I have a psychological disorder... I am schizoprenic... augh!!!

       What a day... first my journal almost got kapoot! Then I found out my work got deleted. I had to redo this module from scratch. It was actually quite tough as the last time I completed the code was more than a month ago and there are certain things which I can't really store for long in my brain. Good thing I was able to get some help to complete the module.   I have to finish two more tomorrow. I have to finish them! Can't wait for my friend's wedding this Saturday. I'll probably get a haircut soon. We'll see. Got to go. I have to meet up with a friend at the Alabang Town Center. I'm gonna be her stylist for the night. Ha ha ha!

       Saw this at a website I chanced upon. It mentions things a boyfriend or girlfriend should do... not sure if this is too ideal of a scenario...  [1] Call the next day  [2] Always laugh at his jokes [3] Tell him (truthfully) that you can't wait to see him again [4] Offer  a backrub, without asking for one in return  [5] Call him just to say you were thinking about her [6] Bring him a teddy bear and chicken soup when he is sick  [7] Write him a poem  [8] Slow dance with him(not only on a dance floor) [9] Bring him flowers for no reason [10] Send him a (handwritten) letter just to say hello  [11] Always remember your anniversaries and bring him something sweet [12] Kiss him in the middle of a sentence [13] Take him for a walk at sunset and stay to look up at the stars  [14] Tell him something about you that no one else knows  [15] Remind him that you still think he is cute [16] Take a bubble bath together [17] Watch a sappy movie with him [18] Surprise him with a candlelight dinner [19] Never stop trying to impress him [20] Tell him you love him and mean it  [21] Never forget how much he means to you  [22] Give him great big hugs for no reason.  I know... I edited the thing just so that it applies to me... hehehehehe... I'm not giving hints... just thought that this list was cute. :)

       Had so many thoughts last night and I don't know where to begin. Caught the last few minutes of Buffy but was really more excited with catching Charmed. I wasn't disappointed.   I loved the whole plot of the ability to change one's present by asking the future. It's something I have constantly thought of. Me wondering where I'd be in X no. of years. What to do in case I end up being poor and lonely or something like that. Back to Charmed, it's good to see Paige is getting the hang of her orbing thing. I can't wait till these girls get really uber powerful. :)  Then it was off to chatting with my honey. We had a mini discussion on how we are different when it comes to dealing with people for the first time. He said that he would want to get to know a person through "prying". (of course I'm sure he didn't mean for it to sound so negative) I, on the other hand, would listen to people converse (if I'm in a group). I want to get to know how people think, how their minds work. I get to know about that by listening to them speak. What words they use. What gestures they make (if they even make gestures... usually they'd be gay if they do hehehehe).  We proceeded to him asking me why I sing. At first I thought it was a simple question with a simple answer. But when I thought about it later on, it was so much more than that... it was as if I was asked why I breathe. I sing because it is in my nature. I was born with it. It is me. It's not just a talent I was fortunate enough to have, it is me. I derive pleasure from hearing my voice when I hit long lines from a Mendelssohn piece or doing runs from Handel's Messiah. I am enthralled at how people gain much satisfaction from hearing me sing. I like it when I entertain people.   I got to watch Oprah last night and was surprised that Cher was the guest. I was struck with the words she uttered. She said something about what she feels and what she likes about her job... her life. She said something like, she enjoys performing in front of people because she feels like she's a minister in front of her audience, her flock. She gets to be in that moment where she can feel every emotion from each audience member. She's able to impart feelings of comfort through her songs to her audience. And then I thought, that's exactly what it is. It's the ability to be in the moment and know that you have touched someone's life or a group of lives. You have shown the audience emotions through song/s.

       Arrived an hour early, killed time by thinking of how I was going to attack that initial G note.. or was that an A flat. God knows. Anyway, went around the GSIS building to get me some water. Got back to the audition venue with a bottle of mineral water on one hand and bag, umbrella and music sheet on the other. I was filled with confidence at that moment.   Things just went by so fast and what do you know, I'm already on stage, about to start singing. I hit the first note of my song with a bit of strain but I knew I wasn't flat. I was about to hit a high B until a voice from the panel's section said "can we have him do a range check". I'm like "what the hell is he talking about?" What range check? I'm a friggin' tenor 1! Did a three scales and hit the notes exactly as they were hit on the piano. And then I hear a "thank you... " and I was a bit crushed. Questions came to my head... what did I do wrong? is my voice not fit for your friggin' musical? i've performed for royalty god dammit! But then, it subsided, my injured pride healed immediately. I just thought that my voice really wasn't meant for their musical. It's too refined. It came out too molded. Oh well, I'll still try out in other theater productions but will remain a full blooded choir boy. :) Like I said to a friend of mine, I have a feeling my voice ain't Elton John material. It's for Rachmaninov, Tschaikovsky, Poulence, and Penderecki. :)

       Funny thought came to me just now... I want to announce why I think President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is a good president... a la Grade One composition:  I think she's a good president because...  ... she's a bitch and she knows it. How many presidents can act the way she does. I love her for it.   ... she does things no sane president would do... that  urlLink MIB Photo  of her and a few cabinet officials was a testament to that.  ... the woman  urlLink surfs . Nuff said.  ... she also goes scuba diving... whatta trip!  She's sometimes an ass... but who isn't? (ok, I know Mother Teresa or Pope John Paul the 2nd could be exceptions)  =)

       What a fun day this has been... woke up early this morning but got out of bed an hour after (try to figure that out)...  My mom gave me a kiss on the forehead with a smile to go with it. I can't remember how much of those I got when I was still little. And how much of those I'd want to get now that I'm an adult.   I asked my dad if he could take me all the way to the office as I have boxes of brownies to carry. He agreed. No questions asked. Drove off to work. Traffic wasn't so bad. It prolly took us 45 mins to get to the office. (I told my dad I had an 8:30AM meeting - which I did). Got to work on time. Second floor... I'm thinking to myself how much I hate birthdays, you always end up tired of saying thank you's.   As I walked inside our office, various colors greeted my eyes, balls of air floating all over. It was amazing. Balloons! I was honestly shocked. As I walked about four meters forward, behind me people were singing "Happy Birthday!" holding bags of stuff from the nearby Starbucks (they know I'm an addict). It was amazing. Fun fun fun!   My officemates gave me a gift... a box of flavored cigars (Coffee Caprichos) and a black leather wallet. 'Twas so cool of them. So now I take back what I said an hour ago... I love birthdays!

       And here I thought a shop in Dublin, Ireland called Knobs and Knockers (a door knob and door knockers store) took the cake for having the weirdest name I've encountered, I come across an actual town called  urlLink Intercourse, PA . Read the link. Quite interesting. Thanks to my blog buddy  urlLink Karlo .  I've been spending two days now on Visual Basic training. It's actually pretty good. Food is not scarce. I'm afraid I'm gaining weight. I need to check soon. Also, this week has been quite tough for me. I need to make do with a few hundred bucks just to get by. I never talked about my sky-rocketing credit card bills and I don't intend to. Let's just say, I could've gotten myself tickets to Europe for two with what I have to pay now. Oh well.   Argh! I need to check if Sex and the City is showing tonight. I doubt it though. But who knows. :)

       Weekend was fine. Friday night was a blast. Saturday was cool. Sunday fantabulous :)  Didn't even get drunk on the four glasses of gin and pomelo, Friday night (which lasted till 5ish in the morning of the next day. Talked about tons of stuff with friends. All 20 of us together at friend's house. Chatted mostly about our past glory. It's so much fun to reminisce.   Saw The Bourne Identity and I really think Matt Damon is just so sexy. The pic was fine. A bit like Art of War by Wesley Snipes but Matt's presence in the film was just yummy for me. Wished there was at least one hot scene with him and hmmm... well, just him.   Had much fun with my honey the same night. Nah, won't tell the details. Might be too graphic for my own good. Might even end up with a stiffie... ha ha ha!  Last night, issue filled. Hillarious wise cracks. Great company. 40 friends in a house. What can you expect. Always love it when these people get together. There's never a dull moment. I even had a chance to participate in a taste test of coffee where I had to rate 6 different brands of coffee. I knew I was into gourmet coffee. I gave it a 7 out of a possible 10. Starbucks and Seattle's Best came next at 6 for each and the others just lagged behind. Although I was shocked at the local brew (Batangas' Kapeng Barako - I honestly don't know the English translation), it tasted pretty good. It probably needed more coffee. The brew wasn't rich enough.   Speaking of coffee. My mom told me French-pressed coffee is still the best. Darn, the French do know how to live life.

       Before you start reading, note that the contents below were written a year ago.    On 9/11   This is an email I sent a cousin of mine in the U.S. after he asked me for my opinion about a certain article written by this Canadian. Contained in the email were comments by a friend here in the Philippines and my cousin's reactions to his comments and then my reactions to my cousin's comments. (confusing? he he he)    - this was written five days after the incident occured   "... I saw it(WTC Tragedy) happen as it was being shown on CNN the moment it occured.  The utter shock of seeing two of the landmarks of American supremacy being "massacred" was completely unbearable. Knowing how much American pride I have actually absorbed with my short stay in the US, I was really touched and disturbed.  With all the criticisms I've been hearing with in the past few days from different mediums, I really don't know how to react to the inhuman actions set forth on US soil.  I feel for the American people, all the hardships America has been through, trempled on by evil acts of terrorism. It definitely is an act against everything the democratic world stands for.   Although I believe that there is a duality in everyone in this world because of the attacks, in a macrocosm, the anti-America and the pro-America.  I'm a Filipino, I believe I can say that I am pro-America.   America, so to speak, holds everything I believe in, maybe not all. It saddens me to think that there are elements in our modern world who still live and would die for terrorism. The plans of these terrorists and what they actually did holds much symbolism. The World Trade Center... as it is what it means... WORLD TRADE CENTER... the place for everyone to hold their commercial activities. The attack on this structure symbolizes the attack on the World. The Pentagon, being the stronghold of American(and world) intelligence and military power... same goes.  These are structures that symbolize not only America but the free world. Any attack symbolize an attack on us, the believers of a free world.    As my mom would say it, "if America can be attacked like this, anybody or any country can be attacked as well"... It strikes fear on everyone here in the Philippines. With the support of the Philippine government to the US Military and US Government by giving open access to both former US Bases(Clark and Subic) to US Military forces, I believe that says it all and that causes alarm to all Filipinos all over the world. Even if it shows how much we are supportive of the US Government, it makes us a target as well.  A developing nation which has issues of its own will now be facing larger and more complicated issues. We have, since the beginning of the 20th Century, bowed down to America.  As for the points my friend had raised, I do believe they were harsh and probably not contemplated on. He does believe in what America stands for in the world but there are just things from personal experience and probably his principles that can't be taken away, maybe for him.    My friend:  did america stop capitalising on third world people's money? NO.    My cousin:  This is true. It's called capitalism. You want to make money, right? That's why you expand your markets. Is there anything inherently wrong with that? I don't think so. If people are willing to spend their money on a product, then why not? It's called freedom of choice.    Me:  Capitalism, is just that... capitalism. There is, however, difference in good and bad capitalism. Making money at the expense of other people's loss can be called bad capitalism.  Capitalism which introduces new technology and processes to an outsource company is obviously good capitalism.    ------------------   My friend:  did the americans close down their sweatshops in africa, india, bangladesh,and the philippines? NO.    My cousin:  While I personally despise sweatshops and oppose them, what happens to these workers when they lose their jobs? Can they easily find employment elsewhere?    Me:  It's not a matter of losing their jobs whence these "sweatshops" close down, its a matter of creating a decent enough working environment for these so called "employees".  There are model US Firms which I definitely commend ,in exempli; Intel and FedEx, but there are others that are just despicable.   -------------------   My friend:  did they prostitute the young filipina? YES.    My cousin:  Or rather, did the young Filipina prostitute herself? Hey, prostitution exists EVERYWHERE. Hence, it's called the world's oldest profession. So basically, are you saying that without the US, there would be no Filipina prostitutes? I beg to differ.   Me:  SOME people say that demand and supply are co-dependent, i beg to disagree... demand controls supply... products are not always supported and/or demanded... The "hospitality industry" could not have been the way it was in the days of Clark and Subic had there been no bases in Angeles(Clark-Pampanga) and Olongapo(Subic-Zambales). If demand is low obviously supply would be low as well... this definitely doesn't mean that w/o the US there'd be no Filipina prostitutes.  -------------------   My friend:  did they really bring peace to the world with their diplomatic policies? NO. it's becuase their policy is based on money and self gain. Not on true altruistic intentions.    My cousin:  I don't think you will ever have world peace. Ain't gonna happen. Since the beginning of time, ain't never had no peace! But let's see, the US is always there to offer humanitarian aid where it is needed - and where do most countries go to when they need help. Hmmm.   Me:  I believe both points are actually reasonable to me... I don't believe in World Peace but I'm hopeful for it.  Regarding countries asking for US assistance...okay okay help... I believe the US can't really say no... without us(the developing countries) the US would also suffer... without the US we suffer... bygones...   ------------------   My friend:  DO you think they were really fighting for human rights out there?! That's one big BULL.    My cousin:  I disagree. The US has a strong human rights policy in general. It's not perfect but the US has always supported democracy and the freedoms associated with it.   Me:  Hate crimes included? No pun inteded... I guess that's where the "not perfect" comes in... it is, after all, an imperfect world...  -------------------   My cousin:  And were it not for the US, we probably would not be alive today. The US saved the Philippines during World War 2.    Me:  we weren't saved... the US only "protected" what was theirs... the only reason the Philippines was attacked so much was because it was a U.S. Commonwealth then... Singapore was attacked because it was a British Commonwealth.. same goes for Malaysia and Indonesia(Dutch) and Vietnam(French).... The whole deal on US Philippine history is one that will constantly be debated for generations of Filipinos for as long as there is a Philippines and US...  Mark Twain(Samuel Clemens) once wrote about the way the US was meddling with the growth of the Philippines after the Spanish American War (which was obviously started by the Spaniards) and that the US should've left the Philippines alone after reclaiming it from Spain by winning the war and signing the Treaty of Paris. The way history tells it, the Philippines was supposed to have been let go but it wasn't to be so. Many laws and pacts signed by our "owners" which have abused the Philippines in terms of natural resources and the Filipino people... but of course they say that "that was then"...   *sigh*... the Philippines has been and will probably always be, a country of brown Americans... no matter what we say or do... I'm being true.  As you might have noticed there seems to be confusion with my sentiments for the US... wherein I don't agree with everything the US has done throughout history or will be doing in the future... I will always be pro-America, for I believe in Truth, Freedom, Liberty, and above all, Love of Country!   My heart goes out to those people who lost their loved ones. I pray for the souls of your departed. May they have peace.

       I'm back. That was a good and quick recovery. Whew... Again, I'll see if I can muster the courage to spill the beans on what happened but I don't know if I can yet. I'm trying to get over it until now. I also don't know if it's better if I keep it to myself. But what's the point of having a journal if I can't say everything. I'll still have to wait for the right time.   I was surfing the SATC website and got this phrase from there. "Why do we only believe the negative things people say about us." Ain't that funny, coz it's true. Wish people would be more trusting with the good things people say about them. Believe in those more. It might surprise them, they'll feel better about themselves.   Weekend awaits. It's going to be bland, I just have this feeling it will. I don't know why. I'm thinking where I can get money to spend. Hmmm... Happy weekend to me! :)

       Why now!? Why face something I had no intentions of facing!? How could it happen to me!?   I don't think it wise for me to continue this journal. Until the time I feel better or at least gain the trust I have for people, then I will make it a point to gain my enthusiasm for writing, but now, I just want to be seek refuge from what just happened.   Hope to be back.

       Employee satisfaction is a big deal in the company I work for. They invest so much on coming up with surveys and evaluation of how they are doing when it comes to making the workplace fun and less stressful. They have initiatives like focus group discussions to get input from employees of how the firm is currently dealing with its people.  I have a few things to say but did not get a chance to have them pointed out during one of the focus group discussions I participated in. Just recently, we received information and confirmation of salary increases. I'm relieved to know that we still got an increase even though the market was really bad. What I'm not liking right now is the blatant aesthetic projects the company is undergoing which I know cost much money.  There's this new area in the office which could be an interior designer's masterpiece. In all fairness, the look is fab and really impressive, Herman Miller chairs all over, a possibility of Philippe Starck chairs and tables as well. I love the furniture, but not the price. For a company that's trying to lessen their costs by laying off people or downsizing, they sure know how to buy expensive furniture. The Herman Miller chair alone costs $600 - $850, and there are dozens of them. There is a set of chairs that cost about $2000. For me that's quite expensive. What I don't like about this whole thing is the company openly showing that they can spend millions on furniture, image, etc. but not on its people. WEIRD!!!!

       New of bomb threats all over Manila looms this Friday night. Doesn't bother me at all. We never made news like that into such a big deal. I mean when did Filipinos make anything a big deal. Ah... when Judy Ann split up with some budding young actor or when Rico Yan died (God rest his soul!). But bomb threats never shake us. I bet you all them fabulous peeps are still going to be in Malate or Eastwood... hell even Rockwell. Bomb threats aren't made into a big deal.   Even during a time when it should be made into a big deal, especially when just yesterday a few bomb explosions happened south of the county (in Zamboanga), you'd think people would be a tad scared of staying out late. It is because we don't take these threats into such a big deal.   We live life to its fullest by the minute. Death is temporary because life after death is eternal. Oh well, off to the resto and have me some fondue! :) mmmmmmm....

       Caught the first episode of "Six Feet Under" last Saturday on HBO. I thought it was a really good series. Cool story line (based on the initial show). Good cast. I love the fact that there's a gay character in the story.   General storyline of the show is there are two brothers who ended up inheriting their deceased father's business, a funeral home. One of the brothers never wanted the whole idea earning a living from the dead just coz he's grossed out by it, while the other, took on much responsibility of managing the business. Their mother having a fling with some guy, and their teenage sister getting it on with this cute guy (in an Eminem-ish kinda way).  Would love to catch the new Hannibal film, "Red Dragon". I dig the dark atmosphere of the Hannibal Lecter (so says my honey) movies... I also have a crush on  urlLink Edward Norton , he looks like my ex (sorry honey... but know that I don't love my ex anymore). I don't know, I just ended up liking Edward Norton, especially in "Primal Fear". Really cool actor. :)

       Thanks to a blog acquaintance of mine, I found something quite interesting to post. The following questions were taken from  urlLink trixy's blog .   On Shoes   1. What size shoe do you wear? 9 to 10 weird... I know  2. How many pairs of shoes do you own? I counted them last week... I actually own 20ish pairs of footwear  3. What type of shoe do you prefer (boots, sneakers, pumps, etc.)? hmmm... I came to a conclusion (just a few months ago) that I love sandals. I just like the way they look on my feet, especially after going to the nearby parlor to have my semi-monthly cleaning appointments.    4. Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Why are they your favorite? I bought these camel loafers from Ravel (a shoe store in Dublin, Ireland) for approx $70. I pretty much wear them with almost anything. Jeans, khakis, even shorts as long as I use the belt I bought from Topshop (also in Dublin).   5. What's the most you've spent on one pair of shoes? Easy... I bought my first pair of Bally lace ups for almost $200. Got them at the store on Via Veneto when I was in Rome. It was actually a bargain, I thought, since they usually come up to around $300 if you buy them here in the Philippines.  It may sound weird for a guy to have so much shoes but it's a great weekness of mine. I love shoes. Especially the more interesting ones. Can't wait to get my first Gucci's...

       Browsed through the internet and found an interesting line from  urlLink Sex and the City ...  "some people are settling down, some people are settling and some people refuse to settle for anything less than butterflies."   I realized I'm the latter of the three. I always thought to myself that I deserve someone special. Someone I can be who I am with and just flirt endlessly with. Someone to give me the reason not to look at any other guys anymore. I'm happy that I am settled... for now. I know that I won't be galavanting around town looking for someone else. I'm happy with who I am with.   I know of other people who are just not the settling kind. They end up with people they initially think they're going to love forever but give or take a month, they're back to blessed single-hood. Contentment is bliss. I also believe one can't be content if one does not get what he feels he needs.

       Love's desires...   To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.  To know the pain of too much tenderness.  To be wounded by your own understanding of love;  And to bleed willingly and joyfully.  To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;  To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;  To return home at eventide with gratitude...  (Kahlil Gibran)  Is this what every human being desires for? Love? No matter what people hear about it, is it really worth all the pain and suffering one feels? Is it really what we seek? How much of ourselves is actually given to our loved one? Why am I sounding weird?  For the past (almost) six months, I have loved (and still do) one man. Though times have been rough on both of us, there's a part of me that feels the fulfillment of having someone there to care for and shallow as it may sound, to make love to.   I have lately recalled how it was that me and my boyfriend got together. Fun thoughts, really. I'm more focused on the fact that one would never know what one has until it's gone. I've been to states like that. A simulated parting if you may consider it. It really hurts. It's like I know how bad I'll really feel if I part ways with my honey. If I remember correctly, it crossed my mind twice. Two occassions that could've ended things. One was of my doing, the other was his. But it would seem that on both instances, I ended up appreciating him more. In fact, I appreciate him much more now.   His dad has been sick for almost a month now and I was concerned. Although I have never met or seen his parents before, I somehow have a connection with them. I always make note during times of weird conversation that I shouldn't sound like my boyfriend's mom. I wouldn't want to get the same from him. His dad seems interesting. In a way, he reminds me of my own dad. Sometimes rational, most times really annoying as hell.   I also ended up thinking how it will be if we really reach that stage of having to care of one another. It's scary and yet it excites me. I really don't know when things will become more serious for both of us. Serious meaning, we'll live together. Individual eccentricities, proclivities, idiocyncracies... all too exciting.

       I'm a part of this thread called  urlLink Issues concerning Straight-Natured Gay Guys  and posted a message in response to a couple of messages made to insinuate that being what I am makes me seem self-righteous...   I "uttered"...    On being gay-natured...   Not all gay men exhibit gay qualities and traits (i.e. the stereotype the entire world has linked homosexuality with). Examples of which are being Streisand fanatics, loving Show tunes (for the others, this refers to Broadway music), love for anything artistic, love for classic and romantic literature, and of course, having a fault-less fashion sense.   On straight-natured-ness...   It is possible that a gay man could have no stereotypical "straight" qualities as well as a gay man having not a single trace of "gay" qualities (Jaggy, raise your hand). I for one am not purely straight natured as I exhibit too many gay traits that I could pass for a queen (bwahahahahahaha)... but I also have some "straight" traits that just happen to be things I'm proud of as well. I'm proud of them because they help in defining who I really am.    Declaration of one's straight-natured-ness...   I think I have only declared my "straight-natured-ness" on this thread but people I have contact with (friends, office mates, etc.) don't have labels for me. They see me as who I am and as how they know me.    Empowering faggot-y ole me with my uber macho straight traits...   Hmmm, I love driving. I know a few who can attest to that. I wish I had a Camaro (a yellow one). Sporting activities always give me a rush. I especially like the ones that get generous amounts of adrenalin from your system, i.e. wall climbing, hockey, white water rafting, and so on. Come to think of it, I feel empowered. Not because I have (some) macho traits, but because the activities give me control of things.   Discrimination   Effeminate gay men discriminate as well... they mock their straight natured counterparts because they see them as "self-righteous and egotistic". I think it's just the same. When one uses another person's beliefs, principles, etc. as something to judge that person (negatively or otherwise), it is considered prejudice. When one uses that prejudice to "label" and eventually "discriminate" against a person or group of people... that sucks. But I believe discrimination will never be removed from this planet. For as long as everyone has their own prejudices over anything, it will still be the same. It's all about how one acts on these prejudices that could affect other people and eventually lead to something good or bad.

        What's wrong with not feeling Chinese   At a swimming gimmick at the nearby country club, me and friends were talking about individual features. I mentioned that I don't seem to think I look Chinese even though I am 7/8th Chinese. Obviously, they laughed. They said I so look Chinese it's not even funny. I honestly never saw myself as having a definitive look, meaning, if someone sees me, they'd initially think I'm Chinese. Not true.   I went into a semi-monologue about how many times it has occured that I have been mistaken for being either Latino or Eurasian. (hence the phrase... "... I am Eurasian..." came to being which I'll talk about later). I would always end up being talked to in Spanish or some even speak Portuguese to me. They would be amazed to find out that I am actually Asian (well, Eurasian... hehehehe).   What the hell do I mean when I say I am Eurasian... I have descended from Euro stock, more specifically British (my grandfather is mixed Chinese-British and was from Hongkong) and Spanish (my grandmother's great grand father was apparently a Spanish friar). Those Euro genes I got from my mother... hence, I almost declared to the entire pool (with other kids, and parents around) that I actually am Eurasian. Obviously, I just announced it to my friends.  No perks really, it just adds some character to my profile. But seriously, how Chinese do look... really? FUCK!

       Words that profess love always get to me... argh!... I'm such a sap!  "What have you done to me? I'm so in love with you right now. I don't think I can let you go. I don't want to share you either. I love you so much it hurts..." - this from a guy who wasn't always so emotional when it comes to the yucky love stuff... it counts a lot!  I love him with all my heart.   Christmas just went by so quickly. My group performed at the Manila Peninsula which is equivalent to The Plaza of Manhattan. We basically sang carols and pop songs to the delighted crowd. Made me feel all good inside to know that we were able to entertain the people who watched us perform.   With the three nights that we sang our hearts out to the guests of the hotel, my honey wasn't able to see or hear us. He was unavailable. He felt bad that he couldn't devote much time for me the past few days. I understand. Commitments can't be easily dissed. They are kept. I would just want him to know that for as long as I know that if he could go, he would've, then I'm content. Intentions have plus points too.   He gave me a bottle of Clinique Happy... and told me that he can stay over at my place (note: I still live with my parents which is pretty common here in the Philippines given that I'm still 24). I actually think that the staying over at my place thingie was better than the perfume, but who am I to complain when receiving gifts, I love gifts.   His  urlLink blog  talks about some things which happened the last few days which I really don't want to talk about much. Maybe sometime soon. I do however love the fact that the outcome of it all is that we both ended up loving each other more.   I miss having a bialy and coffee with him at this cafe where we had breakfast the day before Christmas. I love the fact that my mom acknowledges him as my boyfriend and that I don't have to "hide" his existence. He's legit! My mom's starting to become a flame dame... she'd make such queer comments that would get me frozen. My mom's cool and I love her.   Today's been freakishly busy for me. Tons of backlog with work. I hate it. Annoying subordinates. They take their vacations before completing their tasks. I swear to God. I wish they'd be more considerate sometimes. *sigh* Well, on a lighter note, my friends and I are meeting up with a friend who entered the brotherhood for La Sallian Brothers (FSC). He's been there for more than a year and I would think that during the holiday season, they would get time to spend with their families meaning time to go out as well. I hope he's doing great. I'll catch up with him and the other at Greenbelt Mall in half an hour. I'm suddenly craving for food from MYLK (My Little Kitchen). Oh wellz... :)

       It's been eight months with  urlLink Jagard  and I think I'm loving him more now than ever before. Mostly because of the fact that I know him more now. I've seen how he is. We've gone through much the past few months. Of course I am also anticipating more things to come, good and bad. We're still planning that wild trip to Bangkok... hopefully soon. I can't wait. Last night was great. Gave him a semi lap dance. Ha ha ha... It was fun. I loved talking to him face to face, eye to eye. Only an inch of space between our faces. He said I have nice eyes. What a sweetie.   This week will be another grind for me. Things just keep coming. I really hope I can take this much pressure. Been listening to this CD my honey lent me. It's actually quite good. Various sounds. They call it World Music. I guess I should know what World Music is but I can't really say that I do. But this CD is giving me insights on what various music can be like. I always liked Enya.

       Hiya peeps... I have yet to gain inspiration to write the lost journal entry... meanwhile... my honey now has his own blog. You could check it out by clicking this link -->  urlLink Jaguar Lord .   Most of the time, my honey really ends up getting me all reved up for something exciting. Other times, he gets me to unleash my inner Tao, my Oprah. The weekend was quite interesting. Got to talk to him about ourselves, and how we see each other. I'm glad he now knows that everytime I'm with him, and taken to somewhere alien to me... like a comic book store... I feel like I'm transported into his realm. The realm of the Jagard. Funny thing is, I feel safe. Mostly because I know he's there to show me around. I love it. :) I like the fact that I can share these short moments with him. I'd like for him to know that each visit to these stores get me more and more indulged in his world. Not to be sucked in but to gain the ability to live in it. A dual citizenship of sorts. Bohemia and Arcadia (can't think of a cooler counterpart).   The week's a mess.. I need to organize my time!

       What a weekend...   Friday... helluva drive to my alma mater  urlLink (De La Salle University) . It took me almost two hours to get to a place that's hmmm... maybe 4 mi away from my office. Anyway, I was riding with a friend and eventually dropped her off in front of the university and I went off to pick up my honey at the nearby mall. He was so pooped when I saw him get in the car. Poor baby. We headed back to the school and parked the car. Knowing we were late, we still enjoyed the nice cool breeze (yes folks, there was a breeze in Manila). I was singling out some spots in the school to my honey, mentioning names of buildings and stuff like that. It was fun. Showing him where I spent some of the more unforgetable moments of my life.   Got to the La Salle main chapel, people were already singing. My friends were already seated on the left side of the chapel. The atmosphere was amazing. The performers (also friends of mine) were doing arias from various operas. These singers have not had formal vocal training and they sing as if they were professionals. Amazing really. Last year I was part of the list of performers and did "Nessun Dorma" from Pucini's Turandot. When we got there, I was hearing Vittoria by some composer being sung by a friend and she sounded amazing. All the performers did. It was such a treat!   After the recital, we all decided to head on out for dinner (late dinner that is). Went to The Power Plant Mall and ate at Dencio's. It was so much fun as people would be throwing all these side comments at each other. My honey was away somewhere to check out Page One (a bookstore) and see what they have to offer. Apparently, they have the same books as in Powerbooks, only more expensive. So we chatted the night away till it was about 1ish in the morning and we all had to head off.   The next day was a bit "messy" as plans to head to Tagaytay were still up in the air. Down to the last minute when I asked my dad to take me to me and my friend's agreed on rendezvous. -to be continued- (i think i just ended up deleting my post! FUCK!!!!)

       By golly does time fly...   I can't believe I have been out from my journal for ages. It's been too long. Too many unforgettable memories that will remain where I kept them... in my heart and mind. Memories of my great relationship with my honey. We've been doing great so far. The bad things that came our way have been good reminders of ourselves and our individuality. Like I said to my honey, the conflicts or issues we've been through end up being lessons learned in my mind. They're not at all bad memories or bad experiences. More of things I will be charging to experience, at least my wisdom account would improve.   Sang my honey a song one night. He cried. I guess it's because he felt what I was feeling the moment I was singing to him. For those curious about what song it was, I did "Someone Like You" from the musical Jekyll and Hyde. It's one of my favorite love songs. My honey even wrote about the experiece (me singing to him)  urlLink you can check it here . I loved every minute of it. The song represented everything I felt towards my honey.  Love you baby!

       Sheesh.. new year... beginning...  I got this email today from a friend, makes me think these are things I should start focussing on, again.    More often than not, we let the idea of LIFE eat us up. but what if we just stuck to the basic rules of life?  You know, the things that we learned when we were just kids.  basic rules that seems so simple, we take them for granted...or is it just that as we grow older and wiser(?) we find it harder to follow them...    Don't lie.   Don't cheat.   Don't be selfish.   Be good.   Say your prayers daily.   Don't take your friends for granted.   Eat your vegetables.   Smile.   Say thank you.   Love unconditionally.   New year... beginning the year with my arms around you, my honey, will always be cherished. Here's to more new years with you! I love you!

       In this world where every human being seeks for stability, certain things come to my mind. Before anything else, I'm an artist. A son, a boyfriend, and a best friend. Being an artist, I don't think I'm living the life I want. I once chatted with my manager (he was in Dublin) and we were talking about how crappy things are in Manila, why were we working so late, and other shit like that. I told him that it was just the way us Manila folks work. He told me that it's not worth it. Asked me what I would do if I were given the choice (anything). I answered, sing. When he asked why I'm not singing I was lost for words. I had nothing substantial to give him as a response. Am I to be one of those people in the movies who never went for their dreams and just became content with easy living?   I've always imagined being an artist (quasi Bohemian at most). There too much running through my veins and I fear that one day I'll just burst... into song. :)  I was told by a friend that it shouldn't be that difficult to live that dream, but not in the Philippines. I agree. Stability is still a big factor for us Filipinos. I then told that manager that, maybe it's the encouragement, the push I need that's not there. I'm thinking I'll need someone to drop kick my ass on a stage to sing my guts out.   So, should people still reach for their dreams given the high amount of risk involved? Should I attempt for being the person I truly am? What the FUCK should I do???

       Just thought I'd post on something that's been on my mind. I have affirmed to myself that I will be moving out from my parents' house an live on my own. Me and my honey haven't finalized plans but there are plans of moving in together. We won't be together all days of the week though as we would definitely need time for ourselves and be with our respective families on weekends or special occassions. I am just curious as to how things will pan out. If we'll actually do well with living in one place for a long period of time. I'm also hoping that we wont end up on each other's necks by the first month. I have heard some stories but I don't know if those stories would apply to us. Watching Sex and The City isn't helping much. I don't know if I will actually be used to having someone around that often. I remembered the whole single eccentricities we all have would get dumped because we are sharing a place with another person when we live in together. Do we really have to sacrifice our single lifestyle for a piece of bliss? Why is moving in so damn complicated when all we really want is to be close to the person we love? Are gay men really for domesticated paradise?

       Got me thinking... this is something we should all think about.  According to today's regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's or even the early 80's, probably shouldn't have survived. - Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paint. - We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking. - As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. - Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat. - We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Horrors! - We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. - We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this. - We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem. - We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the street lights came on. - No one was able to reach us all day. No cell phones. Unthinkable! - We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms. We had friends! We went outside and found them. - We played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt. - We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one was to blame but us. Remember accidents? - We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it. - We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms, and although we were told it would happen, we did not poke or put out very many eyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever. - We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them. - School leagues had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. - Some students weren't as smart as others, so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade. - Tests were not adjusted for any reason. - Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. - The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine that!    This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. And you're one of them! Congratulations. This is also for those who have had the good fortune to grow up as kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, "for our own good."

       The Philippines, and most of the Catholic world, is celebrating Holy Week. Sucks that it had to fall on me and my boyfriend's first year anniversary. We will, however, take our revenge on coincidence. I hope it pushes through. We'll be checking in at the Pennisula next week. It's my honey's birthday on the 26th. I'm still thinking what I can get him. I won't be giving him that Bluetooth thingamajigger. It's kinda expensive. Although I wish I could.   Earlier in the day, I just learned that I could purchase a Nokia 7650 for only Php 100 ($20). That would've been really cool. But I was persuaded by my friends and my boyfriend not to. It's not that big of a need for me now as my 8890 is still good. It sure would've been cool though. That's fine.   I'm so weird. When I had so many things to do here at work, I was so pissed coz I can't do other things aside from work. Now that I'm free, I still can't do stuff just coz I'm stubborn. When there's work, the load's really bad. When there's not much work, the (lack of) load is still bad. Sheesh. I need to get a life.

       After a decent talk with my honey last night, I am now firmly resolved to improve myself physically. I need to get rid of this horrible (absolutely horrible) gut. Lately I've been noticing that my pants are getting a tad too tight on the waist so that's not very good.   I used to proclaim my fabulousness because I don't go over 170 lbs in normal conditions. But last night, while talking to my honey over the phone, we were chatting about excercises for the calf muscles when I suddenly stepped on the weighing scale in my bathroom. To my horror, I saw the numbers 180 go past the marker/indicator. I almost fainted. If not for my honey calming me down, I would've fell of the weighing scale and hit my head on the floor. After calming me down, he was able to get me off the scale and relax a bit more. He then encouraged me to go step on the scale one more time. With my eyes closed, I stepped on the scale. Right foot, then left. I was on the friggin' scale. Openned my eyes. Looked down. WHEW. I'm 175 lbs!!!! YEE HAW... I know I know, it's still not as fabulous as I would've wanted it to be. Now I'm aiming, not for weight reduction, but visible results. Less gut, leaner look. More streamlined, and I need a friggin' chest!  Food intake for the day: BREAKFAST five protein cookies with semi sweet chocolate chip non fat milk SNACK cup of coffee small portion of rice cake  .... hope I can last. Pray for me will yah! Thanks!

       Fuck today. Started really bad. Didn't have food on the table. My mom just left for church. Argh. Went to work and hoped my morning would go well after a big breakfast from McDonald's (who knows why I'm craving for it). There's a new McDonald's branch near the office and for some reason, other offices too. Friends and I went there to see tons of people lining up just get their friggin' sundae or pancakes... to go. UGH! I wish I trusted my instincts by just grabbing a bite at Starbucks. Nasty appetite.  On a different note, I feel that my hair was really kind to me today. I think I was able to tame it with that L'Oreal Out-Of-Bed thingie. Nicely messed up. I love it. I'm hoping to see my honey later. *crossed fingers*. I'm starting to be a bit horny. Waaahhh... I also can't wait for Saturday (tomorrow). I will be conducting a church choir so the first rehearsal I will be attending to would be tomorrow, I'm excited. Although I may not see my honey come rehearsal time, he understands that I want to do this and I'm hoping for his support. *mwah to my honey* Weekend's near. Can't wait!

       Interesting how I get to know more and more about friends I haven't seen in a while... actually, a very long while. It's nice to know I now have a way to sneak up on their lives in one way or another.  urlLink Angelo , my friend in fashion (hahahahaha). He likes Giselle as much as I do. He's probably the only one I can talk endlessly about the kick ass Gucci's or the latest D&G Trenches. He's one amazing guy. Found his blog through my honey's endless surfing (hehehehe). I like how he calls himself on the blog... Angelomilco. Him and his hunski should be proud. Congrats Angelo. Hoping I could read more and more from you. :) And as our friend Carver would say... You are loved!

       A friend's surprise birthday party got the entire group plotting a very memorable celebration. A couple of peeps hired a male stripper for our friend (who's gay). When our friend arrived at the venue for the surprise party we all sang him the usual birthday greetings and got him blowing his birthday candle on a mango cake. We led him to a room where the girls were hiding Danny (the stripper). After the candle blowing, a sound of a saxophone being played could be heard from the component nearby... emerge Danny. Danny was dancing like a snake being charmed, swaying his body to and fro. Gyrating his pelvic area with much ease. Our friend was lead to a stool that was positioned in front of the group. It was as if we were watching a stage show. (well it was).   Images of Danny's zips being undone were quite, er, eerie. I've never witnessed a "strip show" in my entire quarter-century lifetime. As he un-zipped his fly, he was teasing the "crowd" with his schlong... all eight inches of it. It was really huge! I mean seriously, for an Asian guy... that's got to be a prosthetic. I mean ... (I guess I've established the gravity of the situation... and how big this guy's thing really was). We were all glued to his pubic area as he would move his waist and make some interesting movements. The guy was such a huge tease. He'd get a foot on top of another chair and get his thing rubbed on my friends mouth... while he was still wearing underwear. Danny would then go around the room and just get himself in front of everyone's face. Some were laughing, others shrieking... tough room. Filled with straight women and gay men. It was a riot.   That same show went on three more times, with each time Danny losing more and more pieces of clothing. The last segment was the towel dance. Damn... that towel made his schlong look bigger. It looked like an entire arm. The strip show ended, Danny went home, people were still commenting on how big the stripper's thing was. It was a very interesting experience. We all went to where the food was at. After getting tired from all that laughing and gasping (some screaming), we thought we needed some nourishment. While the peeps were chatting about, I was constantly bothered by calls from the U.S. It was starting to annoy me. I was supposed to be at a party and work should not be on the list of things I'm doing. Wish I just turned off my phone. Damn. After tons of food, and soda, we all headed to our friend's bedroom where all of us (11 or so), found ourselves yapping tilll 5:30AM. At this point, I felt so drained. I hitched a ride with the birthday celebrant together with four other peeps. Six people in the car. ha ha ha... bad! Got home and just fell asleep in an instant. The weekend that was. God save me from this week.

       Mush day...  I Am by Rosie Baca  Close your eyes and open your mind  There's no limit to the things you'll find  Listen to me closely as I speak  I'll be your strength when you become weak When you're hurt I'll heal your pain When you're lost I'll keep you sane  I'll be your eye when you can't see  I'm what ever you'd like me to be When you cry I'll dry your tears  When you're scared I'll ease your fears  I'll keep you warm when you're cold  I'll love you more as you grow old  I'll pick you up when you fall I'll come when you call I'll keep you company when your alone I'm someone you've always known  I'm your best friend you can call me your other half  When you're sad I'll make you laugh  Don't bother searching I'm no where to be found I'm more or less an encouraging sound I'm always there to help you make the right choice   When everything is silent I'm that voice  I'm someone you always knew, I'm you.

       After almost three days of worrying it's finally confirmed that my  urlLink Jagard  is checking out of the hospital tomorrow. Thank God.   The feeling is weird. It's like you have no control. You want to hold on to it but you can't. Things can go anyway they want to. That's what I felt when  urlLink Jagard  was rushed to the hospital last Monday. Too much to handle. Helpless. No matter how much I wanted to see him then and there, I can't. If you don't know yet, I'm kinda off limits (in a way) from his family. I don't know how they perceive me. If I'm this person who corrupted their son to gay-dom. They already know that I "was" Jagard's boyfriend. It has been press released to them that we are no longer together. So, going to the hospital would be a tad too close for comfort. That's why I feel so helpless. I want to... but I can't. If I do, I might not see him forever. I'm glad he understands. I was crying that Monday night coz I had no news whatsoever of how my  urlLink Jagard  is doing. I seeked comfort from watching Season Five episodes of Sex and the City (how queer). That made me feel more lonely.   Season Five focused so much on the four girls' friendship. The side of their relationship with each other that audiences don't usually see explicitly. Here, emotions were overpouring. So many questions were raised. Damn Carrie Bradshaw. The entire six episodes... not a single fashion faux pas. Argh!  Anyways, yesterday was more calm for me. Got SMS from  urlLink Jagard  almost the entire day. Called him last night and I cried again. He was still in the hospital. I couldn't bare the feeling of not being there for him while he's in that state. By this time I'm sure you get the fact that I'm such a cry baby.   Now, I'm happy knowing he's gonna be home tomorrow. I'll be able to talk to him. He'll be able to hear me say how much I've missed him, and how much I love him. How much I would never want to go through that two day ordeal again. He he he. I love you, Jagard!

       I'm sad... my  urlLink Jagard  is in the hospital. Still unsure if he's going through with an appendectomy or some form of it. He was experiencing pain since this morning and went to the doctor before lunch. His parents were probably worried by early evening when the pain was still there. They rushed him to the hospital an hour ago. I'm just hoping he'll be fine. He can't go to the gym for a while afterwards (if he's going to be operated on). *Sigh*... I've never felt something like this before. Worry. Scared. Unsure. I pray that he'll get through this safely. I love you Jagard!

       Looked at the website of the  urlLink Asian Development Bank  yesterday. Checked out if there are positions I can consider. I always thought I'd end up in that institution when I was still in college. I am still an economist by heart.   Sadly, after going through the list of positions that are open, I can't find anything I was interested in. Most of the positions were admin and research, positions I would've been semi-interested in before. Now, I was actually looking for I.T. jobs. Eeep, I'm a full blown I.T. person now. Ugh.   I also checked out the market for I.T. consultants in the U.S. and there are a lot of positions. For obvious reasons, I'm not so keen on applying. Wish it was that easy. Seeing that I'm from a reputable company, I would think it's easier for me to move on to other companies. Damn money problems. Bugger. I just can't wait till my next assignment. Show me the money!!!!!

       I finally have time to write something relevant... bottom line is, my family is now (semi) broke.   A brief history, my mom retired April of 2001 at the age of 55 (i think). She saved up money from years of working. She had the house remodelled. I chipped in. After two years since the house was dressed up, we're now non-liquid. My dad hasn't worked since the early 80s so that's not even a good place for me to seek financial comfort from.   Basically, now that both my parents are not working and are no longer earning, I'm the one who's to take the responsibility of putting food on the table. I am up for it, don't get me wrong. It's just that I feel I'm too young to have such responsibilities as earning a living for the family. My status now is head of family and God knows what tax excemptions I get from the friggin' government.   I had to give up independence for a while since my parents need me for now. My mom's planning on selling the house and get a new one, smaller, enough for both of them. I on the other hand would get my independence by then. It was a tough decision on my part but I already knew what my decision was the moment I heard the words "would you be able to help us out?"... I'm not used to this. It's annoying me the past couple of weeks.   Called a meeting with my parents a week ago and told them that all of us need to pitch-in in order to survive this family crisis. My dad, as always, unaffected. My mom's all... "I'm tired of earning a living... it's all up to you guys now... I wanna do things I want to do for a change..." blah blah blah. Not good. I promised my mom I would give her 20K which she needs to pay for mortage, utility bills, etc. I am still to give 5K a month for food. Damn, that's 10K every month. Major bugger. I'm still paying for gasoline for the car. I hope this will soon pass.   I'm just glad my boyfriend is always there to give me words of encouragement. For as long as he doesn't bug me in any way about anything, I think I won't snap. I'm very edgy these past few weeks. Emotional, yes. Smiling... always!

       The weekend that was... I honestly don't even want to talk about it anymore. It's getting to be too redundant. Mutiny, coup, rebellion... whatever you call it, I honestly cared less. I did however appreciate and congratulate the efforts the initiators of that "military rally" made. Very confident, bold and daring.   Spent the weekend with my honey (Jagard) and caught the Jolie flick. It wasn't as bad as how some of my co-workers made it seem. I actually dug the film. I didn't care much for fabulous dialogue or whatnot, all I cared about was the fact that Lara Croft kicked ass. Wish she wore better boots though. Her boots were quite ... er... butch. Ha ha ha.   Just surfed a favorite site of mine... (sorry, I'm a huge fan of  urlLink Regine Velasquez ). I saw this video for the first time... the girl can "fly"... check it out  urlLink here . I think belting high notes while on a harness, "floating" uhm... almost 30 feet above the audience is a feat yet to be matched. One of her signature pieces is an Aerosmith hit. She kicks ass with this rendition of  urlLink "I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing" . Wish I had her lungs. Damn girl... you make us proud.   God...

       from "Les Chansons des Roses"  Dirait-on by Ranier Maria Rilke (French version)  Abandon entour d'abandon,  tendresse touchant aux tendresses...  C'est ton intrieur qui sans cesse  se caresse, dirait-on;   se caresse en soi-mme,  par son propre reflet clair.  Ainsi tu inventes le thme  du Narcisse exauc.  ======== translation ========  The Songs of Roses So They Say  Abandonment surrounded by abandonment,  tenderness touching with tenderness...  It is your interior which unceasingly cherishes  itself, so they say;   cherishes itself in oneself,  by its own enlightened reflection.  Thus you invent the theme  of the fulfilled Narcissus.

       Sometimes people tend to find out that how they deal with their own selves is evident of how they deal with others.   A good example is moi. I feel as though I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I always end up giving myself a tough time when I don't achieve what I want to achieve. I'm very hard on myself when I feel like I can't deliver something I've set my goals on.   This kind of pressure on me has somehow been exhibited on the expectations I have of people around me. Maybe not in the exact same way but more of I expect people to be their best. This is one thing I have yet to get rid of.   Earlier today I heard on the radio that a writing competition was opened for budding writers of novels, shorts stories, etc. I immediately thought of  urlLink Jagard . He comes to mind simple because I think and feel that his writing is most unusual to me. I have constantly noted how much of a writer he is and always remind myself that he is one talented guy. After informing him of the competition, I was initially excited that he showed some form of curiousity about how to join the contest. After sending him a message containing info of what I got from the radio commercial, he sent back a message that really got me to sigh. (as he expected). He expressed concerns of not being able to be at par with the other particpants and all that stuff. Initially, I was aback by that statement, thinking "why would that be his initial frame of mind". It never made me understand why there are people who just end up thinking bad thoughts about probable endeavours.  Lucky for me, I just underwent training that helped me understand where Jagard was coming from. When I found the time to drop him a line, I immediately took the chance. What I got from the conversation was that his main concern is not to perform well and not liking the whole experience. He's also saying something about his preference of knowing that a number of people find his way of writing very impressive rather than knowing that he would not fair well in a competition.   I guess it was also hard for me to understand that because I'm a person who's gone through so many competitions since I was young. Elementary, High School, College and even now at work. Academic, Non Academic, name it and i've probably joined it once. That's most of the reason why I'm not seeing Jagard's point of view. I reason I've participated in so many competitions is because of my motivation to succeed all the time and just beat the hell out of the others. Probably because of I was initially insecure about my sexuality and I tried to prove my worth through these competitions. Winning equalled acceptance.   I'm blabbing. I probably need to shut up now. Gotta call Chicago!

       A movie rarely gets me feeling something intense after watching it. Only a few comes to mind right now; Schindler's List, Sense and Sensibility, Braveheart, and much much more recently (like a few minutes ago),  urlLink El Crimen del Padre Amaro (The Crime of Father Amaro) . It was too real for my own good. It was very much familiar. It was too Filipino to be a Mexican movie.  I usually hold my emotions when I watch intense movies. For El Crimen, it was no different. No matter how much I am visually stimulated by the movie, I was still quite in control. An experience, that's what El Crimen was all about. It's just like the first time you've fancied a clergy man.   I'm no saint, I've had my share of Amelita's experience. Sex with the religious. God knows why I'm writing this down. This is probably why this movie felt so close to home. Although I did not feel love, I did feel so much for my past, the experience. Too real.

       My version of  urlLink Carson Kressley's (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy)  bio...  Bocceli was born in 1978 and received his first piece of couture at the humble and tender age of 2. He slowly learned that he was a gifted child by realizing that plaid and stripes never go together and pleats make your butt look huge. He developed his keen fashion sense on the playground, mixing and matching outfits of all the children in his head and daydreaming of a world where everyone knew it was a cardinal sin to wear white after Labor Day.

        Car-ma   It's been a few weeks now and I'm still anxious about getting a car for myself. You see, lately, the car I have been using for years has been hogged by my mom (well, she did buy it).   Since my mom started working again, now for an all-girls school as an administrative assistant, I have been going to work through the kindness of my dad. The daily (weekday) routine has been, mom leaves the house at around 6ish. I wake up around 7AM and prepare for my day. Dad comes in around 8ish. We leave around half past 8 to reach the office 9 - 9:30AM. I have been doing this routine for almost a month now. It's really getting to me.   I know, I know... why can't I just take public transportation to go to work. Sad and annoying thing is, I don't want to. I'm prissy that way. I can already hear people screaming "shame on you" from miles away. I honestly don't know why that is.   Given my usual financial situation, I don't think I can afford to get a new car in the next few months. I really wish that wasn't the case. I can't stand my dad feeling tired everyday for having to be my mom and I's "driver". Sometimes I just try to look at it this way, at least if he's driving, he'll have less time at home = less time hearing my mom nag all day.    urlLink    Financial management will again be the focus of my daily life, at least for the next couple or so months. I desperately need to get a car. A friend mentioned that her friend is selling their 2000 Civic A/T at P380K ($7K). Not bad. All I'd need to do is look for the following: P38K ($700) for downpayment of the loan, and P20K ($400) for car insurance. Hmmmm.   Money matters sometimes burst my "daily fun" bubble. They always creap into your fun day just about the same time you are starting to have fun in your day. I am too annoyed. BUGGER!!!

       The weekend that was... too stressful.   Friday was  urlLink Honk!  night. My friend Rony was the musical director for the Manila Production of this amusing musical (music written by George Stiles book and lyrics by Anthony Drewe). The songs were all too fun that there would be times I'd be catching myself humming along one note after the other. It has a very straight forward story so it wasn't too intense for my already aching head (mostly from the week's work). After the show I headed off to Malate to meet up with friends at Cafe Breton. Stayed there for hours chatting the night... morning away. Checked out the new places from the outside. I realized that it really had been a while since I last went there (I think I was with Jagard that time). It was fun seeing the peeps after a year. We then took a cab heading home. I was feeling groggy. I still had enough sense to give Jagard a ring before heading to sleep.   Saturday. Forget it. I don't even wanna go there. I miss my baby!!!  Sunday. Church in Greenhills got filled up with people again as they knew the group would sing again for first Sunday mass. It's nice to sing again after a month of hiatus. Miss belting. :) After mass, I had to pick up my folks from the house (since they didn't go with me earlier). We headed to our relatives place. Fifteen minutes after, the loud high pitched voices reminscent of my childhood days once again irritated my ears. God can these women talk. Women. Got to hang out with my cousins (there were only three of us that time since the others had classes, on a Sunday! -- soon to be lawyers). After lunch, we decided to go to the nearby Starbucks to chat. That was quite interesting how free flowing our conversation was. Thing is, moments like that are rare since I'm not very comfortable with these guys as much as I am with my friends. Mostly because I have not yet come out to them (I honestly don't know if I ever will). Anyway, yesterday afternoon was tolerable. Enjoyable. Fun even. Wish I had more of those.  P.S. update my  urlLink photo journal ... it's kinda fun doing it. :)

Now if I can find a way to pay for what I'm deviously plotting to buy. :)

       The latest craze on the internet here in the Philippines... urlLink Friendster . I currently have 112 people linked under me. That simply mean I at least know 112 people who are on the damn thing. I don't know though if these people actually had a part in my life considerable enough for me to call them friends. Most of them do, especially my closest friends. Some of them are acquaintances who I find comfort in knowing that I actually know them.   Thing is, a lot of people pass us by and it's usually up to us to make them important in our life. If we really want to connect with them on a certain level. It's actually our choice. As for me, I chose to get these people a part of mine. No matter how small or how big, they have done something to me or with me that I can consider path-changing.   I spent half my Saturday with my honey and we went to the mall to catch a movie afterwhich met up with a close friend of mine for a few cups of coffee at Bizu and Coffee Bean. That was a very steady night. Not much hang-ups. Not a single downer. I loved it.  I honstly miss my closest set of friends, the Chorale. I have not seen them for quite some time now and I fear that I do not know what's been going on in their lives anymore. I would love to just hang out with them the way we used to. An entire evening of non stop laughs and "shows".   My honey and I are planning a trip with my friends for summer next year. I'm hoping it will push through. The guys and I haven't really gone out of town together, you know, just us. That would be cool. I've been looking at package trips to every friggin island here in the Philippines and I'm glad that I'm seeing good stuff. Hope this really pushes through... argh!

       After a long hiatus... again... I have finally found the time to record my life (or at least attempt to)  After my 25th Birthday two Fridays ago, things have been quite slow with work. I am now in the transition phase where I will be moving from one project to a new one. There's too much mixed emotions really. I will miss this project as it has been my home for three years. I was actually the one who started up the project which goes without saying that I have seen people come and go. Life is weird. Moving to the new project leaves me with a couple of apprehensions. All I really care about now is that I will be happy there. *crossed fingers*  I have also been going to the gym more regularly (as I was forced by gym buff jagard... hahahaha kidding honey). I love going to the gym coz I feel that I am doing something good for myself. I have taken it a step further by also taking a fat burning drink every morning and evening. I really hope it works. Will tell you all how it does after a month or so.  My baby and I have been feeling more and more stable and secure about our relationship and we hope that someday we will know what our future will be and finalize what we really want out of this relationship. I'm glad that we're still together and still much in love with each other.   Lastly, the volleyball competition here at work started last week and our team had to finish a match the other day. I am now a coach. It's tough and pressure keeps building. I won't care. I will focus on the task at hand. Good thing we won that match (5 sets, not good... need to work on defense). Can't wait for next week. :)

       I have now been in my current project for almost a month now and things are just slow since I'm still learning the ropes. I'm not complaining. I like the "rest". Recently, I've been conversing with an office mate of mine who's been through so much career wise and funny thing is, he is also thinking of moving on. I have been contemplating that for more that two months now but I'm just timing myself so that I know I won't make a premature step.  Next year would be exciting. I heard from a friend that West Side Story is coming up. I want to audition mostly because I'm more akin to the voice type required by the musical, classical. I won't mind being a chorus boy, I'd love it actually. I'm sooooo excited. I can't wait. Wish it were soon.

        For my honey...     THAT'S ALL  by Michael Buble  I can only give you love that lasts forever,  And a promise to be near each time you call.  And the only heart I own  For you and you alone  That's all,  That's all...   I can only give you country walks in springtime  And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall; And a love whose burning light  Will warm the winter's night  That's all,  That's all.   There are those I am sure who have told you,  They would give you the world for a toy.  All I have are these arms to enfold you,  And a love even time can't destroy.   If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear,  You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.  Say it's me that you'll adore,  For now and evermore  That's all,  That's all.

       A hectic, fun-filled Friday was capped with a sour note...  Friday morning was Greenhills for me and friends. Bought some DVDs of "So Close" (with Karen Mok), "Matrix 1", and "Hero" (Zhang Zhi Yi and Jet Li). Then it was lunch at Pasto one of the more decent Italian restos around.   We all then headed to Makati for some R&R... The Spa at Bel-Air... fun fun fun!!! When I checked the time it was already 5:45PM and we had to meet another friend (it was her birthday). We picked her up from the office and drove to The Fort for some amazing Indian food at Prince of Jaipur. You know an Indian Restaurant is good if Indians themselves swear by it.   Dinner was capped with a nice dessert at Pasto again (this time at The Fort). A cup of Lavazza coffee is always nice on a cold windy night. Finishing my drink, I knew we had to go since I'm catching a concert by 9PM at Onstage, "Songbird (Regine Velasquez) Sings Streisand".   The show was amazing... very classy!! What an artist! I love her!  After the movie I found out that my friend was still in Makati so I asked to hitch a ride with him. He said they were still watching a movie so I thought why not go with them. I found out that they were going to watch "Under the Tuscan Sun"... OH MY GOD!!! Can you say AMAZING MOVIE!... Add to that the spectacularly gorgeous Raoul Bova... YUMMMMMMYYY!!!  Sour note is now sweet. I'll talk more about that tomorrow.

         You are Form 6,  Elfin : The Wyld.   "And The Elfin saw the evil and misjudgement in the world and shot her arrow at the sky.  Bolts of lightning struck the earth and gave the world balance and growth."   Some examples of the Elfin Form are Demeter (Greek) and Khepry (Egyptian). The Elfin is associated with the concept of growth and balance, the number 6, and the element of water. Her sign is the half moon.  As a member of Form 6, you are a very balanced individual.  You can easily adapt to most situations and you may be a good social chameleon.  You aren't afraid of changes in your life, but sometimes you evolve too rapidly, leaving others to think that you are leaving them behind.  Elfin are the best friends to have because they are open minded.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Things are better (a bit). I've just finished a visa application for the United States. I'm going to fly to Peoria, IL in two weeks (for two weeks worth of meetings).   The interview wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I waited in line from 8AM to 10AM for my turn. One by one interviewees before me would leave the room either baffled, confused, smiling, upset, mad, sad, etc. I didn't take long with the consul. He was quick and I answered the questions directly.   As you know, I got approved. Whilst other folks would get denied one of whom needed to go to visit her sister who's in a terrible condition. I felt bad for her.   I'm now getting myself ready for the trip. Getting my tickets and making my cash advances. I need money of course. I have also asked friends if there are things they needed from the US that I could buy for them.   The thing is, I'm not so excited for this trip. I know the responsibilities I would be incurring once I complete the tasks in the US. I'll be stuck with this project for a while. BUGGER!!!  In other news, our last volleyball game is tonight and I hope we win. If we do win, we'll be the top seed for the semi final matches and would have the twice-to-beat opportunity. I'm excited.

       I am currently in a weird state... I'm confused. Confusion was never my thing.  In the next few weeks events could happen in my life that would change things completely (hmmm... I think I'm over-reacting). I was hoping to get to clear it all out in my head before I write but this whole blogging thing could help me sorting things through.   My career isn't really picking up and I'm not liking it anymore. Not getting promoted last year was a real downer for me. Not only that, but not having any sort of motivating factor got me thinking, am I where I want to be?  I used to think that when I do my job well, I will get rewarded. Sadly, it wasn't what I expected at all. It is this that makes me think of moving to a new company, a new job. I have been tapped by a friend to work for the company she's working for. It would still be in I.T. I think I'm liking the field but more the project management side of it. I'll see where the whole application thing takes me.   Also, I have talked about my plans of doing musical theater this year. I don't know how much time God will give me or if opportunities will come my way. This is something I really want to do and I just hope that I'll get a chance to do it.   I'm just not happy... :(

       After weeks of hiatus from literal recollection, I retreat to this wonderful world of verbage creation.   I just got back from a business trip in Illinois. Spent two weeks in Central IL. Ugh. Talk about cold weather. That was damn nasty! Now, I'm back in 70 degree weather and loving every minute of it. I'm also closer to my baby. I missed hearing his voice over the phone. Seeing him. Distance isn't that bad after all, it only makes the yearning for one another strong... sometimes to the point of extreme horniness.. hahahahahahaha (no one will ever argue with that!)  From the trip, I was able to drive up to Chicago. I was almost teary eyed when I saw the magnificent Chicago skyline. With my Chevy Trail Blazer, I rode down Michigan Avenue to get absorbed in the vibrant Saturday afternoon in the city. I immediately looked for parking and found a great deal, $6 per day on weekends. Fabulous!!! Parked the SUV and off to my friends condo on Huron Street. By the way, I was with a co-worker when I drove to Chicago. Met up with Philip (a close friend of mine from work who's assigned in Chicago) and we all left for shopping... the Magnificent Mile. I draped my pashmina scarf, wore my Banana Republic cashmere/wool trench coat and my leather gloves. Off to Nieman Marcus, Marshall Fields, SAKS, and Bloomingdales. Fantabulous time. Shopping always makes me happy. :) Before I get any slapping from friends saying I'm too shallow... I'm going to stop there.   Two days ago my honey and I met up for the first time since I got back. It was fun. Had dinner at Italianni's and just talked. I miss him a lot. His hair's grown. Not sure what I think of it though, but it maybe just coz I need to get used to it. We went to Powerbooks afterwards and browsed through several titles. I immediately searched for Confessions of a Shopaholic as I have heard so many good reviews about it. I'm glad I found it and went on to buy the book. This is going to be my second attempt at becoming a reader (I'm not a huge fan of books you see).   Last night, started reading the book. Lo and behold, I actually breezed through the pages so quickly. I'm amazed at how entertained I was from reading. Sheesh. I'm glad I was influenced by my honey to read again. I do have to take it slow as I don't want to scare myself away by reading another Garcia-Marquez novel.

       All about hair...  Had a fun time Friday night. I went to the salon to have my hair cut. As I made an appointment that afternoon with my stylist, I checked in with a couple of friends if they wanted to go on with the hair make over. They all confirmed so I made appointments for them as well. I got in touch with the other good stylists of the salon. I made it a point not to get my other stylist as I think my friends would run and hide if they knew how much that guy charged. Ha ha ha... But I got them good ones just the same at lower cost.   Went in at around 6PM (this was so that I could have fab hair for the evening since I have dinner with friends). I was waiting for my friend who I scheduled for the same hour (6PM). He was a tad late but that was ok. I was conversing with my stylist after my hair got shampooed and was actually consulting with him what style would suit me for the look I wanted. I wanted short slightly cropped but still edgy. He told me he will do this new style on me. I was ok with it. It seemed harmless. An hour later, I felt ultra fabulous. It was amazing how my hair actually changed. It looked very Tony & Guy. Yet, I can do a fun and casual look with it too. Coolness!  I waited for my friend after my haircut and was just checking out what the other stylist was doing on his hair. I thought it was coming along well so that got me out of panic mode. When I saw the finished product, I was amazed. Thank god he allowed me to take him to the salon (needless to say he doesn't know what to do with his hair now so I told him to get hair wax).   Anyway, the day went by with fab dos and the two other buddies of mine went in with long hair, got out with chopped locks and fab crops. You guys looked amazing in your new dos.  Fantabulous.   So, I got home and the next morning I was contemplating on how I was going to fix my hair. I did some shampooing with conditioner (just like I always do with newly chopped hair). I use different brands of shampoo so my hair won't feel heavy. I change brands every month. I use different types of conditioner too but I do love Cream Silk's Scalp Care Conditioner. I don't know why. Its just that it has been there for me through thick and thin (hair that is). It's saved me more times than any doctor. I love this brand.   So on with my hair rituals, I pat my hair dry (not roughly coz that'll just ruin your scalp and the roots of your hair, I don't want to stress how falling hair is soooo not IN). After my hair's a bit dry, I take out my handy dryer and use the cold dry function to just air dry the strands and my scalp. I don't dry it too much as I don't want to get flakes on me. I then realized that using a hair iron on my do would actually be helpful, so I did. I ironed my hair (just like I did when I sported long hair). It helped thin things out. Make it more soft. I don't suggest doing this often though... hair damage ring a bell?  I'm ready to fix my hair now (after 15 minutes). I am using a local brand of hair paste/gum/wax. I have used several products and liked every single one. I've used this shining wax from Kerastase - Paris (that cost me $15 and lasted like three to four months, not bad). I've used the Gatsby Hair Wax (blue container -- this I loved totally). Now, I saw a new product from Bench so I thought I'd try it. It isn't so bad. It smells ok. It does it's job not to make my hair get into clumps. I hate clumped hair (you know how gel makes your hair clumped if you put it on while your hair's wet). I put on the product with my hair dried up nicely. I learned that one should work the product (i.e. rub it with your hands) before working it into your hair. I also learned that you should work the product on your hair from the back to front. So I do that, religiously. I develop a faux hawk but subtle it down a bit. Make it less, er... prominent.  Done. Get on my red shirt, Zara shoes and Gap jeans and I'm off to meet my mildly depressed baby. I'm off to cheer him up. Yipee...   ... report, I got to cheer up my baby and loved the after cheering up sex. :) Bwahahahahahaha!!!

       Let's face it. People get deeply affected when it's love that's being talked about. More so if it is about falling out of love.   That's not what I am trying to write just about now though. I just want to let out my thoughts on what I think should be done in the current situation my friend is in. I won't necessarily have to relay what has been happening as I might make certain mistakes on some points or scenarios.   I guess all I want to say is, it is ok to express one's love. It is ok to let the other person know what you feel, to let all the emotions pour out from inside you. But, I believe that we all have limitations. That we all should be mature enough to supress ourselves from going all out. I think there's a line between mad about love and just plain mad.   As I always think about predicaments in a manner where I try to imagine what Carrie Bradshaw (Sex and the City) would do, I try to recall what she thinks on the above situation. What would Carrie do if she loves someone who's already attached. A ha! Mr. Big. She had sex with him. More than once. She even ended up being caught by Big's wife (then). Ugh. So do I tell a friend that he should fuck the love of his life. Add to this the probability of him being caught by the boyfriend. Complications complications.  Anyway, I'm trying now to think what I'd do if I were out hitting the clubs with the guy I absolutely have a huge ass crush on, nee, almost love. Knowing how much I want to let him know I'm this fabulous person and that I could do so much better, I'd probably flirt with him till the wee hours of the night er.. morning. But then, knowing me, my friends would be there (and I would be pretty sure they know my situation), I'd be told to quit it. I'd end up crying. Crying for myself. Crying coz I know I can't have my candy. I can't have my Prada shoes. I can't have him. But then, it will dawn on me. If I can love someone I can't have this much, what more someone that I can actually have.   I'll feel much better. I'd pick myself up. Go up to him. "I know that you know that I love you. God knows why but I do. I'm not a bad person, really. I made a huge mistake. I really want you to be happy and since I can see that you are, I'll leave you be. I will have to keep you on my phone book just in case I want to meet up with you again for coffee or whatever, but right now, I think it best for me not to see you, yet." I seal those words with a friendly kiss on the cheeks and forehead. Walk away like the diva I am.   *Sigh*... wow, that was one amazing scene. Hmmm... oh well, I'd go do that or copy something off of the move "My Best Friend's Wedding".   To you, my friend. I hope you'll find the light bulb moment with your current situation. You know how I hate good people being in a horrible slump. Labs yah buddy!

       Let me stray from the usual posts I've been making. I'm just a little pissed. It's one thing to be fab, it's another to be stabbed. (hmmm... nah, that's too much)  Anyways, I received the worst comment from a friend yesterday. Talking to him and the other people gathered around us was nice until, "oh, I saw your bag when I went to the Kenneth Cole store. It was in the SALE section. Apparently, it's out of season."  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY SWEETHEART?!?!?!?!?!  I just retorted, "well, the thing is, totes are in, so technically, my bag is actually IN season."  I honest to God hate it when someone says something like that to my face. I would have appreciated it if he said that to someone else. Man, that really burst my Berkin bubble.   I was also thinking I could've done a better come back line like, "oh really? it was probably displayed next to YOUR TASTE... so last season." But then, that would've been really bad... I wouldn't mind.  Fuck it! I will probably slap him once I get my hands on those new Jack Spade totes. See how the straps would look around his neck as he goes blue from asphyxiation.  Never mess with a fashionista. We could be damn bitches!

       The clothes make a man... but what makes another man (or woman) make love to the man?   Scent. If you are blessed with an amazing personal aroma (as I know there are who have that gift) then you should not be worried with finding the right scent for you. But for commoners, other people end up recognizing you by your trademark scent. It can be sometimes good, or bad.   I remember, there was a time I knew a friend of mine would be nearby when I could smell her. Literally. Her scent was, let's just say, head turning. It was the most pleasant of odors but it was her. This just proves the statement, you are what you smell like... hahahaha (I just made that up).  If you are the type who wears the same cologne year after year and realize that it never works for you, you may be in need of a slight change in personal fragrance. Just throw away your Old Spice and take a look at what's new at the fragrance counters of a nearby department store.  I can't state enough how essential it is to know that every scent or cologne smells different on every person. The way your body blends with the scent is a question of chemistry, and has to do with the chemical reaction between you and the particular fragrance. While your friend smells great in the latest Calvin Klein cologne, it could make you smell more like a gym locker. Honest.   With this in mind, it's very important to try on a scent before purchasing it and never ever assume that what smells good on everyone else will smell good on you. You would never buy a pair of shoes before trying them on, right? Well, the same goes for cologne.  To do this, just go to the store and spray different types of cologne on one of those card thingies. The reason behind this is if you try them all on your arm, your arms and wrists will be drenched by the other scents by your fourth cologne. You will never know the right fragrance unless you put each one on different cards or pieces of paper. Note to yourself that when one of those annoying counter people standing in front of the cologne section at the department store is ready to massacre you with a spray from a bottle of cologne, you should stand back. Just tell them to spray the cologne on a card instead so your wrists remain scent-free.  Try to test the different scents by smelling the various cards to check which fragances you like, and which ones smell more like RAID. You can throw away the ones you really don't like. After having sniffed and smelled all the cologne you are interested in -- or until you feel faint, whichever comes first -- take a breather and walk around the shopping center or outside the store for a while. It would also prove helpful if you sniff coffee between each cologne. This will help give you the full effect of each scent since coffee refreshes your sense of smell. So if you're walking around the department store with a cup of Starbucks, you don't even need to take a break from sniffing. You want to give your nose a little bit of a rest so that your sense of smell is rejuvenated before returning to the store to make your final purchase.   When you are finished "resting", go back to the store to make your decision. This time you can test out how the cologne smells on you. You shouldn't have as many options since you won't be as bombarded by an assortment of scents and fragrances, after having already gone through an elimination process.  That should get you started. Now, from the scents I know of, these are my favorites (on me or on another guy)...  Hugo by Hugo Boss --> get's me worked up... he he he... did I just say that out loud?  L'Eau D'Issey Pour Homme by Issey Miyake --> this is one classic smell. It has that tangerine twist which is just divine. I do feel bad for a friend who had his Issey stolen. I do hope you'll get something soon to at least lessen the pain from being parted with your scent.  Happy for Men by Clinique --> this is what I'm using now. I like it because it smells so fresh and clean. Straight out of the shower type of clean. :) hmmmmm... smells good!  Others I can't really remember. Basically, just like anything, choose something you'll feel comfortable with. If possible, ask a friend to go with you when you're buying a new scent. A second opinion helps. Happy sniffing.

       Days have been oh so annoying for me. Add to that this cellular phone that keeps on beeping (alarm). Apparently the owner left it on his desk and we can't shut it off coz it's asking for a code. Argh!!   Digressing from my emotional stress, I think of shoes. How my newly polished black square-toed pair look on my black flat fronts. Damn, I need newer socks. The pair I'm wearing now are a tad plain. I have to remember to drop by M&S at the mall later today.   As I type this entry, my eye catches my ring finger on my left hand. I see a ring. Silver. My honey gave this to me. He bought it at a silver shop in Baguio (a city far north of Manila). It seems like it has Egyptian symbols. Really interesting. My hands and arms pretty much have jewelry that are silver or stainless. I always wear two essential pieces (plus the ring for sentimental reasons). Watch and bracelet. I never leave home without the two. I'd feel naked if either one was absent from one of my wrists.   I remember having left for the U.S. last month and realizing when I got on the plane that I left my bracelet. They're the Italian kind, stretchable. Really nice. They match my watch's steel band. Boy did I feel horrible not having anything on my right wrist for an entire two weeks (I'm right handed so normally I have my watch on my left wrist and the bracelet on my right).   I did compensate. I had on me a really simple necklace. Circular cut out puka shell that looks just like a white LifeSavers with a leather cord. A small wooden bead is on one end of the leather cord and a loop on the other. They serve as the lock for this really simple necklace. A friend gave it to me. So basically, I still have two pieces, my watch, and my necklace (oh and the ring).  This leads me to accessories. Is it even proper? How much of it can someone wear?   Let's start with jewelry. For me, rule of thumb is men should have just enough jewelry to accentuate their "limbs" or anything long (no pun intended). Arms, fingers, legs, toes, neck, etc. I'll start with the basic.   Watches. Everyone pretty much knows that a watch is an essential. The thing here is that, the type of watch you have can reflect who you are or, if you have dozens of watches, it can reflect your mood for the day. Like I said, I only have one watch. It's silver-ish in color. White face. It's a friggin' company watch but I like it. It's simple. Very minimalist. People mistake it for some expensive brand until they see my company's name on the face. Ha ha ha.   I would suggest to go for a watch that speaks "this is me". If it were a Rolex oyster, a Cartier Tank Francaise or Pascha, a Baby-G, or a Nike Triax, it's really all up to you. I would suggest however to get watches that have a classic design. For dressy yet not so expensive, I'd go for Kennet Cole time pieces. I love their collection. Go check it out on  urlLink KennethCole.com . Fossil also has a good collection. But if you are on a tight budget, I have to admit that Timex carry a wide array of pretty decent watches. Just get the ones with minimal visibility of the Timex brand.   Rings, necklaces, bracelets. This is a toss up. I personally love bracelets. I like how they look on my wrist. I would go for something similar in color to the combo of your watch. If you have a two tone (gold-silver) watch then go for a two tone bracelet. It would be nasty to see clashing wrists. Ruins the balance. If you are either a ring person, I'd suggest to wear one if you are wearing a metal banded watch. Otherwise, it would look weird. If you are wearing one, go for the tones of your watch's band. Here though, you don't have to do a two-toned ring for a two-toned watch. You can use either silver or gold as long as it's of the same shade (silver or gold).   One can be more relaxed with necklaces. The only thing I try to remember is the whole tone thing and shade thing. This only applies if your wearing a metal banded watch and a chain necklace. Other than that, any coordinating necklace would do. It's an accent piece to some. A part of the wardrobe for others. I go for accent. Suggestions for summer. I'd still go with the white shell necklaces, but something simpler would always have more impact. If you want to accentuate that amazing tan, a necklace with a light shade would look hot. Something darker would not even do anything for you. Trust me. And, no more fucking buddah beads on someone's neck! You are only allowede this if you are a Buddhist monk, like my dad's youngest brother (that's a different story).  I'll get into other accessories after more time has been spent doing actual work than posting blogs. As if!! hahahahaha!!

       Being vertically challenged has never been more fun... fashion wise. I made some amount of research (while I was working here in the office) to find some decent tips for peeps out there who are clamoring for some good advice on dressing up if you feel you're a little, err... a little low.   If you follow the items I outlined it could help in some way... and it won't hurt. :)  Just go for a simple wardrobe. This will help you avoid standing out in a crowd.  Avoid designs and patterns. These break up your outfit's vertical lines that normally make you look taller. (applicable to jackets, shirts, or a pair of pants, etc)  Vertical lines in shirts, suits, pants, and sweaters help in extending the facade of a shorter frame or body.  A uniform top and bottom will make your body look longer. (i.e. if you're wearing blue jeans, wearing a similar blue shirt will make you look taller)  Essentially, clothes need to fit perfectly. Wearing something tight or loose will emphasize your physical flaw.  Jackets and blazers should fall slightly below your buttocks and not above it.  Avoid blazers or cardigans with more than 3 buttons. Remember that these are designed for taller men and will end up making you look shorter.  Never wear your pants too high. Wear them just above your hips for maximum results.  Buy pants that are low-rise (a short distance between the crotch of your pants and the top of the waistband). Levi's has them.  Avoid any kind of puckering around the hips caused by full pockets, tight and badly designed pants especially pleated ones. They will make you look wider, hence shorter.  Your pants should break just above your shoes so your socks don't show.  V-neck t-shirts and sweaters will also make your torso look longer.  Avoid tucking baggy tops because they will make you look like an ice cube (wide and short).  So there. Thanks to websites i was able to gather the information above. I have to say that was enlightening for me to. :) This is new territory. Hope this helps someone at least.

       Queer eye for queer guys....  The Wednesday party posed an opportunity to watch an episode of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy... a show I absolutely love. It's a show I can truly say would be a dream come true if I were given the chance to be in it as a member of the Fab 5. I know I may not be as wise as Carson in terms of Fashion but I am equipped. It's been my life.  The episode was quite old as the tips Carson mentioned were a bit hmmm.... gazillion-seasons ago. Also, I would've went for something less trendy but more hip clothes for their episodes' "straight guy".  I did like what Thom used for the bedroom cum office. I'm pretty sure that was an IKEA high bed (the ones where the bed is like 10 feet above the floor and there's space below to put up an office or an entertainment center. I also liked what Kyan did with the hair. The highlights idea was just right. So anyway, enough about them, I do like the whole concept of "making over" people. I've resigned myself to being a stylist for my close friends. Offering them solicited (mostly unsolicited) advice. I'm so into that. I also compliment people I know on how they look and special pieces in their get up which I think was a good choice for an accent.   A good example was The Doc's watch. I loved his watch last Wednesday. It was a BVLGARI with a silver face and camel wrist straps. Amazing touch and went well with his shirt. I also noticed Arjae's look. The half tucked shirt is so good on him. (I try to do this as well after having done it for quite a while... since like ages ago). The thing with the half tucked shirt is that it adds something special to one's look. It also emphasizes the belt (so if you're going to try it, please wear a nice belt) and waist area. Makes your shoulders look broader. Just really simple but hip. Very Ethan Hawke/Gap model kinda look.   Now, to a part of ones look I can never say enough of... shoes. Cardinal rule of dressing for men, shoe color should match belt color (if any). The only time this can be broken is if you're wearing sneakers, wearing a blue and yellow adidas with a blue and yellow belt just spells fashion disaster. Also, a tip, white belts are the latest fad... maybe a staple. Going back to shoes... I feel it is my obligation to help out the population by promoting good shoes. Shoes are an investment. Don't settle for a cheap pair. Go for something classic, sturdy and comfy. The trendy designs, hmmm... I'd say you can buy the cheaper ones but not on say a black lace-up. That's sacriligeous. If I were to suggest a pair of black shoes for someone looking for something for both work and play (i.e. partying)... I'd probably suggest shoes from Mendrez (Philippine brand). Get the mildy square toed ones. I'm not saying that square toed shoes are going out of style coz that will never happen. The mildly squared toe ones don't look too trendy. They are just right for the versatility the person using them is looking for. I would suggest however not to get the ones with humungous soles. Please give me a break. Slimmer soles are nicer and look cleaner. If you have enough kerching kerching, I'd probably go for Traffic ones. (Right angelo?). They're not really that expensive but they are just so divine.   With shoes, I think a guy should have at least 10... 2 black, 2 brown, 2 sandals (thongs, etc. as long as they are leather), 2 sneakers, 2 fun ones (either loaffers or something trendy).  Lemme see, I have the two black Ballys, this pointed pair that I just absolutely love (been dying to get something like this for months), the black boots that helped me last winter, the pair I bought in Greece (hmmm, I wonder where those are), the Italian ones I bought for a bargain at P1000 ($20), my brown Oleg Cassini boots, a new brown buckled pair for also ($20), my RAVEL camel pair I bought in Dublin that I always match with my Burberry socks, the new Asics sneakers I got for ($20) at Marshalls (hahahaha), the Presto and the Cons, and my five millions sandals (I especially love the Kennet Cole pair, the Ralph Lauren and the cheap leather thongs I bought from Sari sari for $15). Ha ha ha ha...   So... I think with this, I need a new shade of brown shoes... Hmmmm...   Come to think of it, this post reminds me of an old entry I made eons ago. This just proves how much of a shoe fanatic I am.

       I had an interesting night so to speak. I dilly dallied off to Glorietta (the nearby mall) to meet my honey. Looking at store windows every so often. I pretty much noticed that the mall shops were on sale. I kinda wondered why I'm not shopping at that exact moment. Oh yeah, I still have $1500 worth of credit. Bugger. So off to where my honey told me we'd be meeting (Gaming Headquarters?). I suddenly heard a whistling sound (Twisted Nerve from Kill Bill)... shit that's my phone. I saw the words "Call" on my phones screen. Yikes, international call. I have a feeling this would be... "Hello?"... "Oh, hi Roberto"... "I'm not in the office anymore"... "I'll try to send you the email tomorrow". Bugger. Our counterparts in South America. Eek. I so don't like talking to them. I always feel so pressured. Most of the time we're not understanding each other. I sometimes think it would be better if they'd just talk in English AND Spanish.  Finally saw my honey. We're off to have a quick dinner at "Spam Jam" where they serve various types of dishes made from Spam. I don't know why my honey likes this. Well, I do know. He likes really salty stuff. He he he. Anyways, the food wasn't half bad. But for 100 pesos I'd rather make my own Spam concoction (don't get upset hun). We finished quite quickly. Off to the parking lot near my office building. We venture off to Paragon Plaza where a mini party will be held. I don't have to emphasize how horrible the EDSA traffic is. Damn this major thoroughfare. I honest to God need to know where all these people are going? Are they off to their own versions of a Paragon Party. On the road, my honey and I could see this CR-V with the front passenger window down. Inside was this crazy ass guy waving to everyone on the road. What the fuck! Is he crazy? I must say it was kinda funny watching him making a fool out of himself. Buses filled with people were just cracking up at the site of the free show.   We arrived at Paragon 30 mins after leaving Makati. That's quite a long time for a place that's probably 2 miles away. Horrible traffic really. After parking at basement 2, we had to get up to the 38th floor. Inside I was all excited to actually be at the infamous Paragon Plaza party. We're meeting my honey's group of friends. You see they've always partied here and I haven't been to any of those infamous parties. I'm all excited as we knock on the door. Holy cow. There are quite a number of people here, and it's only 8:30PM. Considering it was a work day the next day, there was a pretty huge turnout. Did my rounds with the people I know. Got introed to the ones I don't know. (Did I mention everyone in the place is either gay or gay? ha ha ha)   Fun party even without booze. I got to quickly catch up with almost all of them. I honestly had fun. (I don't have to tell you about the call from South America while I was already at the party... he he he) People were doing karaoke (videoke). Cool! My honey was engaged in a Magic game with the other Magic peeps at the party. I wanted to try out the Magic Mic. Did my staple "On The Wings Of Love" where I asked to adjust the pitch. Apparently I made a mistake on the adjustment. I asked for 2 levels higher (pitch) but it was still too low for me. I just compensated. It was fun to sing with these guys. They're so into it. It's all so cool.  I didn't notice how much time we've already spent at the party that when it was about time for us to leave, I didn't seem to want to go. Bugger. Oh well, all good things must come to an end (as the cliche goes). It was such a great party. I do hope I get to talk to the other people there who I just met when I was about to leave also chat more with the other peeps I already know. Good times. Hope to see them soon.

       I find myself sitting on a couch at my aunts apartment. Theyre three old maids you see. My dads mom (paternal grandmother) lives with them. Needless to say, shes the only living grand parent I have. All the rest have died without having known me or were too senile to even recognize who I am. Anyway, back on the couch, my a-ma (thats grandmother in Chinese) would just look at my relatives and my mom as they yap about anything and everything.   Occasions like this always bring me back to my childhood. Its always me going to where my a-ma lives (together with my aunts) and just sit there. Talking shop a few times with an elderly cousin or my dads oldest brother is expected. This is so Chinese of my dads family. Not that I dont like it, in fact I find it interesting. Its just that, Im always not in the mood to be with them.   My cousins are different though. Theyre all pretty amazing. I have a cousin whos in the US Military service, just not sure which one. Anyway, hes in California now. Another who works for Nissan as some VP or Head of something. The other cousins are either a diplomat, an architect, dentist, private school professor, etc. Theyre all pretty accomplished. The cousin whos closest to my age (Im the youngest in our generation) works for Microsoft in Seattle and graduated from Carnegie Melon University. Gosh!  Im not the least bit insecure of any of them. I am just really glad that our generation is doing well. You see, my dads family used to be part of the Chinese elite here in the Philippines. My mom told me once that my a-ma would shop at Rustans (the Barneys of Manila) with several store personnel waiting on her, a socialite indeed. My dad and his siblings each had their own car, by the time they were 16. Let me remind you that this was back in the day 1950s and 60s. Cars dont come that easy for teenagers. My ang-kong (grandfather) was the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila, which was why my dads family was accorded with much respect.   Also, I remember my mom told me my dads siblings are split in two, by where they were born, those who were born in China and those who were born here in the Philippines. My dads family had a mansion somewhere in China (I saw pictures, amazing). Before my dad was born, the family moved to the Philippines where my ang-kong had business growing. My a-ma also had family members here as she is also a member of an upper class nobleman whose business was in hardware and construction. Anyway, so all my dads siblings starting from him down (thats my dad, and 2 younger brothers plus two younger sisters) were born here in Manila.   My mom explained that all the siblings born in China were stiff and responsible. The rest (my dad included) were reckless, undisciplined and spoiled! Ha ha ha! I knew that much about my dad. He was the worst! Mamas boy. My a-mas favorite. Was splurged with anything he wanted. He was like a prince. Owned more cars than any of the lot. Got into the University of the Philippines, got out coz he thought he was better than his professors. He never did get any scolding from that. He put up his own business. Traveled. Thats pretty much it really. I do remember pictures where he had this really large dog, a german shepherd I think. I always try to think where that dog could have been. Oh well.  More later on. :)

       Bocceli... hello... Bocceli!! Wake up! What's with you today? I can't believe I'm actually talking to myself as I attempt to regain some amount of mental and emotional strength. This day has not been good to me. I think it's from being here at work for the last... erm, 10 hours. I'm so not feeling anything. Not a single thing to at least boost me out of this dry spell. Damn.  Ok that was interesting. I just flipped my Sex and the City calendar to show the new month. March. That actually did something. I'm now texting my friend Rony to see if he can meet up with me from say 6PM to 9PM (I have a conference call by 10PM). Don't know if this will push through yet.   I start to think now what I really want to do in life. I'm so sick of it. Really really sick of it. I hate what I'm doing. I wanna just drop everything and start all over. I wanna do something I actually like. I wanna wake up every morning constantly looking forward to what my "job" has for me that day. The shitty thing about this though, I really don't have a fucking clue what that "job" is. I"m so fucked up today.   I wonder if I have male PMS. They should research into that. Men with weird emotional distress at certain times of the year. Hey, at least it's not monthly. I honestly just need something (hell even someone) to tell me just what the hell is wrong with me.  WAAAAAHHHHH!!!!  Just in, Rony can't make it tonight but it was sweet of him to give me a call to check up on me. Thanks buddy.

        WARNING... this is quite a long post. I was in the mood   7:00 fucking AM... and I've been here in the office for almost half an hour doing nothing. My mail isn't replicating (I access my mail offline so going through them would be faster). For some reason the stupid server doesn't want to get accessed. DARN BITCH!  The weekend was ho hum. I can't believe I was already home by 9ish last Friday. Really... could I be more of a loser!?!? Holy shit, wait a minute. What am I talking about. I have the last episode of Sex and The City with me, in my bag. I reach for the cd and plug it in on my fabulous home theater system (might as well get my money's worth right?) Gladly, I was able to catch the second to the last episode of the show when I was still in Illinois. As I focus my eyes on the television, I hear the familiar tune... just like my phone's ring tone (god I'm soooo gay it's not even funny). I see that the show is starting from where it left off on the episode I caught in my hotel room two weeks ago.   ...That's it... The show's over. I can't believe the series is over. I am one huge Sex and the City fan. I even have calendars of the show godsakes. I love Carrie Bradshaw. I can honestly say to myself that I were a woman, I'd sooooo be her. But I'm not and I know I can still be fabulous. :) The show ended as expected. The producers were kind to the viewing public. They gave us what we wanted. I like the fact that the show ended with no "closure" so to speak. You would know from each characters' ending that their lives will go on. That it's not a "they lived happily ever after" sorta deal. I feel weird about this whole last episode bit. It's too unreal. I can't take this. I'll get back to my reading.  The weekend saw me reading a book. Yes, a book. Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella. All too funny. Three thumbs up (if that's even possible). I really related to the character, Rebecca Bloomwood. It was honestly quite eerie. I never loved reading so for me to actually finish a 300 page book in less than five days means I really loved the book and admired the story. I lapped up every page, every word, every letter. It was all too familiar. The story, the character. She's me. I'm her.  Saturday was lunch with my aunt, cousin-in-law, mom and dad. Teriyaki Boy was fun. It's kinda like a Japanese version of CPK (or maybe not, anyway...) I had my tummy filled with too much Norwegian salmon and California Maki. I almost wanted to barf. But I obviously don't.  I paid for lunch ($25... not bad at all for five people). Went around the mall with the troupe and ended up at an optical shop where I remembered that my dad needed to get new eye glasses.   We go inside an optical shop where we asked for assistance from one of the store personnel. I told them to bring out frames of different shades preferrably dark, something rustic, and silver... all matte. I asked my dad to wear each one. Dad and I both decided that the silverish matte frames look good. So now I asked the lady to get us some silver matte frames that have a rectangular shape to them. Like me, my dad also has a slightly big face. Our heads don't seem that proportioned with our body. Weird. Given this physiological "abnormality", a squarish or rectangular frame would be in order. Also, for bigger faces (cheeky or whatever), lighter frames like silver or gold(both should be of a matte finish) or even clear ones are a better choice. Dark frames make your face look bigger because it will actually show the size of the frame in proportion to your face as opposed to the "invisible" quality of a lighter colored frame.   The lady comes back with several frames and my dad tried each and every one of them. I let him take his time as I browsed through the frames (my mom was doing the same at the "want to buy rack"). My eyes lock on a particular pair. Are those clear frames? My god. I signal another store personnel to help me out. I asked her to get the frames I just saw out of the display case. I wear them the moment she gave them to me. In a split second I saw myself in the mirror with these really amazing pair of glasses. I looked really fab. They looked really classy. I check out the price... damn!!! They were only P700 less 15%... = P600 (That's like $11). Oh. My. God. I immediately remembered where I placed my old pair and thought of just getting the lenses out of them...  "Those are nice". My mom comes up to me admiring the glasses I'm holding. She tries them on. Loves them, immediately buys them. All this time I was stiff from how quickly things just happened. I'm apalled at how my mom totally disregarded the possibilty that I would be buying the pair. FUCK! I suddenly remembered, I could ask the store if they have extra stock of those glasses as I honestly didn't care if my mom and I had the same frames. The lady behind the counter said that they don't have one then and there but they could call one fo their branches to have a pair sent in by Monday. I was relieved, all feeings of annoyance faded. Whew.   Early afternoon went by, my dad finished his "eye check-up" and I obviously had to pay for his glasses ($100) for unbranded glasses. Those damn progressive lenses can be so expensive. Thank god for company allowances (we get an optical allowance at the company I work for). Took all of them home and read my book for a few minutes. Then I was off to meet my man at the Alabang Town Center. It was our usual Satuday night. Towards the end of it though, we both met up with friends of mine at a Chinese resto stayed a bit then off to the near by  Seattle's Best Coffee shop.   Got my second dose of Javanilla. Amazing drink I tell you. It's made out of blended mocha ice cream. Conversation was quite light. A friend from Singapore called us up and we all got a chance to chat a bit with him. It was a nice evening.   Sunday... hmmmm... why am I up so early. Oh my goodness, mass at 8:30AM. Think think, ok, red shirt, Gap jeans, white belt and sneaks. Fabulous...  ... mass was done and the next thing I know we were at the Manila World Trade Expo for the Philippine International Furniture Show... aptly entitled "Obra" (masterpiece).   We got in on the first day because my mom used to work for a company that had a steel department and they're one of the suppliers tapped by various furniture manufacturers. The first day is usually for corporate buyers, you know, those who buy stuff for their hotels, million dollar houses, corporate offices, blah blah blah. Anyway, I made my run through the various booths in an organized manner. Start from one end, end on the other. Ha ha ha. Easy right? Finished the entire thing in less than an hour. I have to admit I had a fun time oggling at the amazing displays. These Filipino designers are uber talented. One of my faves was a retro designed seat (almost Herman Miller-ish) but using woven bamboo as base and nice warm colors for upholstery. They all looked so European but warm and cozy because of the Filipino touch brought by the weaves.   Wish one day I'd have the guts and gold to get me those damn furniture. I'd love to hibernate in a house filled with amazing things. *sigh*... I dream....

       My own "how to go about summer" post... yipee... :)   Tone Up NOT Down  Knowing you could probably afford to lose a few pounds and/or tone up a bit makes you do yourself a favor. Do this by first taking a long look at yourself. See anything moving as you slowly shake? If parts of your body tend to be a bit active with this check, it should be time to do at least twenty minutes of exercise here or there. Trust me, this will go a long way to changing what you see now into what everyone will see this summer.   Suits-me up Scottie  Im pretty sure most of us are not going to hit the beach wearing a thong in this lifetime, unless of course you actually like being buried in the sand. This does not mean however, that you need to forget about showing off what you got. Oh come on, dont be shy. Just try to keeping in mind that less is not always more. This should be your key to finding the perfect get up for some fun in the sun.   Mix it nicely  Most of the time accessories end up being the last thing thrown in ones bag. It should never be the case coz once on the sand it is the little things that can make or break your look. Even if you plan to more or less live in your beach outfit, a hat, sunglasses, beach towel, walking shorts or wrap, flip-flops, an assortment of T-shirts or tank tops and even a good book are essential. Sound complicated? Consider a trial run in front of the mirror at home. You can leave out the book.   I dont wanna Burn baby  If youre just too perfect and look exceptionally good in red, a picture perfect day of sun and fun  not to mention your entire vacation  can be absolutely ruined by not being prepared to deal with sunburn. Spare the lobster jokes and the painful cycle of burn, bubble and peel by catching some rays in the backyard. Hey its worth a try. By doing this, you can actually look already tanned when you hit the beach and off to the applying sun screen.    Hair apparent  This is a fact. Both men and women have to deal with unwanted body hair and beach season is the time to do it. Giving yourself the Beach-once-over from all angles before heading it out on the sand could be the difference between a look to remember and one you would rather forget.   Speedo Dido  Unless you are a competitive swimmer, you really don't need the aerodynamics. It doesnt matter how confident you are, everyone makes a decison based on first impressions. So for the guys, my advice doesn't stem from men's points of view, but rather women's. Let's just face it, not all of us have the body of an Adonis. So by wearing a Speedo, you might be revealing a little more than you should be and covering up might not be such a bad idea.  That's all I could come up with for now... hope that helped.

        Etiquette shmetiquette   This is probably a weird post for me since I never realized how big a deal this whole "being a man" really is. I got to go through my usual research and found an article that caught my attention. It focused entirely on being a man with etiquette. Wow! Here's my take on proper decorum... I think men are more manly with etiquette.   Knowing what to say...   ... yeah sure, it's fun to go slang but sometimes it's not so good to have a limited vernacular. Go for the basics or even go for more. I highly suggest reading up. You have a wide selection of magazines, newspapers, novels and even biographies to build a better vocabulary.    Knowing the buzz...   ... since we're on the topic of reading up, conversation is always key to knowing a person more keenly. If a person knows what's happening around him (i.e. news) it's a good indication that he's not self-centered. On this note, however, try to also accept new information when being spoken to. Try not to think you know everything, you just might surprise yourself.    Drop it...   ... like I said, slang is not the norm. Catch phrases are fad-ish. Lessen usage of these phrases so you won't get into a conversation using words or phrases that are from 10s of seasons ago.   I hate to admit it...   ... but going to the gym does produce wonders. You see, maintaining physical fitness shows a lot about you. It means you take care of yourself and you want to project your very best to people you normally see day-in and day-out. Note to yourself, also, that a good disposition will "surge endorphins" which make you seem like you just came from a weekend vacation in Boracay.    One funny thought...   ... "cybersex is permissible as a masturbatory aid, not unlike the recent Falcon or Bel Ami videos you recently acquired, but under no circumstances should it be a substitute for the real thing."   On dating...   ... if you asked for the date, foot the bill. It shows that you are responsible enough for your actions. He he he. It's also plus points for you to do so. Three words come in handy in this situation, "I got it." Make it a point to reassure your date that you are wholeheartedly offering your generosity and that you wouldn't have it any other way. You'll be getting a mental smile from your date immediately.   Past is past...   ... never ever inquire about your date's past relationship/s. That's why they are called skeletons in the closet because they should always be in it (at least for the next year or so). Just concentrate on what is most important, the here and now. This will get your date marvelling at the fact that you're not too nosey and in turn won't do the same to you. I'm sure we all have deep dark pasts we'd want to hide for the meantime.   Work hard, drink hard...   ... ever wonder what it's like to have a date with someone who's having a drink with a little umbrella in it? I'm sure you wouldn't find that the least bit appealing. Do the same, just go for the clean drinks. A nice vodka tonic is a safe and easy enough hard drink to start the night. Even better, go for a glass of wine (red or white, it's up to you).   Shake it baby, shake it...   ... handshakes can give away impressions too. Quick tip, never go for a loosey-goosey grip. Firm and reassuring is always a winner.   Look 'em in the eye...   ... not being able to look at someone directly in the eye could send out signals that you're hiding something. If you have noble intentions, what's wrong with doing a cornea to cornea session with the person you're talking to? You wouldn't want your integrity to be in doubt, would you?  That's all I got. It's all about yin and yang of being a man and having manners. It's sometimes tough to do both together, in harmony but know that this world can instantly come up with conclusions about you based on your manners. Don't worry about not getting all of this in one swing. You'll be able to evaluate if what you are doing is helping, this is done through interaction.   Know that what can you do makes sure impressions and conclusions of you are accurate and that people know the kind of man you really are.

        Zwei Jahre   Vielen danke mein schatz.... (thank you my honey)... I love the fact that I can say "in the last couple of years" every time I refer to our relationship and what we've been through. That Saturday when I first met up with you was most unexpected. I never would've guessed that I will be meeting up with you for two years and still don't get tired of doing it.   Like a moth to a flame, I'm drawn to you. Every single day I'm constantly thinking of you. Good thoughts, bad, nasty, or just plain ole kinky. You are my Yang! I'll never get tired of being with you... Cheers to more years together! I love you!

       Wee hoo! Summers here. Thank God!  With summer comes all the amazing things you can do to get hot and sweaty. Yeah! Ok, Ill calm down now.   What I love about summer is the fact that I can and will wear shorts when I can. But the funny thing about wearing shorts, you cant just put on a pair as if it were nothing. You still have to coordinate. I mean, none of those Bermuda shorts with like a pink linen top uhm, maybe if it was an Ungaro button down polo Id forgive you.   Ok, what does one wear on a toasty summer day? If it were up to me, men should wear shorts (just shorts tee hee) kidding of course. Since Im a corporate dude (yuck!), Ill go for lighter fabrics for my shirt and then less layering. Hell, Id even wear lighter or cooler types of underwear i.e. less of boxer briefs more of silk boxer shorts.   So anyway, I would wear lighter colored shirts to work just coz they feel cooler (I dont know why). I think the only reason why Id wear something dark is if I feel dark that day like really butchy. Ha ha ha Otherwise Id go for pastels. If I had more of the lighter shades for my pants Id wear them but since I made a mistake of investing in a lot of darker shades, Im paying the price. One must remember that in buying things, think long term especially expensive purchases.   Now weekends are a totally different thing. One should be more mindful of what they are wearing. Like I realized this weekend, the Jagard was wearing something quite casual for my taste and I thought, wait, were going to Podium. Thats like the Power Plant of the Ortigas area. It dawned on me that it was fucking summer. We all have the license to dress down. That eventually calmed me down. Ha ha ha. Sometimes I forget that Im in the tropics and that we dont get winter or spring here. I forget that April and May = Summer not Spring. Ha ha ha.   So shorts are totally cool. I love the new board shorts they have in Banana Republic. I especially like the Kiwi color which I already saw last February. Im just glad that theyre carrying it over through the summer. Its such a refreshing color. Love it, love it, love it!   For shirts, I would normally go for a light colored ringer-T or something in a light shade of blue or green. Other colors will do fine as long as the fabric feels light. Abercrombie and Fitch always has nice distressed shirts that are oh so lovely to wear. Theyre sooooo thin and cool.   A tip I got from Carson of Queer Eye is that to have the distressed or worn look for a shirt, wash a t-shirt in a washing machine with rock salt. Apparently that gives a real nice look to the shirt. I havent really tried it but he swears by so I guess it should work.  Moving on, so youve got the shirt, the shorts (or nice draw sting pants) footwear. Ill have to say that thongs are still preferred by moi. I love thongs especially leather ones. Ive been dying for at least the Banana Republic version of the leather thong (for ages now). I got a pair from a nice store near my area and it just cost me P800 ($16). Theyre leather of course. Its a nice addition to my 8+ pairs of sandals and slides. Ha ha ha. Im such a freak.  Accessorize this summer. Hmmm, I remember I bought a necklace and anklet set from Boracay years before. Those dont work for me now coz I have uber layers of anklets on me. Necklace wise, Id still go for something light colored to enhance the skin tone especially if you get a tan from bathing too much under the sun. But it really depends. I just realized that darker colored necklaces can also work if you are fair skinned and dont get tanned easily. The rest of the accessories should really be up to you. All I say is, dont over accessorize. Its harmful really!  Hmmm cant think of anything else but no more of that neon crap. Whoever wears them should be banned from ever going out!

       Hi all. I'm pretty sure you are aching to find out what I think of the May 15 competitions. I honestly can't talk about it yet. Maybe after the month ends. I can give comments and stuff. But I found out something last night. People here in Manila can actually download my pics on their phones via WAP. Here's the picture i was able to download.      Cool huh. :)

       Last minute thoughts before Saturday's competition...  - I'm really really nervous. - I am dying to kick ass. - I hope the new key of my song won't be too low or too high. - I hope my get up this Saturday helps me get good reviews. - Band rehearsals tomorrow would give me what I need for Saturday... assurance. - My stomach's turning like crazy. - Although I've been on bigger performance arenas than Saturday's, I'm finding it more and more difficult knowing that this is all me. I'm in this thing as a solo artist. Not with a group.  - I'm so glad a lot of my friends are there giving me support. Being beside me all the way. - I can't wait to get pumped up for Saturday.  - I wanna go home and sleep and wake up and head for band rehearsals. - I hope I won't get eliminated that easily. Not on the first round. I wanna be part of the Final 3... I really just wanna...   Pray for me.

       I just wanted to formally inform you of news from whats happened in the last couple of weeks.  As some of you may know, I auditioned for Star in a Million last April 23 (Friday). I was with 120 or so aspirants to get into the show. After the taxing six hours of waiting (thanks to my friend for waiting WITH me), all the auditionees were called back into the studio for the announcement of those who got in. They called people number by number and suddenly I was realizing that they were calling the numbers of the people who wont make it. I was number 89 and when I did not hear any mention of those digits, I was relieved. I got in as part of the Top 50 for the month of May. We were then asked to go back on April 28 for the taped Grand Auditions. I had to choose a new outfit of course. Hahahaha. I came in thinking positive and when word got out that we were going to sing a capella, I had to look around for the nearest 3000 series Nokia to get my pitch (or key). I was singing Someone Like You from Jekyll and Hyde using A-flat. I was humming the chord the entire time as the Top 50 hopefuls waiting agonizingly for hours and hours. I was number 44. I got called in the studio and it actually felt exciting. Seeing the judges for the May batch (Vernie Varga, Fritz Ynfante, and Mel Villena) and waiting to sing in front of them. I gave it my all and got rave reviews from the judges. I was so elated with the score they gave me. Three stars. (They would give a star each for a contestant they felt should go on and if one gets two stars theyre automatically in for the next round). Dang was I happy. Off to the red carpet leading to the exit where Ryan Agoncillo would be waiting to get me interviewed.  We were 21 out of 50. The competition gets tighter as friendships grew stronger. May 1 was the last round of auditions and it was going to be at the Star in a Million main set. I will be singing Say That You Love Me by Martin Nievera with a Regine ending. Hahahaha. I was able to extract the music from a VCD that I recorded on to tape. Adjusted the key a little and voila, instant minus one. We all picked our numbers and to my surprise, I got no. 1. Im the first person to perform?? WHOA! I was able to keep calm the entire time. We caught the Live Show of Star in a Million April Finals. 9PM, friends of mine came surprisingly. I wasnt really planning on inviting them yet coz I felt it wasnt too much of a big deal, yet. But I was touched with them coming with my honey.   So anyway, the taping started at around 9:30 (I think) and I came up on stage with enough confidence to last me the whole night. I was in a pretty spiffy get up. Hahahaha. Started the song but got cut coz Direk Fritz couldnt hear my voice so he requested for the sound to be lessened and a monitor to be place on their area. I started again and finished quite strongly I thought. I wont give away what the judges thought of my performance so you could watch it this Saturday. Hahahahaha. After no. 21 finished we all had to change outfits. We were lent short sleeved button down shirts (guys) and I dont know what you call those things (women). Lets get to the main attraction. They all lined us up on stage at around 2AM for the announcement. I was as stiff as a cadet officer (at least thats what my friends said). I was trying to stay calm when Edu Manzano was starting call the numbers of the contestants who will be part of the Top Ten Finalists for the Month of May. #7, blah, blah. #1 FUCK is that my number?? DAMN!... I got in. Shit! I was relieved, ecstatic, trembling. I did not realize how much this contest is so important to me until that very moment. It was euphoric. But all that had to end when reality struck. This is just the beginning.  So to you my friends, I hope to go down this road with you guys by my side. I hope youd support me in this endeavor. Your prayers will be mighty helpful as I start this journey hoping it wont stop too soon.   Catch the first episode of the May batch on May 8 on Channel 2, 6:30PM. The start of the competition for the 10 May Finalists is on May 15 Live from ABS CBN Studio 2. You are free to come if you wish. Thanks again to everyone for all your support. This is just the beginning.

       I know i know... I'm so out of it... Give me time. I will most definitely start again soon. I'm just not really in the mood to talk about my fucked up life right about now. I'm not in a stable state of mind so I might just end up fucking things up. All I got to say for myself is I'm not just about to give up. I'm just revving up my motor. Will have to get back to my stupid life now. Laterz.

       A Singing Career...   urlLink Star in a Million  was a truly memorable experience for me. I had the privilege to sing "professionally" for a few weeks.  After the Top 21 round where they got the 10 finalists for the month of May, I was a busy artist. We had our first video shoot that was on location outside of Metro Manila. We went to a club house of a village owned by one of the corporate sponsors of the show. There, we made shots of us in the pool as we gave one liners to introduce ourselves, shots of us going down a slide, clips of us fooling around, doing karaoke, everything you can think of. They also taped us individually as we were interviewed by the segment producer. It was one showbiz experience. Surreal.  Once that whole outing was over, the next few days were hectic. We had pictorials at a studio of one of the more famous photographers in the country, Jomar Abesamis. Here's a shot of the May Batch from the photoshoot. I'm the one on the extreme left at the back row.     (Front Row - Ashley, Noemi, Michael, Sandy, Laarni; Back Row - Robin, Richard, Frenchie, John, Bocceli)     Then we had to come up with the songs we were going to sing for the pilot episode of the May batch. After numerous debates with myself, I chose Peabo Bryson's "Love Always Finds A Way" using Regine Velasquez' arrangement. It had a pretty solid bridge and the ending would be climactic.    The day before the competition we did our band practice. It was so much fun actually singing with a professional band led by Homer Flores, one of the most reputable musical directors here in the Philippines. I was contestant number 2 hence being second to rehearse. It was exhausting coz I honestly felt like I had to sing out loud. The microphones at the rehearsal venue weren't that good I thought. That day had to end and off we all go back to ABS.    I went home with Richard and John but had to pass by a thrift store to check out some clothes for the show. We all saw fantastic shirts and pants but I opted to stick to what I had planned as my costume for my performance. I thought of wearing my Banana Republic tomato colored shirt layered with a camel shirt. Black pants and camel leather belt and shoes. During the show itself I thought it looked really cool. Anyway, I begged John to take me home after we were through with the thrift store.   I couldn't sleep that night. I was too damn excited. Morning came and I leapt for the shower and finished everything I needed to do. Packed my bags with all my clothes I thought of considering in case they didn't want my costume. I almost thought I brought too much but what the heck, why be a fashion guru if you're not prepared for a fashion emergency, i.e. my shirt getting dirty or my pants would not look good under the t.v. lights.   Off to ABS with my dad driving me all the way to Quezon City. I was so excited as I entered the audience entrance. People recognized me. It was cool. I made my way to the dressing rooms where the rest of the contestants (now my really close friends) were waiting. Apparently they were just waiting for the people in charge of hair and make-up. We were just chatting the entire time until the hair and make-up artists came in. We continued chatting as each contestant would get their hair ironed or lips colored. We had rehearsals at the studio around 4PM (the show is supposed to start at 6PM). I honestly believe I did really well during rehearsals. I was so confident with my song. I was happy. 6PM, we were being called in for a quick rehearsal of the production number where we will be singing with guest artists.    The show proper, we were all quite nervous. Laarni started as she was number 1. She sounded weird that time. It was as if something's wrong. Then I had to hurry over to the stage area where I was blocked initially. I had no time to spare as my name was immediately called. No time to gain composure. I still started. I felt weird. Something's wrong. Fuck. The microphone's not working properly, or at least it was too damn weak. I had to compensate. The chorus of the song comes and I was almost projecting my voice like I've never done. I still couldn't hear myself. I'm just glad I didn't panic. I couldn't make the volume of my voice any louder as I might go off key. I stuck with the right projection. My ending was quite good. I wasn't tense any more. The judges comments...   Judge No. 1 ... "I couldn't hear you towards the climax of your song but I still like your sound, in a Broadway kind of way"   Judge No. 2 ... "there was nothing wrong with his volume, it was just right. I like your voice. You're (me) good!"   Judge No. 3 ... "I would have to agree with judge number 1, I couldn't hear you that well... (doing some actions with his face)... if star quality were considered, you don't... (I point to my get up)... your get up is nice but your face isn't so nice."   GASP!!!!!   God I hope my mom didn't hear that! Did I even hear that correctly? He just insulted me! UGH! I'm so glad my microphone that time was no longer turned on or I would've answered back.   The night went on with memorable performances most especially by my favorite, Frenchie, singing an all Aretha "R.E.S.P.E.C.T."    Amazing woman. Great voice. She'd give Fantasia Barino a run for her American Idol crown.    The show ended with the people getting the boot... Laarni, John, Richard, and moi! UGH!!!    That was it. The experience I'll never forget. I don't wanna get into the other things because I thought they weren't relevant. All I could think of was how much I was thankful for all my friends who went.   Xochi, Angelo, Sharon, Lisa, Vina, Mel, Normie, Nescel, Jack, Stephan, Adjeng, Tegs, Dennis, Wilma, Jet, Paolo... to all of you, Thank You!   To all those who supported me in this endeavor, thank you. May God bless you! To my baby, thanks so much for the support you gave me during this competition. I know it was hard for you not seeing me that much during those times and I'm thankful for that. Besides, you did miss quite a lot of my other performances... hehehehe... kidding. I love you and thanks for being there. :) MWAH!
