      i'm really thankful that we are called to do life together. it's amazing to me how a conversation with a friend can take you from contemplating jumping off something high to a sense of balance and focus and a renewed energy for the journey.   we should all have mandatory hours drinking coffee (or whatever your beverage of choice might be) with someone. thanks for the afternoon.  j  "but pity the man who falls down and has no one to pick him up" -- Ecclesiates 4:10

      ok so i'm thinking about last night and our conversation(?) about mission and evangelism and helping people find God. i think the thing that sticks with me the hardest is the statement that we have it in our hearts to help people connect to God and many of us have friendships with people that are moving in that direction, but we reach a point in the conversation where we don;t know what to do next. it is like in rejecting some of the evangelism "strategies" that we have seen abused over the years, we have left ourselves with a vaccuum that we don't know how to fill.   honestly, i am searching for answers to that question. what does it look like? i was checking out one of my favorite speakers last night (mark driscoll from mars hill in seattle) and i listened to his talk on mission. here is an excerpt from his notes that spoke to this issue and may have some direction for us:   At Mars Hill Church, we see every Christian as a missionary and every relationship as an opporunity:              Routine Presentation Evangelism : (believe in Jesus, then belong to church)           Presentation of Gospel information           Call hearers to a decision about Jesus           If an affirmative decision is made, the person is welcomed into the church           Friendship is then extended      vs.             Reformission Participation Evangelism  (belong to church, then believe in Jesus)           A genuine spiritual friendship is bujilt between the Christian and the non-Christian           The non-Christian see authentic faith and ministry lived openly and participates in it           The Gospel is naturally presented in word and deed in the friendship           The conversion to Jesus follows conversion to Christian friendships and to church  You can read the rest of the notes and listen to the sermon  here  go to menu>mp3/audio>sermons>spiritual topics>missions. He gets off his notes at the end of the sermon, so you don't get to hear him flesh out this part of the talk much, but it gave me a launching point for my thinking about it.   much more to come soon i'm sure.

      i think dreaming about the possibilities of where our lives can take us matters.  of course, this can be done in excess to where it is not very pragmatic. i think i'm just saying that life matters.  it would probably do us all good to think of our lives as things that can be for the world, family, community, beauty, truth, people, god. our lives matter for these things.

      this is just the first thing I think of off the top of my head, but as a community, we have to  SUPPORT  one another.  There are many different ways, prayer, talking, listening, serving, etc.  But I also think it is important to  CHALLENGE  each other.  I know in school that I don't really learn anything unless I am challenged by it.  It makes me engage my mind to a level where I have to think and analyze.  If we don't challenge, then we aren't getting anywhere.  Do I make any sense?

      I didn't mean to sound like we should quit trying altogether, I was just wanting to show that no matter how hard we try and how well we are  communitying  we'll never be able to see it fully for ourselves.  Other people can sometimes be a better judge than the participants themselves.  Sorry if I was misunderstood.

      on the second post. i agree that it is possible to focus so much on trying to become a community that the actual community is hurt by the quest, but at the same time i think we have to put more thought and effort into community building because it is not our nature to move in that direction. the fungi and bugs and whatever will participate in the "decomposing community" (fun image there) because that is what they do. left to our own devices, we will (generally) gravitate to self-promotion which would then move us in the opposite direction of community.  i've started a new paragraph to continue my thoughts 3 times. i think that's i sign i should give up for now and call it a day.   wishing i was smarter (wiser?) than i am tonight j

      It seems like we are trying really hard to figure out exactly what makes a good community, so I started thinking about Biology again.  In an environmental community, let's say a rotting log, the fungus and animals and bugs are working together differently and perfectly to decompose the wood.  But they have no idea that they are a community because it's us who recognize this by observing them.  So it seems like maybe if we just do what we know best (different talents God has given us) and quit trying so hard, the outside world will be able to observe and define how solid a community we are.

      As the conversations about community have progressed over the past few weeks, I've sat quietly and soaked in the philosophical postulates uttered by some of our deeper thinkers.  And with the saturation point quickly approaching, I decided it was time to attempt the unimaginable.  On this grand day, Oct. 14, 2003, the first recorded use of my biology degree has taken place.  Join with my parents now in celebration of this achievement.      Biology's definition of community is " an association of different species living together in a defined habitat with some degree of mutual interdependence ."  Although this def. isn't perfect, I think when applied to our situation it raises some pretty good questions.      Obviously,  different species  doesn't work in our case (crazy monkeys?), but we all agree that we are a very diverse group of people with different interests and ideas, so substitute  types of people  for  species  and it works just fine.     The first question this poses is "What is our defined habitat?"  Is it Main Street? Norman? Oklahoma? The World?  Will it change or should we focus on one area.  I think the answer's obvious, but what does everyone else think?     The second question is one that Corey asked Sunday night.  "What degree of mutual interdependence is necessary to consider someone part of the community?"  The Biological definition just says "some", and I think that goes along with my view pretty well.  Although we don't see Steve and Brenda or the Ammonds very often I still believe they are an important part of our community.  I do think that we need to have a large degree of interdependence to have a strong community, but I don't think the amount determines community candidacy.  Another thing I read goes along pretty well with my view also.  Remember, this is talking about bugs and animals, but it's kind of scary how well it describes us also.  "Communities vary greatly in size, lack precise boundaries, and are rarely completely isolated.  They interact with and influence others in countless ways,  even when the interaction is not readily apparent ."      Well, this is how I think Biology relates to us, so tell me what you think.  I have some more Biology analogies waiting if anyone wants to hear them. All right then,                  Jon

      Nelson Mandela as quoted in Messy Spirituality by Mike Yaconelli (which could also be called my biography based solely on the title)  " Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you."   wow - any thoughts? j

      I definitely think that we must do life together in some way or another.  That is the hard part because people in America are so busy.  I think back to my time in Brazil and the people there always have time for each other.  Even in the middle of the day while they are at work if they get a call from a friend that wants to go have a drink and talk (the drink of choice is a Brahma by the way a brazillian made beer) and they will take off work and go out, and no one says a word to them.  It is just very common, and they feel it is necessary to do so, relationships are the most important thing to them.  So the problem I see is that we are so busy with american life that we forget, and most of the time literally can't stop and have these types of relationships.  I guess I said all of that to say I am not quite sure what we can do.  GTTANN= Going to take a nap now

      cody i totally hear and agree with what you are saying, but don't you also think there is an element of community that involves doing life together? like we've talked about before, we are all involved in a ton of different stories (with different levels of participation in each of them), but i'm not sure they all lead to what we are looking for when we talk about "community". jerry falwell and i are (kind of) a part of the same "christian story" and "american story" and "human story", but are we in community? (the answer is "no" if anyone has any questions) thinking more specifically about our church. we are in the "jacob's well story" together, but does just participating in that story create community? i think what i am wondering about is what kinds of things would help us do life together even though we are spread out geographically (from edmond to norman to stillwater to moscow). i would love to hear everyone's thoughts about that angle of the community issue.  again, i think you are right about the common story, i just think for community there must be more.  j

      due to the number of us that are posting here (which is cool) and the volume of posts and topics, i'm afraid that this space is going to get overwhelmed or overwhelming pretty quickly. never fear! i have now added an online forum to the web site that will allow conversations to continue down one track for as long as they need to go. it also has space for conversations about creativity, questions, conversations about sunday nights, random thoughts and more. please register and explore all of the options (including he ability to private message each other through the board and add pictures, quotes, etc.)  i think there is a place for both the blog and the forum and i don't want to get too deeply involved in trying to line out what should go where. we'll give it a couple of weeks and see how things work out and then if we need to set some guidelines, that's doable too. (i don't know that i have ever typed "doable" before -- weird)  anyway, happy typing. let the conversations roll. j  by the way -- you can access the forum through the  web site , through the link to the right, or  click here

      ok all, this sunday night we are thinking together about community, so here is the question. since we don't live within walking distance of each other and we do have jobs, families, school, etc. what can community look like? the bible says they met together daily, in homes, etc. but since that really isn't possible for us, what can we do to develop community? what does it take? what does it look like? i hope this generates as much thought as the buffalo bills thing yesterday.  still questing for a cool way to sign off j

      I realize Houston finished second, but I believe the Cards played the Cubs more times than Houston after the trade, which would give more wins to the Cards, propelling them into first.  Actually, I'm too lazy to look at the schedule, so Houston probably would have won anyway.  Oh well, I knew it would get a response from you no matter.

      Martha Stewart.  AOL/TimeWarner.  Insider trading scandals have become all too commonplace in the business world these days and a recent trade in Major League baseball may just be the most unethical of them all.  It has long been an unwritten rule that teams not trade players within their own division; but Chicago and Pittsburgh chose to ignore that rule when the Pirates sent Kenny Lofton, Aramis Ramirez, and Randall Simon(all starters) to the Cubs for a few minor league no-names.  This apalling trade has resulted in the Cubs making it to the N. L. Championship series, leaving more honest teams (e.g. Cardinals) home for the playoffs.  Add the fact that Cubs manager Dusty Baker was found guilty of tax evasion last year and you have pretty solid evidence that the Chicago Cubs are nothing but a fraud.  In the business world, the CEO's of fraudulant companies are sent to prison and must pay a hefty fine.  I understand that this is only baseball, so the following are my proposals to remedy this situation. 1) Since the Pirates and Cubs like one another so much, merge the two teams and call them the Chigittsburgh Cubirates.  2)  The Cubs must forfeit all games following the trade, allowing the St. Louis Cardinals to take their place in the playoffs. 3)  Eliminate both the Cubs and Pirates, sending Mark Prior (Pryor?), Kerry Wood and Moises Alou to the Cardinals and moving all others to the Memphis Chicks AAA Team.  Thank you and GO CARDS!!!!!next year.

      BAYLOR-- yes baylor is the team i have picked as my team to play with on my dynasty mode in the great GAME(NCAA Football 2004). and even though i have a feeling that their colors will start to drive me nuts after a while. after a few years of conditioning my coach evan i believe that baylor will become a yearly contendor for the NC. and so my dreams look like they may come true- in the first season my record so far is 8-2 with kay wins to bring me to the ranking of 25 such as beating texas 17-7 and tamu 48-7 and my only losses to KSU and tenn U.  my next opponent os oklahoma and i just feel wierd playing against them i think i might have to just let them beat me bc one more loss wont really hurt my improvement for next year.--   well ok i know x box talk is real exciting to everyone- but hey its what gets me through my tuesdays so give me a break-   alright signing off me

      yes umm-wheatthins is my username. i dunno why i guess bc i was signing up and nothing would work except that not - e not sweet e not sweete or ev or evan and then i saw my box of wheat thins and i was man that has too work. i know i know wheat thins will never surpass the greatness the wheatabix brings to our lives but im just saying if you like wheatabix  then you would love wheatthins- yeah seriously they might taist a little better. i make them disappear especially when i am watching the cubs destroy my braves in the division series shoving them down my throat out of frustration and listening to jason the roommate laughing in my ear. its haunting. but hey even though braves didnt make it this year i have no doubt that they will be back next year again to see if they can try their hardest to lose once more. and no maddux, sheffield, and lopez are not going anywhere i think they would rather be on braves and go to the playoffs every year and lose than be on a team gets there once a century1908- goodness gosh man-                                                                                                       me

      i think that has been a major issue in the church for a long time. how do we reconcile the need to tell the stories of our God with the fact that much of the language of the bible has been adopted as negative slang for christians ('born agains") or rejected as too absolutist or exclusive or not PC enough? i think it comes back to what we were talking about in worship the other night. our story with Christ is the thing that we know best and that has the best chance of being heard because it is validated by the fact that it is ours. we aren't telling a "christian story" or a "church story" or even a "bible story", we are telling our story. if it is really ours then the language becomes accessible because it is our language, not language we learned in an evangelism course. the man who was healed of his blindness in john 9 could only say "i once was blind, but now i see". it isn't terribly theological, but to a blind man it is a powerful gospel. i don't know that we need to find new ways to tell the story, i think we just need to find our way to tell it. Jesus was different in every aspect of who he was, but he offered the kingdom in ways that could be understood because he talked about things people understood (lost sons, wheat, bridegrooms) i think the other part of our "language" is the church. we provide opportunity to see that our story is real and that it works. i said the other night, the greatest presentation of the gospel is the redeemed community being what it ought. what do you think? j

      I think you can have some nice discussions about God's story and deal with low art.  What about He-Man, there are some nice theological discussions that can come out of that cartoon.

      There are reasons that the designation of "high" and "low" came about and basically, it boils down to the rise of popular culture.  Around the 1950s and 60s, an art movement called "Pop Art" came about to blur the distinction and to say that low art was cool.  The most famous was Andy Warhol with his Campbell's Soup cans.  I offered the distinction because low art is hard to defend with questions of adding to God's story.  I mean how does  urlLink Spongebob  fit? I don't know, but I like him!

      lots has been said that is great. let me weigh in on a couple of things (or three)  on the whole loving people / loving Christ thing -- as i'm thinking about it, Jesus said whatever we do for "the least of these" (which could be any or all of us) we have done for him. he also said that obedience to him is how we demonstrate our love for him. if those things are true (and they are) then it seems that every time we love someone, we are loving Christ. which i think is just another way to say what cody said.  as for what it looks like to love Jesus more. i was thinking about how i fell in love with kenda. i didn't wake up one day and decide that was going to happen, it kind of snuck up on me. as i was with her and saw who she was and what she did and how she interacted with the world and with me i realized i was in love with her. i couldn't put my finger on a point when it happened, i just knew that it had. 14 years later as i continue to be with her and watch her and experience who she is and how she interacts with the world and with me and with our kids (etc.) i find myself falling more in love all the time. all that to say, i am in love with her because of her. i think it is the same thing with Jesus. if we are with him, if we see him interact with the world, if we know more about him and who he is and what he is doing, if we experience him in our lives then the result will be love for him that grows whether we focus on it or not. that's still not a how to, but i don't know that the "how" of that looks the same for any of us. i think if there was a rigid system for making it happen, God would have chosen to lay it out so that goofy people like me would be able to access it.  corey's right. thinking about love is a good thing.  j

      yo, what's up all?  i'm in one of those moods where you just don't want to really think about much - but instead chillin' is good.    i got home from work, found out my grandpa had some sort of accident and was in the emergency room.  then i waited.  i didn't know a single detail.  turns out, he should be okay, but it sucks not knowing anything.    all that to say, i was chillin' on the web and read some cool stuff.  urlLink vintage faith church  has a very cool and extensive discussion board that fun readers should check out.  there's a books, film, and art section which inside has a "what are you reading" section...pretty cool stuff...we need one of those.  oh yeah, my wife is cool.  saturday night, melisha dreamed she was the quarterback for colorado.  if you don't know, she's been having terrible back pains, which started saturday.  well, colorado seemed to not see her immobility as a problem and made her play anyway!!  oh, can you believe the buffalo coaching staff!!!  and (in the dream) the heisman hopeful melisha knew her 15% (at kickoff) wasn't enough to handle the golden bears of baylor.  you should all be entertained, about every other day or so, with the stories of the dreams from the night before from mk.  out

      Let's make this a little philosophical (I can't help it).  How do you think our language forms our evangelism?  The problem comes from us attempting to tell people about this Body of Christ by using the churches language.  But, can they understand?  If the church is to be different from this world, how are we to communicate, because if we are different in all aspects this includes how we speak.

      cody, i think you and melisha agree on that.  i was wondering,  can one love people without loving christ?  the kenedys believe if you love christ, of course you will love people.  our discussion on the way home last night focused on the fact that it is not about you loving people, but it's about you loving christ.  i know this really seems circular, but i think it's one of those tough mysteries we deal with trying to get to god.  we can say, "i need to love people more", but that doesn't help me really do it.  i need to grasp more what the heart of christ was for people, how deep that love was.  i think we will find that it was such a beautiful thing that his love for others will grab us and move us.    i think we agree that christ shows us what love is.  this would not be on our minds if he had not lived love his way first.  where the circularity comes in, and why i agree with you, cody, is that loving always seems to increase our love.  i think we find out more about christ when we love others, and at the same time learn how to love more.  practice makes more love, and more love is more christ.    discussion on love is good  out

      Very insightful post, I have only one thing to say about it.  If you want to love Jesus more it seems to me that this comes from loving people more, and loving the Body of Christ more.  I could be wrong but it seems that Jesus was all about loving people and if we are to love Christ more then what better way than to do what Christ did.

      Well, I have now joined the blog.  Sorry to all of the philosophical people for the many non-insightful posts that are sure to come from me.  Okay, so here are my thoughts about tonight, (sorry if it doesn't make sense): At first, I was thinking, well that's great J but how are we any closer to knowing how to do evangelism?  The answer is to love Jesus more?  Now I need to know how to love Jesus more, too.  Then, I realized the point of the entire night.  I started thinking about what God showed me about relationships this week.  The focus in a relationship should be on the relationship itself, not on the "evangelism" part. So, we should love people more, which leads to relationship, and then just see what happens regarding evangelism.  This helped me get what we were talking about tonight because it is kinda the same.  If we love Jesus more, we become more in relationship with Him and then we just see what happens regarding evangelism.  The focus moves away from "how to" do evangelism.  It's all about loving Jesus. Then, I realized something.  In my life right now, I need to quit asking so many "how to" questions.  Here is my problem.  When I ask a question like "how do I love Jesus more", I don't have any answers.  I could say things like read my bible more, pray more, go to church more, etc. but that would be dumb for obvious reasons.  So, without any answers, I get discouraged and conclude that I can't love Jesus more and life is bad.    I know that it is my desire to love Him more, and that it is His desire for me to love Him more.  So, can't I just trust that it will happen without me asking the question of how.  Tonight my prayer was that I woud love Jesus, not that He would show me how to love Him.  From this I believe that evangelism will happen.  Also, I will desire more the things I talked about before (reading the word, prayer, etc.).  I am not trying to make a blanket statement that all questions are bad for everyone.  This is just where I am right now.  In my life I have been discouraged by asking how and not being able to reach any answers.  Now, I am just going to start doing.  Now on to other important matters.  I know that the squid have had an up and down season.  You must keep in mind, however, that the giant squid lives in the depths of the ocean.  They are not use to battles in shallow depths which explains this weeks low score.  BEWARE, though.  They have begun an extensive training program that will hopefully bring them into glory.

      which by the way is a fun word to type.  when we describe God, we are stuck using human analogies because that's all we have. when we start to think about something that is completely "other", we have no way to describe it. it kind of like every unusual thing we eat "tastes like chicken". it doesn't, but we've all eaten chicken and so we try to describe the new or unusual by "taming" it and making it accessible. we are stuck doing the same thing with our descriptions and ideas of God.  fortunately, it seems like we have permission to go this route as long as we don't go so far as to make God like us. (or us like God i guess). throughout the Bible, God describes himself as things we can access (father, etc).  i know this doesn't speak to the heart of cody's blog, but corey got on that. j

      this is great stuff to think about.  however, i think it is too easy to be lazy with our thoughts and end up reducing the creator to its supposed like things.  let us try to understand how different/more/greater god could be than the creation while still like/related/in-the-image-of the creation.  for example, we can reduce ourselves as humans (in this day and age sort of quasi-scientifically) to individual cells.  if you think about this at all, you should say "yeah right, surely we are more than just a massive combination of what 'cells' are individually".  that's what i think, anyway.  how do you account for emotions, value judgements, what seems to be weird communication between parts of the body?   believe it or not, i'm not at all claiming any type of dualism (so i obviously don't have a clue about how humans 'work').  i'm just trying to make the point that reductions don't work that well for comparing "like things".  i believe that, in a way i don't understand, we are massive reductions of what god is, just as if i were an individual cell thinking about my god, the human body.  ( i also believe that no analogy is even close to perfect...and there are complicated philosophical reasons for that)    now, don't get me wrong, i love it that we could know anything of what god's character/make-up is, but i don't think we're really that close by looking at humans.  i think we can get a hair closer by remembering that "creation" does not mean just humans.  what about dolphins, caterpillars turning into butterflies, sand, or the moons of jupiter?     cool.  i'm adding this section through clicking the edit button...there's nothing like never being finished.  okay.  i also wanted to say that creation is not the only way for me to get a glimpse of god's character/make-up.  i believe we also have a very extensive narrative of creation's interaction with the creator.  reductions may be all we have to work with, but it is all we have when we begin to piece together a jigsaw puzzle. (never buy a thomas kincaid jigsaw puzzle, though.  he's pretty cocky)  welcome chaddermac - where are you tiny  out

      Now that I am released from the mere spectator status, I would like to comment on the thoughts on art offered by tHepHoenix.  First, I would like to extend the somewhat blurred distinction between high and low art.  Low art is the art of commercials and consummerism.  It is used merely to appeal to aesthetic tastes in marketing culture (Little Caesar guy or Charmin commercails).  High art is the stuff of creativity.  This is the art that flows from individuals for the purpose of creating, which often receives little praise until the artist is long dead (oh, how we long to not be appriciated).  With this distinction in mind, I would like to comment on high art as it serves within God's narritive.  I beleive that art can be viewed  areligously .   What I mean is that an artist may create a picture of lillies on a pond (Monet) and it can be praise for those that see creation in a new way.  The artist does not have to be a "christian" to create a work that allows me to see something in a new way and worship God because of it. As it is with Monet, I do not know his religous disposition, but I like the subjects he dipicted.  So, I do not think that art changes much, if at all, because the artist already strives towards beauty and creativity.  But, I do think there is one exception to this and it is in regard to the journey an artist may use as the subject of his\her work.  The artist may create works that symbolize where they are in terms of a relationship with the divine (searching, relating, indifferent) and the emotions from this experience.  The art then serves as a reflection of the person and would change as they "work" things out.  Both types of art sweep others into a world that we would not see otherwise.

      i think a lot of the struggle with evangelism is that in the past there has been a mind-set that evangelism and conversion occur in a vaccuum. that is, once a person chooses to step into God's story, then all of their previous story is declared meaningless so that they can become a good member of the church community. it's much easier that way because then the church doesn't have to deal with baggage and everyone can just sit together and be good and then go their separate ways. i guess that's great, the problem is there is no model for that kind of christianity in the bible.  yes the first followers of Jesus were changed dramatically by their interaction with him, but they also maintained their individuality. i can imagine that the conversations between simon the zealot and matthew the former tax collector were probably not always cordial.  the truth is, we cannot be shaped by just one narrative. your story intersects with my story that intersects with her story that intersects with God's story and all of us (well except for God) are changed by those interactions. that is the beauty and the struggle of doing life and faith in community. can i do life with someone who is radically different than i am, but who is also moving toward Christ just like i am striving to do? the beauty of the Body comes from its diversity, the problem has been that, for a long list of reasons, the Church as a whole has not been too interested in being diverse. i long for it.   like jonathan said in our community group a while back "i'm tired of going to church with white people" j

      Evangelism seems to me to be a fairly pragmatic practice.  What I mean by this is that throughout our lives we try to bring more and more people into our community, but the problem with the history of evangelism is that we want to change the people to be like us, in order for them to be a part of us.  I think the church would be much better off with the difference that people joining the community can bring.  Now the hard question is that the people becoming part of the community must change somewhat, right?  In order to understand God's narrative you have to be a part of that narrative.  But if we all are only shaped by that one narrative is that good for the body of christ?  I would like to see diversity in the body, people that might see the world a little differently because of the past that they have been handed.

      I was just sitting here this morning trying to get ready for a lecture on Hume, and thought I would jot down a few ideas to see what conversation would spring from it.  The lecture that I am giving is on the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, it this text Hume talks about how it is or is not possible to prove God's nature or attributes from what we see in the world.  One argument is that like things come from like things, if this is true then it would be very easy to see attributes of God in human life because God is creator (take the creator thing however you would like) and if we are we must be like God because of this.  Now this to me seems to be a decent idea but how much anthropomorphism is happening here.  We cannot say that God is like us but that we are like God.  So what does this do to our theology?  If we are to buy into this then it seems that it would affect a lot of areas.

      ok so i'm thinking about this whole evangelism / mission / impact thing and into my inbox flies this email from melisha. as far as i'm concerned, this nails it. i asked her permission to copy a ton of the content here, so here goes -- it is absolutely worth the read.  In high school, before I became a Christian, I despised most of the Christians I knew.  I think a lot of that had to do with their way of evangelism, which  included a I know something you don't know attitude.  They were on the  "right" side and I was on the "wrong" side and until I came to their side  they were better than me.  Those people made me not want to become a  Christian.  I don't know if that makes sense.  Anyway, when I became a  Christian, I was taught not to be friends with non-Christians because of  their negative influence which didn't make sense to me completely.  I wanted  to know how I could ever impact people I seperated myself from.  Now, I see  how dumb all of it was, and I have had a fear of coming across like the  people I didn't (and still don't) like.  I didn't known much about  evangelism but I did know I wouldn't do it the way I had seen it.  I didn't  want to treat people like they were a formula and if I plugged in the right  numbers they would follow Jesus too. I have understood the idea of forming relationships, and that idea felt  right to me.  It was still just an idea, though.  I didn't know what came  next.  I still don't but God has shown me something.  I have been looking at  the end product too much.  I was looking at these people who I knew needed  God and thinking of the day when they found Him.  There's nothing wrong with  that but I realized I had to look at all of the stuff that happens before  that.  It is discouraging to look at someone and think I am not close enough  to them to be sharing Jesus through my life.  Instead, I want to see the  relationship and the person as the most important thing and not be focused  on what may happen because of it.  I also saw that I was spending all my  time knowing a lot of people a little bit.  I started praying for God to  show me who I need to be pursuing a real relationship with.   thanks melisha -- you still have my vote to lead the conversation sunday night.  j

      i'm sitting here thinking about our blog, and it's pretty sweet action.  all that i read is very thoughtful, pretty serious stuff.  oh yeah, it's all been j.  well, it's all about to stumble downhill like the box car race commercial for the H2.  welcome, thephoeniX.  i would've loved to use that as an id (not freudian), but it was taken.   i understand why everyone's thoughts went awry, perhaps, sunday night - as did mine.  however, i was getting very into the pre-god is speaking to us OUCH moment, which was on reconciliation as part of god's grand narrative.  if j doesn't put a summary or notes from that conversation up, then i'll give the notes i have.    anyway, with that in mind, what about this art exhibition (coming to a well near you - this friday and saturday (see below post)) thing we've got goin' on?  think about art and god's place in it.  i'm not thinking about art being reconciled back to him, really. instead, what will art look like/ concern/ say to us/ be when we are reconciled back to him - or just while we get closer to him during the process of this reconciliation?  can beauty become more beautiful/ pure/ different as god's narrative progresses?  think about it, later, or now

      several of us spent some time last night getting the back ready for  phases:exhibition  this weekend. i have to tell you, thanks to a great save by josh about how we should set up the trellises (trellisi?) things look really great. i can't wait to see the room covered in art from our participants. chad and i had the chance to talk to isaac from the  ou daily  and there should be an article (complete with chad's mug shot) in friday's paper.   what a cool opportunity to encourage creativity and creative people. if you can make it out to any part of the event, do it.  j

      Well I really don't know what I want to write here, but I will just start typing away and see what comes out.  I had a pretty good thanksgiving I guess, fairly normal for the most part.  I don't know what it is but I just don't seem to enjoy going home that much anymore, I guess I have finally realized that I have my own life and going home is not really going home anymore, I would rather be here in Stillwater, it just feels better.  You know I have been debating whether or not to go ahead and take the LSAT (the exam to get into law school for those of you who are not familiar), but I just don't know really what I want to do.  I have been in school for so long I am just looking for the quickest way out I guess.  I could get through law school in about 3 years at the most, and a PHD would take another 4 or 5 so I am just not sure.  I mean I really love philosophy and to have a career in it would be nice, but I don't know if that is the best option right now.  Law would of course be a good career and I think I could use all of my philosophy training, so my entire life up untill this point would not be a complete waste I guess, but still it seems that if I do law then some of it would have been without much use.  Also there is this conflicting issue that I have been so much against xistians being involved in the government and I know that many times law leads to government jobs, so I am just a little confused.  I know that it doesn't necessarily lead to that but it can and I am not really sure how I feel about that.  I think also is the idea that I could be financially stable for one time in my life, I know that is not supposed to be the deciding factor of life decisions but I think it has to be at least brought up, because of the way america works right now.  As much as we might not like it that is how it works, and I guess we have to realize that. (That is the pragmatist coming out in me) I have talked to a number of people about law school and they all say it sucks badly, but I really think I could get through it, I mean writing 30 page papers in every class for the last 5 or 6 years hasn't been the most enjoyable time of my life.  Okay going to get out of here, feel free to post some responses if you would like, any input would be greatly appreciated.

      I have been sitting here doing a lot of thinking lately about relationships.  I am going on 27 years old (good lord, I didn't think it was that old but when I typed the 2 and the 7 I got chills) and have yet to come across someone that I feel I could spend the rest of my life with.  I have heard it all from "god will send you someone when you are ready" to "you just got get out there bucko and find her" but all of those answers SUCK!!!!  But I must admitt that I have never been the agressive type so maybe that is my problem.  I desire to have that kind of relationship with someone so bad that it cosumes my thoughts a lot of the time and I don't really know what to do about it.  I am not like a majority of the guys out there that is scared of committment or strong emotions.  Actually, my emotions run crazy most of the time.  Anytime that a person comes along that I seem to connect with, I get attached very quickly.  So I don't guess there is actually a question in this blog and maybe not even a point but I just had to get some of this out, and the blog seemed like a good spot to do that.   Cody

      a fellow weller and i were discussing piercings and tattoos.  we decided both of us would not do well socially after piercing ourselves (not because of disaproval from our friends and families, but because of our unique whiteness and the shape of our craniums and hair styles and probably even style of dress at the moment)  anyway, but we both thought tatts were cool.  of course he's alreay got one so we talked about prices and levels of pain.  anyway, i'll probably never get one because of how often i change my interests and passions because, don't forget, these things are forever.  just wondering, though would you like to share your stories of tatts or piercings i'm also interested in peoples thoughts on their future tatts or piercings what designs/words and where anatomically  thanks

      yeah, i left cities outside of the u.s. off the list.  i know the j wants to go to istanbul.  i've only been to matamoras and reynosa (sp) in mexico.  yeah, i don't want to live in either of those.    so i'll need to travel to some other distant lands before making a foreign list.   middle-earth might be nice this time of year.  i hear places in idaho and alabama can be pretty much considered different worlds.

      hey, what cities do you wellers dream of living in some day, even for a short while?   i'm pretty adventuresome and diverse when it comes to travel in life.  i'll try to do this in order of most excitement  seattle  portland (newly acquired interest becase of blue like jazz) san fran boston so cal (order stops here) (what follows is just mere interest) new york chicago new orleans philadelphia st. louis kansas city  not saying i want to spend most of my life in any of these places.  just an experience of living there.  man, i love not having to write correctly on these things.  of course, i'm moving to phoenix.  i'd probably like ending up somewhere in colorado, maine, kentucky, or south carolina.  stay tuned for many more posts, which will all come very soon.

      i'm posting here to basically make it harder for j to get rid of the ol' blog. i like it.  it feels more open and accessible than the forum.  oh, but i like the forum too.  it's got it's perks.  i think thisfeels more like a conversation than the forum's newspaper clippings.  i know, i know.  this is just my last mourn in letting go.  actually, it might make me start my own.  that might be cool.   again, i enjoy the forum.  organization can be good sometimes, i guess.  also, having two message boards kinda hurts the cause.  perhaps we'd be more focused and intent on putting stuff down when we're only paying attention to one.    so here i say my goodbyes.  i'll miss you young friend.  thanks for all the great moments.  however, i'll try to get in as many posts 'til the last breath o blog is taken.

      To J - hey dude. You bring up a point that applies to me too. I want to express great thoughts in class, but i seem to only regurgitate what other critics have said. Even if I read and read all the time, I seem to become less intelligent; no new thoughts. But, I figure that as long as I feel something, I exist. "I feel; therefore, I am," says LaChelle. Feeling is very important. I have read studies where people who have amygdala damage in their brains make bad choices because even though they can still figure out logically what the better choice is, they don't choose it all the time because of their inability to recognize what the consequences of that decision might feel like. So YAY for JAY!  I now have a thesis for my paper. I now have visions of resources. I shall proceedeth to OU-eth tomorroweth to work and write that horrible horrible paper. My professors do not love me. And should they? I demand they do so. Yet, I still have to write the paper, whether I be loved or not. This is the obligation of life.   All I do is eat bad things and do homework. I look mortifyingly "icky" and my face is breaking out and I'm getting (what's a nice word for fat?) because I have to be locked in my apt. and libraries. What happened to ending college with grace and glamour? Katie Holmes looked so nice as a college gal. So tall, such clear skin. Straight teeth. I envy her Catholic good looks. No, I'm more of the unwashed frantic slob wearing gray sweatpants and surrounded by torn paper and obscure books. And I have grown-up braces. (hangs head). What's that all about?

      hey everyone! YAY, I'm a blogger. I should really be writing my paper for Women Writers class. To Josh - yes, school indeed stinks. There's so much to do! I just tel myself I can do anything for two more weeks. Bring it on! To Cody, about your "relationship topic." I was listening to NPR a while back and there was this author that was being interviewed - Ethan Watters, and he wrote about urban tribes and how people in our generation are delaying marriage even into our 30s and 40s for various reasons (furthering our education, we don't want to get divorced, careers, etc.) and it sounded pretty cool what he had to say. There's a website called urbantribes.net. You should read all the little gems. Some of the stuff is so funny, yet serious. Stuff about how to get the 'rents off of our back and whatnot.    It is hard to be growing up and think how we are def. past our parents generation's marrying age. My mom got married at 19. That's about the time I had my first boyfriend! (I'm a late bloomer relationship-wise, I guess). And after I broke up with him, I was really sad, so this girl (who also had broken up with her boyfriend) and I did a project together for our class and surveyed about 200 people at our school asking about their past/current realationships. Anyway, we called the booklet we made "What to do while waiting for Mr. or Ms. Right." And it's all about celebrating your singleness. YAY. I can send it to you if you want. It has very insightful, uh, insights from tons of people, plus stats on what percentage of freshmen, etc. were dating, married, etc. That's all.    Where's Jaci? I miss you Jaci! Jaci, join the blog.

      Wow, LaChelle! Some of that stuff you mentioned was really cool.  I had never thought to compare Shallow Hal to how God sees us.  That's cool to think about.  (Although I think I'd rather be seen as Sandra Bullock than Gwyneth Paltrow.)  Anyway, we'll have to talk about the points you mentioned from Bruce Almighty next Monday when we have that film class.  I think that will be fun.  Even the stuff you wrote about Zeus and how he divided men and women was cool.  Nice egg joke, by the way!  You  crack  me up!

      ew. rat hair.  YAY - Jaci joined the blog! And I did call her, even before I read her post. I went to church with a friend and then we went to Braums where we talked theology. Well, sort of. I hate discussions about debating how important baptism is to salvation or whether "faith healers" are unbiblical. Kill me now. I always feel as if people are trying to convince me to believe a certan way. This friend is a very conservative church of christ friend. well, sort of conservative. but our conversation was not about doctrine. It was about silly stuff that was somehow incredibly insightful.  We talked about Bruce Almighty (and I know that you guys are going to talk about this later, or maybe already have, so don't kill me if i mention something about it now). We asked each other what we would do if we had the powers of God for awhile (luckily, no lightening struck us) and this turned into all kinds of questions about why God does things the way he does. I wish that I could type our whole conversation out. I thought that show was okay, but the really interesting thing about it was how Jim Carry asked how he could make that girl love him if he couldn't jazz with free will.  We talked about what we might look like in heaven. And have you ever seen Shallow Hal? How that guy dates someone that everyone else sees as physically unattractive, but he sees her as Gwyeneth Paltrow? I think it would be cool to see people that way, through God's eyes. Do you think that maybe God sees us like that? That he looks at our souls? Or maybe he sees everything - how we are physically, what we have the potential to look like spiritually. And of course it changes everyday. Every flashing millisecond.  And why, if God created us in his image - so maybe he has both feminine and masculine attributes - did he separate us into men and women? Maybe to limit us in some ways?  There's this awesome essay by Plato called Aristophanes' Speech on love that talks about in the beginning, we each had eight limbs, and both types of sexual organs, etc. but we were too powerful so Zeus and the gods sliced us in half like a wire through a boiled egg. Now we scramble (ha ha - get it? scra . . . sorry) around frantically trying to find our other half, struggling together to return to our origin. And love does the best it can to help us back to that on earth. Not that I'm comparing God to Zeus or anything. (I may not even understand what the Tower of Babel story was about completely - if it is comparable to that). I'm really just midnight rambling.

I especially enjoyed eating the allowable amount of rat hair that apparently was in the chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  I could barely even taste it.  Anyway, I really don't have much else to say.

      the fact that this has been on my mind for a while lately and yet i haven't even been able to post about it is more evidence for my case.  doesn't it crush you that our culture has made saying "i love you" as strange and embarassing as being caught naked as the moon (wow. no pun intended)?  i'm not promoting that we abuse the meaning and "specialness" of the phrase by saying it so much that we reduce it to a cliche.  but i'm thinking that might be better than not saying it at all.   in other words, as much as the church is supposed to be about loving people (especially each other), saying "i love you" should be so "churchy" that it grows dangerously close to being superficial, just like saying "i'll be praying for you", (insert favorite christian church cliche), etc.    BAM AND THERE IT WAS ( along with the matrix ripple after a heavy BOOM)  do you get what i'm saying?  i wish there were no churchy cliches, but give me a break, we're all guilty of them.  heaven is the only purely authentic existence.  and what turns into these overused-cliche-phrases, but the very core of our beliefs, the center pieces of christian faith - "jesus loves you". (this should make you smile REAL big)   point finally made:  why isn't "i love you" a thoughtles phrase anywhere but in the family?  and isn't the church supposed to be closer than a family?  if love is the center node (thanks chad) of the web of christianity, then why don't we say it at all?  (well i suppose god is the center node, but isn't god love?  sorry, no more disclaimers, see what happens is i think way too far ahead to where people are criticizing (sp) some of my claims)  let's take a poll: would we rather see the saying "i love you" turn into a cliche because of over usage, or never be said at all?  again, i strive for authenticity, as does jacob's well.  i wish these other phrases listed would be more real.  it just doesn't make any sense for the church to be afraid to say "i love you" to someone, but even worse to not ever think it needs to be said, and that's what i believe we are guilty of.  we've just not been conditioned to overspeak it the way we have of "i'll be praying for you".  however our culture has conditioned us to be afraid of saying it at all.  i guess we'll see who the brave people are soon enough, i like you - and like meas love

      I just got home from J & Kenda's house, where we went after eating chicken.  We played dominoes for a long time, but the real entertainment was Kenda.  She was cracking us all up.  Sometimes she would just start laughing for no reason, and her laughter was totally contagious.  There were several times when I laughed so hard that I cried.  That is such a great feeling.  I really think it must be good for the soul or something.  I don't think we do that often enough.  I think we need to find something to make us laugh like like every day.  Maybe it would make us live longer.  Or we could just call Kenda at around 9:00 every night.

      I want everyone to feel a tug toward each other and give meaningful glances and love recklessly and carefully and with aching in our sides. I want every night, there to be a low-lit punk-rock Christian concert with us jumping and headbanging and laughing for God and each other and the good good music-drums. I want relationships to be easy and passionate and comfy as a couch set in the sand by a blue-gray sea where we could sit and watch kids with umbrellas twirl the pinks into the sky and our souls. I want to taste the Lord and people  do they taste like sweet cream or apple Kool-aid pops or pizza? I want to know.   And I know God is here in my carpet or something and I never feel lonely, because somehow I can light a candle or just the Christmas lights in my room, put on Switchfoot, and smell God in the glowing dusk. Im too deliriously happy because theres not too much guilt anymore, just freedom, bare feet, and open windows to the night breeze. I dont ask, wont anyone ever see me sometime soon, and want it. Not anymore. I have enough great things already around me. And love comes in so many forms. Sort of like water. I like them all. What I already have is more than good enough.    To whomever is stirring up the goodness, you are doing a good job. The stars fill the sky quite nicely in my head, behind my eyes, and way up there. Oh, all around me.

      I can't believe that in our discussion of Robin Williams characters we forgot Peter Pan and the Genie from Aladdin!  Those are probably my two favorites, although Mrs. Doubtfire is up there too.  I looked on imdb.com because I knew we were forgetting some good ones.  By the way, Dead Poets Society was made in 1989.  I also saw on there that Robin Williams was in a movie actually titled Seize the Day in 1986.  How weird is that?  Not quite twilight zone, but definitely somewhat interesting.  LaChelle came over tonight and we  finally  watched Dawson's Creek.  I have the first season on DVD, and we always say we're going to watch it but we never do.  But since the stupid aggies were playing basketball tonight and preempted Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill, we had to get our wb fix for the night.  I can't believe osu couldn't win a game to help OU out.  Oh well, at least Nebraska beat Texas Tech.  Thanks for nothing, aggies.  Anyway, back to Dawson's Creek.  It was so fun to watch it with LaChelle.  It took us back to high school days.  Ah, yes, the simple days when the toughest decision was where to go to lunch and who was driving.  Or what dress to wear to prom, although that was a bit of a drama since LaChelle and I bought the same dress.  But she was really nice and took hers back because I bought mine first.  Still, those days were so carefree and fun.  Now Field of Dreams is flashing through my head as I long for those great golden glory(notice the use of alliteration) days of youth.  Wow, I guess you  can  relate those movies to life!  Anyway, I think I've rambled enough for one night.  As much fun as the blog is, Jaci needs her sleep.  Besides, the later it gets, the more random my thoughts get, and I'm pretty sure they're random enough already.  Goodnight all!  Boomer Sooner! (I just had to add it!)

      i can't help but keep reading anything lachelle writes.  it reminds me of my newly declared "favorite writer", anne lamott (author of   bird by bird   and   traveling mercies  ). by the way, i've never declared a favorite writer before so it was a big moment.  lamott's description of life is so exciting, and i find her interests fascinating me even if in reality it would be ludicrous for me to be into miss saigon.  trust me, i'm not into miss saigon.  i'm just saying these people write well.  COME ON PEOPLE GIVE ME A BREAK.  geez i'm just trying to be nice.    anyway, to all who were unable to attend the film and spirituality chat, we missed you.  it was good times.  there were some very cool, vital, pertinent issues discussed, such as which character shoud be the default image in our heads when thinking of robin williams (i.e. patch adams, bicentennial man, mrs. doubtfire, etc.)  and yes, mr. keating is jesus.  oh captain, our captain  wow, i can't believe i just blogged (i really didn't have time to spare either, lucky for you i just realized that) i must go

      I am so sleepy. Medicine does that to me, I guess. Miss Saigon was absolutely amazing! Last night was so much fun and the Civic Center is beautiful in the evening. But poor Kim. Why doesn't Chris go back to her when he hears she is alive in Bangkok? Why didn't he love her enough to keep searching and waiting? There seems to be this running theme in my life . . . well okay, the movies I'm watching . . . like Cast Away. I caught the end of that tonight. Helen Hunt doesn't go back to Tom Hanks. And what did I see before that? Oh, Under the Tuscan Sun. It makes me sad. I almost felt like crying when Tom showed up at Helen's door. I cried out in silence, "Tom, I would have taken you back. I would have not even had to think twice." What is all this crazy business about moving on, eh?   Today, my throat got worse. Please pray for a happy throat. But I still took Tiff (my cousin) to lazer tag, since i promised her that i would. Dude, that is the coolest ever. It's like we were actually in a video game. And there's just something exhilerating about looking out for cover and creeping up on people to shoot them with that laser gun. The room is dark, slightly lit by colored lights and the glowy paint splattered across the walls and all the levels. Then we stuck around for awhile to play air hockey and a few arcade games. I could spend my whole life playing laser tag and air hockey! In our second game, there were about 28 people in the room. I made about 1049 points and ranked 10! I rock. Um, of course, I was probably about 7 years older and at least one foot taller than most of the kids, but we don't have to dwell on that, right?

      jaci, you are so cute. =) you make me happy. open mic night was so much fun. i'm sorry that j got sick though. that makes me sad. i have a scratchy throat. i think it was all that wind blowing anti-lachelle particles around the other day. and of course i had to lay down on my front yard and enjoy the warm weather. bad for the allergies. good for the soul. tonight, i was going to go to the acoustic bands, cause it sounds so awesome, but my friend called and he reminded me that we are going to Miss Saigon tonight! I'm so excited, and I know it will move me so much that I'll want to forsake grad school, start up voice lessions again, and move to New York. Watching a live musical always does things like that to me. It's musicalerific. (glances at Jaci, the linguistic diva, for approval of her new word). Okay, I will work on it.  anyway, i guess that's all i have to say. no great rants of minimalistic pseudo-wisdom. i should do something constructive like take a shower and think about what i'm going to wear for tonight.  Jaci, have fun playing with your itty bitty cousin tonight!

      5.  Fourth of July-Come on, fireworks, summertime, family, barbecue,        independence-what could be better (besides the top four)?  4.  Thanksgiving-Food (duh), football, family, four day weekends, the start of       holiday mall craziness.  It's great!  3.  Easter-for obvious reasons, resurrection, salvation, victory, and fun-      colored eggs in fake grass.  Bunnyrific!  2.  Christmas-for more obvious reasons, the birth of the savior, the generous       spirit that seems to be contagious, the pretty lights, more good food, and      the presents, although not the point, don't make it less fun.  And my favorite holiday...I know the suspense is killing you...  1.  OU/texas!-okay, okay, I know what you're thinking, it's not technically a       holiday, but I can't help myself.  It's a great weekend, and for the past       four years, it's been pretty fun for me (177-54).  Besides, OU students       get the Friday before off, and in 2000 we also got the Monday after off.        So I think any time you get a three or four day weekend, it's a holiday.   So there you have it boys and girls.  Some of you will agree, and at least a couple of you will think I'm crazy.  Okay, so maybe all of you think I'm crazy already.  I can't really say I blame you.

      ha HA. dude, you crack me up. boxes of canadians - this is a very funny image.   today, i substitute taught for a sixth grade class. it was great. tomorrow, i'm going to Winding Creek to sub for a 1st grade class, then on Wed. I finish up training and work a little for Edward Jones. I love this life! I get variety, and I don't really feel like I'm working. And, if I need days off - just because - I can turn down offers for both without feeling guilty. My life is beautiful and stress free.  Of course, I still need prayer for some things. But I'm getting through them somewhat victoriously - or I will eventually. maybe. on the other hand (the realistic one), i'm planning on failing quite a lot and proving to be the very disappointing human I am for these things, so I don't know what to do about that.   i liked what Corey said Wed. night - it was so great. all about our relationship with God being a story. it made me reassess my past and present issues with God. i was going to tell the girls about it in the car, on our way home Sun. night, but then the "Lady in Red" song came on, we all squealed, and had to gaze romantically out my window into the night and dream about being that very lady.   but it's not very interesting - my thoughts - anyway. i'm just glad that i realized a few things. by the way - AMAZING restaurant that I'm instructing everyone to try. Bella Vista on Western and south 58th street. it's a tiny little ma and pop place run by this very Greek family. they yell in Greek on their cell phones and through the kitchen doors like a Good Greek family should. I love that accent so incredibly much. Why couldn't I have been born in Greece? I'm so jealous. But good good Italian food. They won't let you split an entree, and the portion size is enough for 5.2 LaChelle meals, but it's okay, because you can take it to your fridge and extend the joy with others. Cutest restaurant ever - I went there on V-day for lunch.    I want to see the Mel Gibson movie. Jaci suggested it and I'm supporting her, that we should go next Wed. when it opens.  sparkles. Happy Presidents' Day. I hope you wore a tee shirt with the head of your favorite president on it. I don't know who my fave prez is, actually. But that's exciting, because I had thought that I had thoroughly discovered all my favorites of things. I'll have to do a little research. I give myself until Thursday, and then my answer is due. I may assign myself an essay too.

      ok, without giving it much thought, here are my favorites  1. holy week -- i love building up to easter. i guess this could go all the way back to ash wednesday and the beginning of lent, but whatever.  2. christmas -- three kids, christmas morning, the Jesus story and then santa, enough said. 3. thanksgiving -- no cool candles here, but i hate that it feels like a speedbump on the commercial highway between halloween and christmas  4. my kid's birthdays -- fun stuff  lots more -- i'm in to holidays except for all of the goofy ones that cause the banks to be closed on monday.  how about a shirt with canadians putting each other in boxes?

      Oh the beautiful world of a job. Okay, so my lovely little desk job isn't a steady, five days a week thing, but it gets me started towards . . . something. Some higher level of careerness. I might be a stock broker when I grow up.  And now . . . the greatness of Valentine's week. I should wear my Wal-Mart angel wings to work, although I'm not sure how professional that would be. Valentine's Day is my fourth favorite holiday because it celebrates love and passion and pink and red candy hearts, friendship, Charlie Brown, and Power Ranger Valentine cards.  (the following are my fave holidays. come on, you all want to know).  1. St. Patrick's day (it's green sparkles and Irish and Catholic - what, I ask, could be better?) 2. Thanksgiving (I have very nice, pumpkin candle, crepe paper turkey memories of this holiday). 3. Christmas (I would be such a sinner if I didn't like this one in the top three. Actually, this holiday is the most romantic of all with the warm golden lights, and roasted marshmallows, and apple cider). 4. St. Valentine's Day  All the other holidays sort of run together, although I have always wanted a tee shirt to celebrate Boxing day. Isn't that some holiday in Canada? It probably has some horrible historic background, like it was the day when large ancient turtles called "boxings" plummeted to a gruesome death and became extinct. If so, I'm truly regretful of my desire for an article of clothing that would celebrate that day.   But in my mind, I just think of Canadians walking around in red boxing gloves. Don't tell me that doesn't deserve a shirt.

      I'm just going through the Feminine Face of God book and it's making me think in some parts. I don't know how much I like this book, but I'm reading it anyhow. It may even touch on a few things that I'm experiencing right now.   I feel a little stuck, a little limited, maybe somewhat like I need a fresh new lemon-lit brush of hope in my near future. Perhaps I just need to trust myself more.   I look every which way, I don't know exactly which direction I want to go, but the transition period is like the birthing process. Yet isn't everything? I've stayed in the womb for so long, maybe 10 or 11 months, and the mother is past restlessness. I'm getting too big. I feel too big. I don't know what the next step will be.   Or I'm on the edge of a cliff. I just want to be pushed off the cliff and into another space so I can "back up" and continue searching. Or I could jump.   I don't want to feel worthless or useless or unmagnificent, but I do sometimes. Can't I enjoy a little period of free nothing? And in a way, I am, but I'm worried I'm not using my time wisely. I need to go someplace that I'm needed and I have a responsibility to go there.  Yet I need to be more discontent, because I am not enough.  All my life, well, for much of the recent past, I've dedicated myself to live an authentic life in search of an authentic self and I wonder how to exist anymore in certain situations. Perhaps my goal is to learn that there are elements of authenticity in everything. But I've only focused on myself and on religion for my whole life. Sometimes I think I honestly might be well suited for some pastoral convent. But that would almost be too easy for me.  The thing is, it's not a wanting or a lack of wanting that characterizes my life in the crossroads of being in my (almost) mid-20s and finished with college (so far). It's more of a watching and waiting to make some kind of decision, to fall recklessly into the storm-ridden sky plugged with frizzles of purple and gold into other seasons, the cool inside of an expansive but not eternal lava lamp (kudos to Josh for that one), feeling my bare feet hitting the clouds that are strange compositions of not the usual cotton, but deep oceans and gel clumps and just-before-the-rain kind of air.  I'm glad this blog is called "rambings from the well." I seem to take the term literally. Back to the book. Or I will call Jaci.  Jaci, where are you? It's time to watch the Dawson's Creek dvd (wink).

      my friends from college spoke well of eddie izzard. i have yet to see any of his stuff. maybe we should have a little party where all of us Jacob's Wellers bring an item or two we think the group should be exposed to. I'd bring soymilk and Breakfast at Tiffany's. you could bring eddie. well, not the izzard himself, but you know a video. or you could do some impersonations.

      Hey just thought I would suggest a DVD to watch.  All of you people must go to Blockbuster and get the DVD Eddie Izzard Dress to Kill.  Eddie is a stand up comedian, and probably the funniest guy I have ever seen.  Most of it is very intellectual humor.  YOU MUST SEE THIS!!!!!.  But put the children to bed first.

      I am thankful for Girl Scout Thin Mints even though I don't like them very much and even though I don't have any 2% milk to go with them. But I would be less happy without them, so I am thankful.   Seussical was wonderful. I teared up during the "A person's a person no matter how small" song. That Jojo and Horton - I tell you. Okay, and don't kill me, but I could so see Kenda playing Gertrude the bird or the Mayor of Whoville's wife. Kenda, why aren't you on Broadway? Let's go together. You and I. Let's tour London and be a part of the Seussical cast. I'll be Horton. He's so fun.

      I also enjoyed the writer's circle on Thursday.  I wasn't sure what to expect and I didn't bring anything to read because I'm not really a writer, or at least I have never thought of myself as a writer.  I just went because LaChelle wanted me to and I thought it might be interesting.  I had no intention of reading anything.  But when we got there, we were given a topic to write about and I was actually able to come up with something.  It wasn't even close to what everyone else had written, but it was fun.  LaChelle's autobiography was awesome.  She makes me feel so inferior with the way she makes a story about her life sound like Shakespeare.  I don't even understand all the words she uses.  Ray's script was really cool and WB-ish.  J's story was great, as were Quentin and Jonathan's.  Everyone did a great job.  But back to the part about me not being a writer.  It's not that I can't write, but I'm just not usually inspired to sit down and write about something.  If I'm given a topic, then I can write like I did Thursday night.  I'm not saying it will be great, but I can come up with something.  But the really funny thing is that this morning I was totally inspired to write on three separate occasions.  And the topics were all completely unrelated to each other.  I probably shouldn't admit this part, but I actually stopped working to write down what I was thinking about and how I felt about it.  Words just kept coming to me.  I've never experienced anything like that.  So now I have three writings (I'm not sure what you would really call them) that I can share at the next writer's circle or open mic night.  The only problem is going to be working up the courage to share them with people.  That's the scary part.  If I get too scared, I'll just come up with some more OU haikus!  But I'm really excited that I actually almost felt sort of like a writer today.  Maybe I will be inspired more often.  I hope so because it's a cool feeling.

      i'm with lachelle. i loved the 20 minutes of writer's circle that i actually made. there is something inspiring and awakening about hearing different voices. since she spoke well of everyone else (and even if she hadn't) lachelle's autobiographical sketch was incredible as well.  the next time around is april 1. if you haven't come, do. if you have, come back.   btw -- finally reading  anne lamott's travelling mercies . corey's right -- she's amazing.

      I guess I need to get into bed since it is one in the morning and I have to be at the school at 7:30 tomorrow. Ray, my friend from Colorado, came here and he brought Heath. We picked up Jaci and headed to The Well for Writer's Circle which was so much fun. I read a part of my autobiography and Ray wrote a script that we acted out with Jay. I loved hearing everyone's work - I was completely impressed with it all. Jaci's piece on New York was so specific and nostalgic, Quentin had this amazing inner monologue description of New Mexico, and Jay with his very professional-sounding story on his grandfather, then Johnny with his scenic walk through the woods.   Afterward, we drove back to my place to watch the OC, fool around with my video camera, and eat pizza.   Good night all.

      Stacey, Quentin, Josh, Justin, Jaci, and I went to see The Passion tonight and it was pretty amazing. Every shot simulated a photograph and the language was beautiful. Although I felt incredibly horrified and saddened that a human being, no less God, was subjected to such cruelty, (so much was just literally difficult to watch), I felt other things too.   I kept thinking how that was God there and how no one could really kill him. They were doing those things to him, but I don't think of him as a  victim. Even in his weakened, blood drenched states, I kept thinking that no one could kill him.    And it made me think how I really don't understand it all as much as I had thought. It's not discouraging. In fact, it's wonderful. There's a lot more to it that I just haven't figured out. I mean, why all that pain and the short life? Why come to earth as a human at all? Why did God decide to do it that way. It's this whole system that's unfolding and that I don't understand. I don't really plan to understand it this week or next year. But maybe someday I will have a better glimpse.    Well, I have to remind myself that this movie isn't the Bible, but it does give me some things to think about. But now I'm very very sleepy, so I will take out my contacts and get to bed. Enough posting for one day. =)  Thank you for making dinner tonight, Stacey!

      i have never understood why this was such a hard thing for us to say to each other or to the world. those words, cliche or not, carry some power behind them when they are said by a life that backs them up. i have always tried to remember to end services since way back in the mart, texas days with those words and many times i had kids tell me it was the only time they heard them from an adult. sigh.   does it say something that i reference "those words" several times in the preceding paragraph, but never say them.  I LOVE YOU!  ok, now i said it.   i think maybe there are two issues that hold us back. one, in our culture, there is no allowance for a middle ground of "i love you" that speaks to a healthy, loving relationship between any two people. love is either a very cheap word (my dog, ice cream, your car, you man to sell beer) or it is an extremely intense word that means "let's get married" or at least "let's sleep together". we don't necessarily mean it in either of those ways when we say it to each other, but since we are formed by this culture, it feels wierd when we do. (probably moreso for guys and than girls) which leads me to issue two in our wierdly homoaware and phobic culture, it just feels and sounds odd for guys to say that to each other in a "you're my brother and i love you" way. it's not right, it just is and again we are conditioned not to do it. it's like the touching thing.  so maybe we should just say "to heck with the culture" and start saying it among ourselves and out into the world. "they will know us by our love" right?  by the way lachelle -- i don't know that we can say it too much as long as we mean it.   i love you guys.  j

      I think I probably say it too much (raises hand). Back at college, we girls would say it all the time to each other, so I guess I got in the habit. I don't know what it is about Oklahoma Christian girls, but we were all so tight and we always said how gorgeous each other was and everything. We'd bash boys together and we'd hug a lot. And we'd always say "I love you" as we were leaving or hanging up the phone.  It was a little different with boys, although I have several guy friends who say it to me all the time, and I know it doesn't mean "gosh, let me marry you someday" or anything romantic. I think that people assume, when you even use the word "love" concerning them that you mean it as a binding contract or an intention and it scares them off. But anytime I have ever said it, i have never meant it as that. I just meant that . . . oh crap. I'll finish this later. I have to brush my teeth and get back to work. This is an interesting topic Corey.   . . . I'm back. But I have ten minutes until Jaci picks me up, so I really should be getting ready. Yeah, I'll finish this later. sigh.

      I got accepted to the creative writing Ph.D program at the U of Cincinnati! I still have yet to hear from North Carolina and Georgia, but I'll probably go to UC unless another school offers me more moolah. (That is a technical term). In a way, I had prepared myself to not get in anywhere, so I'm having to readjust my thinking a little. I love the people here so much - my family, friends, etc. And Ohio will be cold. But it will be exciting for me - I'm a single woman, going off to another big city to get her Ph.D and continue experiencing life. And the Ohio River is right there, so at least I'll have a little water. I think, unless things change and I go to another school, Mums and I are going to fly to Cin City next month to check out the school and get everything in order. I'm a little scared, but I have a friend - Jonathan Paden - who lives in Dayton, Ohio (45 minutes away). So I'll get to hang out with him and I'm sure I'll make friends . . . right?   Here's to years of 3 a.m. libraries, months of 10 cent Ramen Noodle meals, the drama that is the dissertation, and intimidating professors, crazy roommates, housepets named Wayne, and no free time.   Ohio, prepare for the LaChelle.   Love the LaChelle.  The LaChelle will love you back.   But you know what I'm most excited about? New thrift stores.

      Boys and girls, I must share in my joy.  Tonight I have been privileged to experience the greatness of the last 30 minutes of "The Naked Gun."  Oh, Yeah!  If you ask me, it is absolute brilliance, cinema at it's finest.  I mean, Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley,  AND  O.J. Simpson, who could ask for more?  What could ever be more romantic than "This is our hill, and these are our beans."  Honestly, I know it's sad, but I have been wanting to see the end of this movie for a while because they always use the "Stttrriiiike" clip on the morning animals and it makes me want to see that part of the movie.  It's preatty funny.  Anyway, I just had to share my good fortune with my peeps.  Peace Out, Yo!

      Let's see.  What could I bring to the exposure party?  Is there anything I like that most of you probably know very little or nothing about?  Ah, yes, I think I've got it...NSYNC!  I could bring all of my NSYNC cd's and my videotapes of their concerts and interviews and everything else they ever did.  We could listen to the cd's and watch the tapes and eat NSYNC fruit snacks (insert joke here) if they still make them.  And I could bring my NSYNC board game and we could learn all kinds of NSYNC trivia by playing the game.  Wouldn't it be fun?  Okay, I know what you're thinking.  Just remember I said I'll bring food.

      I thought what we talked about was cool.  I think it's amazing the way God does things sometimes.  You can pray and pray and pray and nothing happens.  Then, just when you think you've gotten your answer, or at least enough to satisfy you for the moment, BOOM!  Then comes what you were waiting for.  I think it's funny the way that all happened, with J just driving home and suddenly there it was.  I think it's awesome that we now have a way to explain who we are and what we do.  I think it's hard to know exactly what all that looks like right now, but I also think that if we just chase after Jesus we don't really need to worry about that because we'll figure it out along the way.  I must say I love the phrase "Rhythm of God."  It just sounds so cool.  I am excited to see what happens in the weeks and months to come as we think and pray about what this statement means to us and for us as a community.

       so does that mean you want to add it? or have you just run out of things to think about.   it's the people's blog -- if we want comments then let there be comments.

      just wanted to check in and say hey. so hey. i miss you guys. just a couple of thoughts from my journey here  - the whole state of arkansas is under construction (i'm sure it will be wonderful when they're done)  - if you flip back and forth between npr and sean hannity it will make you both dizzy and extremely paranoid  - tennessee has two kinds of radio - country and western  - it would really stink to be the highway road kill scooper guy (who knew that was a two-man job?)  - there is nothing more depressing than traffic delayed for 30 minutes when you are ten miles from the end of a ten hour drive  enough. see you guys in a few days. i'm sure i'll be full of brilliannt insights about the drive home as well. see you sunday night.  staring at the hotel walls j

      Okay, so I caved in to the peer pressure.  LaChelle said I should start a blog, so I did.  I don't even know what it looks like because my computer is stupid and won't let me get to it, but maybe you can all check it out and let me know.  The address is: soonerdreams.blogspot.com  Check it out and let me know what you think.  Boomer Sooner!

      There's a lot of love in Jaci's post . . . . YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. Okay, let me tell you that I was THIS CLOSE to being seriously ticked off when Rachel said "I can't do this right now. I'm so sorry," and got on the plane. I mean, you could see the steam beginning to rise inside my brain. But then . . . bliss. With all this true love floating around (What Dreams May Come, the final episode of Friends), I am so happy too. *dances and twirls with Jaci* Where's my Ross and whatever-Robin-Williams'-character-was? Nah, who needs real relationships? Because . . . . . ROSS AND RACHEL ARE TOGETHER FOREVER!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. I haven't completely lost faith in American sit-coms. Dawson's Creek made me doubt, but Friends restored my faith. We like and want the obvious. So give it here. Thank you. *sings, "Ross and Rachel, Ross and Rachel . . . ."*

      Yes, I too am a victim of pop culture.  Surprising, I know.  I also have to confess that "Friends" is the reason everyone could not be entertained by my haikus at the writer's circle.  Maybe I could write a haiku about "Friends" and read it at the next writer's circle or open mic night!  That would be da bomb!  And Rap Mama Chelle is right.  Ross and Rachel do belong together.  He's her lobster.  I'm happy when Ross and Rachel are together.  The world is a better place when Ross and Rachel are together.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, so I'll just say that I'm a pretty happy girl in a pretty great world.  But it was sad to say good-bye.  I love you Chandler...and Monica...and Phoebe...and Joey...and Ross...and Rachel.  I love you Central Perk.  I love you Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.  Oh, wait, what am I thinking?  I have every season on DVD.  And then there's always syndication.  "Friends" will never really be gone!  Yay!  That makes me almost as happy as knowing that there are only 120 days until kickoff!  BOOMER SOONER!  I love you Bob Stoops...and Jason White...and Antonio Perkins...and Mark Clayton...and Dan Cody...

      I regret to say that I am a victim of pop culture. I must stay at home tonight to watch Friends with the rest of America. In front of some tv is where I will be from 7 to 9 tonight.   No, it's not just a story; it's life. Ross and Rachel belong together.

      ladies and gentlemen and the rest of us i am glad (relieved) to announce that the all (mostly, well kinda) new cometothewell.com is ready for public consumption. there are a couple of spaces that are still "coming soon" and i'm sure some kinks to be worked out, but it's all there for you and anyone else you can think of who cares.   play around and let me know of any problems you come up with. i'm wondering about how long some of the pages may take to load so if you run into any problems, give me a head's up.    urlLink www.cometothewell.com    off to coach j

      oy,  i'm making no promises.  all i'm saying is, "i'm back."  or so i think.    anyway, please, everyone take my advice - never move unless you want to.  and if you want to, well then do it.  if you are moving - don't have a yard/garage/moving sale unless you want to.  and if you want to, well then have some very effective drink around.  the end of my life is friday morning from pre-sunrise to around 11am (i have seen it in dreams).  i believe we might also have a yardsale then as well.  please pray that we make in the neighborhood of  $30,000 because that would make my day, and the church should always be praying that our fellows days are made.  i'm toying with the idea (with a real nice fluffy blue feathery cat toy thing too, you should see it) of creating my own blog.  please, no criticisms of lack of showing text on this community blog.  i might, i might not, and if i do i will not let you know, you'll just have to discover it on your own.  poof

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 2 grain 2)  he would do this through his expression by first causing the darkness to be attractive.  he created songs and poems and pondered stories which all revealed the In of their dark Out.  And it wasn't that their In would bring smiles, but the artist knew that was where the stories were.  I have witnessed many spectators of dark art turn away after only observing the shallow.  They had not the curiosity or respect to engage the dark into its deepness where the stories dwelt.  The stories alone could give understanding, that is if there were kings who sought out confrontation with understanding.

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 2 grain 1)  davwig's work was put down by those who could not understand that there were story lessons to learn from the darkness.  humanity's reality.  i suppose this was part of his struggle in action, the fact that others could not be real about the imbedded struggles of their lives.  the public seemed to lose something by not facing darkness, to miss an opportunity to find another beauty.  this artist saw this as the public not embracing a reality that held dynamic vocabulary.  davwig desired to engage them with the world of the deep dark.

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 1 grain 3)  for now, the artist will be named davwig.  reality must be realized because one thing davwig believes to be a right of all individuals is choice of a larger vocabulary.         [TDefinition - Vocabulary - 1. educated worldview. 2. language system            of specific worldview. 3. worldview acted out, practiced. 4. understanding of life and the world.]  the public must not live ignorant of choice.  the artist is not out to force change on the public, but to raise its level of awareness, to create opportunity for choice.  davwig expresses so that he can support opportunity for vocabulary to be altered.

      "stories and not of artists and kings" is an experiment of many kinds. 1. the mixing of narrative with expository writing so that rhetorical effect may be deepened.  2. the changing of verb tense in order to blur the chronology. 3. different points of view of character to give readers a chance to understand as much as possible, to get to know a character more holistically. 4. changing name of character for uses of symbolism and psychological handling of baggage that names bring.  for the three to five of you humoring me, thanks for subjecting yourself to the experiments.  i welcome any comments, which (laugh)will be my only data from this exercise. this is not entirely a game i'm playing but something i hope opens the door of my creativity, and i do desire to send somewhat of a message.

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 1 grain 2)  the artist had come to grips with his state of social unconformity.  he had decided to be a certain kind, to concern himself with the "far out", "scary", "difficult", the deepness of all.  he could live the life of the stranger because he must.  artists, poets, ironists believe the abnormal is nonexistant, the unknown to be respected, the out of bounds to be the frontier.  deciding to protect this ideology was easy for the artist because he believed it to be reality.  reality must be realized.

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 1 grain 1)  he was an artist.  he wanted happiness, and he wanted freedom.  an artist of sorts really, he was into beauty, darkness, imagination, and most recently the other.  no one understood him slightly.  he could be known very close to completely or misunderstood always, and those unfortunates just put up with him.  his thoughts could be scary, and scary was unacceptable.

      hello...pvff pfvvff  ppffvvv...is this thing on...hello hello okay hello my following i will attempt, for you, the impossible. i am semi-committing to do something large with this spot of ramble i have recently obtained.  still know that it is still product of the ironist and surely will remain wavy like superstrings.  but hey, you're my following.  something like this. in the post above (which would be 6, i believe), "stories and not of artists and kings" will begin hopefully a long life.   "stories and not.." will be a very regular recurring feature of this blog (not the sole possessor of rhetoric, however). it is the ironist's attempt at something similar to a part narrative - part expository literature.   you of the following may decide for yourselves how much, if any, of "stories.." to take seriously.   perhaps, this will increase the ironist's blog following.  perhaps this will create an expectation of a different kind for much of the public. you will see what i mean.

      we must get the message out  while in the think tank today (which, by the way, closed today since it was chad's last day at work.  oh man, i wish i would've had this blog or blogged at the well during the duration of the think tank at flexc, you guys would've gotten tired of the other forcing his thoughts on chadborne.)  chad and i discussed t-shirt ideas. here we go: (no colors or fonts were discussed, merely sayings) #1 with a big target covering the whole shirt the text could read "don't love me EVANGELIZE ME"  #2 with the look of the shirt being a marquis sign (however that would work) the text reads "i'm another stupid church sign services at 8:30 and 10:00" #3  this one's a little less sophisticated with a picture of a toilet on the front and text above it reading "i'm going to sit on the toilet" on the back "feel free to slide a tract under the door"  we thought we could sabotage the falls creek t-shirt hut and get our message out to the masses, then thought that was to far to drive.  then the idea of the closer mardel store popped into our head. picture the other using his stealth to pin up these heretical slurs while chadborne pulls the reinforcement shirts from his stuffed jeans and slides them inconspicuously amongst the other "roll-ups".  a very productive last day of the think tank, i feel.

      stories and not of artists and kings (Element 3 grain 1) davwig turn colnem.  singing. what is redemption but a glowing power?  break the earth's crust with a shaking.  we watch the pieces fall away and melt under the rains of innocence.  the helpless must stop.  denouncing denial and accessing an abundance of hope.  criminal turned hopeful.  politician turned hopeful.  alcoholic turned hopeful.  single mother turned hopeful.  the loser nobody ordinary turned hopeful.  may you, day, bring us presence, and may it be name Hero.
