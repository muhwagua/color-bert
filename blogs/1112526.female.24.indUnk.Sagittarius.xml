      Why is it that I never see myself on Blogger's 10 most recently published list?  Chinese new years eve is really cool this year.  There's not a car on the streets, giving you a very unusual but much welcomed calmness.  Then there's the variety of firecrackers that's been going off people's roofs and driveways all through the day and into the night.  Calmness + firecrackers...ha ha.  Inconsistent but not contradictory.  On a sad note, I'm pretty horrified to find out that according to Chinese tradition, you get the red envelope on new years until you are married.  So after a certain age, when your relatives give you red envelopes, they are actually handing out reminders that you are an overgrown child and an old maid.  Fairly cruel and painful.  I read Ahoyhoyhoy's blog today and I must say, I totally agree: what are sinuses good for?  They only make my blasted nose run every morning and cause bothersome bogie to accompany my nasal cavity through the day.  Then there's the boy question: what if you just end up with a repressed Christian man hiding behind the jargon?  Why not just forget the fundraiser and go with the drug addict?  : )  Good thing I'm not dating, right?

      Happy Chinese New Years!  I went to Taipei with my sister today.  After walking through all those department stores, shops, and vendors, we still end up coming home with stuff from Net (none of us ever wondered what that name meant, huh?).  What a boring pair we are : )  Why is it that I feel like I'm forever a teenager when I'm with my mother?  Perhaps that's just what mothers do -- to remind you that even if none others do,  they  can and will still be able to exasperate you.  I watched  Wallace and Gromit  today and realized that I really miss cheese.  I wish I had a dog that I could go to the moon with to bring some back.

      I saw a movie on tv the other day and decided to dub Madeline Stowe "the affair woman", just as Juliette Binoche is "the naked lady".  Might not be totally accurate, but hey...might relieve some of the shock if the former starts sleeping with a priest or if the latter suddenly stripped nude and stayed that way (for those with whom I watched  Damage  in that shady "MTV" place across from Sunrise in 8th grade: it was very damaging indeed).  I'm re-reading some of the  Chronicles of Narnia  books and realized that they are indeed a bit too allegorical.  Might be all right if the story-telling was good; but sadly, it just doesn't compare with the genius of  Harry Potter .  I've decided to move onto C.S. Lewis' adult stuff.  We'll see how that is.

      I miss San Diego!  I miss my old roommates, the nice Nobel Court and Costa Verde apartments, and even the gyms that I go to only once a quarter.  I miss VH1, Bravo, ABC, NBC, HBO, and the TV Guide Channel.  I even miss channels that my friends like to watch - MTV, Animal Planet, Lifetime, TLC - you know who you are.  Have you ever been haunted by the ghost of a bridge you burnt (or caught fire by itself, in some cases), and wondered why it even bothers you?  I'm reminded today of the corollary to Luke 7:47 - he who has been forgiven much loves much.  I love little because I forget how much I've been forgiven; and if I love much, what is there that I can't forgive?

      I wish there was a way I could tell Hotmail how much I do not appreciate all the "good news" I get in my inbox.  I really don't want to increase my penis size.  And I don't want anymore emails from Raunchy Rachel either.  When I try to download Michelle Branch's "Sweet Misery", Kazaa's adult filter notice comes up.  That's just sick.  Bye-bye Lisa!  Hope you have a good flight and a good semester.  Hebrews 11:38 - I have much to learn.  Tell me when you get to the part in Piper's book.

      10:00am Tuesday.  A green Jaguar is parked at a corner near the afternoon marketplace.  I walk up to it and think (in Keanu Reeve's voice), "whoa".  As I proceed to inspect it (first front, then back), I hear someone walking up behind me.  I turn around to see a man clad in standard Taiwanese gangster apparel - flip flops, loose dusty trousers, short jacket, and a surgeon's mask (!).  In my surprise, I smile sweetly.    I saw  Pearl Harbor  for the first time yesterday.  So there must be dissenting opinions on what the worst part of the film was.  I thought Kate Beckinsale's character was horrible.  But who am I to point fingers?  What would I have done, given Josh Hartnett?  *long sigh*...Danny.

      8:00am Hsinchu, Taiwan.  Sound of rain, scooters, and humming of the computer.  Yellowish-gray sky, brown-streaked building, and pigeons perched on an air conditioner ledge.  Cold feet, clammy hands, and cracked lips.  I don't suppose anyone really knows the meaning of some U2 songs, though they do make you either nostalgic or wistful.  But you only feel the former until you really start to remember, and the latter if you are masochistic.  Then again, we all secretly like to be tragic sometimes.      Through the storm we reach the shore   You give it all but I want more   And I'm waiting for you   With or without you   With or without you   I can't live   With or without you

      Happy Valentine's Day!  My sister and I were going to buy chocolates to comfort ourselves, until I realized that I don't even like chocolate.  We mused over what sort of guys our future boyfriends will be.  My sister believes that I'll end up with someone really generic, like "What?? You can get that at the marketplace--didn't have to go to the department store!"  I think that might be, although I don't even know anymore.  I've come to realize that my head is very separate from my heart.  hmm!  That means I'm heartless at times and senseless at times.

      I need Coke!  I really really need a fix right now; I'm practically convulsing.  But, I'm so lazy I don't want to change out of my pajama pants and walk out to the 7 Eleven downstairs. I don't think many people reading this have actually felt derelict -- as in a building, not Zoolander.  But after a month of indolence, I suddenly have the happy feeling of actually wanting to  do  something.  Let's start with going downstairs to 7 Eleven.  My parents have been habitually commenting with dissatisfaction, some of which (when in good humor) - On me leaving my laptop and books in San Diego: "There's not a shred of evidence that you are back from studies.  If someone found your suitcase, they'd think you were A-mei's makeup artist!" On me talking to my Gund bear: "I am going to send you to St. Josef's Center for the Mentally Retarded." On me using wrong Chinese phrases and saying "I wanted to seduce you" when I really mean "I wanted to provoke you": "You are hopeless."

      In a little over 12 hours, I'll be heading for America again.  The return flight always feels nervous and sad, because I'm leaving home behind.  Then it takes the whole getting-used-to period to feel like everything makes sense, which then falls apart easily as soon as I come back to the nest.  My mom bought me a carbon-filter mask to use on the plane, because of the recent breakout of this mysterious SARS virus.  They've given it a pretty meaningless name (I mean, what does Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome tell you?).  I don't mind looking like an idiot on the plane, but I do worry for my family.  There's no knowing now just how many people has it because it has a 2-week incubation period.  My dad says, "Check the news in two weeks to make sure Taiwan is still around."  aiyo!  My country is at war and my home is plagued ... my friends, pray hard!

      When a school says they sent your transcript and another one says they didn't get it, whose fault is it?  Grrr!  I rented  Sweet Home Alabama  today.  I thought it was really sweet.             "Since when does it have to be one or the other?  You can have both roots and wings."       "The truth is, I gave my heart away a long time ago -- my whole heart -- and I never really got it back."        - wow! I hope I never have to use that line. : )

      So, I went ahead and got blepharoplasty less than 10 days before I go back to the U.S.  I actually wasn't in the mood for it, but the chance was there.  So I hope it turns out ok, because right now I look totally deformed.  I wonder what my friends will say.  I watched the awkward and tense Oscar ceremony this morning, while switching an ice pack between my eyes.  I'm so glad Nicole Kidman got the award, and I hope I get to see  The Hours  someday soon.  I remember reading that Gwyneth Paltrow is doing a movie on Sylvia Plath.  That must be Oscar material as well!  Ok, back to the icepacks.

      I got a St. Patrick's Day e-card in the email.  It had lucky clovers and dancing leprechauns.  Insert soundclip from Austin Powers: "They're always after me lucky charms!" ha ha ha.  Thanks to Gloria, who is soaking in essence of China (ie. good sanitation) right now.  Our correspondence always ends with "I love China", "Long live Communism!", or something positive of the sort (think government internet filters).  Next time I go on winter break though, I will want to travel around China and see the places from  The Romance of the Three Kingdoms  and Wu-shia novels.  I also want to barter for jade.  According to Chinese jewelers, jade brings long life, riches, wards off evil, etc etc.  It's like this all-purpose piece of rock!  I've learned to really like pig-blood-cake (that black stuff with sticky rice on a stick).  Yummy!  Then there's Oahmiswa with large intestines.  Mmm!  Blood and guts.  I've forgotten how  strange  Taiwan weather is.        Monday: 27 degrees, hot and sunny      Tuesday: 19 degrees, strong winds      Wednesday: 15 degrees, cold and rainy Crazy!

       I Went Downtown Yesterday  and saw a young beggar in front of Kingstone. He was a boy of less than 15 years - "just like my brother", I thought. Except that he was mentally and physically handicapped and spent his days sitting half-splayed on the ground. He wore no shoes, as if they were too good for the cold dirty walkway on which he sat. Some people did spare their change for him, offering the only perceivable consolation. It must seem like comfort in a broken, blackened plastic bowl. It's a comfort that he can't even pick up and touch, for those thin arms hung somewhat uselessly against his sides. When the bustling of the city finally dies down at night, a certain man or woman must come to take him home. Will it be any warmer than his daytime spot? They might take out a cold lunch pack and feed him. Maybe he understands, and maybe he doesn't. Would he care about the stickiness on his legs or what comes with his rice tonight? Would he wish for his parents' comfort or that they would simply spank him less harshly? It looked so strange that everyone should walk about him dressed in the latest fashion and carrying expensive cell phones. Should I get the white blouse with pink flowers or the azure one with blue flowers? It didn't matter.

      It seems like I've abandoned my blog.  I think it got a bit scary when people told me that they were actually reading it, and when a friend actually took the first step to creating "the stalkers' webring", adding me to it.  Eeek, I think those years of English class in high school has left something permanent ... ok, so that (and this) is a comma splice, what do I care?  Some new minnie-thoughts:  Ode to a Pachyderm  I didn't know that the world's oldest elephant in captivity was right here in Taiwan (!), until it passed away last week.  The news made headlines, and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeo awarded it a posthumous honorary citizen's certificate.  It's sweet that the people loved and took care of it so well.  It is said that elephants have impeccable memory and that they somehow have an innate knowledge of their ancestors' burial grounds, which they go in search of when they are dying.  I wonder if Lin Wang the elephant was thinking of his home in Burma and that secret place where his family awaits when he died in his pen.  MOSt Yummy  There's a new fad from Japan, and it's called MOS (pronounced "mose") Hamburger.  The way they advertise it is, "Burgers with an Asian taste".  Now when you apply that to pizza, that would mean corn or thousand island dressing.  Luckily, it's got nothing of the sort and is very good.  I do think that some Japanese went to California and sent news back about In-N-Out, because they figured out how to make the buns crispy around the sides.  Mmm.  Eskimobile  My parents  finally  decided to get a new family car (I know I should learn to be content, but five people in a Toyota Tercel is just not very pleasant travelling).  So, here comes a much more roomy Nissan Cefiro.  It's white and is named the "Excimo".  My mom called it the "Eskimo" by mistake, but I thought it was very appropriate so didn't bother to correct her.   Hairus disasterus  I thought that I'd try a super-short cut one more time, especially since no one here knows me anyway.  Now I look like a boy (think  Joan of Arc ).  I'm so sad.

      Connie's right, there is such a thing as a free lunch!  I was at the cafeteria in De Anza, being my very clumsy self.  I was walking around with a salad and a Coke, and my dressing dropped and splattered over my pants.  So I remembered, trays ... And when I finally make it to the cashier I find out I have no cash in my wallet.  So the guy told me to just take the food and pay later. "Well, maybe I should leave the food here." "No no, take the food.  I didn't ring it up." [smile, wink] "Um...[dumb stare]...ok." As I walk out pondering when I'm going to come back with cash, I forgot to say "thank you"!  There were people performing outside in the quad.  It's funny because I don't like "Tears in Heaven", but hearing it brings back nice memories.  I hate the idea of possibly missing out on the high school reunion.  *sigh*  I'll have to figure things out.

       I Love the Lord, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy. Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live. - Ps 116    You are my God, and I will give you thanks; you are my God, and I will exalt you. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. -Ps 118

        The Return of the King   is SO good.  If you are stuck in  The Two Towers , trust me, it'll be all worth it :) .  Unless they make the movie 6 hours long, I don't see any way it can do justice to the book.  As for dreams, I've got one too.  I'm in the next Harry Potter book, and this time the story revolves around a tortured infant wrapped in bandages and hanging from from a white gauze-like sac in a Hogwarts classroom.  That's supposed to be protection from Voldemort, who has a mysterious (and sick) obsession with it.  Then you can't trust anybody, because they could all be using the Polyjuice Potion.  So I have no idea what is going on and I don't want to look at that half-dead baby hanging from the ceiling.  I just kept thinking, "Ok, this is so not fun anymore, J.K. Rowling.  You suck!"  Hopefully on June 21st, my fears will prove unfounded.

      I'm going to start adding links to other people's blogs.  It might be a slow process, since I don't know many people who do.  First, there's going to be  urlLink Lisa , who I started this whole thing for.  Then there's my  urlLink sister .  A few things about hers--it's Chinese (one way to brush up on your reading) and oozing with emotions of a little teenage Pisces girl ;) .  I keep listening to this by Michelle Branch (should probably stop) -   Of all the things I believed in I just want to get it over with Tears form behind my eyes But I do not cry counting the days that pass me by           I've been searching deep down in my soul           Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old           It feels like I'm starting all over again           The last three years were just pretend And I said goodbye to you.

       Conversations with the Driving Instructor  DI: Why are you so thin?  You only got skin on you.  Why don't you eat?  Are you a very stressed and unhappy person? Me: Er ... maybe. DI: Good thing you don't have a boyfriend.  If you do you'll be worse. Me: What?  I thought I should be more happy. DI: Not if he doesn't really love you. Me: What?! (The bastard, I'll get you for this.)  Me: So do you have any kids? (Betcha don't have any daughters) DI: Yes, they're in college. Me: Oh, what are they studying? DI: One's studying Media at UCLA and one's studying Communications at UCSD. Me: Oh, they're both daughters? DI: No, both sons.  (Ha, I was right) Me: Really?? They chose pretty girly majors.  (Ha ha, slighted you.)  DI: Wow, so you passed the test. Me: Yeah, you got lucky. DI:  Me ? Me: Yeah, because last time my driving instructor boasted that none of his students ever failed.  But, I broke his winning streak and thereby tainted his reputation. DI: Oh, heh ... he couldn't have been that good.   and Others  Me: You two are a good match.  She's so  feminine  I'm a man next to her! William: Ha ha ha.  What?! Me: Don't tell me you can't tell the difference? Will: Yeah I know what you mean.  But if you're going out with a guy, don't tell him, "You know what, I just don't feel very feminine." Me: Ha ha ha.  Okay.

      I had a lot to blog about during my first week or two in San Jose, but now that it's past I've lost interest in writing about it.  Sort of like how I lose interest in reading my own diary.  Sort of like how I want to delete my blog now ... so it's best that I don't read my own entries.  I've seen some pretty funny blog titles in the recently-published list, for example: 1.) I Used to Be Schizophrenic But We're Okay Now 2.) Mortality is the Leading Cause of Death . . . ok, I feel like I need a third one for it to qualify as a list, so help me out.  I got to go to Berkeley this weekend!  Lisa took me to her church for Easter service, which was nice.  I think I dozed off a bit during the sermon, but I clearly remember the pastor saying, "you must take action.  those who have hope take action.  so take action Minnie!"  And that's how I woke up.  Not really.  Talking to Lisa is so fun, as always.  I'm glad I left a bit earlier so she could study, because there's no stopping our chatter as long as I'm around.  I sometimes remember people's birthdays, and sometimes I don't remember until a month afterwards.  Here's to the Aprils - Happy Birthday Ron, Sharlene, Molly, Dick, my little brother (Bear), and those whom I know but didn't know it's your birthday.  Gosh, I'm so lame... :)

      My one-day stop in San Diego.  Everything is the same - quiet, chilly, slow ... Sudden withdrawl from the constant bustle and climatic changes of Taiwan.  I woke up so early this morning.  I hope I can keep it up for another few days, because blue light is supposed to be good for getting over jetlag.  I have a feeling I might fall into a deep sleep something this afternoon.  Maybe I will work on this 600-piece 3D jigsaw puzzle of Camelot.  Jenny Ho and her college friend pieced together the tower of Pisa last night.  It's really leaning! (and a bit cracked as well, *chuckle*).  I found this cute little name card holder by Jenny's computer, and it's filled not with people's name cards but bible verses and inspirational quotes.  What a cool idea!  And God just spoke to me with the first card on the deck: Philippians 4:13, "I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength."  --> God is in every tomorrow,       Therefore I live for today,       Certain of finding a sunrise,       Guidance and strength                for the way.                -  Laura A. Barter Snow   It is so amazing because that was exactly what I've been praying for in the past two days - that God will give me strength, assurance, and the knowledge that He is there in my every future, with everything ready and planned.  And he sends me a card with his answer on it.  :)

       Good times with Jess  Jessica moved in with her brother recently.  We went grocery shopping yesterday and then to her bro's place, where we drank Mike's Lemonade (I've always wondered if it was more than just lemonade ...), took pictures, laughed, took pictures, and laughed some more.  Lucky Howie's gone to Europe for an entire month, so I get to have Jessica all to myself on a friday night!  Hmm, that sounds a bit sketchy.  I wish we could all go to Europe.  Then I can catch  Harry Potter  on paperback.  We watched this badly conducted study of female v. male brain development on Discovery Channel.  Discovery's really gone stupid and tabloidy - like Newsweek.  So we just talked about other people, ourselves, other people, and more of ourselves.  We shared embarrassing underwear exposure stories from high school.  We complained about how hot it's been lately, and I told her about  The Stranger  and how I totally connected with that book.  Because I lived in Taiwan, I knew exactly what it feels like to be so hot that you just want to take a gun and shoot somebody(s).  It's that shake-your-fist-at-God, I'm-alone-and-suffering, why-is-everyone-treating-me-this-way feeling.  Then, as usual, we secretly promised to vouch for each other's innocence should either of us ever be compelled to do something irrational.  I wanted to treat Jessica to  Nemo , because she was having a bad week; but she didn't want to watch it.  Can you believe that??   Every body wants to find Nemo!  I already know that my favorite character is going to be the turtle.  I love turtles.  ... and Others  A couple of weeks ago, I was eating Korean food with Jessica and Howie.  They told me that they were watching  Harry Potter and the CoS  just before they left to pick me up.  Then Howie started thinking that it was strange that his middle-aged uncle would rent that movie for himself. "I don't know, maybe he secretly wants to be Harry Potter", said Jessica. "A Chinese Harry Potter?  Ha ha.  He'll have to be Harry Wang instead", Howie chuckled. "Harry Wang!" Jessica and Howie both burst into uncontrollable giggles. In typical Minnie fashion, I join in after a half-minute delay ... and continue a half-minute in excess.  :)  I swear, I never want to marry a Wang.  Minnie Wang?  Kill me now.  Come to think of it, I'm remembering another phallic joke from Stella Han's math class.  But I think I'll save that for later, lest anyone accuses my blog of having bad taste and "low water level".  I'm going to see Sandra dance tonight!  Yay.

       He's changing me My precious Jesus I'm not the person that I used to be Sometimes it's slow going But there's a knowing That someday, perfect I will be.   from Friday, June 16 - Genesis 13.  When the time came for Abram and Lot to separate, Abram in his generosity and humility offered Lot the choice between two lands.  Lot looked up, and seeing that the plain of the Jordan was lush and pleasing, chose it for himself.  I've always thought that it meant Lot was a selfish bastard (or nephew), end of the story.  Naturally, that wasn't the point.  Lot did what any of us should do - make informed, logical, and practical judgments.  If the lives of my family, flocks, and herds were dependent on my choosing one land over another, I should hope that I choose the better-looking one.  God isn't saying, "Make sure you choose the worst of the lands.  It must be dry and rocky, so you can't water your flocks or grow any crops.".  The problem wasn't in Lot's decision, but the criteria on which he based it.  He chose what was pleasing to his eyes and pitched his tents near Sodom, even though the men there were wicked and sinful.  God is telling us, as he told Abram, to "lift up your eyes from where you are."  The fertile land we look for is not on earth but in heaven, and faith is to be like Abram and acknowledge the Lord in all that he does.  I could really use this lesson because I base so many of my choices, conscious or unconscious, on my "eyes".  I'm so easily lured away by what looks attractive or promising that I'm completely blinded from God's criteria.  The songs we teach kids at sunday school can be very applicable to ourselves: "Trust and obey, there is no other way.  To be happy in Jesus is to trust and obey!"  I spent the weekend at my aunt's house.  We took my cousin Maritha to The Baylands Nature Reserve, this piece of marshland across the water from Fremont.  It's kind of nasty to think that your sewage flows into the bay from there, but I thought it was really beautiful.  I love the salty smell of the sea (which you don't get in San Diego) and walking along wooden planks.  The signs say that you can see birds like the blue heron there, but I guess it's not the right season.  We tried to feed the ducks at a pond, but they didn't care for any food.  My aunt joked that Palo Alto people are too rich, even the ducks are loaded.  So I just watched as my little cousin threw large chunks of bread at the ducks (yeah, she actually hit a couple).  It was cute.

      I feel somewhat betrayed.  Will has us in his links, while I didn't even know his blog existed.  My self-proclaimed reigning blog pimptress is going to flip when she finds out.  tsk tsk.  ;)

      woohoo!  I must celebrate Jenny's decision to start a blog.  It's true - email killed post mail, and blogs killed email. I spent another half-of-a-week in SF and Berkeley.  I was so excited about posting my bible study notes, but I forgot to bring them with me.  I did something else that's stupid - left my one and only floppy disk (which has my resume and unofficial transcript) sitting in the a:\ drive of a computer in UC Hastings College of Law.  Now I'm fumbling behind the computer at the library trying to use my flash memory stick (another one-and-only).  Let's see ... yesterday, I finally got to meet up with Howard.  It's nice to realize that even though we've changed so much, we still get along just as well.  Even though both of us grew taller and one of us got fatter, we could almost be like kiddies skipping to school again.  Ok, it's just an expression.  I just feel this bond with my Taiwan people, because we've seen each other through the most unflattering circumstances :) .  I was chatting with Lisa as we drove around looking for a place to study (which, I've come to notice, typically ends up at Berkeley Espresso).  We began to wonder, why is it that most love songs talk about how good a girl looks?  Girls don't want to be told that they have a nice personality.  If you told someone, "I love you for your wonderful personality", she's going to think, "What, so I'm ugly or something?".  Every girl wants to look good ... and every guy wants to look.

       Notes to self  There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. - Pr 14:12 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight.  As it is written ... "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile." - 1Co 3:19-20 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. - Job 13:12  The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.  Who can understand it? - Jer 17:9 When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. - Ps 73:21 Whom have I in heaven but you?  And earth has nothing I desire besides you. - v.25 Show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths; guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long. -Ps 25:4-5  Wise words from Becky: If someone tells you the stove is hot, don't go touching it! Actually, I did that when I was little.  I knew that the gas range was turned off, but I wanted to know if it's still hot; and if it was, how hot.  Well, a badly blistered finger gave me the answer.  I'm excited about staying with Lisa for the summer.  I've asked her to hit me over the head with the bible everyday when I live with her.  She kindly offered to read it with me instead.

       Why  selfishness, disappointment. jealousy, doubt. greed, shame. betrayal, scars. . . I don't know why I still hope.  Must be stuff like Sonnet 116, 1 Corinthians 13, and "All I Want is You." ;) Take care, you.  I miss you.  women  I saw Sandra Day O'Conner talk to a group of law school students on C-Span the other day.  I can't believe she graduated from Stanford but couldn't find a job because law firms wouldn't hire women at the time.  It's amazing what she had to deal with.   Pretty inspirational!  take this?  Orthoevra.  "So, if you don't want to forget to take the  pill  everyday, put on the  patch ."    Side effects include blood clot, stroke, and heart attack. Don't you just love it?

       So why is the giraffe green?  I guess it's time to tell the story behind the namesake for this blog, for whoever wants to know in the future.  Last summer I went to visit my friend at UCLA.  We were at a Longs Drug and I spotted this stuffed animal smiling from a shelf. "Oh Jenny, look look, it's a green giraffe!" I shouted excitedly "Yeah, it's really cute.  Are you going to get it?" I did, and clutched it happily as we proceeded to the checkout.  By the time we reached the counter, Jenny was suddenly able to put into words what had been troubling her for a few long minutes. "Wait Minnie, that's not a giraffe." "What?"  I was incredulous. "It's a dinosaur" "What?!"  I suddenly recognized it for what it was but stubbornly denied it. "Minnie, I saw the real giraffe over there ..." [pointing to an aisle we just passed] "Well, this one's green so it's different!" That same night, Sandra and Lisa drove down from Berkeley and confirmed that it was not a giraffe.  I'll never admit that to you, though.   "I would like  the-rapists  for 200 please"  Yesterday afternoon Jessica and I sneaked into her overbearing, very Christian, yuppie brother's new Silicon Valley bachelor pad.  We had a good time laughing at his four closetfuls of fancy suits and color-coded shirt racks (I guess it's only funny if you knew that they were strictly reserved for Sunday wear).  I also marvelled at his stack of bibles. Me: Wow, he really studies it Jess: So, do you want to marry him? Me: Um ... out of love for you, Jess. Here are the minimal requirements to be considered for Mrs. J. Tang --  trendy, traditional, submissive, good cook, and a popular church member. So now I know why  he's  single, but why am I?  ;)  I was commenting to Jessica about how someday, I want to get it on the record that I have ADD, SAD, and Narcolepsy. Jess: No problem.  When I get my license to practice, I'll give you whatever diagnoses you want. Me: Wow Jess, I don't now how to repay you!  I suppose I could hook you up with prescription drugs. Jess: Okay!   Nerd at heart  Dick has been savoring the thought of being on top of the (academic) world and graduating with a handful of attractive job offers to "settle" for. Me: No wait, you still have to get the Nobel Prize and Dick's Law of ... I forgot, what was it? Dick: Co's Law Me: Co's Law?  Sounds like a salad. Dick: He he he.  That's exactly my point. Me: Ha ha ha.  [Pause] We're such nerds.

        Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   -  It's mine mine mine!  It came to me, my preciouuus.   "Ugh! Don't even  try  to justify yourself," says Lisa warningly.  I accidentally revealed spoilers to  The Return of the King  yesterday, and have since been trying stupidly to cover up the mistake.  So the best thing to do now is to shut up and act remorseful.  I feel like there's something scary about Paul Frank, but I don't know what it is.  I feel like behind all the cutsie-ness, something strange is going on.  Maybe it's just Julius the monkey (I'm scared of primates), or Devil Julius, or Skurvy the Skull, or the really goth-like people who work at the store.  Maybe it's like Urban Outfitters - not that the store was made for homosexuals, but that gay people tend to like their clothing.  Nevertheless, if anyone finds out what the deal is with this guy, let me know!  I want to watch  Quills , but isn't the Marquis de Sade a very sick man?  But then I think of every French film I've ever seen or heard of, and they're all pretty sick.  What's this obsession with blood and sex?  Can somebody say "simmer down" in French?  Ok, I have to stop all this rhetorical questioning, or this blog is going to turn into a Xanga (oooh, that was offensive!).  Sorry.

      It's one of those times when you watch your friends leave, and you feel this pang of being left behind.  I'm not crying, because I have dry-eye and a heart of stone.  But eventually it's going to bubble up and brim over, and one day I'm just going to burst into inconsolable sobs.  I can almost predict that day, but I'm hoping that it never comes.   Sunday, June 22:   Stuck in traffic, part II.  Missed church.  Missed breakfast.  Lunch in Walnut.  Lilian, when asked if her Chinese-medicine doctor was well-known, replies, "Oh yes.  He's really good.  He got lots of sterile women pregnant."  Thanks for the laugh, Lileo.  Light drizzle as we leave from Lilian's to pick up the rental car.  Our plan was nearly foiled when we found out that the car rental had neglected to tell us about the age restriction on mini-vans.  After much distress, the manager had compassion on us (God's Grace, part I).  Molly leads in prayer, and we set out in our Grand Caravan.  I pop a Dromomine and fall asleep as Mary drives, Lilian navigates, and the sun sets behind the hills on our left.  I wake up to a darkened sky and Molly's voice saying, "Wow, look!  The stars are so pretty."  We calculate the number of miles until our Courtesy Inn, and hearts sink as our drivers announce that we won't arrive before the check-in closes at 11:00.  We pull up to the Inn at 10:50 (God's Grace, part II).  Li, Mary, and Lilian are the first to claim their beds, while the rest of us fight over who we don't want to sleep with :) .  Bridge game, part I.   Monday, June 23:   Wake up and smell the ocean.  The sun comes out at Hearst Castle.  Oohs, ahhs, and many photographs.  2:00pm - we pass up $3.00 gasoline at Piedras Blancas.  No worries.  Sliding down slopey roads.  At our left, the ocean is clear and green.  On our right, the brown hills roll along with a gray mist brushing across the tops.  Many more miles and no sight of a gas station.  The gas meter moves to "Empty" and we are going uphill.  Time to worry.  We come to a 76 gas station.  $3.50/gallon.  Praise the Lord.  (God's grace, part III)  5:30pm - Lover's Point, Carmel.  "We came from San Diego for this??"  Clambering on the rocks.  Marvelling at the apparent depth and coldness of the ocean below.  Spotting a seal.  "From La Jolla Cove to here ...".  "How ro-man-tee-kuh oh!"  6:30pm - singing along to Jahn-Jeng-Yueh's "Love Me, Don't Go" on the 68 East.  8:00pm - Cupertino Village.  Beef noodles and dirty spoons.  We finally reach our lodging for the remaining of the trip - Li's house.  She lives off of Mary.   Tuesday, June 24:   Off to San Francisco!  Union Square.  Macy's.  Starbucks 1.  Banana Republic.  Starbucks 2.  Paul Frank Store.  Starbucks 3 - Connie can't stand it anymore and succumbs.  The Academy of Art College.  The Metreon.  Jelly beans (booger, black pepper, earwax),  digital postcards, Gundam action figures, and a Legolas cutout.  North Beach.  Freaky bathroom at an Italian restaurant.  9:50pm - Castro St. back to Eva's place in Sunset.  10:20pm - home to Li's.  Bridge game, part II.   Wednesday, June 25:   Rubbing on sunblock for a hot day at Napa Valley.  We find Sharlene at her sister's place in Martinez, and drive drive drive to Napa Valley.  I'm periodically shaken out of my doze when Lilian gets off to ask for directions.  Our brave drivers finally find their way to Sterling Vineyards, and we hop on the lifts to our self-guided tour and wine-tasting.  We don't really appreciate wine, but we like the Malvasia Bianca.  Good-bye to Sharlene.  Dinner at Le Cheval's in downtown Oakland.  Amongst the "guests" was Lilian's middle school crush.  Very  interesting  albeit friendly guy. :) Minnie stays behind in Berkeley.    And then there were four.

       "80% of life is just showing up".        Our commencement speaker quoted Woody Allen in his speech on Sunday.  Being an easily distracted person, I only collected bits and pieces of the speech.  The parts I caught were good, though not entirely coherent to me as I'm trying to recount the main points.  Most people were just fiddling about and looking up to cheer to phrases such as "... graduated in 5 years", "... Revelle is the first and best college at UCSD", "... finishing the Humanities sequence", or "... Provost Bond will be retiring ...".  It struck me how important it was being able to "show up".  Five years ago, I did not envision graduation as it is today.  I wanted Phi Beta Kappa, acceptance to medical school, and a steady boyfriend to take along.  It's good to be reminded that "Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails (Pr 19:21)."  God's purpose was to reveal my sinfulness, my pathetic strongholds, my self-defeating attitudes, and ultimately, his immeasurable grace.  "But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me (2 Co 12:9)."  Amen!       So the speaker's point was to tell us to always question  why  we showed up and to remember to get lucky in life.  For him, luck = preparation + opportunity.  I guess it meant that everything we work hard at is meaningful, because opportunity is nothing if without the preparation.  It was encouraging, commending, and everything you need to hear at a commencement, I suppose :) .  So we moved our tassels to the left, released the doves, and this is the end.  I realized that there are so many people I had still to meet (like the CAPE guy that looks like Jet Li) and so many people I wish I met earlier (like my 5th year roommates or that Joe who graduated my freshman year) and the English major I never switched to.  But before I cry for my loss, I have to first rejoice in my gains.  I would not have had a taste of any of the many blessings throughout these years if it wasn't for God's grace.  I would not have been able to understand that they were blessings at all.  I would not have "shown up".

      I don't like John Mayer.  It's nothing personal; I just hate his songs.  They've been playing them on the radio since last year.  If I hear "Your Body Is a Wonderland" one more time, I'll pee in my pants.  I'm packing up and leaving Cupertino.  Tomorrow morning, Lisa's going to come and wisk me away to Bear Territory, where I hope to find a hobby to occupy me for the summer.  It's decided.  I'm going back to SD for graduation.  It's a year after the fact, but better late than never.  It's funny how graduation ceremonies work.  You just go with your cap and gown, write your name on a card, and walk across the stage.  They wouldn't even know if you weren't in the class, or didn't even go to the college for that matter.  My friends joked that I should've come up to Berkeley last year and walked with the MCB department.  After all, I was a Cal student at heart.  All right, so Sunday. June 15. 3:00pm. RIMAC Field.  If you're in SoCal, come!  :)

      Finished  Portrait in Sepia  today; it's very good!  I was embarrassed to find out that I had been pronouncing Allende incorrectly ... and I'm supposed to be proficient in Spanish.  Jenn, who cautiously corrected me, must've felt the same pain in her ear as I do when people mispronounce Nietzsche or Wiesel.  Oh well.  Potato, Potahto.  After spending some time with a friend yesterday, I felt a mixture of emotions.  For no apparent reason, I started thinking about  The Bluest Eye .  Why would a woman love someone else's children more than her own?  Why would a  black  woman love someone else's  white  children more than her own?  She despises her own kind.  She feels more honor in being a surrogate for another family than in her own God-given motherhood.  A person can feel rightly discriminated against because she has learned to despise who she is.  Why do women allow themselves to be oppressed?  I know of a girl who grew up in a family of deluded men.  Their attitudes are so outlandishly chauvinistic that it's almost comical.  What's not amusing is that the women condone it.  They accept the stifling ignorance of a tradition.  They consent to the oppressiveness of a backward culture.  They consciously protect the male ego and offer themselves up as magnifying glasses for men.   They unconsciously depreciate themselves, scorning their daughters and revering their sons.  What's the sociological factor behind this psychology; or what is the psychological factor behind this sociology?  Maybe it's just the age-old curse, "Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."  So what do we do about that?  I recall reading Elisabeth Elliot for a women's bible study last summer, and it just frustrated me more.  Some of my discipler's parting words to me were, "When you acknowledge the price that God paid for you in sacrificing his only son, you will appreciate your infinite value and royal status as a daughter of the King."  I miss sharing in her wisdom.  I guess it's time to make an appointment with the King.  It's always - seek him first, ask later.  Right? (can't really answer, can you?)  So I think this ranks as one of those ramblings that make absolutely no sense.  Oh well, it's  my  nonsensical blog, so there.

      I like: green hills, blue skies, and clouds that seem to just light up/  billy joel's "for the longest time"/  friends that share/  friends that care/  friends that aren't here ...  okay, it's again too late to be blogging.  go ahead, throw your cabbages and tomatoes at me.  So I've been wondering how come Sandra doesn't update her journal anymore.  I always have to go to Andy's website to see what she's up to.  Tsk tsk ...  I'm going through Sandra's old high school senior year page, and I found this hilarious list of things our classmates submitted for the graduation issue of the school newspaper.  It goes,   Remember When ...     Jack got hit in the... by a dodgeball?  (I remember poor Jack being hit with lots of things by lots of people, including me.  Well, we've all done things we aren't proud of.)  we spent more than half of our waking  hours sitting in one room together. Not  to mention breathing the same air for how  many hours?  (we did, and it was filthy air.)  we copied homework, cheated on tests,  stole from the store, broke into the  classroom? ...neither do I.  (yep, yep, yes, definitely yes, and neither do I.)  Minnie walked into English class soaking wet.  (I ditched school to finish an English paper; took the bus to the bottom of the hill, rain poured down on me out of nowhere as I hiked up to the school, and I walked into class drenched.  so much for sneaking into the room without Ms. Anderson noticing.)  we took pictures of our shadows on the concrete and of our reflections in the windows.  (apparently, we still do that.)  makes me laugh.

      I'm going to post on this just for the sake of not letting this die out.  Truth is, I'm getting so lazy that I don't even care to talk to myself anymore.  Lisa just got her free copy of John Piper's  Don't Waste Your Life  and immediately tosses it to me, thinking "Here, you need it more desperately."  That on top of my  The Purpose Driven Life  ... I think God's trying to drop me some hints.  So I should probably listen, or it will be like hitting the snooze button - do it enough times, and it's going to just stay silent forever.  The past weekend I've been criticized for being mean, closed-minded, and having too many inside jokes  with myself .  That last one I consider a bit harsh.  :) Since my bible study on James tells me to act out of love and wisdom, here's a chance to practice that.  I'm starting to get scared about going to school, although I greatly welcome it after this 8-month vacation (enough time for most people to have a baby).  Oh well, I think I'll continue this some other day.  It's 2:00am and I don't care to think/write anymore.  I'm chatting with somebody online ... that's much more mindless.  ha.

      Right now I kind of wish I had a little stash of  wallets  like Connie does.  My wallet is ripping and I haven't been able to find a replacement.  I was at Ross this morning and I noticed that this girl seemed to be following me around, looking at all the handbags and wallets I had just looked over.  I thought to myself, "she must really like my style."  But then I remembered, "Wait, I'm in  Ross  ..."   I finished the fifth  Harry Potter  last night, and I really wanted to cry.  But I couldn't.  And it makes me upset that I did't.  If  urlLink Lisa  wants a heart of stone, she can have mine.  I'm going to go on a rant about  Harry Potter  so don't read on if you don't want any spoilers (see, blogs are nice because you can go back and warn people  after  you've already blabbed). ____________________  So  urlLink word  was out before the book was released that Rowling was going to kill an important character and that she walked crying into her kitchen after having done it.  Still, I had no idea how hard I was going to take it.  The blasted woman has me where she wants.  The victim has become my sister's and mine favorite character.  I'd really like to see how Rowling is going to make up for the damage she's done.  At this point, I feel like Sirius Black has taken the whole story down with him (I'm sure I'll regret this rash comment, but whatever).  He died in a lousy scene which I don't exactly consider to be "battle".  Even if Voldemort dies in the end, will it make up for all the lives he ruined?  Even if Harry saves the day in the final chapter, will it make up for all that was lost on his account?  Maybe that's where the author's purpose comes into play.  What exactly is she writing about (is there actually a theme to this)?    The first few in the series felt like a jolly good read, where the bad guy never really posed a threat because it seemed as though Harry would always take him down in the end.  But now it's like the author sits me down - as Dumbledore does to Harry - and tells me, "sorry I had to break this to you ...".  So this is where I realize that she's clever (or just plain annoying); she's directed me onto the right tracks of questioning and then she takes her time answering to it.  Urrrrgh.  I'm going to start a list of on-going questions/predictions.  A lot of it will be irrelevant/inaccurate, but oh well ... we'll find out.  :)  > In Book 3, Harry used a time-turner to save Sirius and Buckbeak; why couldn't he do that again?  Why don't people just keep going back in time to set things right? > What is the deal with the people in paintings (do they have minds that work/how much of the real person resides in them)?  Can't Harry just get his hands on portraits of his parents and ask them questions? > Since the students are taught to defend themselves against the dark arts, does that mean they should never practice those themselves?  Are good wizards incapable of using the Unforgivable Curses? Harry wasn't able to properly use Cruciatus, and Dumbledore apparently refuses to kill the Death Eaters/Voldemort even though he had many opportunities to.  Why does Dumbledore show mercy?  What is the thing which he mentioned that is worse than death? > It still isn't explained why Harry saw a look of triumph in Dumbledore's face at the end of Book 4.  What does it mean? > If Harry is protected by his mother's blood, how can Voldemort use it for himself?  Since Harry saved Wormtail's life, he owe's Harry a sort of "life-debt", like Snape to James Potter.  Why isn't he bound to it? > Since Ron's pet turned out to be an unregistered animagus, could other people's pets (Hedwig/Crookshanks) also be wizards in disguise?  Crookshanks was seen walking with Padfoot in Book 3, which wasn't very animal-like.  Also, what is the deal with witches and cats?  They're not magical creatures, but they seem to bear some significance (think: Professor McGonagall, Arabella Figg, Mrs. Norris, Crookshanks). > Rowling had once mentioned that it was important that Harry's eyes were green.  Is there a significance in the color green? > What is behind the veil in the Department of Mysteries?  What exactly is death, by wizard definitions?  What is the full story on ghosts?  ... to be continued

      It's been 7 days since  urlLink reunion  week began.  I feel like I don't need to blog about it because it's been so extensively debriefed already.  Reunion with my high school class was another all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end kind of event.  We had a grand time fellowshipping in unabashed dorkiness and running around San Francisco with unrestrained inanity (how do you describe to people how we took turns jumping off the steps at Union Square and screaming our names for all those to hear?).  We re-FOBinized certain member(s) of our class who left Taiwan early while belting out classic Chinese tunes at the karaoke.  We saw the sights, talked the talk, balled the ball, and barbecued Charles' place out.  We lived it up at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for $20/room (the thought still makes me smile) and managed to break the "grad-trip curse".  I felt true support through my home girls and praised God for answering our pre-reunion prayers.  On the last night, we gathered everyone's cameras and burned the pictures onto CDs for everyone.  Lisa put up a few  urlLink highlights .  So that was it; we actually did it.  I was thinking about listing out everything we did, but that just isn't going to happen.  I'll let the pictures do the recounting.  It was sad saying good-bye to people, one by one.  I guess these things have to end so that there's a next time.   Crusin'08  ... yeah.  :)        _______________________________________________________  Watched  Braveheart  this afternoon.  Still love it.  Aye, they fought like warrior-poets.

      I watched  Gattaca  again last night, and I liked it even more.  I noticed more things.  The funny thing is, I think the DVD actually has  less  scenes than the original video.  Some of my favorite lines:   Vincent:   You wanted to know how I did it.  That's how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything for the swim back.    Jerome:   I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.   and  Sorry, the wind caught it.

       I Left My Heart in San Francisco?  It's been exactly a week since I arrived on the east coast.  My state of mind controls so much of how I feel about things.  For instance, weather. On a happy day, rain is music/ soothing/ drops of friendly coolness/ a pleasant contrast to my sunny disposition.  On an unhappy day, rain is pathetic fallacy/ dampening/ a mean threat to finish off my dying spirit.  On a happy day, the sun is good company/ heartwarming/ the light the shines on my green green meadow.  On an unhappy day, the sun is a mockery/ irritating/ an unbearable brightness violating the shade of my ill humor.  Today, it's the sunset.  I'm very fond of it.  I think it's beautiful, romantic, and oftentimes the best part of the day.  That is, if the sun sets  over the ocean .  I was leaning over the pier of South Street Seaport viewing the Brooklyn Bridge, thinking of how pretty it is and yet how I despise the town across the water to which it leads.  I felt like the dusk kind of just crept in on me as the view over the water dimmed.  No comfort from a sinking ball of light with a reddish glow nor purple streaks across the sky nor white clouds with a brightness against the darkening blue as though instead of carrying vapor, it's holding in every last ounce of light from the waning sun.  Okay, I have to stop this melodrama.  So I guess I'm still getting over the shock of my first few days here -- trekking down, up, and across Brooklyn under a merciless late summer sun; waiting as though to be cooked through and charred in the dirty subway stations; stepping out into Chinatown and feeling a wave of confused horror because I think I'm in Taiwan - complete with the taxicabs, grime, and humidity.  Also, I seem to be getting in everybody's way.  I've been pushed from behind by impatient pedestrians with large carrier shopping bags or briefcases, going about their oh-so-important business.  I've tripped on the stairs, tripped on a boy with an icecream cone in his hand, tripped across the street as a UPS truck came speeding up the street at me...  Other than that, New York City is quite beautiful.  I've been missing my friends so much and been thinking about how undeserving I am sometimes.  I rarely make myself available to help others; but when I'm in need, I call up everyone I know and everybody I know that my friends know without hesitation.  I'm so grateful for the people who have given me thought, advice, encouragement, and prayer this past week.  You know who you are (or aren't! just kidding).  I'm feeling much more relieved and at peace now.  I know I'll be stressing through the rest of the year, but I'll just have to take it as it comes.  I would also like to add that my apartment search through the city has led me to one obvious and oh-so-simple answer: where there is a Starbucks, there a liveable place be.  The only Starbucks in Brooklyn are in Cobble Hill, Park Slope, and Brooklyn Heights ... see that?  Wow.  I have just discovered the Starbucks Coffee Test for Safe Neighborhoods.  I could say more, but the train of thought has stopped.  :)  That's contradictory.  Oh, whatever.

      When you are in L.A., you should put Red Bull in your gas tank.  Why?  Because it gives you wings.  Snuffles says, "Wow, look at all the daring girls wearing short skirts like the ones at Ah-bear-crombie!"  When it comes to moving, having a boyfriend really makes a difference.  I was telling Jenny this, a bit envious of her having such an advantage.  She replies, "not when he hurts his back ... then no more boyfriend, essentially."  :) In case John sees this: she was only joking.

       The Real Me  "Why is it that we can see our friends perfectly but when it comes to ourselves, no matter how hard we look, do we ever see ourselves clearly?"  I can't believe I'm taking something from  Sex and the City ; but hey, even the most superficial things carry some truth.  I realized that I really appreciate talking to William, even though it seems like we sometimes get stuck/hit a wall and don't understand how the other person can think the way they do.  But while we don't understand, we can still know exactly what the other person is talking about.  So when I have trouble expressing or elaborating on some key point and feeling a little bothered for sounding trite, he assures me that I'm not.  Our conversation somehow led to Jonah, which happens to be the subject of today's sermon.  I realized that I immediately got preachy and judgmental, applying the lesson to the other person and not seeing how it pertains to myself.  It's so easy to get that way, and it's so sad.  Most people who know me think that I'm an honest person and that I oftentimes judge accurately, albeit harshly.  Of course, I do take my intuitive nature a bit too far and my judgment gets clouded by many other things.  In any case, it's just so much easier for me to see my friends clearly but to not understand myself at all.  It's hard to be honest with myself.  "...he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord." How do you know when you are fleeing from the Lord?  When you are not disobeying something he has expressly stated, it's easy to convince yourself that you are actually following his will and going somewhere/doing something completely with his blessings.  Just because everything is in your favor and seemingly in God's favor, doesn't mean it's right at all.  ------------------- Happy Birthday, Sandra!

      Me: You shouldn't listen to Chinese music when you are in love Lisa: Oh yeah, or else you'll turn out like H*****. Me: I wonder how many people got screwed over by Phil Chang Lisa: OH!  That's a good question.  You should bring that up in a discussion forum.  Somehow the subject of Chinese pop music comes up a lot in my conversations with Lisa, and we laugh at the horribly horribly cheesy love songs that we used to listen to (or were forced to listen to).  They are the suicidal ones that,when heard through our bedroom doors, made our parents give each other sideway glances and wonder if something terrible had happened to us.  I just have to translate a couple of them here.  I'm going to make it as literal as possible, so as not to take from them the genius of Chinese figurative language.   urlLink "News" by Phil Chang   Looking at the letter you returned burnt to ashes/  each word each tear, ashes flying smoke destroying/  only then was I willing to believe In our already decided hearts/ using the same determination/ making different choices This is okay too/ my long travel/ might as well forget the return trip Let the foreign villages and unfamiliar language/ speak their joys and sorrows/ and I will not need to take part in it anymore  chorus  If goodbye is the last news I have of you/ how is it that I cannot remember Your expression and your feeling at that moment/ whether there was any trace of a mark to look for If goodbye is the last news I have of you/ I can almost see myself The farther away I fly/ the more you are in my heart/ Yet I am your unwanted memory  I just want a little miracle   *clap clap*  Hilarious.  This is actually taking too much energy from me, because I can't stop laughing.  I shall continue with another some other day.

      I think I'm starting to get my city legs.  Today, I walked through Fulton Street Mall to Brooklyn Heights Promanade.  There, you can see a photograph that shows where the twin towers would've been from where you are standing.  I wish it's still there for me to see; but I'd rather wish it were never there in the first place if it means what happened to it would not have happened.  I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan, took the subway to Rockefeller Plaza (This time I learned that the Japanese artist - Takashi Murakami - who has his sculpture on exhibit is the person who designed this season's Louis Vuitton bags.  It's the rainbow color monograms and cherry blossom design!), walked to 58th and 1st, and rode the Roosevelt Island Tram (just like in  Spiderman ! ... but it doesn't look so high in real life.)  Jenny Lee's friend Lilian's boyfriend Daniel treated us to wonderful Japanese food on/around St. Marks Place.  So nice :)  There's this interesting white/latino boy with a thin goatee and braided hair in my bio class.  He looks like a punk, but I'm taking a liking to him.  He says I look just like his cousin and he can't get it out of his head how much my face resembles hers.  So I look at him in mild disbelief and ask, "Why, is your cousin Chinese?"  This boy was also talking about what a smart choice it is to be a pharmacist because with two years of residency, you can essentially be a medical doctor (a bit of an exaggeration) and yet not have to have the hectic lifestyle of a doctor.  "... I mean, when you are a doctor, you have no life.  You have a long day you go home and get busy with your wife and then it's beep beep (the pager) - nah uh (shake of head)."   Why am I so inappropriate sometimes??  Yesterday I watched  Amadeus  with some girls after bible study.  I noticed that the young maid whom Salieri had hired to spy on Mozart was played by Cynthia Nixon.  So I cried out, "hey, she's the girl in  Sex and the City !"  Oops ...  Anyway, I love the movie and will have to reflect on it another day.

        ...he grabbed and mauled a man on his bench, bit into his bone-lappings, bolted down his blood and gorged on him in lumps...    I'm so hungry.   I had to miss dinner today to finish my homework.   "That's what you get for putting off your reading and forgetting that there's a response and quiz that comes with it," says myself. I've read  Beowulf  three times in three translations for three English classes, and I still don't remember it much.   loser, Minnie.  "shut up," says I.  Speaking of Scandinavians, I just recalled an article I read online recently about how research shows a higher rate of suicide in women who have had breast implants.  I thought it was interesting, so I continued reading until I got to the part that said the study was conducted in Finland.  I rolled my eyes and closed the browser.  I mean, c'mon.  If I lived in some Norwegian country, I'd kill myself too - breasts or no breasts.   Jenny Lee was saying over lunch that she needed a spring/fall jacket, and I suggested a corduroy blazer.  She stared at me over her food and exclaimed, "What, a corticosteroid??"  Man, did I get my bad fobness hearing from her?  I did live with her for two years back in San Diego.   I [Heart] NY  Two brothers were stabbed on the southbound 2 train between 116th and 125th street stops in Manhattan today.  "Despite a total of three stabbings this month, crime in the subway overall is down 16 percent so far this year, the NYPD said." Oh, that's good to know!  "Handcuffed Prisoner Escapes From Brooklyn Police Station ... So far, more that 20 prisoners have escaped police custody in New York City this year."

      Some things people say really irritate me.  Of course we all know that oftentimes it's not what they say but how they say it that affects how you receive the message.  This definitely applies to writing.  I have opinions too (hence this spiel), but I get worked up when people approach something in such a way that who they are overpowers what they have to say.  When the writer's unwelcomed personality peeps into every other sentence, it really detracts value and credibility from the piece.  I find this in books, articles, web logs, what-have-you.    God created three sexes: Male, Female, and You.   Now I've come across a bit of talk about metrosexuality, and it makes me wonder if I have any take on the subject.  Since the definition of the metrosexual male allows for a wide range of qulifications, it doesn't really specify the particular type and degree of gayness that men in this category need possess.  While there may be a stereotypical metrosexual, there's room for a lot of diversity.  So how much is too much, and how gay is too gay?  For one, I think it's a good thing for guys to care about their appearance.  I've seen guys sneak on Chapstick as though it's unnatural and impolite.  Don't think I don't understand that men and women are genetically different, and that applies to epidermal tissue.  But, everyone's skin needs taking care of and everyone's lips chap.  Why do men have to pretend theirs don't?  I don't care if some guy has the entire Shiseido Pureness line (if he really needs it).  I'm all for fairness.  Now some girls might think, "but only women should pamper themselves and use expensive personal care products."  Give me the logic for that, and I might change my mind.  I'm not supporting the pampering of skin for either sex, mind you.  I do think they should have the same rights to it.  A typical store at the mall will sell more women's apparel than men's.  Women's clothes also have more variety, detail, and in general look "nicer".  A garment for men may have the same price and plainer look, but it definitely has more quality and practicality than the women's version.  Why do men's jackets have interior pockets and women's don't?  Why are men's shirts made of good substantial material while women's shirts are only available in sheer handwash-only fabric?  Everyone knows I'm a fan of sheer cotton/mesh/whatever; but when I want a normal t-shirt, I expect to find one.  It shouldn't be assumed that women only wear clothes for show and that if they get cold, they can go borrow a guy's sweater.    There's more to life than being really really really ridiculously good looking.   A guy should care about his appearance, but he should not be any more vain than a girl should.  I'm all for fairness.  Why should women be excused for vanity while an analogous attitude in men is disparaged as narcissism?  I appreciate guys with good taste.  On Saturday, I went shoe shopping with Dick.  I was pleasantly surprised when he had the sense to know what looked good and what suited my purposes.  We sat in Central Park West and critiqued the outfits of the girls who passed by.  Most guys might think, "Uh, I don't know.  That one just looks good."  My pal here was able to explain what was good about the shirt versus what was wrong with the pants.  That's taste, people - and I'm happy to know guys who possess it.

       In the form of my high school weekly journal: 1.	Self-reflection I have a free spirit but not an adventurous spirit. Im so vain, yet terribly insecure.  2.	In the News 25-year-old black male ships himself from New York to Texas in a crate. J-Lo and Ben call off wedding  3.	Something I Learned The faculty at school has been on strike while renegotiating their contract, so I havent learned anything in class.  I sat in on a couple of Jenny Lees graduate classes though, because they werent affected.  Something about anesthesia: Injection (quicker onset) is followed by inhalation through the duration of the operation.  Xenon is the best inhalation type, because its a noble gas and doesnt react with any other elements; but its too expensive to be used commonly.  Something from the prescription drug cards: Theres a muscle relaxant called Soma.  Doesnt that remind you of Brave New World, A gram is better than a damn!  Also, Valium comes in very pretty colors and heart-shaped holes in the center.  I could eat them just for fun.  In the future, you should tell your kids to be careful with the candies from Auntie Minnie.  4.	Free-write Have you ever had the feeling of reading a letter and not wanting it to end?  Its when you appreciate every word that is said, when you believe that every sentence is thought out, and when you think you can feel the writers emotion when he/she signs it off.  These are so precious.    When is it okay to love someone selfishly, and how do you love unselfishly?  There are times when selfishness is sweet, because it shows that you want a person and that person alone to make you happy.  But at the same time, that can end up being a very unrealistic expectation and pressure on somebody.  Would you actually want to be that kind of person for somebody?  No.  And thats a good thing, because you really cant.  We are all too bankrupt.  I think sometimes bitterness arises from thinking that you love someone a lot and yet they reject your good intentions.  You just have to remember you are not there to correct them or to be their savior, because theres only one person who can do that.  I sometimes catch myself being so unfeeling and unable to rejoice in anothers happiness or grieve for their sorrow.  I think part of unselfishness comes from putting aside how you feel about a situation and just be happy for another persons happiness.  So doesnt really make sense because it comes from a jumble of things.  If you think it makes sense, maybe you have a problem. :)  I admire some people for being the woman I cannot remotely imagine myself becoming.  They would put their own careers on hold to build up their husbands, to be his helper both inside and outside of the home.  They make their home where their husbands are called, essentially following him to the ends of the earth.  They stand by their man even when he isnt one (figuratively speaking, of course).  They embrace their role as a mother, assuming the (almost) full responsibility for taking care of and nurturing their children.  I also admire some people for being the woman that I wish I were.  They are strong and independent.  They paint their own walls, caulk their own bathrooms, nail in their own floorboards, move their own boxes, take themselves to the airport  They are so certain of what they want to do that they can sacrifice everything else, even when it is very painful.  They dont care to have husband nor children.  They are optimistic about the future, believe in colonies on the moon and cities under the ocean, think that someday the subway system will be perfect, and want to outlive the average person.  In the end, Im neither of these and dont know which one Id rather be.  I can see my own mother as one who attempts to find a middle ground, but the result looks pretty messy to me. ___________________________  My dad asked me a few times how one would translate the Chinese phrases "boo[\]-how[v]-yee[\]-shr[v]" (BHYS) and "suh[v]-boo[\]-duh[/]" (SBD).  I believe there just might not be an English equivalent, because these phrases express very cultural-specific Chinese ideas.   BHYS   an expression of politeness 1.	Used when asking for pardon, as in excuse me 2.	When you are embarrassed or shy about doing something 3.	When you do something not out of desire but from a feeling of obligation.  For example, I dont want to go to the party but I feel BHYS to not go.  Another example - Person A says, Dont walk me home, Ill be BHYS. Person B replies, No no, let me walk you home.  Otherwise,  I  will be BHYS.  --> Essentially, either of these usages contains a hard on the face factor.  I dont think Americans readily understand the concept of saving face, because it comes from this kind of pride veiled by false modesty.  So I guess I would define BHYS as: Origin, Chinese.  An expression of politeness often characterized by false modesty.   SBD   lit. difficult to expend or let go 1.	Used when you cant throw away something sentimental 2.	Also used when you cant bear to let someone you care about endure hardship (often found in cheesy writing) or to watch them go away (ex. when a father gives his daughter away in marriage).

      One of the things I love remembering is what Brenda likes to say about grace (yes yes, I like to quote people) - if you want to know what grace is, just put your hand to your heart.  There's nothing you do to make it beat.  You didn't make it start and you can't make it stop.  The cardiac muscle is continously active, lub-dubbing from before you were born to the day you die.  The pacemaker cells are amazing - a little miracle placed in you by God.  You could pluck the heart from the body and see that still, it beats.  "Listen to Our Hearts"   If words could fall like rain  From these lips of mine  And if I had a thousand years  I would still run out of time  But if you listen to my heart  Every beat would say  Thank you for the life, thank you for the truth  Thank you for the way   So listen to our hearts  Hear our spirits sing A song of praise that flows   From those you have redeemed  We will use the words we know  To tell you what an awesome God You are  Words are not enough to tell You of our love  So listen to our hearts  - Geoff Moore

      I hate Chemistry.  I appreciate him for being such an important part of my life and for trying ever so hard to explain to me how the world works.  But sometimes, I just want to be the ignorant and naive girl that I am.  I want to tell him that I don't give a damn about fractional distillation, stereoisomers, and such.  Can't he love me for who I am and not what I can do?  It's for my own good, he replies.  I tell him that I need some TLC, but apparently he has an entirely different concept of what TLC is.  I ask him why he can't make things a little easier for me; aren't we in this together?  Why does he constantly discourage me from pursuing my dreams?  I ask a lot of questions, but he often prefers to stay silent.  We've broken up a couple of times in college, and never once did he object or try to win me back.  This time around, I've decided to tough it out until I can dump him for someone better.  In fact, I'm really using him to get to his wealthier friends Pharmacology and Pharmaceutics.  Okay, so that's a bit heartless.  But, serves him right for making me miserable.  Pharmaceutics promises that he'd wait for me, and I hope we have a better future together.  I also hope he doesn't find out that I'm really planning to marry  him  for convenience and money, though.  Truth is, I've been dallying with English (every Thursday night, on the subways, and at the public library).  It's not my fault though - English understands me and makes me laugh.  Chemistry doesn't.  *sigh* It's not easy being a girl.

      1. My concerns go to San Diego/Orange County.  Wish I could send you some rain and overcast skies. 2. I want a new computer.  I want something slim but well-built, dependable, and pretty.  Hmm, sounds like my ideal boy.  Yeah well, what the heck.  Throw the boy in with the computer.  I do not want a Mac, though.  If you are a Mac guy, then I'm sorry.  You can be a heathen, but not a Mac.  I think I'm slightly addicted to blogs.  I click on other people's blogs 10 times a day. I think about what to blog even when I don't have time.  I feel the need to blog even when I have nothing to blog about.  I don't know why I buy Chex Mixes when all I eat is the Chex.  My mind is as empty as Jessica Simpson's.  'Doesn't matter, just bloggaboudit!' I tell myself.  So put the hamster in the ball and start rolling out the b.s.   urlLink Christian skate store .  My short answer is two words,  what-ever .  Whatever  - is there really a difference between the "Christian" brands and the non-Christian brands?  I'm not into skating, so I don't know how the skater kids feel.  But I personally don't listen to Christian pop music.  I think it's cheesy.  It's registered "dangerously cheesy" on the Cheetos scale.  To some degree, music is music.  Angry music isn't going to turn holy just because it's Christian angry music.  Singing gospel songs in hot pants and sexy tops isn't really going to get the point across.  No offense to Beyonce; I'm sure Jesus loves you, but those guys in the crowd that are gaga-ing over your T&A might not know that.  By the way, Evanescence annoys the heck out of me.  It produces the same side effects as having listened to "Heart Shaped Box" on repeat in my sleep.  With that said, I have to admit that everyone worships God differently.  People come from different cultures, backgrounds, and personalities.  If the worship is true, then I suppose it's legit.  But whether I appreciate it or not is another issue.   Whatever  - I don't see the point of something like a Christian Hot Topic.  So we're still talking about skater gear, but I'm obviously trying to avoid showing my lack of skater knowledge.  Anyway, why do you need to cool-ize Christianity by making it fit into pop/teenage culture?  WWJD?  I don't think Jesus would wear his own brand, if that's what it is supposed to be.  So, give that a rest.  With that said, I again have to give the business the benefit of the doubt.  If the guy really had a successful career in the past and feels compelled now to use his gift of business-mindedness to glorify God, then good for him.  Someone will benefit from it, hopefully.   Whatever  way or reason is okay, as long as the gospel is preached.  "But what does it matter?  The important thing is that in every way whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached.  And because of this I rejoice." (Philippians)

        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping   Silently screaming.  I don't know what to write.  Sometimes something compells me to actually think.  But I will by nature run through the whole reasoning process through my head first; and if it appears that a conclusion is not favorable or cannot be reached, I will abandon the thought altogether.  Yes, that is how a lazy person operates.  And I am the poster girl for laziness.  For a sedentary lifestyle as well.  Maybe that's how people keep their sanity ... or lose it.  Depends on the brand of psychology you buy, I guess.  Singing, "I just don't know what to do with myself."  I had lunch with an unni from Berkland, who happens to be a pharm professor here.  We had a brief meal at an Applebee's across the street and shared our feelings about Shady University.  It's funny because she graduated from UCSF, went off to Almaty with her husband to set up the church there, came back to New York for the church here, got a job teaching, and to this day has not yet worked as a real pharmacist.  I'm supposed to go to a small group tonight, but I feel so unmotivated.  I can hear a little voice inside me waning by the minute.  I'm starting to lose perspective; I'm tempted to settle with what's in reach and withdraw into a state of ambivalence or cheap security.   "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door ..."   I came across the poem today and remembered how  The Crow  was my favorite movie at one time.  What was I on?  Strange it is, but I still think there's a romantic beauty to the gothness.  Mmm, love beyond the grave.  If I could change the marriage vows, I'd reword it to " 'Til never do we part".  I definitely prefer the poem over the movie, of course.  What to write, what to write.   Why agonize over it?  You don't have to write if there's nothing to say.  Chinese people believe anything worth saying can be expressed in 5 words.   Eunice unni asked me over lunch if Yankees won yesterday.  Sorry, wah?  I'm sure the rest of the world knows.  My sweater is snug.  I could've sworn it said "machine wash".  But when I pulled it out of the washer, the words on the tag changed to "hand wash cold".  I don't know, I feel like an innocent victim who sabotages herself.  Am I schizo?  No one living with me ever reported any other observable, abnormal behavior.  I know Connie is going to remind me of what I did to Snuffles - "Tag says, surface clean only .  Do not immerse in water."  I think,  okay!  And drop it into the washing machine.   Oh, poor Shnuffles.  If my stuffed animals could move, they would have all run away by now. what to write, what to write.   Leave my loneliness unbroken!---quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!                                                      Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

       urlLink I am a Skeptic   The Questioner (the Six)  Questioners are responsible, trustworthy, and value loyalty to family, friends, groups, and causes. Their personalities range broadly from reserved and timid to outspoken and confrontative.    How to Get Along with Me   Be direct and clear.  Listen to me carefully.  Don't judge me for my anxiety.  Work things through with me.  Reassure me that everything is OK between us.  Laugh and make jokes with me.  Gently push me toward new experiences.  Try not to overreact to my overreacting.    What I Like About Being a Six   being committed and faithful to family and friends  being responsible and hardworking  being compassionate toward others  having intellect and wit  being a nonconformist  confronting danger bravely  being direct and assertive    What's Hard About Being a Six   the constant push and pull involved in trying to make up my mind  procrastinating because of fear of failure; having little confidence in myself  fearing being abandoned or taken advantage of  exhausting myself by worrying and scanning for danger  wishing I had a rule book at work so I could do everything right  --> exactly!  being too critical of myself when I haven't lived up to my expectations    Sixes as Children Often   are friendly, likable, and dependable, and/or sarcastic, bossy, and stubborn   ... oh my gosh, I've got split personality.  look to groups or authorities to protect them and/or question authority and rebel  ... definitely bipolar.  are neglected or abused, come from unpredictable or alcoholic families, and/or take on the fearfulness of an overly anxious parent   ... hey, that explains everything!

       Jesus draw me close, closer Lord to You Let the world around me fade away For I desire to worship and obey    "In those elusive periods of blinding clarity ..."  I am sad.  I am the worst when I am sleeping; all I care about is my sleep.  I cannot be reasoned with.  I am shut off from myself and the world.  I can't remember a period of time when I didn't miss a day of church, except back in freshman year (and even that wasn't completely done with a pure heart).  I wake up this morning and for some reason Lisa's voice pops in my head, "how can anyone think it's okay to not go to church?  grr!"  I pull the blanket over my face and think miserably, "I don't know..."  At bible study, we're always talking about what the gospel means and who Jesus is to us.   It's during sudden brief moments that I realize,  oh my gosh, he died for me.   He died for people who fell asleep on him.  for me who claim to love him; but when I get a taste of just how real his love is, I am astonished because I know I could never love him back a fraction of that amount.  And yet, he is pleased when I offer up my little bit of worship.  When I am infuriated with all the adulterers in this world, I realize that I am no better.  When I throw my hands up and cry out that it's all a lie, he proves that love is true.  Probably, tomorrow I'll find myself asking again "what is truth?".  At least I'll know that as fickle and hopelessly forgetful as I am, Jesus never changes.

        urlLink Saturday Morning    10:20 .  8th Street and Broadway.  Downtown R Train pulls into the station.  I hesistate -  do I want to take this?  Yeah, might as well get on and transfer to the Q at Canal Street.   10:25 .  The train runs for less than a minute and slows to a stop.  I wait, thinking that it's waiting for another train to pass.  5 minutes later, a train actually passes.   Okay that was stupid.  Now can we get going?   10:40 .  Announcement: Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry for the delay.  We are experiencing some difficulties, so please be patient."  10:50 .  Male voice comes on the speaker, "This is your conductor speaking.  We are experiencing electrical problems.  The power company is trying to send us help as we speak.  Please be patient."  11:00 .  An empty R Train pulls up right next to us.   Okay, fine.  At least they are going to get us out of here dark tunnel.  It's like a mini-rescue.   Everyone stands up in anticipation, only to watch the said train begin moving again and steadily speeding up until it has completely left our sight.  11:10 .  Black female in my car throws a tantrum and pounds on the doors.  She yells about how she is late for work and her boss won't be happy if his home/office isn't cleaned.  11:25 .  The train finally moves, slowly, and the doors open for everyone to get out at Prince Street.  11:40 .  Spring Street. Station Lady: swipe your card.  ...  [looks at me like I'm trying to pull something] This was over an hour ago! Me:  Yeah, because I was stuck on the train for an hour, until they told everyone to get out over there at Prince!   What, you think I'm doing this just to get out of paying 2-f#@!ing-dollars??  I'm doing this because I was sitting there in a dark tunnel on a train I didn't want to take in the first place, having nothing to do but pick my nose, while a gay man keeps eyeing me through his Armani glasses like I'm weird or something.  I'm doing this because I had left my f#@!ing wallet at home and I don't even have money to take a taxi or buy a bubble tea.  Come to think of it, I really don't ever want to pay the 2 dollars.  I think the subway should be free.  Station Lady:  Okay, catch the 4 that just pulled in over there.   Article courtesy of Lord Durian, king of the fruits.

      Why am I such an easy target?  Even kids make fun of me.  Actually, just one Bronx boy called John.  I told him last week that he didn't look like a John.  He replied, "What do I look like then,  a Jose?  Antonio?"  I wanted to say, "No, more like a Diego."  Anyway, today I was really out of it and was just sitting there with a cold stare out the window of the lab (aka. fah-dai).  Apparently, someone had come over from another table pointing at my book and asking me questions, but all I did was shift my gaze away to another window.  I think everyone looked at me thinking I was ignoring her on purpose.  So Bronx Boy was all asking, "Are you okay??  You look really out of it.  Have you been smoking [pot], because it kills your memory you know."  So I was like, "NO!"  And his Brooklyn Chinese Sidekick says, "Well, she doesn't remember smoking because it killed her memory."  I was idignant.  I wanted to remind them that I'm 23 and they should get down and call me Dah-Jieh (big sister).  I guess the whole idea was really amusing so he stuck with it for the entire 2 1/2 hours we were in lab.  He took this test tube and a rubber stopper with a pipette and syringe and made this miniature bong and kept saying, "Hey Minnie, does this look familiar to you?" and raising his eyebrows knowingly.  Stupid.  stupid stupid.  *sigh*

       Where do broken hearts go?  Connie: alaska Sam: into my open arms Nat: can they find their way home?  :) ha ha ha.  somewhere, someone is on my wavelength.  the rest, i still love you so ...   Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you  I can't believe how Dick and I have almost reversed roles since high school.  I've become more cynical and he's become this complete cheeseball and drama queen (okay, slight exaggeration).  Isn't it ironic?  Actually, it's not.  But that's okay because people like Alanis Morissette has gotten away with using the  urlLink word   urlLink wrong  20 plus times in a platinum selling record.  I don't know why, but I have this taste for tragedy.  Not that I like sad things to happen in life, but I sometimes like to play devil's advocate and meditate on the injustices and meaninglessness of life.  My secret desire is to be Simone De Beauvoir and have the kind of relationship she had with Jean-Paul Sartre.  I would say it's passionate, pure, and sinfully hopeless.  That would be my rebellion against god and man.  kind of scary.  nevermind.

      I've been staring at my water bottle.  It's curvy, green, and see-thru.  It's beginning to look like the central vacuole of a plant cell.  Squishy.   I shall call it Squishy and it shall be mine.   I think I'm a little stressed.  Suddenly, four more years of schooling feels like a long time.  I'm so envious of Jenny Lee.  I wish I were in her class.   tardive dys-kinesia  ... was trying to help her decipher an alien term in her taped lecture.  I admire her.  She tries so much harder than me.  She's the one who inspired me to do this.  During the two years we lived together, I've sat around daydreaming and sleeping and bemoaning my awful classes while she busily volunteered and worked and picked herself up everytime she did badly.  I remember her coming towards me as I walked out of York Hall one morning, and she just burst into tears when she saw me because Dr. Armour had been unmerciful, and she really needed the physiology class for pharmacy school.  We helped her with her admissions essays and Gloria and I even took turns writing her English papers for a class.  Things didn't turn out the way she had hoped, and I remember her again bursting into tears while sitting at her desk because she didn't want to ever leave LA and her family to go to some far away place.  In the end, she still packed up and traveled across the country to fulfill her dream.  I, on the other hand, am an ungrateful and undeserving butt in comparison.  Last year during Thanksgiving, I was sick with the flu.  I remember sitting propped up in bed trying to remember something about bioluminescence and dinoflagellates while thinking about how I was going to come up with a piece of BS big enough to get me into the next stage of my life.   Don't ask me why I want to go to law school.  I don't know.  How about, "I'm just an average person trying to be more interesting?"   My one potential write-you-a-good-reference professor from Humanities class gave me  The Spirit Catches You...  to read for inspiration, but it ironically had the opposite effect.  In the midst of my delirium, I crawled out of bed, sat in front of the computer for a few minutes, and told Connie later, "you know what, I applied to pharmacy school."  and plopped back on the bed and slept soundly.  I wasn't planning on updating, but this kind of just popped in there.

      Watching Judge Judy reminded me of college roommates and the silly things that can happen to you.  Can they subpoena people on Judge Judy?  Because Gloria, you came really close to being on TV, remember ... :)  Yesterday, I had the turkey dinner at my pastor's house.  It was nice, except I found myself wanting to break out of the apartment by the time dessert came.  It's akin to that feeling I get when I'm in front of the class giving a speech; a minute into the intro, I stop at the thought,  okay, why do I need to do this?  You don't care, I don't care.  I could simply put this down and walk away...   Then I have to take a deep breath and remind myself that in the real world, you keep going.  You keep smiling, picking at your food, asking questions and nodding your head even though you didn't hear a word they said.  Afterwards, Jenny Lee and I took a nice quiet stroll along the Promenade.  It was a perfectly clear night, without a ripple in the water or a mist over the bridge.  We had a perfect view of the skyline and the statue, and for a brief period enjoyed a feeling of freedom.  Then we turned around and headed back to reality.  Ah, Lady Liberty ... you mock me.  Sometimes, it really is the small things in life that's best.  Today, it's hot Chinese food and a roommate's TV on a wet hazy afternoon.  I'm thankful that I'm a warm mammal, and I'm grateful for my sanity.   Happy Thanksgiving , friends.

      Last night I had a talk with someone about what I would be if I were "that girl", in relation to his entry on  urlLink "that guy" .  The answer was, I'm either 1.) that girl who looks naiive but really isn't that naiive or 2.) just plain naiive.  I don't think that's too far from the truth.  If you wanted to describe me with one word,  ambivalence  might serve you well.  I'm that girl who's sort of your type and sort of not.  I'm sort of everywhere and sort of nowhere.  I'm sort of passionate and sort of indifferent.  I'm sort of observant and sort of not paying attention to you.  I'm sort of encouraging and sort of make you self-conscious.  I'm sort of quick and sort of slow.  Crap, what am I?

        Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along.  Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone.    Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter, When you come close to sellin' out reconsider, Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance, And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean, Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens, Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.  I hope you dance.   Couldn't help it ... :)   This morning's answer to last night's struggles  "Make My Life a Prayer to You" I want to thank You now for being patient with me Oh it's so hard to see when my eyes are on me "Great is Thy Faithfulness" Great is Thy faithfulness! Morning by morning new mercies I see All I have needed Thy hand hath provided Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me

       Randomness.  it's late and I can't fall asleep. Someone asked me at bible study if I've considered modelling to pay for pharmacy school.  I looked at her, "are you for real?"  Apparently, she was; and it's not surprising because I've heard talk about how the NYU health and grad students live under so much pressure because they accumulate such horrendous debts through the years of professional education.  I guess any legitimate way of making money is acceptable, even if it is selling your body (meaning, modelling).  Good thing I don't have much to sell so the temptation's not there.  Friendship is so precious, because it doesn't come (and stay) easily.  I sometimes get frustrated with Jenny L. for being always on the lookout for guys, when I think what she really needs is some good girl friends.  But then I learn to sympathize because befriending girls can be such tricky business, and she's been disappointed by so many friends that she's decided to give it up and invest her hopes on a boyfriend - because there's somehow a promise that a boyfriend will be there for her, will care about her, will understand her, and will be all the friend she needs.  Sounds a bit ridiculous, but I've realized that it's a very common attitude of Taiwanese girls.  Taiwanese girls are such friendly, let's walk arm-in-arm, go to the bathroom, go to 7-Eleven together types.  But in reality, I wonder how much they really care about each other.  I think the girls sometimes don't know how to trust themselves to their own kind.  Rather, they bank all their emotion and faith on the opposite sex.  !? Jenny told me how at the Chinatown pharmacy she interns at, the most common prescriptions are birth control pills; and a disturbingly large number of them are for young teenage girls.  Why?!  I would throw the prescription in their face and yell a la Donatella Versace, "Get OUT!" (Think SNL).  Friday in lab, the Boy talked about his little cousin.  He talked about her with such a paternal fondness.  He talked about  The Cat in the Hat  movie, how he'd read her the book, and boasted about how she's so smart that when she's twelve, she will have surpassed his intelligence.  He talked about how her mother would drop her off at his house early in the morning and she would crawl into his bed and fall asleep next to him.  He talked about how she could read the papers and would point to the Kobe articles and remark with disapproval.  He talked about how surprised he was that she knew what rape is, but is so proud that she's a tough girl who can protect herself.  He talked about how at the park, she'd yell "fuck you!" and give the finger to any man who approaches her.  I didn't let it show, but he totally has my respect.  There's something infinitely attractive about guys who know how to protect girls.  On the other hand, I really hate - with a passion - girls who don't know what they're worth, women who are bla/se about women's issues, women who don't care that they are oppressed, women who don't stick up for other women, women who don't want to be women.  They can just go [bleeped].

      I.feel.sick.  It's been a long time, I must say.  So I'm pretty grateful for my good health as of late.  But ultimately, the virus wins.  I don't think I have the virus because I know what it's like, but I'm not feeling well.  It felt like one of the longest days of my life - waiting for the stubborn cyclohexanone to boil over, while the water running through the tube was too cold b/c of the temperature outside and the distillate solidifying before it could come out, breathing in an array of nasty hydrocarbons, waiting for the prof. to grade my test in front of me, running to the bathroom twice during the lab to throw up.  When I made it back to my room, I changed out of my holey outfit and cried like someone had died.  Maybe it was the headache, enduring the long morning, or the Russian professor finally telling me I had done well instead of yelling at me.  But I think it was a bottling up of emotion for the past couple of months.  In any case, I'm okay now.  Just need to make it through this week.

        Don't hate the playa.  Hate the game.   Thanks, Dick (and Bad Boys). Yea it's one of those days (and when I say day, I mean week/month/however long I'm in a certain mental state).  One of those days when I feel like I've had enough and I'm thinking of ways out - out of here, out of there, out of anywhere.  I think being around many not so well-adjusted, aggressive, unrefined, and plainly annoying people is forcing me into a tight corner.  I've been rolling my eyes at Jenny Lee a lot and slamming my hand down at the table, angrily huffing "Thank you Lord" over my food.  Like I told someone already, I even hit Bronx Boy in lab on friday.  His sexual innuendos got out of hand.  I mean, for him I've upped my threshold already.  But this time he went too far.  The sorta cool thing is that he totally reminds me of Ron (Ker-yuan), so I feel like I already know what kind of punk I'm dealing with.   You love this town / Even if that doesnt ring true / Youve been all over / And its been all over you   I like running into friends on the street, because it's something you don't expect to happen (of all the nooks and crannies in a bustling city) but also something you do expect to happen (because chances are people you know are running around out there).  It's also very easy to walk right past someone you know, even a good friend, because people here are destination-oriented and usually don't stroll along singing Zipadeedoodah while checking out the people on their left and right (which I still do in as subtle a manner as possible).  Today I ran into Yiyi at a subway entrance, and she had on the most surprised expression when I called her name.  It seems like people are easily caught off guard in the city.  "Whoa, what are you doing here?  Where are you going?  Where am I?  Is this the right exit?  It says 40th and Broadway; I need to get to 8th and Broadway..."  Funny.  Just a split second ago you looked like you knew exactly where you were heading.  But I guess that's what most people do - look like they know exactly where they are going.  Anyway, turns out she had a message to deliver me on this chance encounter: don't float around too long.  decide on a church, dangit.  I told her how just last night I was walking and thinking  God, how do I know if it's me or You? .  But she told me not to worry, because he will use the bible, other people, and even my own biases to tell me.  So I can be at peace with my decision.  That's a relief.  I miss California.  I miss space.  I miss palm trees.  I miss riding in (other people's) cars.  I miss the other peoples.

        Hey Ya ...    Connie says, "You must be studying really hard.  If you are listening to Outkast."  If you know me you'll catch the sarcasm.  There's no way I can study with music on.   If you need it, you should show it 'Cause you might play so monastic that you blow it   I don't think people know just how introverted I can be.  I will take the stairs just so I can avoid being in the elevator with people.   Sixth floor?  Just walk it , I think to myself.  It's kind of good that living in NYC forces me to be ever in the presence of people, even if I have no interaction with them.  But I do hope that I can learn to interact with people more.  Saw the Lord and his Lady Durian at Redeemer this morning.  Kinda weird to see California people in New York (like Jeff ...).  But it's nice to feel like we're not that far apart - just a long plane ride away.  Yesterday morning I actually got up early.  I needed to go to the library, so I thought I'd stop by the Toys 'R Us parade with Jenny L.  It wasn't much of a parade, but there were so many kids there and they were so cute.  Most of them sat on their father's shoulders.  One man behind me was holding his wee little toddler up by the legs as Wonder Woman came by and kept shouting to the kid, "look at the boobs on her!".  I turned around to look at him and he laughed but kept shouting.  There was this other boy who had on round bug-eye shades and a hat with flaps that went around his face.  He looked SO cute, I wanted to eat him up.  Uh ... I mean, yea ...  And it was cold.  The Cup o' Noodle in Times Square had started to steam - which is a sign that it is officially cold weather, I think.  My lips felt so bloated and numb, and I babbled nonsense whenever I talked because I couldn't formulate the words with my mouth.    I went on a hunt for  urlLink UGG boots  but had no luck.  I did find a pair of  urlLink PINK New Balance  sneakers, which is my new obsession.  Dear friend, if you love me, you will place that on your Christmas shopping list :) .  Jenny likes to bring her own food into the cafeteria and eat it there.  So yesterday, we brought tea eggs and tofu curd (doh-hua) back from Chinatown and ate it during dinner.  It's remarkable; after 20 years, I've finally overcome my learned taste aversion for tea eggs.  I once got sick in kindergarten in Taiwan because I had a tea egg with a bowl of Chinese herb soup that really stank.  I hurled after I got home, and came down with a fever.  After that day, the sight and thought of tea eggs made me sick.  It wasn't even the egg's fault!  The poor thing was just hanging out with the wrong crowd.  All my jeans, along with two sweatshirts, came out of the laundry last night with gaping holes and chewed-off edges.  Answer to the riddle: I had spilled 80% H2SO4 on my clothes in chem lab and left it in for a week, dunked it in water and detergent, and whirled it about vigorously for half-an-hour.  I'm going to try to continue wearing them for lab days, except for one pair of jeans which has a hole in the crotch area.  Well, maybe if I wore shorts underneath ...

        Stacy's mom  has got it goin' on She's all I want, and I've waited so long Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom  (Teacher Sam - this one's for you, sicko.)  My gosh, music nowadays never stops shocking me.  So I hear this song for the first time in the cafeteria, and I think it's cute.  Being the didn't-catch-what-you're-saying me, I scribbled "Stacy's Wrong" on a napkin and decide to look for it online.  Apparently, this has already been on the radio for ages.  I'm so deprived!  Why does nothing work here in the dorm?  No Kazaa, no Limewire, no nothing.  Radio MTV.com, we're gonna make it through this together.  Jess: poor, poor minnie.          Or as Jenny Lee would say, "minnie is so poor". :) Have you ever been so bored that you would do something you'd only do in the 7th grade?  Well,  urlLink here  is your chance.

      Overslept on a Sunday, Part II. I don't know ... I'm feeling really sluggish today.  As soon as I'm awake I want to go back to sleep.  I dragged myself out and walked three whole blocks to Brooklyn Tabernacle this afternoon.  I went all by myself ... please, say you are proud of me.  Anyway, it was so nice!  The building is SO beautiful, and the  urlLink choir  was amazing.  I was staring at the figure of this woman on stage with Hillary Clinton-ite hair and her back facing the audience, conducting with such force that's inconsistent with her size.  I just thought, WOW.  How does Cymbala's wife lead a choir like that?  The woman is amazing.  "This is the power of music," I thought to myself.   Though I can't see Your holy face and Your throne in heaven above it seems so far away  Though I can't touch your nail-scarred hands I have a deep and unspeakable joy that makes my faith to stand   I've been wondering why I'm so phlegmy lately.  It's because of the bad air!  *cough cough*  Ugh.  I'm really getting to like the city though.  It's so lively, you see all sorts of people and shops, and the buildings have so much character.  I explored the NYPL yesterday and was pretty captivated by the ceilings in the reading rooms and the suction tubes that they send your call slips through.  On the way home, I got lost in Grand Central.  This girl carrying a huge cello case came bumping into me through the crowd, and it turns out to be someone from church.  She was on her way to a wedding gig ... ah, how lovely!  I want to go to a wedding too.  Anyone?  Send me an invitation, please.

       Four Weddings and a Funeral  This week: the arrival of mini-me snuffles in the mail, little surprise cakes in the cafeteria, a phone call from my dad, group movie tickets, and a miserable organic chemistry final.  The  Return of the King  movie is AWESOME.  But I am just in  pain  because they left out my absolute favorite moment in the book.  Ask me, if you've already seen it.  Lisa, you should know what it is ...   Nevertheless, it is so good I almost peed in my pants (partially due to too much coke as well).  I'm so excited, I can think about it all night.  Oh wait, I still have another final tomorrow.   Eek.

      I've neglected to update for awhile, and I've sort of forgotten what to write now.  Natalie came to stay on Saturday and Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend; praise the Lord for sneaking her past the guards multiple times!  It was really wonderful to see her - read her  urlLink entry  to get a special anecdote and the gist of her visit to the city.  Tuesday, Dec. 2.  Our good friend Samuel left for Kazakhstan.  First day of snow in NYC.  Friday, Dec. 5.   urlLink Blizzard  hits and catches me unprepared, in icy socks and Birkenstocks.  Watched  Braveheart  over really spicy duk-boki at Joon and Karen's place.  Slept over at Charlene's dorm.  Saturday.  Forced to go home in the snow storm - a horrible experience.  I suppose it's character building ... until it kills you!  So, I'm having a pretty terrible weekend because of the blizzard and the lit professor's plagiarism accusation.  Sorry for those of you whom I've already ranted to, I'm going to repeat it verbatim.  I've been taking this British literature class for personal interest, not knowing at first that it is a class for English majors and will require more work than I had intended.  The professor is a really nice woman who offered to withdraw me from the course whenever I felt like I needed to, so as not to affect my science classes.  On Friday, I finally emailed her and said that I would like to take up on her offer because I just can't spend any more time on the final research paper.  She replied and said that it is a good decision on my part because she had serious suspicions about my short essay, and proceeded to recite the university policy for plagiarism.  She stated that she did not carry out a source check for the paper, but stressed that she had "serious worries" about its validity.  I immediately wrote her, professing my innocence and asking her to go ahead with the source check so we can discuss the problem together.  She responded with a sour attitude, saying that she is busy getting papers back to people who  are  completing the course and that I will have to look for her during finals week if I want to see her.  I mustered a cordial reply of thanks.  This is a bit out of character because I don't usually like to narrate in my weblog (okay, that's debatable).  But it's really bothering me because I feel indignant and sad - being accused of something so serious by someone I had respect for, in a not-so-reknown institution, for something I totally despise.  The one time I recall reading someone's webpage is for a Kafka paper; I emailed him the graded paper afterwards to show that even though I didn't take anything directly from his page, I wanted to thank him because I had benefit from his work.  Despite all this, I feel so grateful for my friends.  A friend's trust is so amazing.  Many people I talked to didn't even ask the  "but did you...?"  question.  They were immediately infuriated for my sake -  what? that's messed up! that's ridiculous.   I'm really thankful for your support.  I guess what I really need now is real peace and prayer.  The pastor gave a good lesson at bible study on Friday:  Jesus used God's word as defense and weapon when he was tempted in the desert.  He also used God's word as food and sole energy source.  How often do I put God's word aside, letting it hang like fatty tissue, and drawing from it only occasionally, to have something to say in fellowship and to show some head knowledge!   Yes, I am guilty.  I need to take God's word, chew it, digest it, absorb it, and, well... sans the expelling part.  I read a chapter in  Too Busy Not to Pray  today, and it really spoke to me.  When we face unanswered prayers, we often question what is wrong with God, the timing, or the request itself.  But sometimes, it is  me  that is the problem.  I have not been regular, earnest, and persistent.  I have forgotten in the dark what God told me in the light.  I am  Contaminated by Cheating , as one section is titled.  My prayers are contaminated by sin that I have not addressed, attitudes that I have allowed to build up and swept under the rug.  I think it's the Lord's kind way of telling me to quit sweating over one kind of cheating and address the latter.  Well, that's it for now.  Thanks for chatting with me.  Thanks for praying with me.

      I've been getting in touch with my FOBness and obsessing over  urlLink this  Taiwanese drama with Jenny Lee.  Nevermind that Vivian Hsu is ever the annoying ex-porn star with a tired cutsy act, Ken Zhu is a sleek-haired pansy, and Vic Chou speaks Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent (yes, too sexy).  Nevertheless, they are still beautiful, stupid, and totally entertaining.  It's a  urlLink "love tornado"  - one girl, two guys, and some trouble!  Now that  is  a bit of a dilemma, right?  What would I do if I were stuck between Vic Chou and Ken Zhu?  The answer is, nothing.  I would be quite happy.

      I stood by the counter at Top Service, clutching my boots and waiting, as the men in the back discussed with uncertainty my "unusual" situation.  One by one the ladies came in to pick up their shoes and wished me luck with mine as they left.  I didn't understand what was so difficult about my case.  Hadn't they ever encountered someone who mistakenly washed suede shoes with sheepskin cleaner?  Hadn't they ever seen  pink ?  How can these people restore Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choos to their original $400 value and not know what to do with a pair of discolored UGG knock-offs?  I walked out of the shop and headed towards Angelos, where an Asian woman (the lao-ban-niahn) acted as though I wasn't there and busied herself with the register.  Then she motions to me with the I-saw-you-coming-in-now-show-me-what-you-got look.  I pulled my shoes out of the bag, sat them on the counter, and proceeded to explain what had happened.  She shakes her head at me and cuts me off before I could finish.  "Why did you do that?  Why didn't you bring it here first?  Look, they made it worse, etc. etc."  She rebuked me as though I was a foolish child and inflicted pain on both the shoes  and  herself.  So I left them there with her for pickup tomorrow and walked out feeling stupid.  That woman was more sorry for my shoes than me.  My friends' voices swam around in my head - "Oh Minnie, such a slave to fashion" - "You gotta get over your obsession with washing things!".  *sigh*  My feet are so cold without them.  Stupid pink shoes.

      Sometimes when I'm talking with someone and both of us are pouring out our struggles, life feels like a mess.  I feel, "oh my gosh, my life is going nowhere as of right this moment.  It is a complete mess!"  But then all it takes is for one of us to remember one thing which God has blessed, and we know that He is faithful and life is good.  Our God is in control.  I spent 72 hours this past weekend at the Sheraton in Framingham, Massachussetts.  It was the most intense indoor activity I've ever done - a three day church conference!  Leaving aside a bundle of emotions and questions I have yet to sort out, I must say I was really blessed by all the testimonies that were given.  The founding pastor's daughter, Pauline, told her story of being ... well, the pastor's daughter.  Growing up, she was always what people expected of her.  Outwardly, she behaved as the model PK - quiet, obedient, long-suffering.  But inwardly, she was angry, jealous, and rebellious.  Her mother was never at home, but rather travelling and working with college students.  Her mother was never there to talk to her, take her shopping, tuck her in at night, etc.  She would see her mother come home at all hours of the night, tired and worn out, only to answer phone calls and rush out again after a few hours of rest.  She became jealous of the people her mother spent so much time teaching and counseling, and wondered if what her parents were doing was really all necessary.  She would purposely disobey her parents and say things that she knew would hurt.  She was so lonely by herself, with only her grandmother to care for her.  During the past summer, she was finally able to spend one whole month with her mother while they were on the mission field in Tashkent.  There, she saw the fruits of her mother's labor and the lives that were changed.  She looks at the church now and realizes that what she didn't get from her immediate family she received ten times over from the church family.  The people she saw her mom teach around the kitchen table as a child are the pastors and leaders of today, and they cared for her as their own.  What was so beautiful about this is that the very thing that makes her testimony is what made the church possible.  It is because of her mother's sacrifice, which she didn't understand and struggled against, that there is such a body of believers.  In the beginning, I was just curious about what this pretty little harvard student pastor's daughter who sings like an angel has to "confess".  Surely, she's a goodie-goodie, blessed by God and everyone else around her.  But I was amazed at how simple yet powerful it is, that God is not interested in what you do but your heart.  He's all about changing your heart, and only he knows our hearts and has the power to change it.  Moreover, it's chilling to see that the mother's sacrifice that makes this testimony tug at your heartstrings is the very reason why there is such a joyful family of believers.  Sacrifice is something I confess I really don't understand, but this story made me realize how it could be a more than a good thing.  This girl's mother, Rebekah JDSN (Korean for "minister") later read to us a thanksgiving letter she received from a Berkeley sister.  It talked about how she's learned a lot about life while working as a nursing student.  One thing she realized was that, she's been  unfairly  blessed.  Becky jdsn pointed out that it was a very good use of the word.  We mostly know how to use the word "unfair" with a childish attitude.  But this sister understood a better use for the word.  We were challenged to ask ourselves, do we have such a gratitude toward God that our only complaint is, "Why Should He Love Me So?"  If we have anything to complain to God about, it should be "why have you so unfairly blessed  me  while the rest of the world is lost?"  I am truly humbled!

       Snuffles Yang is back  Me: I gave Snuffles a bath today :) ...  he just doesn't look like how I remember.  I think he looks bigger, actually. My Sister: i was reading your mail again, and i think snuffles just ate too much in  Taiwan.  And we went to Ahbearcrombie  Me: My cousin is going to take me to the mall here, home of Abercrombie & Fitch.  That's right.  I like Ohio already. Lisa: funny that you like a&f so much.  it's such a corn-fed white boy label.  Sam: You enjoy that soft porn, don't you?  We spent a week in Ohio  Dear Melissa, Happy New Year and welcome back to school :)  I know now you have to settle back into the routine and stress.  Thanks for taking the time out to host me this week - cooking for me, shopping with me, and chatting with me into the wee hours ... so engrossed that we didn't even notice your car being broken into right outside our window!  It was really good to meet Stan, and I enjoyed hanging out with him and your church family.  I can see that God has really made you a blessing to them and used you mightily.  You are quite gifted, and I am inspired by your obedience to Him.  Thanks for helping me to see areas of my life that needs prayer - even things I've never thought of praying for, things I didn't realize I needed, or things I had given up on.  Well, bundle up, stay warm, and don't get sick anymore this winter (I still can't believe it's possible to go below zero - in Fahrenheit!!).  Miss you already... love, Minnie  And watched some  Veggie Tales   Baby I know your eyes see right through my disguise (and no one can deny) Baby, that I'm the one who's love is no surprise (and he can't tell you no lie) But there's a secret i've be hiding I can't keep it no more (There's this thing about himself he's never told you before) Baby he needs to tell you somethin' I don't got a belly button Oh I need to tell you somethin' (Have you figured out) He don't got a belly button Belly button, no Oh no no   Baby, please don't squeal just tell me how you feel ('Cuz his love is for real) And if you went away my heart would never heal (So to you he appeals) There's something missing in my middle and it's hard to ignore (There's this thing about himself he's never told you before) Baby he needs to tell you somethin' I don't got a belly button Oh I need to tell you somethin' (Have you figured out) He don't got a belly button Belly button, no Oh no no belly button   "Belly Button" Boyz in the Sink

       So we know why the sea is red...  Today I got an email of a  urlLink CNN article  from Lisa, with the comment, "This must be your lucky day!" It cracked me up.  Snuffles hates you for putting ideas in my head...  I'm so happy that the people downstairs are blasting NSYNC, as opposed to the usual crass, hard-core rap.  C'mon, admit it, you love boy bands too.  They make you happy.  They make you think of the days when Britney wasn't a slut (or even around for that matter), Janet had no costume malfunctions, and you were Josie Grossie with the braces, 80's style shirts, and tapered jeans.  I had a lot of fun with Sandra.  On Thursday, we went to see a reading of the musical for  urlLink The Wedding Banquet .  Then we had dinner and made it into Serendipity 3 cafe after a hour-long wait, during which we walked around the Queensboro Bridge and admired the buildings on Sutton Place.  Yesterday we spent the whole afternoon shopping for black dresses at Macy's - I'm getting really good at this!  We had dinner with Albert at Saigon Grill and joked about recent Sandra rumors.  Then Sandra went back to Albert's nice nice downtown apartment.  At first I felt sorry that Sandra couldn't stay with me the whole time, but then I saw his pad and was more envious than sorry :).  So come visit me, and I'll put you up at 39 John Street!

        I Find That:  The NOV is not legally sufficient to establish a prima facie case of Transit Authority Rule 1050.4(a) and that, for the reasons state below, the Notice of Violation is dismissed.

        Before the throne of God above ; I have one strong and perfect plea. A great high priest whose name is Love; who ever lives and pleads for me. My name is graven on his hands; My name is written on his heart. I know that while in heav'n he stands no tongue can bid me thence depart, no tongue can bid me thence depart.   Saw Lord Durian at Redeemer, part II.  Heard a great sermon by Tim Keller, the details of which I've sort of forgotten because I didn't take notes, and Catherine fell asleep (She did the age-old trick of looking like she was praying!).  But, I shall attempt to recount a little.  The text was 2 Samuel 23:13-17, "The Warriors".  To be a Christian warrior involves humility and knowing full well who you are before the Lord.  David behaved as he did (pouring out the water that his warriors had broken through enemy lines and bravely fetched) because he knew that there was nothing he nor they should take credit for; everything was God's grace.  I thought at first it was just a loyalty-garnering strategy that General Liu would've done in  The Romance of the Three Kingdoms  (is anyone fobby enough to know what I'm saying - in reference to the rescuing of Ah-Doh?), but this made sense too :).  David wanted not water, but his reassurance back.  Reassurance that he was king and that God was on his side.  He poured the water out as a drink offering.  To be a Christian warrior also means being like the mighty men in their love for David.  David had said of the water only in sighing, but his warriors braved all odds to bring it back.  Sure, they proved their strength and probably upped the morale significantly, but their being attuned to David's desires and quickness to please shows their love for him.  Likewise, we are warriors when we do this for the Lord.  So now that I've butchered the well-structured sermon and left out a million key points, I must admit this system of mental note-taking is not very effective.  Anyway.  On Monday, I accompanied the aforementioned Lady Durian in a wonderfully successful search for a bargain dress.  Hurray for shopping.  So, this week's been pretty humbling.  I always prided myself for being an honest person, but I realized how little it takes to disprove that.  I've sort of been on a dishonesty streak lately, all shamefully revealed in front of my friends.  I've been a bad witness, but at the same time a good example of how merciful God is :) .  I feel so forgiven, especially after talking to my mom.  It's weird with my mom.  I have this strange complex which compels me to tell my mom everything, especially bad things.  In high school, I always told her whose mother I pissed off that day or which teacher I annoyed or which teacher I'm writing an embarrasingly immature and scathing letter to.  It's kinda like, "Mom, I don't know why people hate me; I'm so innocent."  And even though I've been quite the little evil one since I was young and my mom knows me better than I give her credit for, she still loves/forgives/gives me the benefit of the doubt.  After I confessed my wrongs today and received the expected rebuke, I said "Oh by the way I need a long puffer jacket, can you go shop for one and send it to me?".  I crack myself up.  Sandra's in town!  Time to do the sneak-a-friend event at the dorm.

      When life is kinda sad, and Snuffles isn't talking, you just need to find a reason to laugh.  Even if you are alone, and nobody knows what you are laughing about.  I was by myself during lunch, eating my soup with bread and thinking of how boring bio labs are now that Bronx Boy is no longer in my class.  I remember how he spent a whole lab period trying to teach this Russian boy how to swear, and he'd practice on these Persian/Indian dudes.  So when Sugeet (or some'in or the other) walks over, Konstantin is supposed to say with a straight face, "Yo, get the  fuck  out of here."  But Russian Boy had such a hard time.  He'd always end up saying, "Yo, get the fu... (mumble mumble)."  Hahaha.  Hilarious.  I don't know why I laugh, but I do.  Now it's just Russian boy and me, and we talk about boring things like the kind of trees in California or the rides at Disneyland compared to the rides at Disney World or why it takes an hour to get to Queens on the A train.  So as these thoughts popped in my head, I burst out laughing and soup dribbled down my chin.  As I quickly fumbled to catch it with a spoon on one hand and a napkin on the other, I noticed this black guy glancing over wide-eyed from another table.  He must've been thinking, "damn exchange students are so fuckin' weird."   As for the F-word:   Thanks to black people, the word "fuck" has now registered in Jenny Lee's head as a legitimate English vocabulary that can be used sporadically and nonspecifically.  As some of you know, her first swear word was "bitch".  She learned that by observing good friends calling to each other by, "Come here, bitch".  Now she knows that if someone asks, "What's wrong with the elevator?"  You say, "It's stuck on the fucking floor."  Remarkable - social learning is so effective.   And exchange students:   A Korean girl on my floor got her nose pierced this week, and it looks good!  I like it.  I'm going to get it.  What do you think?  I'll give you a week (maybe two) to intercede on the nose's behalf.  As Valentines Day is approaching, I have begun to remind people that I will be quite alone, without balloon or flower.  So far, I successfully solicited an e-Valentine and two party invites.  catherine: what are you looking for in a husband me: male, asian, christian.  i don't know. haha catherine: so many out there.  that doesn't narrow it down at all snuffles yang: okay how about 5'10", preferably 6', wise, witty, philosophical, intellectual, speaks mandarin and maybe some taiwanese for the fun of it, bad boy with a soft side, boy next door with a wild side, looks good in boring clothes but knows how to dress, drives a crappy car with style but has a nice car, perfect blend of the rich doctor and the penniless writer, has taste but not much opinion... to start off. catherine: better.  i'll have to keep my eyes open me: okay, thanks!

      This is for all you girls, about twenty-five. In little apartments just tryin' to get by. Livin' on, on dreams and Spaghettios. Wonderin' where your life is gonna go.  - "This One's for the Girls", Martina McBride   Okay, not quite.  But in New York, you are always looking for one of three things - a job, a boyfriend, or an apartment.  I've got neither.  Yesterday William called and taunted me about some proverbial clock, the nerve... Snuffles says he's got mobster contacts in Seattle.  Just one call, Yen boy.  You better be careful.

      Back to reality.  Miss you, friends.  One day you may go to the doctor with some Sx and he will question you about your Hx before giving you a Dx.  Your Tx will most likely involve a Rx, which you will bring to me.  And I will say, "Ahh... good luck with  that ".  Okay, after about a year of this, the novelty of blogging is starting to wear off.  I have no desire to write.  I need some other muse besides an inanimate bear.

      Club Trust - my first in NYC, *cheer*.  These lounges/bars/clubs really put the "meat" in Meatpacking District.    You're semi-evil. You're quasi-evil. You're the margarine of evil. You're the diet coke of evil. Just one calorie - not evil enough.  - Dr. Evil    Friend 1:  I still support gay rights and I think gays and lesbians should have the right to marry.  I think the U.S. has made marriage a political institution, which is one of the primary reasons I support gay marriage.  Marriage is about having rights, getting benefits, government census data, it's very much a part of our political and economic system. The meaning of marriage as it is in the Bible is completely lost in today's world, as is evidenced by the 60% divorce rate, adultery, etc. And I don't like civil unions because it supports the whole "separate but equal" ideology in the civil rights era. This part of the gay argument I feel very strongly about.  But of course, I don't know if being gay is a sin or even if being gay but not acting on it is a sin.   Friend 2:  God did not intend for same-sex marriages to exist because marriage is more than a legal institution.  It's a vow we make before God, and more than that, God created it to be a spiritual union (in addition to the physical) between man and woman. I think it's hard to argue that homosexuality is not a sin because of the clear biblical references ... People like to add their own spin on the scripture saying things like, "oh, God just wasn't pleased with THOSE homosexuals" or "that verse was just referring to the people in that time/place and doesn't apply to us" etc etc... but you can easily say that about anything else, so why draw the line there?  ... In fact, as Christians, don't we believe that God's word is the only objective commentary on human beings? That said, it is difficult sometimes to accept biblical teaching because we aren't immune to society and pop culture.  And especially because christians are portrayed as demonic for wanting to deprive two people of a good time or a lifetime of love, whatever you want to call it.  It's hard to explain to others that it's because God the father loves us and wants the absolute BEST for us that he lays down these laws.  In fact, most people don't want to hear these explanations.    At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.   - Dr. Evil

       If you are my friend and you have a Xanga, this doesn't apply to you (or at least, not entirely).  I firmly believe that Xanga.com should provide one extra function (as if they don't got an overload already), and that is the option of giving ePoops.  I believe that half of the Xangays out there deserve it.  And the default radio button for the number of ePoops given should be set at 4 (one each for idiot grammar, inane content, excessive pictures, and annoying background).  Then there's the rare but occasional sound clip.  Oh goodness.  In the name of all that is good - please, no sound clips.    I think I've been in spiritual slumber for a long time.  I always find myself slowed down by apathy, cheap security, and the attractiveness of worldly wisdom.  Then it seems like forever until I rediscover why I accepted Christ, what His death and resurrection means, and reminded that I have chosen to follow.  I feel like I'm often just waking up, waving hello to God from a great divide, and then turning around to continue with my day without a clue what He's up to.  Just today I began to think, who are the Davids, Nathans, and Jonathans in my life?  Who are the God-fearing leaders, spiritually discerning companions, and loyal God-loving friends in my life?  Or rather, where are they?  Are there such covenant relationships in my life?  I am a lazy and wicked servant.

      I was talking to a young classmate today and he mentioned that he worked for one of our professor's community pharmacy.  I thought that was interesting, so I asked where the pharmacy is located.  He was like, "Why?  you're not going to come, are you?  It's on 5th Avenue."   "Oh, 5th Avenue and what?"   "61st Street..."   "What?  How is that possible?  You're next door to Louis Vuitton?"   We stared at each other for a few long seconds until he replied, "NO...it's in BROOKLYN." and everyone around laughed at me.  *sigh*  At my age, I'm not so thick skinned anymore.  I am actually embarrassed.

      Shall I begin a series on tales of high school nothings?  My stalking activities led me to unearth certain memories from the tenth grade, which is to me "the limbo year" because it lingered somewhere between the rebellious mayhem of ninth grade and the golden age of eleventh.  Demographically, tenth grade was somewhere between the mass defection of fellow classmates to TAS and the last-minute arrivals of William and Tina.  Academically, it was somewhere between "screw school" and "I better study for the SAT if I want to get out of here."  It was during this time that a rather interesting angst-filled former goth-turned-bubblegum punk girl named Rui Cheng joined the 10B class.  While Lisa and Sandra were busy with student council and Jenny was busy with then boyfriend, I amused myself in Rui's company during her long cigarette breaks on the fifth floor stairwell.  Schooldays were spent listening to her stories about performing arts school, growing up in New York, picking on "that loser Macaulay Culkin", having a white (and apparently bonehead) boyfriend who thought Chinese people had gray eyes, ballet dancing in Shanghai, the safe and economical way of body piercing with large safety pins, and how she really really wanted to kill herself.  A few years later, she would've been the poster girl for Hot Topic; but in my opinion, she was the forerunner of all plastic lunchbox carrying Marilyn Manson-esque girls.  I helped her cut out Hello Kitty pictures from popsicle boxes while she expounded on the reasons she hated her parents so much.  After a rather dazed and confused semester, Miss Rui left.  She came to me during afternoon cleanup one day and told me that her parents decided to let her go back to New York.  She asked me if I would miss her.  I said I wouldn't miss her, but I'd think about her.  I kept true to my word.    April 26, 2004.  Friendster Message:  Rui wrote:  holy shit!!!  I remember you.  It's funny, I  just saw Emily wang yesterday.  Talk about blast  from the past.....  How are you??? You're in New York?  Hahah.  What a small  world.  Call me if you're around...

      OH my, looks like I've done everything short of handing out keys to my building and signs pointing to my bedroom.  Thanks for the warning, friend of my non-friend Lisa (because she doesn't write and doesn't call and doesn't caaaare!).

       urlLink NoLita  - barely missing the Bowery, away from  urlLink Chinatown , south of the Houston but not quite  urlLink SoHo .  My new double-shot-of-humble abode will be across the street from  urlLink Cafe Habana .  What's great about the apartment is, it comes with a mailbox, buzzer, windows, fire escape, and leveled floorboards.  I was quite disappointed when, after taking a friend to see it, she could only say, "It's so...  small ."  Well!  No Peking Duck for you!  I was thinking of  urlLink Peking Duck  as incentive for people to attend my moving party (the party of people who will move for me).  Think about it: you walk by those ducks all the time.  Rows of ducks hanging by a hook through their necks.  Roasted and glistening ducks hanging beside Cantonese chefs as they deftly pound away with cleavers behind grease-smeared windows.  They are so familiar to you that you hardly realize that you've never actually eaten any before.  Then by some fortuitous encounter, as though Someone read your mind, I offer to treat you to a more attractive version of some of that palatable duck in exchange for a day of mild labor.  Doesn't the prospect of it strike a chord such that makes you want to carry my oak dresser up a five story walkup?  I think so too.  You are hereby cordially invited to Minnie & Company's all-day moving party at [My Address] on Sunday May 2nd, 2004.    R EPONDEZ,  S 'IL  V OUS  P LAIT ?

      I love how the congregation at Redeemer recites the liturgy with such languid monotone,  Praise the Lord, O my soul .  I'd like to imagine it as understated passion.  [Zzzz...].  I think a well-balanced Sunday worship will require a gospel celebration at Brooklyn Tabernacle on top of the semi-requiem at Redeemer.  :P But really, Praise God because I have found an apartment.  I hope the crazy hours of apartment-talk with future roommates will wind down.  How I spent Saturday-  2:30-4:30pm: hanging around the tenement with the workers.  Talk about the apartment. 5:00-9:00pm: "doing homework" at my usual Silkroad.  Talk about the apartment. 9:30-10:30pm: pork fried rice and wonton soup at Wonton Garden.  Talk about the apartment. 11:00pm-1:00am: watching lovers make out, tiramisu and cappuccino at Lanterna di Vittorio.  Talk about the apartment. 1:00-2:00am: sitting on the stoop of Prada, watching silly people trying to hail non-service/occupied cabs.  Talk about the apartment.  Since coming here I've learned how to 1. Play it cool when I accidentally steal someone else's seat in the cafeteria and some black guys attempt to give me a hard time and 2. Yell "Turn it down!" in a strong enough tone so that the music downstairs will  stop  within two seconds.  Since coming to New York, I've become a bit careless with how I express myself and what I say, especially around my very pagan/superstitious/taiwanese future roommates.  Throughout the process of apartment hunting, they've solicited the help of goodness knows how many "gods", and even our moving date has to agree with the Chinese Huangli (Yellow Calendar).  It made me both happy and sad to realize how much more freedom and peace I had, in Christ.  Lilian asked me, "if you pray to God for something and you get it, do you have to  do  something?"  She explained how in Taiwan, she will have to burn "follow-up" incense or offerings for the Buddhist deities.  I told her "No, I just give thanks whenever and wherever."  I had to remind myself that I've been given a Spirit of power and I'm not ashamed of the gospel.  I should openly give thanks to the only God who is worthy of my praise.  This afternoon, Jenny actually came with me to Brooklyn Tabernacle, saying that it is because she kind of misses the gospel music we sang at UCSD.  I think it may also be because she believes that it's "my God" who answered my prayers this time around, so she feels the need to give thanks.  As the pastor spoke and people answered to the altar call, Jenny leaned over and said, "hmm, I guess black people can be annoying but also just like us.  I guess we are all the same to God."  I prayed, as the choir sang, that she would be able to see just a tiny bit of God's love today and that here in his house, satan would have no hold on her heart.    I felt touched.  I didn't know how unhappy I had been all year.  In the future we should go back more often.

      I've been feeling pretty discouraged this week because I thought I would be happily meditating on Jesus' passion, freed from distractions, etc.  Come Good Friday, I'm not feeling much different from Monday.  Suddenly a slew of doubts and questions plague me.  I realize that I don't have as much confidence in God as I think I do.  I act stupidly and say the wrong things because I didn't get what Jesus was talking about.  I'm more Peter than I am John.  I spend half the week reading about how to be like David and thinking instead, "But wouldn't life would be easier if I were Samuel?"  Friend mentions that my theology is a bit fuzzy.  What's going on?  Hmm...  I was really starting to think that I'm more of a stumbling block than anything, until a friend said that she's been surprisingly blessed through reading the bible since we started sharing devotionals together.  I was totally  cracking up  as I read her email because man, it was nothing  I  said or did.  Praise God that as useless as I am, someone is still blessed!

      I like the Eva Cassidy version of "Fields of Gold".  I've decided for this week to not think nor talk to anyone about apartments, boys, and apartments.  And, I'm going to finally go watch The Passion of the Christ.  I guess it wouldn't be weird of me to go alone, since no one would take a date to see that anyway.  Hope you friends have a meaningful Passion week.  I am in need of prayer.

       just one arch ...hey, i like that Before my dad became a poor professor, he was a poor PhD student.  I remember McDonald's opening its first restaurant in Taipei when I was in kindergarten.  I saw all these commercials about hamburgers and french fries and goodies that came with your meal.  So when I moved to Seattle in first grade, I asked my dad for a happy meal.  As far as he was concerned, a happy meal was really all about the box.  So, he made me go and ask the guy at the counter for a happy meal box.  I remember walking out into the rain that night feeling a bit unsatisfied.  As I trudged along, with one hand holding my dad's and the other on my "happy meal", I pondered whether it really is just about the box.  I couldn't help but think of this while eating a happy meal in my empty dorm room tonight.  I'm trying to collect The Dog dogs, to replace the baby pups in the Pound Puppy that Lisa gave me.  Come visit ol' Ruffles, Lisa!
