       Supersonic-idiotic-disconnected-brain-infected-overloaded-candy-coated-scum-sucking-dufus.  Ever have a really long insult that you used to yell out at school? The above was ours in grade 6 (age 11?). The kid who yelled it the loudest and got it out the first won the battle.  Sometimes I feel like yelling it out again, just because someone is ticking me off, but they're not really important enough to take seriously. So, wouldn't it be nice to show them their place with a well timed, well rhymed dis? Isn't that what a lot of rap is about? "A tisket a tasket/ I'll go tit for tat with/ anybody talking this shit that shit/..." Slim Shady knows what it's all about.   Nothing makes me feel like letting loose with an over the top insult string like the minor administrative duties of life. Putting phone accounts on hold. Buying travel insurance. Filling out application forms. Checking to make sure you have everything before you leave the house for work only to discover you can't find your keys to lock the door. That kind of crap makes me loopy.   Kind of ironic that I've been the height of administrative management this past year as an office manager. I guess that I'm okay with that kind of administration because I feel like it's actually important. If I don't show up for work, people notice. I lose my keys and  I  don't even notice.   Did you know that a one month Eurail pass costs around $1000? I know that travelling is expensive, and yet I am consistently surprised by the amount of money that is gushing through my bank accounts. It's like a river in full spate, large volumes flow in and eddy around for a moment only to disapear into winding, neverending tributaries of people with their hands out.  I'm riding a bittersweet high right now - saying permanent goodbye to all my friends is really difficult. Ususally I approach the situation with a nonchalance that I don't feel, but adopt due to fear of turning into a total blubbering, leaking, sap. At the same time, I feel like my life is waiting for me around the corner, all sorts of new friends, challenges, experiences... the whole rest of my life... it's peeking around the corner of the house - like someone who's about to make the dash to safety, but doesn't want to get caught out in their game of hide and go seek.  My life is about to dash home and yell "ALL-y All-y HOME FREE!!!!" with straining vocal cords and furious joy at declaring safety without being subject to the hunt.   I was completing a transaction at work today, with an elderly lady. The way she asked me to tally up her account would have put me short 58 cents. I tried to explain to her why it wouldn't work, as I would be out money, and then my petty cash wouldn't balance, and then I would have to explain it to my boss, and then she would have to alert head office to the problem, and then head office would have to adjust.... nevermind. Anyway, I was trying to explain the consequences of this faulty transaction, and why I could not do it. The elderly Babe must have been frustrated because in the middle of sentence she interrupts me and says, "Oh, you're just trying to tip yourself!" in a very irate tone. I was stilled. Are you kidding?!  58 cents. fifty-freakin'-eight-cents. That's almost a half a gummi bear at the corner store. She's right, 58 cents could go a long way: GIVE IT HERE!  I can't wait to get old and be able to say all sorts of bitter, vile, venemous, accusatory things because I'm wrinkly and my dentures are loose.

      Mother Nature screwed up. She makes us humans pretty efficient. We take in food, we get rid of waste... it all doesn't take very much time. So why, oh why, must I got through FIVE days of inconvenience every month? Why can't this process be as efficient as every other process in my body? Why must it take five days to get rid of not very much? Where is the efficiency in that? Can someone (preferrably someone who isn't queasy) explain it to me please?  I've just noticed that all my entries are like special gourmet dishes. They are served " a la minute" cooked and prepared, right there, on the spot and served still sizzling from my little typing fingers. There's nothing even remotely timeless about them.  It's all in the NOW. I guess 'cause now is the best time. You can never tell what is going to be coming, and  then  is already gone. I suppose it eliminates any type of preparation, thinking and revising, which could be good - as it keeps me honest, but it could be bad - there are things that maybe should be trimmed, tweaked, twiddled, before they're posted. Meh! Ever had an 80 yr. old woman pat your ass? It's an interesting experience. All you feel is bony hand. It's cheeky and weird at the same time, because you just know that the sweet little granny is thinking back to the time when she was 23 and her ass made men cry and bite their knuckles. Now her ass is covered with some labelled "Serenity" adult "incontinence" pad. How's that for sexy? I can still understand the crying part.

      In which our intrepid traveller is preparing for a European trek with her younger (but much bigger) brother. Have been to England every year of my life, so that's where we are going to start. After that: Spain, France, Italy... Switzerland... who knows?? I am borrowing my Dad's massive trekking backpack, which happens to be red. I can't get enough of Canadian flags - I want to sew them on everything I own.  Our flights are quite expensive, but that's OKAY! I want to get a tattoo of a Canadian leaf on my body somewhere. I already have a little design on my lower back - I'm not sure how I can incorporate more graffiti with it... any suggestions? Not sure wether I want to put myself through more pain either. And my mother..."Dahling,  please  don't do it! It's soooooo common." She's British.  On the good side of having the flu and feeling nauseous at the smell of food: I've lost ten pounds.  Although people are starting to comment that I look a little peaked. A little of column "A" a little of column "B". I'm feeling far too normal today. My muse has deserted me. Mundanity is wreaking havoc on the slightest creative impulses.  It's to be expected. No drama for a while will be a good thing.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY CANADA!   The issue I put to you today:  People in love.  1. When you see two people canoodling in a corner somewhere, obviously tremendously satisfied with each other, do you  a) want to spit on them b) smile to yourself c) start to cry  2. When you first fall in love with some one do you a) get scared b) wish the world could stop so that you spend the rest of forever right there, with them c) think too much  3. Love is a) complicated b) a many splendour-d thing c) a crock of crap  4. How often do you think people really fall in love during a life time? a) just once - there is only one true love for any given person b) as many times as they feel like they're in love c) no one really falls in love - it's a crock of crap d) a few times, between 1-3.  5. Love is: a) based on honesty and communication b) based on mutual interests c) based on lust d) a crock of ....  Now, there really is no scoring for this quiz. This ain't no Cosmo "Are you prone to psychotic episodes?" rating. Just think about it. What prompted all this: the movie "A beautiful mind" Mr. Nash was one difficult man to live with. How did his wife do it? Was it love, determination, fear.... all of the above??

      Just as I was thinking I`m a smarty-pants when it comes to languages... Here I am, in Japan and I haven`t a hope in hell. I can`t even try and sound out words, because the alphabet is so illegible to me. I can`t even get money out of a bank machine by myself because I don`t know what the buttons mean. I am entirely dependant on my hostess. I don`t like being dependant... I am an independant person by nature. I also have a personality type that feeds off information and now I am lost at sea. I cannot read signs, street names, menus, anything. ARGH. Sayonara.

      Good heavens. Back from a 5 week trip backpacking around Europe. Leave to go to Japan and Australia within 5 days.  Mundanity threatens at home. Was very happy to be back in my own room, with my own bed and no psycho pyromaniacle bunk mates. And now that I've slept here two days I am VERY ready to leave again. I miss meeting people. I miss cheap beer and wine. I miss new sights. How can I miss new sights? I miss discovery. The sense of being raw, new, unprepared for each new city. Just when we got acclimatized to another language, town, landmarks, we left. Time for more raw newness. Japan will be a culture shock. I will be tall. I will be blonde. I will be strange. I will be in a minority. I will eat lots of seafood. I will not find clothes in the shops that fit me. I will be ready for Australia in a couple weeks!   Of course, the house is in a turmoil. Mum has sold up and is moving to England. I am now officially, homeless, jobless, car-less, but not quite penniless! It's a very liberating feeling, but also extremely scary. I have nothing to hold me down, but nothing to hold onto either. I could easily floatoff the face of the earth. All my ties that bind have been cut, and now I'm massless. I'm a helium balloon without a string. I'm destined for adventure, and eventual touchdown when I run out of juice. But not for a while. Not for a while.  Europe was a good experience. I even had my purse stolen. And it was okay.  I  was okay. I  will be  okay. The big bad world might try to get me, but I keep getting up again. Six more weeks travel and I will be back in Toronto, wondering what the hell to do with my life. I think I want to go back to Berlin and teach English. Berlin got into my blood. Berlin gave me a shot of adrenaline, a shot of the fountain of youth, a shot of reassurance. My home will be wherever I choose to make it. I will not be tied to one city for the rest of my life. I CAN feel comfortable in foreign lands. I will learn other languages, and with them, other modes of thought. In Germany no one ever says, "How are you?" unless they really mean it. People there take it seriously. They will really tell you HOW THEY ARE. And if they are strangers then they will think you are being rude and prying. I like that. I like that you don't have to use that meaningless phrase every time you run into someone you know. An elimination of a platitude.   Someone once said that people either live their lives out of a centre of fear, or a centre of love. Those who fear try to control. Those who love, accept. I feel like I moved towards love during this trip. You cannot make friends without reaching out. Smile when you make eye contact with someone and see what happens. Being shy will not get you anywhere. Be who you are. Don't pose, pretend or talk shit. Accept. The only valuable thing in life is genuine interactions with other people. REAL living. You will only achieve this if you discard the dross of ego, pretension and fallacy. Ambition is all the greater if you are open about your goals. Ambition becomes something different if you are not entirely self serving.

      Got home from the bar last night and as we (my friends and I) were chowing down on our late night fast food binge a commercial came on television advertising lower costing natural gas carriers. The man in the commercial faints and falls backwards when he discovers how much money he's saved on his heating bill. I was petrified.  I almost started to cry. Normalacy frightens me so much that I   almost started to cry  . Dear sweet heaven, I don't want to face the reality of the rest of life. I bloody well refust to accept that version of life. I am determined that somewhere inside me is the strength to live a life less ordinary. The idea of a house, with cable bills and small children and a man who kisses me on the cheek every morning as he goes off to the same job 5 times a week... no thank you. Some other McCookieCutter combo life please.

      Sleepless. My inner clock is all messed up – still on Australian time. First priority on arriving back in Canada: recouperate my music collection. Can’t believe how much it matters to me.  Am also incredibly eager to see all my friends, catch up, get reconnected.   Japan was an experience that made me aware of how I live. Bare shoulders here in Canada are normal, in Japan bare shoulders are tarty. Electronic toilets in Japan are run of the mill (they even have two different kinds of jet water squirts), electronic toilets here are unheard-of. I live a strange life. A semi-charmed life. And now, what do I want to do with it? What job can I do that I will LOVE, that will not feel like work, that will offer a sense of accomplishment but won't leave me poor? I could write blogs for a living, but then, I would be poor. I also have a feeling that I would have to be more careful and artistic about it, rather than just setting down all the inanities in my head. I would also have to spell correctly. Not-so-much.  What to do, what to do? Back to school for a bit, back to work for a while, and back to Australia in a couple years. I gotta go back.  I gotta:  ~learn how to surf ~parasail ~get my scuba diving certification ~go horse back riding ~camp out in the outback ~hike through the rainforest ~pet more Koalas ~get through some of the watering holes ~go canyoning ~white water raft All these things and more, I gotta  gotta  do!  What has everyone else done? What would you do? You're homeless, jobless but not hopeless. Employable, but unsure as to which vocation to follow. Where do I start? I need money to go to school to see if I want to do certain things that would lead to a career. To get money to go to school I need a job. How do I get a job in a career that I might want to get into but still have to go to school for? Therein lies the quandry.  I can't remember who said it, but someone did, "There is inspiration in everything. If you don't see it, look harder." I say a television show on redecorating - their inspiration for a new master bedroom? Tiffany's. As in the jewellery store. As in Turquoise and white ribbons. Interesting. Inspiration is everywhere. Why can't I find it sometimes? My muse must be fickle. Either that or I'm just some part time job that she's filling in time for some extra cash, or brownie points, or however the Muse Payment System works.  Apparently there are 80,000 books published per year in the USA. Maybe my muse is too busy helping the real writers in their literary works. What happens if you feel creative, you know it in your bones and you try to BE creative and live a creative life and you can't? What happens then? Are you just trying too hard? Should you just let creativity happen around you, or should you continue to work at it? Continue to look for inspiration in everything. Inspiration in the way the furnace rattles when it turns on? Inspiration in the sign above my head that says "Katanga spoken here"?! Inspiration in the early light over a suburb of Toronto? Inspiration in looking for inspiration. At least frustration gives me something to write about. I am given subject matter by my complete lack of any proper subject matter. I've been most of the way around the world, 11 countries in one year and I don't really have much to say about it. I hold my experiences to myself, refusing to believe that anyone really wants to hear that the Swiss graveyards are a riot of colourful flowers, and that Australia feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, when it's not really. Perhaps I dread trying to explain my feeling because I don't analyze them. To expound on them, I would have to monitor what I am thinking and why, and then try and express it in an interesting manner that other people would actually want to hear. Hmmmmmm. Do other people really want to hear that?! Do they?

      And christmas has come and gone and new years is almost here and now what? I refuse to make resolutions, I'm full of them already and they are not going according to plan. What ever does go according to plan?    An inventory of relationships   One uncle in love: age 42 and skipping around like a 12 year old with a new toy. Irritatingly happy and motivated. Rose coloured glasses are distorting his world and I have to put up with it.    One father breaking up with his girlfriend: irritatingly moody and unpleasant. Cynical. Smokes more and smiles less. Future so dark he has to wear a miner's light to see one day ahead of himself.    Me: in the middle of relationship weirdness. One good friend who is more than that, but I don't want to commit. One email companion who is really nothing, yet - but promising. Lots of people from the past popping up during the holiday season - disconcerting. No one likes to be reminded of their mistakes.    One mother in England missing her dining room table - the shipping company has sent out an urgent search for it. Description: Mahogany, old, recently refinished, art nouveau legs and feet that appear to melt into the floor. If you've seen it, please email me, I'm tired of calling the shipping company for status updates.   One grandmother who can do the crossword in the Toronto Star in about 10 minutes, EVERY morning.    40 new friends at work - am finally getting settled and accepted. Must quit soon!   3 close friends I miss dearly - feel free to move to Toronto, or at least get your drivers' liscenses so that you can come visit me!   1 malfunctioning cell phone, due possibly to the lapse in my payments to Bell over the past three months. HATE bell, but understand why they don't want me to rack up anymore money owing. HATE THEM.   1 dial up internet connection - this is frustrating. It's killing me. Soon to change.   3 stereo systems: YES!   One old cat: arthritis makes her joints pop as she walks. Sounds like rice krispies. Kinda funny actually.   16 rolls of film documenting 3 months of travelling. Feel like I never left at all.    One computer.   Two rooms of storage full of furniture, books and clothes. Soon to be empty.   One new landlord. Is he ever in for a surprise!   Zero cars. Ouch.   35 over due bills. Kidding. 3 over due bills. For real.   One pair of new red boots. Made for walking, provided they are weatherproofed and there is no snow or ice around. Correction: One pair of new red boots. Made for sitting and looking good in.  The end!

      Conversation overheard between Dad and Grandma... Grandma says," Betty Richmond is looking really good! They cauterized something and it worked wonders."  Wow, can't wait to be old.  In the search for a job with meaning... something that I don't need a doctorate for. Champion television watcher, chief straying fork, ultimate web surfer? Working full time in retail is souless, painful and stifling. Even thinking about what I have to do for 8 hours a day cripples any sense of hope.

      Interesting old lady on the bus. Spent half and hour yelling, "85th division, 95th division, 105th division! All involved in crimes against my family! 45th division, they're the worst! It's all dirty garbage! You can like it, or lump it. The whole police force! The 35th division, oh yes, that goes all the way back to the 80's. All involved in crimes against my family. Dirty garbage. They're killling us with the windows DOWN!" Weird eh? Interesting young man on the bus. My water bottle fell over and he actually got up and set it upright for me. And then he held the door open for me at the bus station. And then I ran off to catch my transfer. I wonder who he was? I wonder if other people do this? I've decided I like taking the bus. It might be a long trip every morning and night, but I either get some good reading, or some interesting stories to tell.  Interesting indeed...

      Today is a day that makes all the cabin fever Canadians go slightly insane. If I was in my home town right now, I could drive down certain streets and see the front lawns of certain houses decorated with couches, University students and beer-a-mids. Today is the kind of day that you step outside and think, "Why wasn't I up with the birds to enjoy this?" Today is the kind of day that the dirty snow melts and there are fresh streams running down all the pavements and the soggy brown grass underneath the snow starts to show. Today is the kind of day when there are 1/2 hr. line ups at the car wash, to get all the salt, muck and winter slime off a car that will soon sparkle almost as much as the sun does. Today is the kind of day that I hear birdsong and realize how long it's been since I heard it last. Today is the kind of day that even though you are inside, you can just tell that it's blissfull outside. Today is the kind of day that you open all the windows of the house, because although it's not quite warm yet, the air is certainly fresh, and you can smell a preview of summer in the breeze. Today is the kind of day when going for a long, random walk is the best thing to do. Today is the kind of day that makes people happy.

      Life is so so so crazy. Or should I say, "woo woo"? I'm dating now. I met a guy at a bar a couple weeks ago (I know, the bar scene has typically horrific results). Gave out my phone number for the first time ever. He calls me a week later, after I've been checking my call display like a child waiting for christmas. We set up a date. Date starts out great, even though he's two hours late. We have dinner and "same page" conversation. He holds my hand. I get all embarrassed but like it. We go to one of his friends' house. We head to the same bar where we met. Things are already going downhill. He's had about 9 drinks and then KABLAM!! he turns into "Mr Fucknuts." 3 hours later I am driving his stupid FUCKING loaded ASS home in his standard car. I don't know how to drive standard.  We stop at his house and he says, "I won't kiss you until it means something, but we can have sex!"  I laugh. But wait, he's serious.  "C'mon, just let me put it in you." AND "you should get on the pill soon." "But I don't want to get on the pill." "That's okay, I don't need to come inside you. I bet I could unload at least four shots our first time."  I have known him for 7 hours.  He calls me the next day to apologize. At 3am. Drunk. I am calm and nice. Always too nice. I explain to him why I don't want to see him. He says he understands and we hang up. He calls me later to make really sure that I can't forgive him for being a total FUCKHEAD. This time it's 3:30 am. Again I am nice, again I tell him that I never want to see him. Finally he says that he will never call me, but if I ever feel like I can forgive, then he would really like to have another date. He promises that he won't get drunk this time.  After all, "out of all the of the girls I'm dating, I like you the best."

      and this is an excerpt from friendly Jeff - who is touring eastern Europe right now. God he's funny.  So George Bush is coming tomorrow. That's right, good ol' dubya. I'm gonna try to meet him, maybe get a picture with him. Maybe see if I can hitch a ride to Dresden with him. That'd be much better than taking the damn Polish train. It's such a thrill when that drink cart lady comes around and starts yelling at me in Polish. She scares the hell out of me, and I have no idea if she's telling me how she's gonna kill me, or offering me a refreshing beverage of my choice. She always tells me it's free, but I've seen others paying. I don't trust the little wench. It's the same one too. There must be hundreds of her.

      Found this quote on the  urlLink Deviant Art  website...    The difference between 'involvement' and 'commitment' is like an eggs-and-ham breakfast: the chicken was 'involved' - the pig was 'committed.'  I want a job that I can commit to.   And now a moral question for you: If you were in absolute lust with someone, and they had a significant other (but didn't care), would you still fool around with them? One of my friends at work is toying with the idea of getting it on with a guy who says he has a girlfriend, but then shrugs his shoulders, as if to say, "but that signifies nothing!" Having been on the "cheated on" end of a relationship, I won't go near anyone who is involved with a significant other. What say you?

      Weird sleeping patterns recently.  Trippy dreams too. Last weekend I was dining at Buckingham Palace - in one of those great halls all embossed with gold leaf and the walls covered in a uneven layer of family portraiture, done in heavy oils. I was sandwiched between my lunch companions, but can't remember who they were. I don't remember that the Queen was there either, but she's not really that important.  True to my sensualist nature, I do remember the dessert. It was a chocolate cup cake - in the shape of flower pot bread. Into the bottom of this cup cake, they had stuffed a small egg shape mound of very cold mint-chocolate ice cream. I was thinking: I must remember this! I can make it myself! It was cold and delicious. As for last night's dream... This must be the first time that I have fallen in love while asleep. He's large - in all senses - the build of the incredible hulk. But he's a hulk who hasn't worked out for a while, so all the popping veins and chiselled muscles have softened - making him less frightening. He is 42 (!! - note, I'm 24) and has a brush cut of blonde/grey hair, that he used to wear longer in a fashionable type bowl cut.  He is an athlete of some sort, or vaguely associated with the Navy seals. We went to a funeral where everyone was dressed in outdoor activity clothing. Someone portaged the corpse resting in a small aluminium boat down to the river, where they launched it into the rapids with little ceremony. All the funeral guests were half concealed among the gold and red changing autumn trees. After the boat launch, they all melted away - like spies eager to disappear. Back to the man I was in love with... we had a shower together in a cavernous tiled blue/grey room that was completely featureless except for the faucet and shower head protruding from one wall. I can feel the warm deliciousness of the water soaking my hair as we clung together under the nozzle. My largest bath sheet barely met over his shoulders. I woke up in the morning (in my dream) and he was sitting on the floor beside the bed, his eyes level with my pillow, watching me sleep.  I'm bashful and just look at him in contemplation. He says, " Would you believe me if I told you that I hadn't been this happy in years?" and I can't stop myself from smiling, but hid my face in my pillow and grin and grin and grin. His blue eyes sparkle with welcome and good humour as he climbs back into bed with me and strokes my bare arm. I am in love. But he has skin cancer. I keep thinking about how healthy he looks, but how so vital a man will have to be cared for as his cancer progresses. I look forward to nurturing and maintaining  that happy spark in his eyes. Cancer is nothing. It doesn't stand a chance. So I wake up, for real - full of love. In love. And the feeling stays with me for most of the day. Now, whenever I need it, I can think about how I felt and remember how it is to have someone like that in your life. Sweet bliss.

      oh yeah, and my first really creepy "homeless" incident  on the street car today.  This guy is standing in front of me, smelling like week old dirty underwear. He's calling everyone RETARD and then he starts to bang away on the metal pole by the exit stairs. He keeps saying, "It's not my fault, it's just the way I am.." as he hammers away. I hope he doesn't turn around and notice me trying to be invisible. His testicles are showing, hanging out of the gapping hole in his jeans. For the first time in a month of this commute, I feel threatened.

      	I have now started my proper job and this is my first week on my own. I hardly need to say how happy I am to be sitting behind a desk, looking at a computer screen and feeling my eyeballs turn dry and square. So much less exquisitly painful than standing in a shop, trying to get people to buy clothes that they don’t need and won’t (please don’t!) wear.   	I miss the music and the stimulation of the store. I don’t miss the rude imbeciles, bellowing children and having to refold t-shirts until my arms give out. I loathed my previous job, and now, I’m just a happy little bunny.   	On my way to work I get to go through one of the scarier neighbourhoods in Toronto. Lots of drugs, lots of homeless people. The homeless provide me with a sense of perspective, and a sense of humour. Today I watched from out of the streetcar as a man raked his fingers through his woman’s hair and then carefully braided it down the centre of her back. When he was done, they returned to their seats... she on a plastic milk carton, he on the rancid sleeping bag. It was touching and terribly sad. They were so caring towards each other, but their lifestyle looks so hopeless.  	I often wonder why the wanderers collect the strange junk that they cling to. Bicycles, I understand... but office furniture? What possible use can a rolling chair be to anyone without a room to put it in? I’ll tell you what use it can be. Aparently, they make good pillows. The guy had the chair laying on the grass in the park, the arms facing into the sky. The backrest was the resting place for his head. And VOILA! A 40 pound, solid construction, plastic, foam and upholstery pillow. Or maybe he was just lying on it like that so no one would steal it?  So far I’ve seen:  •	Three fights - one involving a “Matrix” type of leap into the air and flying, flailing kicking. •	A man reach out and grab a skinny crackwhore type girl and try and put his hand down her pants. •	A man get on the streetcar with bright turquoise surgical gloves on, careful to make sure his skin touches nothing. His jeans though, are     completely putrid, covered in slime, dirt and muck. He can’t be that concerned about personal hygine. Oh yeah, he followed me to work too. Creepy.

      After reading this article on  urlLink Feminism "Lite " I am further appalled at the citizens of the United States of America for electing George W. Bush into the most powerful office in the country (perhaps the world - but that's another argument).  After reading the last two paragraphs of this article I was horrified to learn about Bush's supporters, his committee memebers, his tendencies. Take this guy:  "Dr David Hagger, who opposes legal abortion, refuses to prescribe contraception to unmarried women and wrote a book suggesting bible reading as a treatment for premenstrual symptoms, sits on a medical panel overseeing contraception."  Are you kidding me? Bible reading as help for premenstrual syptoms?! God give me patience (and it won't come from reading the bible). Has this man ever been within choking distance of a woman with cramps?  Men: is this what you want for your wives, mothers, sisters, friends? A woman doubled over in uterine contractions, feverishly reciting Genesis 1.1?

      Is it bad that my blog is completely about people and relationships? I mean, it completely ignores all the important things that are happening right now. The death of Saddam's sons, the Stone's Concert, the killing of Zhara in Iran and her subsequent burial there. Summer. The idiocy of George W. Bush. The death of the conjoined twins.  The fact that I should be doing work, instead of doing this. Ah, work.... now there's something important, right? I mean, this place would fall apart without me.. wouldn't it? No, I doubt it.  How about an opinion on something? Should I offer up my trite, uninformed blatherings on subjects that I don't really care about? Yes? Okay... here we go. Americans: I don't know what you think of Bush, but every time I hear one of those stupid, "In our great God-fearing country" speeches I want to put my boot through the television screen. What GOD is he referring to? His version of Jesus, who carries a bazooka and wears the stars and stripes on weekends at trailer park BBQ's? Can you really relate to anything this man is saying? Do you really want this Looney as the president of your country? Did you know that Toronto pays Michigan to take our garbage? You want our garbage? It's all yours. But judging from all the Dubya rhetoric I've been witness too, I figure you should clean the trash out of the white house before you start taking on our pile of shit. And NO we will not go and invade another country with you. Turns out that the information regarding the weapons programs in Iraq was a little fuckin' LIES? Surprised? No? Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. I'm so glad that our prime minister took a stand and told the U.S.A. that we won't send any of our Army members to Iraq to blow things up with you. The whole war is some shitte excuse for the beginning of the new Multinational. The United States of America, Inc. How ya feel about that?

      This is why she is my best friend....  hello    I am sorry to have heard your message today...Just remember  where your heart was when  you talked about what [Frilly] really needs and wants, and you happen to have found someone that has different needs and wants. Fate brought you here to remind you there is some else that is better for you later,not now. And not to lose the FOCUS of I AM ME.....Love is hard enough then to match it with someone that's not quite ready. You will be treasured when the time is yours, look I didn't find true love until I was 26. You are a complete women in all aspects, and if you don't know that by now something wonderful has been lost. You may have to fight the battle of love more than once to win it. ( hinge) " a moveable joint, closes, and OPENS. You handled the situation the best you could, so what:  that we don't have all the answers of WHY, be the hinge, where is the woman that has or had those wings.                                                                     love and friendship M. :)   What would I do without that kind of love and support?   This is my Zodiac sign.. no wonder I'm so emotional and unhinged right now.    Scorpio     youur sign is that of intense Scorpio, best characterized by passion, intensity, and emotionality. You are considered to be the most powerful and extreme sign of the zodiac, because you deal with the process of fundamental transformation on all levels.    Pluto's influence makes you a charismatic, yet enigmatic person. While you may appear serene on the surface, you contain a magnetic intensity and powerfully hypnotic personality, belied only by a penetrating stare of deep intelligence.    Scorpio, you rule the eighth house of the chart, which is associated with other people's money, possessions, and values, as well as wealth received through inheritance; it also describes how and to what extent we commit, and bond with our partner, both on a sexual and emotional level. Yours is a fixed sign, which means that you are steadfast in adversity. Once you put your mind to something, you display self-discipline and staying power. You work stoically to achieve your goals - no matter the cost!

      You were perfect because we had a lot, in common. Including personality. You are flawed because you are frightened of responsibility. Being my boyfriend does carry responsibility, but it's not as hard as you think.     I'm not demanding, I'm not jealous, I won't cramp your style. I won't tie you down, or keep you in line. I won't manipulate, whine or nag. I don't like any of these things as traits in other people and therefore I try to avoid them in myself. How could you have acted so caringly, without wanting to know that I would be yours, and you mine? You haven't been (and don't want to) date other women, but now, I've had to tell you that you can't date me either. Are you thinking about me? Am I burning a hole in your brain? Why do I feel like there is more to this? Is it my pride - refusing to admit that I can't have you? Or is my gut really telling me that we're not over, and you somehow, will reconsider.    You obviously liked me - still like me? You liked me, but not enough. You are so smart, you followed my reasoning and argumentations so well. You are the first guy who hasn't said, "But I don't understand!" If you can understand that much, if you are as intuitive as I think you are, then you should realize what just walked out of your life. Maybe that's it, maybe you're glad I'm gone and you don't have to worry about my happiness being in your hands. Maybe you cared too much, and scared yourself with the possibility that I did too. Maybe it was too easy.  Maybe I should shut up and get on with my life and stop obsessing about someone who cares - but not enough.  I'm so unaccustomed to this. Maybe it's time.

      I've decided that I can't relate to people who get the blues. Nor do I understand the "mean reds", nor even the deep blacks.  No, I get something altogether less colourful. I get the "slows".  Moving fast - not an option. Moving at all - not an option. Thinking clearly - not an option. Thinking at all - not an option. When I'm feeling crappy I seem to live my life in a suspension of maple syrup and molasses. My thoughts go 'round and 'round, swirling in the most decadent, meandering way... My body feels bloated, so far removed from the ballerina I dream at night. Motivation disapears. Everything is too damn much effort. Even complaining. The best thing to do when I have the slows, is to go to bed. Sleep it off. Sleep until I can't sleep anymore and I'm so full of nervous energy that I just have to DO something... and then that something usually gets rid of the slows.

      Standing watching the subway train pull into the station and I think how easy it would be to just step in front of it. Only my small, quick firing synapses keep me from moving those perilous two feet to death. So easy to die... So easy to just let go of the caring and step out into the void, pulling my screaming mind after me. Where would the sweet release take me? My new adventure would begin, leaving mourners and confusion. I am not unhappy. I just have a strong case of cat-killing curiosity. What would it FEEL like, not to feel anymore. Why does my brain hold me back from the edge so imperatively. Why is it so important that I stay safe and sound on the platform? Would I feel the train making contact, or would I just go black. I could easily trip, fall, stumble, get pushed.  The weapons of destruction are all around us. You can kill someone with rolled up newspaper. The nuclear bomb is scary, the guy who thinks up how to kill someone with any given object, that's terrifying.  Death stalks us from the minute we are born. I will die anyway, why not go at a time of my own choosing. Why not go in an adventurous way, rather than that every hoped-for "in the sleep" senario. Maybe death is just the begining and this, this little bit of time is my purgatory. I must say,  I don't have many issues with this kind of limbo life. I'm learning, I live passionately, sumptuous in my relaxtion, electric in my action. But where would that step off the platform take me? Into what realm, dimesion, conciousness would I emerge? Is there anything to emerge into at all? Ah yes, the slippery afterlife... bright lights and melifluous voices? Chared, burning agony?  Vacuum? Un-being? Release into the cosmos? Carebear lifestyle? Like I said, cat-killing curiosity.

      This from an  urlLink article  on how people get to be  rich...   1. They live well below their means.  2. They allocate their time, energy and money efficiently, in ways conducive to building wealth.  3. They believe that financial independence is more important than displaying high social status.  4. Their parents did not provide economic outpatient care. 5. Their adult children are economically self-sufficient.  6. They are proficient in targeting market opportunities. 7. They chose the right occupations.

      More eastern eurpean email from Jeff:  I'm in hell at the moment. I haven't written in a while because I am lazy and I don't like most of you. I was in Budapest, which was pretty cool. They had some nice places to hang out and relax, and some sweet baths to soak up the sun and watch very overweight men and women walk around in skimmpy bathing suits and speedos. Somebody should tell these people. Had I known a word of Hungarian I would've done it myself.   As for recent events... I was at the Jay-Z and 50 Cent concert at the Molson ampitheater last night. I must say that although 50cent is very popular right now, Jay-Z is a real professional. He had the crowd going from the second he walked on stage. He did a lot of his big hits- H to tha Izzo, Big Pimpin', etc as well as his new La-la-la-la. Unfortunately the billing for the concert was 50 Cent, Jay-Z and "friends." Rumour has it that the friends were: Missy Eliot, Lil' Mo, Fabolous, and others but that they didn't want to come accross the border. That really bites, esspecially now that SARS is on it's way out, and our economy could really use some positive publicity, and we all know that STARS visiting Toronto would have provided that. Considering that the tickets for the concert sold out in 15 minutes, one would hope that our Canadian enthusiasm would have promted a little more love from the Hip Hop bright lights. I guess not.  I'ma Mutha Fuckin' P.I.M.P.  Now that pot is almost legal, and people aren't charged with possession anymore, the ampitheater was constantly covered in a noxious fragrant haze of weed smoke. Police men were walking by and people with joints still ducked their heads, or hid the lit spliff, but eventually they got used to the idea of not being harassed and they stopped being so shy. This guy sitting beside us was rolling one mother of a joint, the MOAJ, as I like to call it, and he only used a flyer to keep the weed from blowing away, not to disguise his fatty. It was surreal and smelly. But the concert goers were remarkably well behaved, no brawls, or butchery. I think there may have been a shooting the parking lot, as we hear the sound of fire crackers and then there were dozens of police cars, ambulances and uniforms running around, but I haven't heard anything about it yet.  I'll just have to wait and see if there is anything on the news. Oh wait, there is... it was a drive by shooting... read the  urlLink article .

I want to grow up. Why? - I get to be responsible for my actions - Fun means a risque joke with friends - Dorks are cool - I get to have kids who use lingo that I will never understand - I get to worry about wrinkles, saddle bags and arthritis  - I get to go home from work on Friday night and go straight to bed because, "I'm absolutely shattered, dahling." Fuck this noise.  Twice in one week - Fuck this noise - three times!  Well well... ain't it going to be a super-skipper-y weekend then?

      And now you make me mad. You call me, you joke with me, I miss you more than ever and yet you still aren't willing to give effort. You say that you are - that I just have to give it more time, but it's been 3 months of heartache. Why do you tell me that you care about me and then I always have to be the one to make the contact, to put myself out there, to cry, in the end. So I tell you I need more than words. Is all I ask of you/to make me feel/then you wouldn't have to say/that you  - wait, he hasn't said that he loves me. /cause I'd already know/   - Anyway, where has my fierce, proud, strength gone? Why do I end up whining every time I get on the phone with you? Why am I whining now?! Resolution: Okay, you say you care, but I'm not seeing it. You say give it more time, but I don't have that kind of patience (it's a failing of mine). SO - the obvious conclusion is that you then, are not right for me even though I've never met anyone more perfect for me in my life. Okay. So - life is telling me that there is someone ever BETTER out there. Where do I find the strength to tell you not to call, when you are promising me everything - - - -> even commitment?   Why am I so sad after our phone conversations? Are we "star cross'd lovers"? And what THE HELL is the big deal about taking me out on a proper date??? Why is it like pulling teeth. You know what? FUCK THIS NOISE. I need a guy who says he'll pick me up at 6pm and is outside waiting at 5:30pm 'cause he's excited. None of this... "well, I've been busy" nonsense. I do not come last to everything else in your life. I am not something you squeeze in after frisbee but before sleeping. I am not that girl. I am not this girl - this quiet, sad, angry, doleful creature. I sit and silently vibrate misery and hurt. You hurt. You hurt me. This is not healthy. I'm gone. AGAIN.  Enough of the relationship crap.

      I am now officially a member of the C.R.A.F.T. club. So are most of my friends. I'll give you a hint as to what C.R.A.F.T. stands for: 1. You must party, in fact, you must party hardy. 2. You must drink, you must drink lots. 3. You must have a severe hangover.  Okay, so it's not exactly a contribution to society, but the C.R.A.F.T. club does support the economy. All that alcohol consumption must make up about 50% of the government's profit from liquor sales. So to be a member of the C.R.A.F.T club, you must be able to wake up in the morning and shout out, "What the hell happened last night?! Who are you?! Where am I?! Where did we go?! What did we do?!" and then, after a diginified pause you shriek, "I  C an't  R emember  A   F ucking  T hing!" and now you have gained admission to one of the most respected, prestigious, far-reaching and powerful organiztion in the world. We have literaly millions of honorary members... including the person who coined the term "coyote ugly" and all those guys in movies who wake up next to creepy strange women.   Now there are rules to belonging. Hommage must be made to the alcohol gods at least twice a month, at worst, or 5 times a week (at best). A pilgrimage must be made. Visiting either a brewery, a winery, or the place where they make rubbing alcohol is mandatory. You are expected to enter these hallowed grounds in a smiling, decorus manner and not leave until you have been bodily ejected for puking either: on the tour guide, on the grape vines, into a barrel containing fermenting yeast or such like, all over the rest of the tour group. Projectile vomiting is not necessary, but recommended. Once you have returned to your hotel/hostel/house/appartment/condo/hole in the ground you must loudly proclaim our name, "I can't remember a fucking thing!" At this point you should be quizzed by a friend as to where you wen't, who you were with and why you got kicked out. If you answer any or all of these questions correctly, you have failed miserably and must once again commence your pilgrimage.   There are some slight diversions that might be prohibitive to the general public.     Parents/loved ones indicating deep concern regarding your substance abuse.   Public humiliation that comes with being banned from every bar in your greater metropolis   Being unable to correctly remember your name and address - when you are sober   Being told that you don't ever have to go to work again, at least, not at that branch of MacDonalds   Disapearance of significant other - either they left you, or you ate them last night when that mean case of the munchies hit    Anyway, all of these so called "drawbacks" should be regarded in the light of clear pale ale. These are mere trifles in relation to the amount of fun you are having. Who needs friends anyway?  Of course, there are other methods besides alcohol by which you can reach the appropriate stage of forgetfulness. There is always the option of drugs, and/or deep meditation, but these methods are not recommended and should be avoided at all costs as they are anti-social and reduce the possibilities of playing drinking games, or picking up that hottie behind the bar.   And voila! You too are now a memeber of the C.R.A.F.T* club.    *CRAFT concept stolen from Tom Robbin's book:  urlLink Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates .  Enjoy!

      I was watching some CNN crap special report on children's beauty pageants last week. I was watching in that horrified, drone-like submission that so often descends once I  sit down in front of the television. Please tell me that these little girls are going to grow up to be decent, contributing memebers of society. Please tell me to make me believe you. One of the girls one the prize for "Most facially gifted." WHAT THE F**K?! It's the same with all the women's pageants - even the Miss Teen America girls were judged about how they looked in bikinis. And the announcers kept saying, "And remember, it's not about the bikini the girls are wearing, it's not about how they look in it... they're judged on their  overall  appearance and presentation." What the hell do you need a bikini for? Is it to prove which girl is happiest walking around a stage in heels in front of the studio and nation television audience? You need bikinis for this? What skills, talents, or aptitudes are these girls being rewarded for? Celulite free asses? The correct hair flipping technique? I know, it's the ability to maintain the glued on smile.  There wasn't even a lame attempt at a "talent" for these ladies. Hell, only the top 5 had to open their mouths for anything at all. For all we know they could be illiterate, ignorant bigots with great tits. Hell, I bet some of them  are .  Well ladies - here's your pearl and diamond crown, after all, you emptied 8 bottles of hairspray on your head. You've earned it.  As for the critics.... one little girl's stage mother had the most inane response to date: "It's a great hobby."  Hello lady - YOUR GIRL CHILDREN ARE NOT A HOBBY. Now go read a book.

Perhaps that's because we were staying with a "respectable" middle class family. Perhaps it's because I don't read or speak Japanese - so I wouldn't know if I did see newspaper articles like this.

Please please please aquaint yourselves with what IS.   Found this saying on DeviantArt: "Pride is the bitch that fucks you over every chance she gets." True that.  And to you who I missed and then found again: It's hard for me not to be bitter, but you haven't exactly behaved considerately. On the other hand, you were never rude, or cruel, just stupid. So, for now, I think you and I will go in different directions - you on your hedonistic, somewhat destructive path, me on my hedonistic, but more resposible and settled path. I still feel like there should have been something crazy and amazing between us, but I can't make you care if you don't. Obviously. I'm still angry, I'm still sad, but now I'm moving on.

       And another weekend boogie fest is over. No new pickup lines for the list - which isn't to say that none were used (I am so quick to point out). It's just that they were pretty run of the mill. "Hi I'm dumb-ass, what's your name" was common, along with, "Yeah, go girls!" Some guy did buy me three drinks - but I never saw who he was. Gentlemen - Zambuca is an aquired taste. Please do not *specifically* order it for a girl you are trying to impress. It is strong and after a night of drinking the flavour is still obnoxious. The general rule is "fruity is good". That's how we like our drinks. And our gay friends. If you want to buy us alcohol - anything ballet pink should be just fine.

      Two issues today: Men's bathrooms & Politicians.  1. Men's bathrooms. Boys, I don't know what happens in these places, but from the sounds of things there's a lot of checkin' out each other's equipment.  My younger brother told me that he had a most interesting run-in a couple weekends ago, while at the bar. Quite frankly, I'm a little worried. He was "balls to the wall" takin' a leak at the urinal, when some dude beside him said, "Dude! You've got a Wonderous dick!" Then of course, "I'm not gay or anything..." etc etc.  I  had to double check with my brother - did the guy actually say "wonderous"? Was that the exact word? If so, why? Who does that? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?! For god's sake, tell him you like his shoes, or his hair even, but why is it necessary to comment on the twig and two berries? Most disturbing of all is that my brother shared this story with me. I never, ever would have wanted to know that other guys are impressed by his package. EW.   2. Politicians Alrighty, watched part of the Ontario Premiers debate last night. What the hell is the point of a debate anyway? All those three smarmy bastards could do is sidestep. They wriggled out of every question, after having thanked the person who posed it to them. They would say, "Thank you for giving me the oportunity to address that issue..." and off they'd go on some ramble about their campaign platform while rarely, if ever, winding down with a proper answer. I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of the nonesense.   Oh yeah, and has anyone ever told Ernie Eves about his hair? He looks like that character from one of the Star Trek shows. The one that is a  urlLink shape shifter . That shit's not cool.

        The meaning behind the word   urlLink av*a*tar (v-tar) N.  1. The incarnation of a Hindu deity, especially Vishnu, in human or animal form. An embodiment, as of a quality or concept; an archetype: the very avatar of cunning. 2. A representation of a user in a multi-user virtual reality environment. 3. A root or superuser. There are quite a few Unix computers on which the name of the superuser account is "avatar" rather than "root".  Hmmmm, New Zealand has the answer to the Avatar definition... makes sense - I guess?!   urlLink "Words and concepts"  An article concerning the entomology of Avatar and it's use in cyberspace.

        What is it indeed?   Here it is!  urlLink What Is An Avatar? : "'The Meaning of Avatar:"Whenever virtue subsides and wickedness prevails; whenever there is unrighteousness or Adharma and whenever there is catastrophe and unrest in the world; the Divine Mother manifests Herself. That is, Adhiparasakthi comes down to this earth, or physical plane, to establish virtue and Dharma and to destroy the evil and save the good. When She comes down to the physical plane She takes human form and is called an Avatar or Incarnation. For those of you who use an Avatar anywhere in cyberspace - how did we get from the description above to a little graphic that is used to identify yourself on the web? The relationship between these two things seems to be tenuous at best.  Is it that our graphic is the closest thing we have to a physical manifestation out here in cyber space?

      Remember how my older step-brother  spent a couple days in England with my Mum? Well, he hadn't really told me HOW it went, other than to say that everything was fine (which could mean anything, right?). So, I get my Mum's version of it... he arrived, she picked him up from the bus stop, took him back to our cottage and then they went down to the sea. This is my brother's first time traveling inter-continentally. FIRST TIME.  They spot some garbage sitting on the beach, at the sea. Mum picks it up. She sees more. She picks that up too.   The end result is that my brother spent the majority of his first day in England picking garbage at the seaside with my Mum. She tells me, "He filled a whole bag of his own!"  And I moan in despair. "Mum!!!"  She says, "Well, dahling, you know how eccentric I am!" and giggles.

      Email from my ex-step brother (read:brother) in England. He stayed with my Mum for the first couple days. Funny to hear how about the New Forest from someone who's never been there before. I'm accustomed to the wandering livestock now... although it's still somewhat frightening to suddenly come across eight very large highland cattle in the middle of a forest trail.  (1) England  I spent my first three days in england with my ex step sister's real mom, which makes her my... well, um...god only knows.  At least it's good to know that the simon family circus stretches across continents.  She lives in the south of england in a region known as the New Forest, which since it's nearly 1100 years old, might be a bit misleading.  But, having just arrived, I thought it best to keep that to myself.  The gig here is that it's William the Conquerer's old personal hunting ground.  As a result, the ponies, donkeys and cattle (people hunt these things?) run free and have developed a keen sense of how to stand squarely in front of cars.  Darwinism at work I guess.  (2)  Stansted Airport  Off to sweden.  Stansted airport is situated somewhere and hour or so north east of London... I say somewhere because it's literally in the middle of nowhere.  No hotels, restaurants or bars.  Nada.  Fortunately, they have developed this extensive bus and train system there.  It works something like this: first flights of the morning leave at 6.10, next wave of flights leave at 6.30 (like mine).  The first buses of the morning arrive about 6.50.  Excellent.  The result?  Spending a night at Stansted airport!  So I arrived around 11pm thinking I'd be one of a couple of travellers in such a predicament, only to discover that about 300 travellers had the same plan.  Devastating.  And so I became friends with perhaps the most uncomfortable airport chair ever developed.  The key, I was told, was to adopt a zen-like attitude to the nearly 8 hours of good times ahead... there is no past. no future. only the now.  Live in the now.  Yeah, as you might guess, that crap wears off after about 6 minutes.  He's still got about two more weeks of travelling, I can't wait to hear what he thinks about Berlin... It was my favorite city in all of Europe.

       Jobs that don't make you work  So, what's the verdict on jobs where you sit and try to look busy for the majority of the day? Is it :  a) good - the less I have to do, the more time for internet browsing b)not good - I get bored and I can't really do what I want, which is lie down and have a nap c) sort of okay - I don't like being stressed but I feel useless when I pack up my things and realize that I haven't accomplished anything that day  Me, I'm sitting on the fence. I have a good job, it's not challenging but the money is great. I'm going a little crazy already and it's been three months. On the other hand, I used to have a job that gave me seriously bad nightmares about not being able to get everything done. I don't like either of these situations. Is there such a thing as a job that challenges, but doesn't stress? That grows as I do? That loves me back?  On the plus side of my boredom I do have SO MUCH more energy for weekends and weeknights... I could easily become the most overrated party-girl of Toronto. I just need to tear myself away from PlayStation long enough.

       urlLink  9/11'S LEGACY: UNCERTAINTY   "Then I spotted the photo in the middle of the display, which showed one of those heartbreaking sidewalk shrines that popped up all over Lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center fell. A tattered poster of a missing woman, flowers and candles. And I remembered what actually happened that day: 19 angry young men, most of them Saudis, carried out a foul plan they had hatched three years earlier in Hamburg, and murdered as many thousands of Americans as they possibly could. Children and parents were incinerated in a hellfire of jet fuel. Dozens jumped from the towers rather than wait for the flames to burn or the smoke to poison them. Twenty-four Canadians died too. As other murderers would demonstrate later in Bali and at the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, some people aren't picky about whom they slaughter.  Every once in a while, you realize you've edited your memories, put them in little boxes, so you can get on with your life. Most people have built a little wall in their minds between their knowledge of Sept. 11 and their memory of it. You can debate defence spending or moan about airport security without really thinking. The searing memory stays in its place, off to the side. Mostly. Not always." This article from McLeans's Magazine made me think back, and remember exactly how it felt to be driving home on Sept. 11/2001, glued to the radio, wondering, "Why?"   On a more frivolous topic - What kind of guy is it that calls and pleads to take you out on a date, but is too busy to actually go and ends up saying, "Let's just play it by ear" after three weeks of waiting? I'll tell you what kind of guy - an IDIOT. For God's sake, make up your mind! As for me, my mind is made up.   again . It's been about three months of this nonesense and I'm ready to head for greener pastures. I've been riding the emotional rollercoaster and it's time to get off, throw up, and move onto the next amusement. I feel good because I lasted until the end of the ride. I know that there are no more twists and turns that I might miss out on. We've definitely come to that rubber bumper/stopper part of the ride, the gates have opened and I can safely exit the "Upside-down twirler of death" that I have been on for this long long time. Adios amigo, and keep your hands to yerself.

Well so so. i was working all summer in a smelly call centre for the local electric network - scottish gas. man what a horror..still it definately put any thoughts of call centre work being my vocation in life to rest. my bosses(yes plural) were mildly to insanely anal ..i think it was a characteristic they developed and polished with age. if you were even a minute late you got 20 minutes off your pay so needless to say muggins here didnt fare the best out of that one! ah well i gave it my best shot.so i quit there on friday in fine form..stinking of beer,fags,a greasy chicken kebab with a whiskey flavoured "McCondom" sticking proudly out of my rear pocket..i have no idea how that got there..honest i didnt touch it! that would be extremely wrong. so now i find myself up to no good wondering around the windy streets of the scottish capital sneezing and weezing for all im worth trying to infect the whole city with this horrible cold i have.

Who knew that you needed a permit to build a tree house in your own yard? The whole neighbourhood even signed a petition that the council ignored, asking to let her keep the playhouse in place. Although, we only hear one side of the story in this article. What if the treehouse wasn't built to standard. I mean, what if it was rickety and unsafe? What if the plumbing wasn't to regulation? And the lighting was under the standard 80 lumens required for all enclosed urban living space? And perhaps the ladder had not been certfied for 8 children or 500 lbs., whichever comes first.  Puh-lease. What a hassel. Lady, just go and buy them some cheap ass tent. Better yet - give the kiddies a big cardboard box, a whole bunch of markers and an afternoon to themselves. You'll see that they don't need boards and hammers and nails. All they need is imagination. Besides, kids do fall out of tree houses, don't they?

       Let's get our terms straight  Before we go throwing around words that have become popular, but who's meanings have been obscured... urlLink Homophobia  Why don't people just call each other "poo-poo head" instead of dragging out a mouthful like "homophobic"? It's really on the same level. The "phobic" part of "homophobic" means "frightened of" or "scared by." It implies an irrational, exaggerated fear of something. Note that it does not imply all forms of fear. If I were to the top of the office tower they're building down the street, walk to the edge of the new floor they just poured and look down, my stomach would probably go all swimmy, I would clutch at something, and I would probably be terrified. This is not a phobia. This is my body saying, "What in God's name are you doing so far off the ground, you moron?!?" It's perfectly natural. Mrs. Buster has a fear of heights. She can't climb stairs in a movie theatre if they're the steps-only, open-backed kind. Seeing down just one story makes her freeze up. That's a phobia. So, I am not homophobic, I just don't really understand same sex non-platonic love. I'm certainly not irrationally scared of it.

       A quote for today   You can't love someone from the start.  It is something you realize has happened, like a payment made into a bank account while you weren't looking.  Until that time, lovers act out the emotion and make shapes which love, later on, will inhabit. The French call it, " Jouer la comedie de l'amour".

       Happy Birthday to me  A new graphic for the heading. How do we feel about Gucci stilettos? WE LOVE THEM! Style before substance. Always. Still busy at work - not enough time to tool around the internet and read everyone's posts.  Have been participating in something known as "flashblogging" - same idea as "flashmobbing" but you leave comments on some poor unsuspecting slob's post. The victim must wonder what the frick is up with the 80 "pro's and con's of being bald" comments. Considering it doesn't matter what their post is about.  At least it gets people to visit blogs outside of their daily reading circle. Maybe I should organize a flashblog on the guy who usually organizes them. A victim of their own idea. That would be great.   The engineers are quiet recently. There has been some arguing about pumps, and the flow capacity of piping. I like it better when the broken english is deafening and the cursing is directed at contractors, not each other.   One new pickup line from last weekend, and one guy who makes it onto my, "Dude, you just bought yourself a night of self-loving" list. They guy who screwed up was talking to my best friend. She had been staring at him all night. She was already 3/4 in love with him. Then they started to dance. Then he tried to stick his hands down the back of her pants. Then she left. I don't know if he thought that she would actually like to have his hands there after their extremely short acquaintance... or if he was just  hoping  that she would like it, but in the end, he got the brush off. If he had played nicely he could possibly have gotten piece - but no - he had to be a big molester jackass. T'ant pis.   Sunday I went to the horse races. I never knew how exciting it is to bet on horses... Oh, and I got to eat for 3 hours straight. I think that this will be my new ideal day. Except for the hangover. Although, a hangover indicates a great night preceding. Bah! I'm too tired to be writing this. There is no way that I am conveying my true excitement at watching the horseys run like crazy. I'm not conveying anything. Not even coherent thought. Can I go  urlLink home  now?    Note: I just spell checked this post and blogger asked me if I would like to replace "blogs" with "bogs". Hello?

       Thoughts on turning a quarter century...  I saw the Disney Peter Pan movie when I was four. I went home and cried, and cried, and cried. I knew, like Peter, that I never wanted to grow up. I mean, highschool students had homework to do (gasp!), University Students had the life sucked out of them, and adults, well - you didn't see any of them enjoying the jungle gym at the park.  Nope, definitely had my heart set on staying four, forever. I used to believe that if I jumped high enough off the steps of my back porch I would just continue on up into the sky. If I jumped really really really hard, I would escape the bounds of gravity and I would FLY. That's what I used to wish for before I became aware of money.   Now my happiest dreams are the ones where I'm performing Swan Lake, and I hit those 32 fouettes without a stumble. In fact, after the 32 turns, I keep going - my balance is perfect, I can spin forever. I have these dreams a lot.  If I found a magical lamp with a genie in it, I would still wish for a lot of money, but I would also wish to be four again. This time, I would jump high enough and I really would fly. And every night I would have my spining dream and grow up, just like that.

       urlLink Meet a Tosser  Amateur Evolutionary Psychology Hope. Mentioned in the previous post about how people always seem to harbour irrational hopes, that they will win the lottery tomorrow due to some "omen" or other, or that their relationship will somehow be the dream one despite seeing the failure and idiocy of many others'. But I quickly realised that hope is an evolutionarily advantageous emotion (if I may call it that). Obviously having the hope to continue buying lottery tickets is not evolutionarily advantageous, but having the hope that perhaps this time your hunting expedition will be successful and it may be better than just starving in your den instead, or that this time that female will actually consent to let you mount her, is obviously a great help to the propagation of your genes. That is, not trying will mean certain loss, so in such situations it will be evolutionarily advantageous to have hope, even if there is little chance of success.  Hmmm, thought provoking blog. There seems to be a lot of bitterness in the blog annals recently. Angsty. Pissed off. Murderous. Usually has to do with the opposite sex. Where is everyone's HOPE? Good will? "You've got to stand up/shake it off/look 'em in the eye." - Jarvis Church.  Yes, some people are absolute shits. Get over it.  No, not everyone in the world is out to fuck you over. But you can't expect them to care about you as much as You care about You. If you find someone like that - marry them.   I'm tired of men griping about women and I'm very tired about women bitching about men. For God's sake, each person is an individual - if some treats you like shit, cut them out of your life and move on. They're not doing it becuase they're a woman, or a man. They're just dumb fucks who don't know any better. So screw them.

       urlLink Marcellus Wallace's Bloody Gitch   "Patriarchy put women on a pedestal, feminism put men in the gutter"  Fallacious arguments abound, but is there a nugget of truth here? Yes, yes there is. That's why it's dangerous. Patriarchy put women on a pedastal - under the power of men. Ever heard the term "rule of thumb"? Yeah, it came about because then had to pass a law about the SIZE OF THE STICK husbands were allowed to BEAT THEIR WIVES with. What pedastal??!?  This article manages to sound very much like common sense, while using half-truths and false dichotomies to appeal to the threatened man.   Having created, through law suits and legislation, work places hostile to manliness, feminists now act as though this is the norm and preen over how perfectly suited to the workplace women are, and how defective men are.  The work place is not either "man friendly" or "man hostile" as the author seems to think. The workplace is sometimes both of these things, and everything in between. Yes, legislation has made it more comfortable for women, but isn't more comfortable for EVERYONE? Not just women?? What about gays, minorities, and any other stereotyped factions?  And, what exactly is his definition of "manly"? If it's the "pull-my-finger" kind of manly, then yes, the workplace is somewhat hostile. If it's the "I am male, and don't feel the need to pinch my female co-worker's asses," kind, then everything should be alright. I mean, what kind of troglodytic existence do you lead? What has been legislated against,  that you want to do so badly? You got some good racial slurs you're aching to try out? Some hot new pick up lines? A great beer drinking story? "Pull my finger!" Yeah, that one never gets old.   Behave like a decent, ethical, kind human being, and shut up already!

       urlLink The Kabbalah Centre - Sex  The underlying problem behind a lousy sex life and dysfunctional relationships, according to Kabbalah, is that we do not know:  Who we really are  Where we came from  Why a man and woman exist  The structure of the Cosmos  The meaning and purpose of our lives  The role of sex in the physical and metaphysical scheme of things  The tools necessary to arouse sexual energy in our lives.   In Kabbalah, spiritual awareness and sex, Heaven, and Earth are in an ongoing interaction with one another. The Upper and Lower worlds are intimately connected just as two lovers locked in embrace.   All this, just to have satisfying sex?! Sure, I don't believe in "casual" sex. Every time I've experienced it, it's left me feeling a little hollow - certainly not fulfilled. But I think that having to keep the "Structure of the cosmos" in mind is a bit much. What about plain, old, abused, love?

      Funny, I have been busy at work. Nothing interesting mind you, just busy. It's strange. It means I've been neglecting little "woo woo" here. Poor darling. With each character I type, I can feel her getting better. MMMM, lovely little post-y presents for the blog.  It's fall in Toronto, all the leaves are on fire. Sweaters are aired out, the thanksgiving holiday releases thousands of freshly heartbroken men and women into the nightclubs. It's my birthday soon.  I spent a night in the hospital last week. It took them 7 hours just to admit me. I was strange. Because nothing is wrong with me. I don't know what happened, but there I was. I am fine. I always was. I just didn't FEEL fine.  I'm going shopping downtown today. The big mall, with the white glass ceiling and the hanging Canada Geese. And lots of other credit card addicts.  I love the subway. Clean, safe, fast. Lots of interesting humans to look at. Stare down. Avoid. No graffiti. European subways are all covered with graffiti. Esspecially Italian ones. The London tube is small and round and scarey.  I will eat McDonald's. A weekly treat. Freshcrispyhotgreasy fries and a large sugar syrup with ice cubes to go. I hate what McDonalds is doing to the environment. I love the taste of the food. Maybe I can get fat and sue them for millions. Too bad the earth can't launch her own law suits. Sue aerosol can companies for wrecking her ozone layer. Sue oil tankers. Sue whale fisherman. Sue elephant poachers. Sue me for liking shoes too much.  That's it for now.

Leading a double life, trying to be different things to different people, will only mess you up. Focus on your genuine talents and the attributes that are closest to your natural self. You'll sleep better, and indeed feel better much of the time being at peace with yourself rather than torn over who to be today… It's the feeling that life is often not interesting enough that led you into this dilemma. Following your true interests may just make it interesting enough to get you out.   Well, that's easy enough to follow. As one of my friends would say, "Keep it real." Duh.

"On the way to work this morning,  urlLink I  was thinking about this theory I heard once about how in every relationship there is a Kite and a String. The theory, which I will now attempt to bastardize in my flaky retelling, is that there is always one person who is the wilder, looser, more adventurous part of the two, The Kite. Then there is The String, who invariably is the one who keeps the Kite anchored, who saves the Kite from getting caught up in high winds and flying away. Of course, without the Kite to pull the String forward and stretch it, it simply lies in a pile, a rather uncompelling exsistience. The Kite gives the String purpose and shows it what it's like up there in the wind. The String helps the Kite out when things get too dicey up there.  and you?

       urlLink Wap Wap  And to you, strange blogger, I must ask, What The Fuck?! Hand holding? Sweetie, look outside your little Christian world and wake up! One thing I've been noticing , maybe cause for concern, when we are alone and sitting on the couch whether at my place or her place, its been easy for us both to hold each other's hands. Sometimes, I stretch out my hands and she places hers on top. Or she reaches for my hand. It's a great feeling to hold her hands! On the otherhand, I hope that I'm not misinterpreting her feelings. To me , holding hands is a sign that there is intimacy.. even if only at the friendship level. I believe that is the case. We've developed an intimate friendship relationship. I'm hoping this sign of an intimate relationship can lead to a commited courtship relationship someday! To her, it might just be pure friendship. There is no way to know whether she holds other people's hands on occasion or not. I'm tempted to ask her if she holds other guys' hands. And from this confusion, maybe I should ask her to not hold my hand if it doesnt mean intimate friendship.... But like I wrote earlier: It's a great feeling to hold her hands!  I'm ubermean today.

Everyone is welcome, be it in States or any other place worldwide.  http://cvv.ru/  ATTENTION. Clearance offer. Buy 30 grams of heroin, get 5 free. Prepay your batch of rockets (air-to-air) and recieve a portable rocket-lacuncher for free.  This offer won't last! Only until 20th of October all our clients will also recieve a pack of 2 CDs, with best selection of child pornography. Trust Russia. This is a joke, right?

       Was visiting my best friend.  Hit the bars. Meet creeepy 49 yr. old hand molesting weirdo. Caught some guys behind us looking real hard and then they said, "there's definitely some movement in here tonite." What the hell does that mean?  Overdid it at the gym. Every set of stairs I have to climb, "Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck"  every set of stairs I have to decend, "Aichi Mama!"  Shake it like a polaroid picture, kids.

       "Mo" of last weekend  fame has called me 6 times in the past 48 hours.   FUCK.  Oh yeah, and he has clarified his family situation for me: he has 10 BROTHERS, 9 sisters.  Apparently they, the whole village of them, can't wait to meet me.   Sorry to disapoint....

       I'm going to be house and cat-sitting.  Friends of my Dad are off to Thailand for two months. I will have an entire semi-detached house to MYSELF. There's even a gas fireplace. The cats are all a little strange. Harley is about the right proportion for a hog ridin', leather wearing tough guy. Tina is tiny and all black. Doodle hates everyone.   I went to the house last night for dinner, get to know the humans and the quadrupeds a little better before I take over their domain. Two bottles of wine and a litre of lager later, I'm in the back of a taxi quizzing the cabby about his life, his philosophy and forgetting how to do up seat belts. I get home and say, "Hey Poosh!" Which, I think, was supposed to mean, "Hi, Dad."   Before I know it, I'm crouched at the sink in the bathroom guzzling water directly out of the tap. It's 4 a.m. and I'm parched. I keep hitting my forehead on the sink spout because the bathroom floor won't stay still.   I try to walk back down the hall to my room quietly, because we have guests staying with us. Instead, my cat jumps out of nowhere and gets a resounding, "Fug oo! 'ittle .... bollocks."   I finally remove my very uncomfortable for sleeping in, jeans and remove the phone from under my pillow.   Sleep.  And then I almost threw up on the bus this morning.  I swear, no more drinking on weeknights, ever.  I don't want to see alcohol until at least tomorrow.

You wake up, stretch, yawn . . .just another day . . . except, wait . . . isn't today the day? Didn't you make a little pact with yourself? To go on a consumer fast — to buy absolutely nothing for 24 hours?  This is what 95 percent of the millions of participants around the world do on Buy Nothing Day: they have a battle of wits with themselves. They go cold turkey on consumption for a day and see how it feels.   Buy nothing day is November 28th. Do you think you can go a whole day without using money?

        Mo is short for something   "Mo" is short for Mohammed. As in Follower of the Prophet Mohammed. As in, ciao.  I lie. We talked on the phone for over an hour. Despite the fact that he's Muslim and I have huge issues with organized religion, he's a intriguing guy. He's lived an interesting life. Came from West Africa, to Nigeria, to USA to Canada. Speaks four languages (one of them French, YAY!). Is scared of cold weather (is he ever in the wrongest place on earth). Has 10 brothers and sisters.   I'm out of my depth with Mo. I cannot relate to huge chunks of his life. I cannot imagine emigrating from Africa to somewhere like Toronto. And I cannot relate to his faith. I respect faith, but I don't understand how people believe so strongly in a thing that is based on one guy's rantings (be it Jesus, Mohammed, or  urlLink Bahá'u'lláh ). Anyway, we will continue to chat and end up friends. There will be no dating here.

        An unsettling day  I was reviewing my referrals at SiteMeter and noticed that someone had found me by looking for my cousin's name and her photography. This person is in Hawaii. This person is my cousin. She's googling herself.   Her Mum lives two houses away from my Mum. I cannot trust that she won't blast off a quick email to the fam, "Look what I found!" We don't have a close relationship. I'm screwed. But wait! I follow her google search and find that it locked on one of my entries that has NOTHING to do with her. Site meter tells me that she looked at the site for 0 seconds. Thank-you internet gods. I do not have to erase all entries about sex, drugs and classical music.

       Ah the weekend...   I visited my friend K. in  urlLink Oshawa.  We started our Saturday night at the Oshawa Santa Claus parade. Now, Oshawa is a city of say, 150,000 people. Half of these people are employed by GM. The other half are not employed at all. This is a blue collar town. Diversity regarding ethnicity doesn't really exist. There where maybe six people of non-WASP origin in the parade. For a small, rather unemployed city, there were an awful lot of marching cadets. At least 6 differnt divisions. If there was ever a draft in Canada (sweet God no), Oshawa and surrounding area would be stripped of it's youth.   Of course the piece de resistance, the ultimate expression of Christmas, was the Star Trek fan club float. Their fearsome looking ply-wood Klingon weapons, home-knitted costumes and blue eyeshadow brought a twinkle to every little child's face. You could feel the festive spirit in the air. Maybe that was just the collective vacuum left by the spaces between their ears.   After the parade we returned to K's house to get ready to hit the town. The best known bar is called "The Corral". There were at least 15 people in line wearing cowboy hats.  The line was also two hours long. I prevailed on K to head to " urlLink Le Scratch ", rumoured to be run by organized motocycle gangs. This immense bar/billiards/club was filled with all sorts. People had actually come FROM Toronto to this dinky little bar. Combine half a bottle of champagne, 3 rye and ginger's and this is what you get: hung over.  That's right. For the  urlLink second time  in my life I gave out my phone number at the bar.   Fuck.

        Scientist, control thyself     urlLink Crytogon .   But you've said aspects of the war on terrorism infringe on civil liberties. Aren't you calling for something similar with respect to technology?  I'm not saying the government should do it. Centralized strategies - things like Admiral Poindexter's Total Information Awareness program - don't work. What I'm saying is "physician, heal thyself." People in the various scientific communities have to police themselves.  >>> Like the Russell-Einstein Manifesto from 1955 - where we get the phrase "weapons of mass destruction."   I certainly think a Hippocratic Oath for scientists would be useful. And I think an essential part of getting control of technology will be for international organizations to take a lead in promoting ethical scientific behavior. The Pugwash organization's work on sensible nuclear policy is a strong example.  >>> But what will get the scientific community to accept being told what to do?  Catastrophe. We have scientists saying they want to publish pathogen gene sequences on the Net. One consequential accident and we'll want to throw those researchers in jail.   >>> So much for progress.  What are we in such a hurry for?   >>> Easy for you to say. You live in Aspen.  We don't need a lot of economic growth to address the problem of the world's poor. We put subsistence farmers out of business because that's our choice. Clean water would do more to alleviate disease than high tech medicine.  >>> Downsizing expectations? That's pretty pessimistic.  I'm not a pessimist. Democracy is about individuals giving up the ability to do whatever they want so that everybody can have some rights. We may have to give up some of the power of high technology if we want to keep our civil liberties. And that is a choice, whether we realize it or not.  I wonder wether scientists would ever agree to a Hippocratic oath?

        My body   I've read a lot of posts about bodies. Body parts, functions, shapes, textures, colours, movement, abuse of, worship of... Most women consider themselves to have a relationship with their bodies. Love, Hate, or a combination of the two. Men seem to pay little attention to their bodies, unitl something marvelous (or horrendous) happens.   I'm one of the women that has a relationship with her body. Parts of me are misbehaving, other parts are getting "A" grades. On the whole, I LOVE MY BODY.   Please don't take that to mean that I think it's perfect. Sweet jesus, it's not. But I love it. It keeps me up out of the gutter, it takes me places and lets me do funny things to it without complaint. It knows what a beat is and looks good when moving to music. It's still young and springy. It's aesthetically pleasing.  If I stand naked in front of my mirror (everyone does it, so don't get all excited), I can look at my stomach, the smooth skin, that spot under my ribs where all the muscles meet. All those miniscule atoms aligned and attached. All those atoms put together to make a drop of blood or a hair. Quite frankly, I think it's a miracle. My little brain sends a little electric signal and my little finger hits the "a" key. It takes much longer to type that out than it does to actually do it. All these processes associated with typing, taking place at electric speed.  How can women hate their bodies? Yes, they're messy and inconvenient sometimes. Yes, they allow a great deal of pain before they crap out. Yes, we don't look like supermodels. Yes, we have celulite. Yes yes yes.   There is still something magical about it.

        It don't get no better than this   urlLink  True Porn Clerk Stories   "I hate it when people argue, but I understand why they do. I don't think there should be any shame in masturbating, but I do think there should be shame in expecting someone with whom you are not very, very close to deal with a wad of your spooge. I think they get all defensive because in that moment, they realize it too, but I think there's more to it than that.   One of my favorite concepts in anthropology is that of the polite fiction. It's something nobody believes, but we all pretend to because it makes life so much easier. My favorite example was of a Pygmy couple. Pygmy divorce involves quite literally breaking up the home: the couple tears apart their house (it's easy - the houses are made of leaves) and once it's down, the union is dissolved. One anthropologist was watching a long-married couple have a fight. It escalated until the wife threatened to leave, and the husband yelled something along the lines of 'Fine!' and there was nothing the wife could do but start tearing down the house. She began tearing the roof off, clearly miserable. The husband looked wretched too, but at this point neither could back down without losing face and by now the whole village was watching. "  Now I don't have to ever work as a video store clerk. All the ewy stuff is here for my reading delectation.

(a) 2 (b) 4 (c) 6      2. (a) 6 (b) 4 (c) 7 (d) 2 (e) 1      3. (a) 4 (b) 2 (c) 5 (d) 7 (e) 6      4. (a) 4 (b) 6 (c) 2 (d) 1      5. (a) 6 (b) 4 (c) 3 (d) 5 (e) 2      6. (a) 6 (b) 4 (c) 2      7.

(a) 4 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 5 (e) 6 (f) 1       Now add up the total number of points.         OVER 60 POINTS: Others see you as someone they should "handle with care". You're seen as vain, self-centred, and who is extremely dominant. Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.       51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.       41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the centre of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.       31 TO 40 POINTS: Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest.    Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.       21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.       UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything.  They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.  Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.  I scored 50.

       I’m going back to the start. "No one said it would be easy/ No one said it would be so hard."  - Coldplay  I've been pondering the pro's and con's of comments recently and although I value the insight and intelligence of the contributions, I've decided to disable the comments. I started this blog as a catharsis. I wanted to spew whatever was beautiful or horrendous in my head. Now I find I self edit. Now, I wonder what people will think. I wonder if so-and-so will applaud, I wonder if what's-their-name will vilify me. Most comments are supportive, intriguing - provoking. But I feel the need to be selfish.   I want to be fearless. I want to say whatever I think. I want to set down how I used to smoke pot. I want to set down how many mistakes I've made. I want to set down those dark corners of my mind that won't talk to anyone. I want to deface or exalt this page, according to my mood. I want to feel truly disconnected from where I am.   So, I bid you all adieu and thank you for enriching me. I've appreciated all of your ranting, your cosseting, your mild flirting, your contributions. I feel lucky to know that I did write posts that left people with something to say. But now, you will have to forgive me for making my page my own, again.    urlLink So long, and thanks for all the fish.

       I was just channel surfing  and came across an indie movie. Unusual, they come on later at night. Anyway, the first shot was of a guy and a girl, he, rolling a joint. They're sitting at opposite ends of his bed-on-the-ground. The second shot, they've sprawled out a little, they're smoking. The third shot they've lain down, side by side, hands crossed on their chests, giggling at the ceiling. I wonder how many other people can relate to this? For me, it's like a page out of my memory, shown on television, for anyone who might be curious. I used to have this same ritual with one of my exes. We'd lie there, burbling laughter, feeling warm colours explode in our veins. I gained about 10 pounds from eating too much munchie fast food. We'd either fall asleep together, curled up in a satisfied cocoon, or make slow, lazy love - not quite believing the intensity of the feeling, knowing that it will be impossible to recall in the morning.   The relationship ended badly but to this day, I will remember what it felt like to float above the bed and know that someone beside me was sharing the experience.  Of course, smoking pot twice a day isn't good for your brain, and I ended up on academic probation for my last year of University. I got tired of making myself stupid and sleepy. I got tired of eating wretched food at 4 a.m. I got tired of coughing, and smelling like sweet, burnt herbs. I got tired of him, and his insistence on using dope for release. I got out of it, and graduated with honours. I got A's for the first time in my University career.   But sometimes, it would be nice to be stupid again.

        The art of kissing   urlLink The Art of Kissing  This is part of the pre-amble that the man should initiate before attempting the kiss. "Then, take a deep sniff of the perfume in her hair and comment on it. Tell her that the odor is like 'heady wine.' Tell her that her hair smells like a garden of roses. Tell her anything, but be sure to tell her something complimentary. This done, it is only a natural thing for you to do to, desire to sink your nose deeper into her hair so that you can get the full benefit of its bouquet."  I swear to you, if some guy ever buried his head in my hair and told me it smelt like "heady wine" I'd give him a horse bite. That is disgusting.

       I went out for dinner  with a friend on Saturday night. At the table next to us were a couple. He was visiting from France. She sounded American. He was arrogant, wrapping his arm around her, placing his hand on her bottom. She sounded like a ditz and she practically had her tits out on the table for his dessert. They wanted to visit a friend's bar after dinner and didn't know whether it was close or not. He clears his throat, " Excuse me, are you from Tokyo?" I look at him. I'm about as white bread as you can get. I don't look like I'm from Japan. I say, "No." He says, "Oh! Sorry! I meant, are you from Toronto?" Me:"Yes" Him: "Where is Queen and Dufferin?" Me:"C'est tout proche d'ici. C'est un petit peu au Nord, pis a l'ouest." He thanks me. I respond "De rien." As my friend and I leave the restaurant he smoking is outside with a couple other French men. The woman/tart is nowhere to be seen. They're talking about her tits.

      Phew, weekend almost over.  Interesting things that happened:  Drunk girlfriend fell down the stairs at the bar.  Paid $160 for dinner for two. It was worth it.  Listened to Loon - "Down for me" until me CD player got fed up and packed it in.  Turned RE down for drinks after work on Friday. Good me. Pats on head.  Vacuumed. Wait, that doesn't count as interesting. Aw, f**k it, I'll rant later.

       He doesn't get women   urlLink I shall never understand women pt.2   I dont know anymore, i am not a new man, i am just a caring guy..as my nature and upbringing has done.. i open doors for women, i open doors for men, i do everything to try to make things better, yet i keep getting it in the neck, bum and other body parts. women seem to only want one kind of man.. the nasty drop down man who will use them and abuse them. now i am not nasty to women.. like all these books and tv shows say women want nice men.. but girls/women a lot of you dont.. u want the thrill of the bad boy image, leaving those men who really do care and love you in the background and who has to go and pick up the peices afterwards these good men.. so good that you dont deserve them.. but if everyone doesnt deserve them then we good men are a dying race.. no wonder this world is going to hell when good caring men start saying its not worth it and then they become life long bachelors.. its your fault women with you double standards..   Now now. There is a difference between NICE men, and doormats. Are you nice, or are you a spineless wretch? I do enjoy a good, kind, man. But if you are looking at me with those puppy dog eyes and I know that I could play with you, and you would be grateful, then you are in trouble. How can a woman respect a man will say, "Yes dear" to everything?   It's not that we want BAD men. We just want men who aren't going to bow to our every whim. Let's face it, I'm not Cinderella. I can't be trusted a lot of the time. I want a man who will love me with all my faults, in fact, I want him to respectfully, and gently, tell me when I am wrong. Just as I would tell him. I feel uncomfortable on pedestals. They're high and narrow. There's not enough space to dance. So, don't look at me and tell me I'm an angel. That's too much to live up to.   Just tell me you love me, the way I am.  Perhaps you are too good for the girl anyway. Maybe she knows that she isn't as virtuous as you are, and therefore you are better off without her. She would only hurt you. Are you being blind to her faults? Or are you like one of those women you complain about - hoping to tame a "bad" girl? Often if you ask a girl to be truly honest with you, and she is, you will begin to understand our motivations. Men whine that they don't understand women, but they don't really want to hear what our feelings are anyway. Neither do they enjoy the value most women place on their intution. "Gut feelings" aren't a good enough reason for a lot of you guys. You seem to be scared of illogical thinking.   What does it matter if a woman is being illogical? She's just doing what she feels is right for her. You may not be able to follow her reasoning, but intuition is something that should not be belittled. The little voice in the back of my head is right more often than wrong. I have learned to trust it. Don't you have one of those?

        My Big Brother  is still in  Europe.  Berlin   My favourite place so far... good times and piles of history.  Something to keep in mind: Despite Rich B___'s suggestions, asking a german guard 'where are YOUR papers' isn't even funny the first time. Really, you're just looking at a one way ticket out of the motherland.  Reading, England  So, it turns out that Reading seems to be not exactly the best neighbourhood to live in. It was the three guys shot by a shotgun on the day that I arrived that tiped me off.  Appartenly, I'm going to school in england's scarborough.  The good news is that there's only two more deaths in the week since then.  Fabulous.  Just stay away from the bad parts I've been warned (if anyone has the good parts/bad parts map of Reading, I'd be interested in borrowing it for a month or two).  I can't tell you how much I look forward to his emails.

       Say hello  to my cousin   urlLink C. . Currently ranked 6th in the world, ladies windsurfing. The first week she ever spent windsurfing was at a camp in the UK, off the coast of the Isle of Wight. We were at camp together, and I LOATHED windsurfing. By friday she was at level 3, and I had figured out how to tie my board up and work on my tan, oh yeah, I'd also snogged one of the instructors. Little did we know that it would turn into her passion. I 've been windsurfing once since then, in the Dominican Republic, and I split my lip open.  She's finally picking up sponsors. There are also articles about her in various wave magazines, and her photography is getting published too. ROCK ON 'MILLA!

        It's time.  I've been single (and dating) for two years now. I have had sex about... very little, during this dry spell. I am about to unleash my full sensuality on the next poor man who meets or exceeds the decency mark.  The problem is that I'm having trouble finding men I'm interested in. I meet lots of men, fairly regularly. It's easy in a big city. A smile is often all you need. It's the intelligence that is hard to come by. I really, really, really need a man who is as smart, or smarter than I am. Otherwise I tend to run circles around them.  Either that, or I need to stop reading  urlLink his  blog. He gets enough sex for the both of us.  I hope that none of my  urlLink family members ever find  this site.

       urlLink The Luke Pettigrew Blog    "I have trouble explaining the difference between guilt and shame to non-binge drinkers but it is significant."  Luke reminds me soooo much of most of my guy friends from highschool and University. They too would have had trouble explaining the difference between guilt and shame, but they certainly would have had a smorgasboard of illustrative-real-life stories with which to make the attempt. Guilt: I talked shit to this fugly girl all last night, got her home with me, screwed her within an inch of her life and fell asleep. Shame: We woke up in the morning. She wanted a ride home. I gave her a subway token and the shreds of her bar top to cover up with. Also suggested a quick dip in the toilet to get the jizz out of her ears.

         urlLink Philosoraptor  He has an answer to the  urlLink Du Toit "Wimpification" Essay   I’m torn about Kim du Toit’s essay about, as I’ll put it, avoiding his gratuitous crudity, the wimpification of the Western male. I’m inclined to ignore it, since it’s unlikely that anyone who found the essay insightful will listen to anything I have to say about it; but du Toit is full of shit, and that, combined with the apparent popularity of the essay on the right wing of the web makes it hard to ignore. I’m torn about it also because there is, in fact, an important and true point in the essay. I’d put the point this way: we’re in danger of undervaluing virtues like courage and self-reliance that are traditionally thought of as masculine. Now, I’d add—though du Toit might not--that for almost all of human history we’ve done just the reverse, undervaluing virtues like kindness and cooperation that are traditionally thought of as feminine. So I see the problem of wimpification as a relatively minor, relatively recent and eminently correctable phenomenon, a predictable case of the pendulum swinging a bit too far in the other direction as we try to correct a bigger and more long-term problem. But I do agree with du Toit to some extent, and I do think that the threat of wimpification is worth discussing. That’s why it’s too bad that du Toit’s essay is such a piece of crap--the wimpification point gets lost in a torrent of bigotry, falsehoods, and right-wing fantasies. Intelligent, carefully thought out, and sound in reasoning. Two thumbs way up. Not that I'm any authority.

       urlLink Galvin's Japan Journal   "The fourth and final giant metal bowl of alarmingly meticulously prepared fake poop disgusted and confounded even a moderate master of intestinal distress such as myself. Whereas the previous three bowls had been molded out of some kind of clay, this last bowl looked to be, at least to my best guess, made out of a couple of egg yolks and some partially-stirred pancake mix. I mean, I'm not even sure what that was supposed to BE, other than DISGUSTING, and all I know is that if you start leaving shit in the toilet that that looks like THAT you can probably expect your entire intestinal tract to soon follow. The only way it could have possibly been more disgusting is if she would have then jammed a giant hidden spoonful of corn into her mouth and then spit the half-chewed kernels into the bowl saying, 'Okay, now who's had shit like THAT?'"  I don't know what Galvin is doing in Japan, but by golly, it sure sounds like fun.

       urlLink Kim du Toit - Daily Rant   "But in the twentieth century, women became more and more involved in the body politic, and in industry, and in the media -- and mostly, this has not been a good thing. When women got the vote, it was inevitable that government was going to become more powerful, more intrusive, and more 'protective' (ie. more coddling), because women are hard-wired to treasure security more than uncertainty and danger. It was therefore inevitable that their feminine influence on politics was going to emphasize (lowercase 's') social security.  I am aware of the fury that this statement is going to arouse, and I don't care a fig.  What I care about is the fact that since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a concerted campaign to denigrate men, to reduce them to figures of fun, and to render them impotent, figuratively speaking."  I don't know what to say to this. I'm floored. Although, typically when you call someone a TWAT (pronounced the same as Toit), then you are calling them a PUSSY. Ironic that this man's last name.... I don't need to point it out to you.  Actually: "du Toit" means "from the roof" or "of the roof." Seems like that's where he likes to be, looking down on all the rest of us.

        I live in Toronto - I never heard about this   urlLink The Spectator.co.uk  The threats against El Al came via phone calls from the Toronto area from terrorists claiming to have heat-seeking missiles. Police subsequently found a cache of weapons including a German-made shoulder rocket launcher that was smuggled into Canada through the ingenious method of dropping it in the mail and letting the Post Office deliver it. So there are two approaches to this problem: you can crack down on Toronto-based terrorist cells and try to get government agencies not to deliver their rocket launchers; or you can ban El Al. Mr Collenette inclines to the latter. This is a man, by the way, who marked the first anniversary of 11 September by publicly regretting the fall of the Soviet Union because now there is nobody to check America’s ‘bullying’.   Have I had my head in the sand, or did this just not get any coverage?

Ridiculous.  Oh, the adrenalin! The frustration! The leap of joy when something miraculous happens and you get that deadline by the skin of your teeth. Procrastinators unite! Maybe tomorrow? Or next week? How does next year sound to you?? It's just that I've still got to write my thank-you cards from Christmas last year, and if I don't start now, they'll never get done. It'll take me at least another two weeks to go and buy the stamps. So, procrastinators of the world - Put off the uniting, it can wait.

       urlLink This is my new favorite sentence   Having rejected the idea of an objective morality since I was ten, my actions are dictated by self-interest.

Besides those visionaries known as "saints" I think most of humanity fits this description. Maybe the saints were just moral so that they could get into heaven.

      On a personal note: New Years Resolutions: Not to make any stupid resolutions that I'll just end up breaking anyway.  If I had to make resolutions they would be: 1. Get back in shape. 2. No more crushes. 3. Persuant to #2 - stay away from all of brothers' friends. 4. Find a new place to live that cannot be called a "troll hole" 5. Become a real lady, not just sometimes. 6. Do something kind for someone else at least once a day. 7. Do my ironing left over from the summer. 8. Keep in better touch with Mum. 9. Get rid of at least 10 pairs of shoes. 10. Buy one new pair of shoes. 11. Eat healthier. 12. I've run out.  I'm sure that there are thousands of things that I need to work on, but really, I'm just muddling my way through life and I quite like it like that.  I'm spending three days in my hometown with my best friend and I can prophesize that this New years will be particularly messy, emotionally and drunkenly. She and I will probably end up kissing each other at midnight - which might be hot, but not as hot as having some one I love to bring it in with. The miniscule black dress that I'm wearing is uber-schlampe, as are the shoes, so will the makeup be. So much for becoming a lady. Maybe if I get pictures I'll post them. Nah, there are enough uber-whores on the internet. No need for one more.   To all eight million of you who read my blog: Happy Freakin' New Year. I'll be thinking of you. Meh.

       urlLink Macleans  tells us this:  The past year, in many ways, looks like the year Canada stood still. With the political agenda placed on hold as we awaited the leadership change in Ottawa, we have seen only minute shifts in public opinion over the last year. The one glaring exception to this wait-and-see posture relates to our view of and relations with the world. It now appears that 9/11 not only shook us out of our complacent sense of security, it also opened our eyes to a complex, dangerous and needy world. Indeed, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that we have learned more about the world and international affairs in the past 27 months than we did in the previous 27 years. And that knowledge and understanding have led us to conclude that Canadians and Americans see the world through dramatically different prisms. This expanding sense of being different appears to have a side effect -- a new, more outward, more confident nationalism. For example, for the past two years we've found a majority of Canadians wanting to upgrade our military. This seems to be not simply from a desire for greater military might, but from a realization that if we are to exert our unique sensibilities on the world, we have to participate in it more actively.  Does this mean a more aggressive Canada? Already I see a change in the way we handle the USA. They are quick to claim that one Mad Cow arrived in the US via Alberta, and yet, this is only their  preliminary  suspicion. Here's an idea: keep yer mouth shut until you're sure. So far, all they've done is aggravated us and started a media frenzy. All because they said that they, "needed to keep the American public informed"   Informed  , funny, I thought that meant that you actually had to have  information . Not just some knee-jerk "Not it!" reaction.  Talk to me once you've got that paper trail figured out and actually KNOW where the damn cow came from. Until then, quit spouting shit.

      I now post the five best rules for drinking games. These are worth unlimited good times, when you get to make up a rule that the rest of the players must follow.  1. No pointing. (and that means you!) 2. Every sentence must end with, "in my pants" ie. "Bucky, it's your turn... in my pants." or "Wow! Look at that chick... in my pants" 3. No using anyone's proper names, you must refer to everyone by thier "Westling Name" which they get to make up. 4. Every one must try to speak in cliches. 5. Anything involving basic math.  You will either end up drunk, or oxygen deprived from laughing so hard. Both will feel the same. Have fun and make sure that grandma's got her hearing aid turned up real high so that she doesn't miss even ONE of those in-my-pants finales.

      He's Romanian, has lived in Canada for three years and his English is actually much better than a lot of native speakers. Now he's into the phase of discovering all of the little jewel words our language uses. So far I've heard:  " Woooooble? What is this wooble?" (wobble) "It is such a beautiful crawler" (colour) "Are you at the cattle house?" (cat house) "You look like some kind of moomy" (mummy) "That Plyemouth is nice" (Plymouth, as in cars, but when I tried to explain it to him he said, " Of course. Of course, it's Ply-wood, but Pli-muth. Because it's English and English makes no fucking sense.") " I love Tatziki, with the yohgurt, garlic and kuck-umber" (cucumber)  I think I'll keep adding to this list as we go. Then sometime in the distant future I can present it to him and say, "Remember how retarded you used to sound?"

      Oh how I love shopping. Or at least, I thought I did. Yesterday, I saw (for the first time) the ugly underbelly of commerce. Gold was 1/2 price at the Hudson's Bay Company. Except a necklace that was worth $80 had been marked up to $300. What a load of shit.  My primary peeve about packed malls are the people who stop in the middle of an aisle, look around dazedly and then mosey on again. Goddamit, can't you see that I'm here to do business? Don't just stop dead in front of me. You deserve every jostle you get you wrinkled old bag-with-a-cane.   My brother was emmitting those warning signal traits that I have come to associate with immediate need for exodus. Mumbling under his breath, glaring, shoving, accidentally saying, "Fuck you" instead of, "thank you"  to the people who were ringing up his gifts.   And what's with those families who let their kids play in the fountain? For christ's sake, we're not at "Wild Water World", it's fucking MALL. One lady was even video taping her toddler splashing around. Don't get out much, do we?   My shopping trip was still quite successful, I spend more money than I wanted, I bought things that I'm not sure people will like, and I forgot to get the one thing that I actually had planned out. So now, I'm going to have to head downtown tonight after work, and go through it all again. I look forward to it.   One thing that did make day brighter than a new penny: Last year at this time I was WORKING in one of these malls. In a women's clothing store called JACOB. I went into the store yesterday to help my brother find things for his girlfriend. I saw a lot of familiar faces, all of whom looked just about miserable. I sent my prayers up to whatever the hell lives in sky, "THANK YOU THANK YOU, I do not work here anymore. I do not work in retail. I will not have to work 12 hours on boxing day. I will not have to deal with the simpletons who didn't like their gifts and want to exchange their blouse for a piece of my soul over the coming weeks."   Thanksgiving comes twice a year, for me.

      Ever heard the Bangladeshi national anthem? No? Well, it sounds particularly lovely at 2:30 am in the back of a cab. Really, it does. Or that could have been the vodka singing to me. Whatever. I was a happy little bunny either way.

       That's right you little fucker's - I want answers!    To whom it may concern,   I attempted to use my Reward Coupons for my most recent order of office supplies (Order # 5X3X8X8X0X). The website would not accept the full 16 digit code on either of my coupons and asked only for a 5 digit code, so I entered the first five numbers on each of the coupons and these were accepted.   Our office hours, like many businesses are 9-5 Monday to Friday. At 5:10 pm your company sent an email regarding the order, alerting me that it had been placed on hold.    I checked my email the next morning, and found the alert, at which time I called customer service, to clarify the matter. Customer service notified me that my order had not only been taken off hold, it had been CANCELLED. When I queried this I was told that I only had until 6pm the previous day to call and still receive my order.    This an illogical time frame, as most businesses do not operate during these hours. I will also have to place my order again and it will now take another day for it to arrive at the office. I will also now have to call customer service once I get my order and give my coupon #'s over the phone so that my account can be credited.    I find this highly inefficient, and counter productive. I have never had a problem with Business Depot before but would recommend that if you are to have reward programs, they should be less of a hassle. Do not state that I can use the coupons over the internet if, indeed, this is not possible. Either that, or provide a longer window by which people can reply to any emails regarding holds on their orders.    I would appreciate a reply concerning any action the company is willing to take on this matter.   Sincerely,   H____  D_____________ Office Coordinator  ______________________  416-xxx-xxxx   www._______.com      and what do the Mofo's have to say?   We appreciate your inquiry concerning this issue [Frilly],   Unfortunatly, we are unable to change the web site format at this time.  The best way to still receive your rewards rebate is to  wait for the email confirmation stating the order number, and reply to it saying that you would like to add coupon ################.    I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Please don't hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance.   We appreciate your patience concerning this matter,   Dean, Customer Care Representative  How the fuck does this help me out at all? Customer Service? Customer SHEISSE. "Unfortunatly, we are unable to change the web site format at this time.." Well fuck you little piss-ass, that's the whole point of websites, they're up to the minute, real-time, and entirely UPDATE-ABLE. Besides this, I realize that it would probably mean a lot of re-coding for you, so fine. CHANGE THE FUCKING COUPONS. Don't print on the back that I can use them "AT THE WEBSITE" just fucking tell me the best way to redeem them. I FUCKING HATE THAT THESE LITTLE THINGS PISS ME OFF SO MUCH. I need to get a life, and stop stressing about this kind of stuff.  I guess the problem is that this is not an isolated incident. It seems like everything that  should  be real easy, real simple and straightforward is MUCH FUCKING HARDER than it has to be. For God's sake, all I want are some fucking markers and copy paper. You send me coupons that I can't use. This is systemic.  Retail stores tell you that you won't have any problem getting refunds. EXCEPT: that you need to have your original receipt with you, the clothing item must be unworn and unwashed, you cannot return intimate apparel under any circumstances, the tags must be on the item, you only have two weeks in which to return it, you must have the original method of payment with you or you only get store credit etc etc.   Why do I feel like we, the customers, are always getting it up the ass? They tell us it's going to be as sweet and easy as oral sex, but what do we get? We get a fucking baseball bat to the head.  Oh yeah, and it's unfortunat e ly, not unfortunatly. Hello, spell check much?    But wait, there's more!!  I send in the same order  again  and follow Mean Dean's instructions with this email:   I would like to apply coupons #  3031690053402793 3231490053402796  to this order please.  Thank you,  H Office Coordinator 416-XX4-XXX2 x 21 www.__________.com   And what does Dean the Dipshit send me??!?!?!  We appreciate your inquiry concerning this issue [Frilly],  I have credited your account $69.00 (the coupons plus tax), which will show up on your next credit card statement.  To avoid delay, on your next order  please include all coupon discount codes in the "coupons" section when you check out.   We appreciate your patience concerning this matter,  Dean, Customer Care Representative   So I fire off another email, with HIS OWN attached and the closing line:   "What is going on at customer service over there?!"  H Office Coordinator 416-XX4-XXX2 x 21 www.__________.com   I'm so fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.... I give up.

      Here's some more good points about  urlLink communism  and why it doesn't work.   urlLink Matt  (the darling) has his thinking cap on... Personally I think it is more then greed that is the problem with communism. It is (IMO of course) the lack of competition. Humans thrive on competition. One of the grater ironies of the human condition is that it has the effect of bringing out the best in us and the worst in us. But it does bring out the best in us. Like it or not the drive to be better then the other guy/girl/team/nation/whatever is a serious part of our make-up. Communism takes away any reward for doing a better job then the other guy, so why bother trying? That is why during the reign of the USSR people would literally risk their lives to smuggle Levis into the country. You couldn’t get a quality pair of Russian made jeans because workers got paid the same for a lot of effort as for a little. Levis were worth hundreds of dollars used. Then there is the fact that the ultimate competition, war, is responsible for more technological advancement thru-out our history then any other factor.   Capitalism may bring about some of the worst human traits, but it also with out a doubt brings out the best too.  And that's why we love  urlLink him .

      R.E.: "Communism is for robots. Take away possessions, take away all that shit and leave a person with just their animal passions. What are you left with? The need to eat, sleep, have shelter, fuck, and work. Communism covers these basic needs, but doesn't allow a human being to develop further than this.  There is no room for the individual. It is for robots. You become a number."  Me: But capitalism is just a different kind of number. I'm still just the sum of my bank account, my health card #, my driver's license, my street address, my IP address, my user login... I'm individual in this combination, but I'm still a number. Bureaucracy creates populations as numbers. Communism limits your material possessions, and with that comes the limiting of self expression. I think that communism's main flaw is that of corruption. Those at the top are not participating in the system. There are always the "have" and the "have nots". As long as human greed exists, communism will fail. Both because the leaders are corrupt and because the peons are always left wanting more.  I do agree that communism would be great for robots though. If human beings ever learn to be happy when ONLY their basic needs are met, then communism will succeed. The problem (and great blessing) is that we strive for self-actuation, and expression. Expression involves not only free speech, but also the chance to believe in different systems of society, different political parties, and extremist means of expression.

         urlLink cryptogon.com  "Monday's hunting trip to Pennsylvania by Vice President Dick Cheney in which he reportedly shot more than 70 stocked pheasants and an unknown number of mallard ducks at an exclusive private club places a spotlight on an increasingly popular and deplorable form of hunting, in which birds are pen-reared and released to be shot in large numbers by patrons. The ethics of these hunts are called into question by rank-and-file sportsmen, who hunt animals in their native habitat and do not shoot confined or pen-raised animals that cannot escape" How can that actually be called "hunting"? According to Merriam Webster:  to hunt "to pursue for food or in sport"  Pursue? Seek? Use tracking and intelligence to outwit small two and four legged animals? Hell no. Stick 'em in a pen, give me a shotgun and blow those naughty mofos away. I know, I know, peasants are threatening creatures and all politicians would like them dead. Oops, did I say "peasants", I meant "PHEASANTS". Slip of the tongue, I swear.

       This time I created myself a  urlLink letter to Santa .   Dear Santa,  I have been a good Girl.  It really wasn't my fault what happened at My Best Friend's Christmas party. It was Schlampe who spiked the punch with too much Martini. I can't help it if I drank 6 glasses. It was so good---smelled and tasted just like Escape cologne.  I thought it was funny when I put BitterLittleMan's Turtleneck on my head and danced the Boogie oogie oogie on the Desk while singing `Ca plane pour moi'. I didn't mean to break My Best Friend's Remote Control and don't know why she would sue me for Theft.  I don't remember calling Matt's wife a Super! Chicken---even though she looked like one with Blue eye shadow and Red lipstick!  And when I threw up on Sarah's husband's Toes, it was only because I ate too much of that Pizza.  After all that fun, I admit I was a little tired. So I fell asleep on my way home and drove my Murano through my neighbor's Roof. I don't think that was any reason for my neighbor to call me a Round Cat and have me arrested for Jay Walking!  So, Santa...here I sit in my jail cell on Christmas Eve, all colourful and Hot. And I'm really not to blame for any of this Soft stuff. Please bring me what I want the most---bail money!  Sincerely and jumpily yours, H (Really a nice Girl!)  P.S. It's only 1 bucks!   I am all colourful and hot!! Wahey!

       One small peeve   Darlings - quote other websites, please do. Give us what they say so that we don't have to click over to them. But for heaven's sake set your quotes apart somehow! It's not enough to say, "And I quote..." at the begining of the post. I'm skimming through all your lovely words, and I might skip the first sentence in favour of a nicer one down below. Make it PAINFULLY obvious that you are using someone else's words. There are several HTML tags that might prove useful here.   The  &lti>and I quote&lt/i>   tag will give you = and I quote - Blogger even has a nice easy button for this.  Of course, there is also the   &ltb>and I quote&lt/b> =  and I quote  bold tag.  Even better - in fact, the best tag is the   &ltblockquote> A whole bunch of quotness &lt/blockquote>  which will usually=   Indent and put space around your quotes.  You can even set up your style sheet to make your blockquotes different colours, or italics, or different fonts altogether. See, isn't that easier to tell apart??   I know I'm being picky, I know that it's pendantic, but for Chrissakes, I'm also easy to confuse. So please, please...    set your quotes apart  Thank you.

        Should this be an actual relationship?    urlLink Things he and his girlfriend have argued about.    Margret doesn't like to watch films on the TV. No, hold on - let me make sure you've got the inflection here: Margret doesn't like to watch films on the TV. She says she does, but years of bitter experience have proven that what she actually wants is to sit by me while I narrate the entire bleeding film to her. 'Who's she?', 'Why did he get shot?', 'I thought that one was on their side?', 'Is that a bomb' - 'JUST WATCH IT! IN THE NAME OF GOD, JUST WATCH IT!' The hellish mirror-image of this is when she furnishes me, deaf to my pleading, with her commentary. Chair-clawing suspense being assaulted mercilessly from behind by such interjections as, 'Hey! Look! They're the cushions we've got.', 'Isn't she the one who does that tampon advert?' and, on one famous occasion, 'Oh, I've seen this - he gets killed at the end.  See if you can spot the difference between these two statements:  (a) "Those trousers make your backside look fat."  (b) "You're a repellently obese old hag upon whom I am compelled to heap insults and derision - depressingly far removed from the, 'stupid, squeaky, pocket-sized English women,' who make up my vast catalogue of former lovers and to whom I might as well return right now as I hate everything about you."  Maybe the acoustics were really bad in the dining room, or something.  Ah, the sweet, whispered nothings of love.

       Where are we? New York?!   My cousin has to pay the City of Toronto $50. My cousin's girlfriend has to pay the City of Toronto $50. Why? They got ticketed for jay Walking. That's right, ladies and gents. 59 people a year die in Homocides in Toronto. 51 people a year die due to jay walking.  It's back to holding hands, looking both ways and crossing the street. But only when the little man says you can. And only where lights with the little man are located. I can think of lots of things I'd rather do with $50 than give it to the city. I could probably get a decent hooker for that much. Or maybe another pair of shoes.

       I have a bowl  It is a pretty bowl, slightly wonky, bold black and white. It is light, about the size of half a basket ball. It has a japanese design inside the rim. The design means "adventure".   It wasn't expensive, but it cost enough to be treated gently. I put my bowl in a box. I put my bowl in a box with an address label on it.   The address label shows that it wants to be sent to a small cottage on the south coast of England. The address label and the box want to have stamps put on them, so that the pretty bowl can go to England.   Instead, the address label has holly leaves drawn on it. The box will be the lucky receipient of the stamps.   The man at the post office looks at the (now) pretty box. He knows that there is a pretty bowl inside it. A light, pretty bowl, that wants to go to England. The man at the post-office carefully weighs the pretty box and measures it. The man at the post office types on his little keyboard and says, "$94.80 please."   The pretty bowl in the pretty box is sitting on the counter at home, in Toronto, Canada. It does not get to go to England because $94.80 is too much for a bowl adventure.  Poor bowl.

Dad fires off a quick "Reply All"  hello ALL   i fail to understand why we are all included in little H's xmas wish list.  only one person has her name!!!   is this computer marketing gone mad in the hopes that one of us will e-mail her our Visa # so that she may pick and choose from e-bay as she desires?  the poor girl already has to rent closet space from one of the neighbours in the next building so that she may keep her shoe collection in some semblance of alphabetical and preferential order!!   she will be moving out in early spring so be forewarned;  coffee table books, when placed in a carton with 25 others, are bloody heavy!!   of course, as your doting and dutiful father i will endeavour to get every single thing on that list and more.  i have already singled out the one iem that you had spoken of in the past that you wished and it is at the top of my list of gift giving.  Once the mortgage on mom's apartment is approved!!!   love you h.  Is it sick that being teased makes me feel loved?

Go after these first, then pass your constitutional amendment.  Divided opinion.

         You bastards.    I don't care where you are from, or what you used to do before you came here. I don't care if you've been here all your life. I don't care about your culture, or your hot water situation.    IF YOU ARE GOING TO SQUISH UP BESIDE ME ON THE BUS FOR FUCK'S SAKE, SHOWER MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH.   Especially in summer. Especially.   There is also something called  urlLink deodorant . It is available at most grocery/pharmacy/convenience stores. It is available in all these places because it is an important part of any personal hygeine routine.   PLEASE GO AND BUY SOME.   And then, instead of admiring the fucking packaging. PUT IT ON. Under your arms, that's right, under there, where all the cockroaches live. Maybe you should just buy a can of insect repelent. Solve two problems at once.  Scalp grease does not serve the same purpose as hair gel. Don't think that it does. Because it doesn't. Your scalp makes the bus windows look like someone rubbed butter in circles where your head was.   Also, if you must make those juicy coughing noises,   DO IT INTO A KLEENEX , not my face.   I hate public transit.   Especially in summer.   And Especially in winter.  You smelly bastards.  Especially when I have to take it.

Then random guy gets on to ask how to get somewhere. It's the wrong car, he gets off again. The driver, "He had a cuppa coffee but mine is better." *takes a sip*  "Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh, Delicious."  Bastard.

      I didn't know that there were so many people who don't.   urlLink Ikeaphobia and its discontents  : "I must hear some version of this spiel once a month, generally from some self-consciously leftie male between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two desperate to prove his authenticity, present his down-with-the-people, fuck-the-Man bona fides. This despite the fact that Ikea was explicitly founded on the premise of providing well-designed furniture to the masses at affordable prices - a premise that the company still largely delivers on. (If I have a quibble, it's with quality, not price.)  You know what? I'm done with it. If your life is mediocre, I promise you, Ingvar Kamprad didn't make it that way. You did. And if you're so desperate for your own soixante-huit moment that you can sit there with a straight face and tell me that you're being oppressed by flat-packable pine furniture with goofy pseudo-Scandinavian names, I'd advise you to spend a few days working with child slaves in the Sudan, or something. "  Go ahead and hate Ikea if you want - but they never said they were original. Just unboring.

      For the first time in about three years, I got together with my two brothers last night.  This summer, we will all be living in the same city. There will be lots of drunken good times. Yes, I am looking forward to immature silliness.   In honour of our little soiree last night here is one classic "I was really drunk..." story. Starting with me... of course.  1. I meet up with my older brother downtown for dinner on a friday night. We come upon some of his friends from law school... and thus starts a nonsense night of liquor.  At four a.m. I'm at a dive with plywood floors, plywood benches and a rock cover-band singing unnoticed standing on milk crates. The dive sells liters of "ginger ale" for $40. Very potent ginger ale. In fact, ginger ale that tastes suspiciously of rye whiskey. Everyone knows about this.   My brother is off dancing to the rock with a pretty blonde. In fact, he's less dancing and more making out. Whatever, he was happy.  I had been talking to this cutie all night... we'd had more than a few drinks, we'd laughed, we'd danced... it was great.  Six a.m. and we decide to call it quits.  We load into various cabs, my brother, the blonde and several other people in one. Me, the cutie, and several others in another. Funnily enough, the cutie and I are the last ones in the cab, and we both get out at his place. Innocently I say, " So, are you up for a night of cuddles and chats?"  He pauses and after about 30 seconds says, "I'm sorry, maybe I should have told you this earlier, but I have a girlfriend."   I am mortified. I go up to his apartment to use the facilities, call a cab and pay the $28 fare to get home.   The next day I call my brother and freak on him, "You could've told me he has a girlfriend!" My brother says, "I don't really know that guy... sorry.  By the way, what did you say to him?" I told him, " I asked if he was up for a night of cuddles and chats." Mu brother... "You what?!" [My name] that means that you want to have sex!"   Me: "No it doesn't... it means exactly what I said. I'm not into one night stands! What are you talking about?!"   Brother: "From a guy's point of view, that means you WANT HIM."  Christ. I was under the impression that it meant what I thought it meant. Doesn't it?

      I suppose I should preface this entry with the whole sordid 2 year old story, but it's not really worth it. I I replied with a, " Fuck you  Thank you" and that I still wished him the best, because really, he's all about the love. Pbbbbbbbbbbbt.  You know what? I forgot how tough you act behind a computer. Do you sit on a broom while you type, or just your throne? I never mentioned anything about sex. So if your birthday alert doesn't notify you about my birthday in the, oh lets say next century or so. Here's my notification to you, don't contact me again. Don't trip over your ego.  For some reason this email hurt my feelings. I guess it's because I thought I was just being honest with him and this is what I get in return. Ah well, c'est la vie, and some days... it sucks.

      And I hated it. Every bit as much as Anthony here.  urlLink Retail Hints : "A good idea when your shopping experience isn't up to par, is to state your dissatisfaction with the store aloud, to nobody in particular, but hoping it will be within earshot of someone who will care. This is essential in guaranteeing that your shopping experience will be improved upon your return. Employees carry around little notepads and pens for these occasions, jotting down whatever louder-than-normal comments they happen to hear. They then take these slips of paper, and place them into a special, titanium-laced safe, to be protected from any harm. The employees care wayyy to much to let anything happen to your complaints." I think perhaps there are a couple items he forgot. Like....  1. If you ask the sales girl what the largest size the store carries, in a certain skirt that you have just tried on, and you are a women's size 13 and sales girl says, "Ma'am this is a children's store." Do not get snippy with the sales girl. Listen, you're a women's 13, our store goes up to a GIRL'S 10. You will not fit that ass into a 10 year old's skirt. Don't fuck with me about this.   2. It's not okay to try on ladies panties and then ask the sales girl to come and check how they fit you. Honestly. It's not a pretty sight. Guys, most random shopping women are celulite, pimple, hair ridden creatures. Not even you would want to see them in their panties.   3. Do not lift your shirt up at the counter and tell me that you want, "a bra just like this one." That big barrier towards the front of the store is a WINDOW. The security guy with his face pressed up against it just got a great shot of your "tatas" and he is the proud wearer of a walkie-talkie.  Don't be surprised if you end up on the internet - there are security cameras in every mall.  4. Do not try to return your skanky worn underwear becuase you washed french lace with your rock collection. Yes, they're falling apart, no it's not my fault. I have those and they did not disintigrate on contact with water. In fact, it looks like your boyfriend mistook them for "edible" undies. For god's sake, get them off the counter, the lady behind you is gagging.  5. Men: "she's your size" just doesn't work. I'm a totally abnormal body type. Guaranteed, she's not my size. Do a little research, check the labels of some of her clothes, undies and THEN come see me.   6. Do not leave clothes that you try on the floor of the change room. It's dirty down there.   7. Don't argue with me about the return policy. It's there, it's 12 paragraphs long and I know them all by heart. It doesn't matter that it's not printed on the back of the receipt. There is no law that says it needs to be.   8. Other things that you should NEVER try to return: socks, belts, footwear, bras, intimate wear, two year old merchandise, merchadise that you have completely fucked, merchandis covered in your dog's hair/stained/damp for some reason. Merchandise from another retailer. If I tell you that it's not from our stores, then don't try and tell me it is.   Thank all the various gods people believe in. I do not work in retail anymore. And never, ever will again.

      Ten points to those of you who can name the ablum (and artist) who was reponsible for OPP. A hint: said album also contained such hits as, "Ghetto Bastard" and "Guard your Grill" - Guard your grill, knuckle up, put 'em up, you ain't tough. I listened to that tape until it wore through.   urlLink Mighty Girl : "Music: YOU DOWN WITH OPP? YEAH YOU KNOW ME!   L: What does that mean?  Me: What?  L: What does that even mean?  Me: It means, 'Say, do you feel that OPP accurately represents your worldview, resulting in an increased respect for, and loyalty to, him and what he represents?' L:What? M: And then the other guy says, 'Why yes, you're well-acquainted with my fealty for said musician. In fact, this entire party feels the same way.' L:...You're drunk. "  I wish I was this good at talking while drunk.  That would be good. Ish. Goodish. Well, it would be. But I'm not. I'm not even that good sober. At all. See?

      Ah yes, the "organic" debate. I don't usually buy organic food, because I can't afford it. The idea of all shit that's in everything else is freaky though.   urlLink Macleans.ca  : "FROZEN ORGANIC beef hamburger patties, $9.78/kg. Grade No. 1 organic onions, $2.26. On-the-vine, hothouse organic tomatoes, $11/kg. Eating a hamburger that doesn't load you down with chemicals, priceless. Well, maybe. Some shoppers would just say pricey. Those organic ingredients -- when compared to the common ones regrettably seasoned with traces of antibiotics, growth hormones and pesticides -- can cost anywhere from 15 to 170 per cent more. But it's come to this, hasn't it? Most Canadians would never accept a two-tiered health-care system, yet that's the direction in which we seem to be heading with our food. Consumers who are at least reasonably well-off can afford the good stuff, while those who are financially strapped make do. As shown by the scares with mad cow disease and tainted farmed salmon, our increasingly industrialized food chain may turn out to be the pitfall that keeps us from what could otherwise be a long, healthy life."  Even if we do eat healthily there are still the environmental risks that we come into contact with every day... pollution, radio waves, chemicals... you name it. I can picture a return to the pioneering days - everyone farms their own vegetables, we use horses to get around and pump our own water from the well in the back yard. If we don't start cleaning up our act, we will be reduced to this - without any other options.

      Great blog entry, comin' your way!   urlLink You Silly Girl: Little Exorcisms : "The conversation began with the man asking to speak with the Rabbi. Now, it's not the first time I've had that request.   Apparently, about 10 years ago, the Rabbi really did use my phone number...which leads me to believe these callers don't speak with their Rabbis as much as they should. In any case, usually telling the caller they've reached the wrong number is sufficient.   This time was different. I was asked to look up the Rabbi's phone number, instead. After assuring the man that I haven't a clue how to get ahold of the Rabbi, he scolded me. 'Well, what kind of Jew are you?'   I mentioned that I am not Jewish. He seemed surprised. With a real desire to get to the bottom of this situation, he cleverly asked, 'Well then why do you have the Rabbi's phone number?' I think it was his thick New Jersey accent that made the first 5 minutes amusing."  Perhaps you should go and read the entire thing. It's fun and amusing. She talks about god, but only a little bit.

      Do all of my southern neighbours really actually LIKE shrubs? Please tell me it's all wrong. I mean, you saw the state of the union address. How can you like a fucker like that?!   urlLink They like Bush, and they are not stupid - www.theage.com.au : "First, the US economy is growing at an estimated 5 per cent a year. Interest rates are low. Bush's tax cuts are in people's pockets, and they are spending happily.  Second, Americans like Bush. They see him as patriotic, family-centred and self-disciplined. He is also teetotal, conservative, and Christian. He supports marriage, and opposes abortion and homosexual marriage. There are people who think this makes him a bit old-fashioned but millions of Americans like old-fashioned values. Most Americans also support Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq. They are not stupid. They know that the so-called intelligence about Saddam Hussein was wrong. Despite this, 67 per cent still believe the US did the right thing. "

       I've made a new header graphic. I spent most of the morning dicking around with AutoCAD trying to figure out how to select certain things and not other.  The selector thingy seems to work across all layers, unlike the one in photoshop that only uses the layer you're working on. It's frustrating, but things in AutoCAD are so much more precise than I make them in Photoshop.   One thing I will say, AutoCAD is not as creative or intuitve feeling as photoshop is. I mean... it's just so much more scientific, and lines are all "bisecting" or "perpendicular" or at "endpoints". Great for the Engineers, not so good for the creative types.

      The photocopier broke. I called the service guys and they sent someone straight away. Beautiful, easy... I should have known. They sent a service guy who happened to have advanced Parkinsons. I shit you not. It took him over half an hour just to unscrew four bolts on the bottom of the paper tray.   For those of you who don't know all the pleasures of Parkinsons, it manifests itself mostly with uncontrolable muscle shakes. This guy shakes hands with everything.   It must suck though, to be a repair man who can't hold or operate a screw driver.   In the end, he just used some super glue to put a broken piece of plastic back in place.   Although, I've found super glue on the carpet, on the table, in the paper tray, and on the back of my chair. Must have been a particularly violent spasm. Dangerous.

      interesting has happened to me yet, today. Or maybe it's just that I'm not finding the ridiculousness in the "normal" like I usually do.

Maybe you're tired of hearing me be tired.  I wish I had some pink pointy kitten heel shoes like  urlLink Anna  has.  Surely that would be a good thingumy to have for this afternoon?   Better yet, I should write a reply to  urlLink Matt ... he sent me a deliscious, long email over the weekend and I still haven't expressed my gratitude for his insight.

      What is there to oppose? They may have had a faulty process, but the report still makes a whole lot of sense. What the hell is the Bush administration trying to do now? Tell America, "You're fat and will probably die of heart disease, but that's okay?!"   urlLink MSNBC : "The WHO report recommends eating more fruits and vegetables and limiting fats and salt. It also suggests governments limit food advertising aimed at children and encourage their citizens to eat healthier foods. Taxes and subsidies could be used to reduce the price of healthy food and make them more attractive to consumers, the report said."   How about NOT undermining the authority of the WHO and backing them up. There is an obesity crisis and not just the WHO says so. Let's stop nit-picking and get behind some kind of healthy eating program. Christ.

Police are investigating after an angry man returned a computer he had just bought saying it was packed with small potatoes instead of computer parts.  The store replaced the computer free of charge but became suspicious when he returned a short time later with another potato-filled computer casing, police in the western city of Kaiserslautern said on Monday.  'The second time he said he didn't need a computer any more and asked for his money back in cash,' a police spokesman said.  Police are now investigating the man for fraud  Would you not know that you did not sell a man a computer full of potatoes instead of silicon pieces? Would accept a case full of small potatoes? Is there some kind of "you are small potatoes" joke that I should be making here? No, no there is not.

      I feel like I should put a disclaimer in front of this post because quite frankly, it's disgusting. It's so disgusting that I have to post it... hopefully to get it into meatspace here, and out of my head.   It's another dream and it creeps me out. I still only remember bits and pieces but EWW.   I'm standing  around, talking to friends and my two brothers. Some other friends rush up and start blabbing  on about how they said they would do something if the opportunity every arose. Apparently the time has presented itself and everyone's off to finish up the dare. What did they bet each other that they would do? They bet that they would stand in tubs of horse cum and have another tub of the same emptied over their heads.   Maybe I'm watching too much "Fear Factor." I don't know.  Anyway, everyone trundles off to the farm and the waiting tubs, telling me that I have to go with them and do this thing too.  I'm doubtful at first, I don't really want to stand ... well... I just don't want to go. I tell them to give me a minute because I want to bring  a change of clothes. Giving myself this time to think up a proper excuse I start to collect my pink PJ's to change into. Finally an apropriate excuse has me smiling. "Guys, I can't go, I have to be downtwon at 2 pm and there is no way I make it to the farm, do this thing, change clothes and be downtown for my appointment on time." At this point we are ON the farm. I don't know how we got there, but it's a dream, okay?  We're looking  at the great big vats of nastiness. The horse juice is yellow-ish and each spermatoza is the size of an earth worm. They look like transluscent, yellow-y minnows. It's putrid. I picutre my friends standing in their vats with the buckets being emptied over their heads. Fishy looking sperm gets into their mouths and I'm glad that I'm not doing it.   Now WHAT THE FUCK does that mean?!

"WUTEVA!"   urlLink Hold On, I have [Shit all] To Say : "so i think im really dumb, i think i overreact to the stupidest, smallest things ever. i dont know maybe it's just cause im insecure or whatever, but i think it just makes me sad because i expect more out of most things than the other person does. i must say though that i feel better, but i feel dumb because the person i overreacted on i can not talk to when i want to but when he tried talking to me, when i could have talked to him, i didnt feel like talking to im, what a dumb ass i am. oh well wuteva!, i think i'm just lame! alright now i feel better!"  I guess I shouldn't be to hard on the girl. I mean, my blog would probably read exactly the same way if I was 15. But I'm not. Wait a minute, the diaries I was writing when I was 15 DO NOT read like this does. Phew. I'm not an idiot.  Maybe tomorrow should "teen talk" day and I will write all my entries in this sort of, like, self involved, circular, un-punctuated, clued-out, short hand. Yeah, like, that would be so "the hot."   Pbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbt!

      I'm pretty sure that someone who actually knows me is reading this blog. They spent almost an hour reading my archives on their first visit, and now they are checking the site almost twice a day. So, it's making me uncomfortable. I have a couple posts that I'm sitting on because I'm worried about who this person is. I might even have to close down the 'blog... but I don't want to. If you (mystery reader) are one of my friends, or family, or even aquaintances (co-worker?!), I would appreciate it if you a) told me who you are, or b)stopped reading my blog. This is not here for people who I interact with, who I went to school with, who I dated, who I was/am friends with.   I suppose it's mostly my fault, because I wasn't very careful about being anonymous, using my regular email address, my name, and other things. But with a blog this personal, anyone who knew what I did last weekend would be able to figure out what they are reading. So far, I have changed the contact email and the posts and my new handle is "Sponge Writer."   Anyway, I'm going to continue to post almost like I was before, until I figure out whether I am comfortable with the idea of someone who knows me reading this.   If you're wondering how I got worried about this, I have two words for you:  urlLink Site Meter . It tells me most of your IP address, your internet service provider, your time zone, the amount of time you spend on my page, the number of pages you look at, etc etc. But it doesn't give me enough information to track to a specific person.  That's all for now.

      I don't work with fools, but I used to.  urlLink iWorkWithFools.com   "I had a friend who worked at McDonald's who told me this story. One day there was a blackout in our town and the local McDonald's was basically offline as it takes electricity to heat all that greasy oil. Some lady called in and asked whether the McDonald's would be open. Fair enough. When my friend responded with a 'No', the lady asked in an indignant tone 'Well, what am I supposed to feed my kids?' Too bad I wasn't there. I would have suggested chemical castration tablets"  Oh yeah baby. I bet the people who work at McDonald's have some of the best stories. Not only are they stuck at what is arguably the most miserable job in North America, but the clientel aren't usually that "Wall Street Banker" kind of person. Although, they are sometimes. Anyway, I love McDonald's, but they have a hard time with "No Cheese" orders.

      The owners of the cat house have just left Burma  Well now,  I've just read this myself and Burma sounds kind of horrible, doesn't it?  Let me sum it up this way.  When you travel where we do, you should expect somewhere around 50% to 70% of your time to be  a bit of a hardship.  Its what's left over that makes it all worth while.  I've always found, the poorer the country, the friendlier the people.  Burma is no exception. No where will you find a kinder, more gentle human being than in Burma.  Many a day, you'll notice a child staring at you.  A tiny grin in the kid's direction will almost always be rewarded with a huge ear to ear smile.  If I were to ever take up religion again, I think it will be  Buddhism.  The temples have a great sense of serenity.  I think that the people are a reflection of that. Foreign policy would have you believe that Burma is a dangerous place. I've never felt safer. Bagan is magical.  Inle Lake is second to that. The food is a new pleasure with every meal. Back in Thailand now, I dream of Burma.  I'm beginning to babble now.  I've misplaced my betel nut.  Oh, am I ever jealous. I wish I could be there. I'd even settle for Thailand.

      I was petting a cat. It's ear broke off in my hand. There was blood like half dried glue all around the bottom of the ear. It felt like a dry leaf. The cat meowed quietly in pain.   I woke up crying.

      Alright you guys down there, just make sure it doesn't happen again.   urlLink Bush's popularity rating.  " I, however, will blare out its name so that at last people can address the issue and perhaps adopt strategies to overcome it. It's the 'Stupid factor,' the S factor: Some people -- sometimes through no fault of their own -- are just not very bright. It's not merely that some people are insufficiently intelligent to grasp the nuances of foreign policy, of constitutional law, of macroeconomics or of the variegated interplay of humans and the environment. These aren't the people I'm referring to. The people I'm referring to cannot understand the phenomenon of cause and effect. They're perplexed by issues comprising more than two sides. They don't have the wherewithal to expand the sources of their information. And above all -- far above all -- they don't think."  I agree that there are many people in the world who have problems with complex critical thinking. On the other hand, politicians seem to base their campaigns on rhetoric, being vague and breaking promises. I would say that it's almost impossible to make an informed decision, when every piece of information is "spun" to give the candidate the best chance of success. Perhaps new laws about HOW politicians campaign would help this issue. I mean, Bush would be a lot more accountable to the American public if they were able to sue his ass for breaking campaign promises, or lying to them.

       What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they're much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good. Dressing oddly gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.  Quoted from  urlLink Paul Graham.  Read the whole thing, it's worth the brain power.

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!  My best friend and I had the ultimate night out, more eye makeup than clothing (both of us in teeny tiny little black dresses), champagne falling from the sky and the drive home a complete blur. Apparently I ate some Chinese food somewhere in there, but it's all just starting to come back to me. I ran into several actual friends from University and a couple of guys from highschool. M. and I toasted each other at midnight, "To friendship!" and then while everyone continued to snog their significant other: "To damn men!", "To false nails!", "To alcohol!", "To makeup!" WHEEEEEEEE!  I didn't have to take the bus to [hometown], or home to Toronto again. As a part of B's "get M. back" campaign, he picked me up and dropped me off - both ways. In order to please her. And I got to chat with him about why he really broke up with her - which I'm still not sure about but have knocked a couple of reasons off the list. He doesn't think she's too high maintenance. It wasn't that.   How was your new years?

      I am at work. I am at work, utterly alone. There is no one else here, but me. Did I miss something? Am I supposed to be at home in bed right now? Where are all the naughty little engineers? Have we been awarded an extra day off that I am currently frittering away by actually doing work? Well, I'm not really working, am I? I'm updating my blog. But still. I'd rather be back in bed. Under the duvet. Warm and unconcious. I'm still hung over.   I think I deserve an extra day in bed. After the big break up last night. That's right. R.E. and I are going to be friends from here on in. I talked to him about the way he had begun to treat me and it all came tumbling out in some big mess. He's currently depressed. He wants to be with me, but doesn't think it's fair to start a relationship while he's not mentally healthy. I'm agreeing with this. So, we decide to call it quits. I'm actually quite relieved... I don't have to worry anymore, or wonder what's going on in his head, or take him to task for some insensitive comment. He, of course, is completely 'round the bend with sorrow, keeps calling me to cry on the phone, worried about how sad I must be. I'll admit it, I am sad, he is a wonderful guy, but right now the relief at having the situation sorted out outweighs the sadness.   At least I've learned one important lesson. A couple of years ago I would have convinced him that it's okay for us to continue how we were, and that by staying with him I could support him in his bad times. I would want to FIX him. But now, I realize that he must fix himself. Then, maybe then, we could have a proper relationship.  Hey ho, it's on with life we go.

      Usually when I head down to my hometown for the weekend, I can anticipate getting drunk, dancing and possibly snogging a cute boy. This weekend was NOTHING like what I wanted. Not only did I not get drunk, instead of snogging a cute boy I end up running into my EX. A.k.a. the BLACK HOLE. At  my  bar. Small consolation that he's still the smarmy loser I broke up with.   This relationship tops ALL my "I've been hurt" stories. The Black Hole was truly atrocious. He stole my stuff, he slept with other girls in my bed, he lent them my clothes, and he "borrowed" money that, of course, I will never see again. I feel foolish for admitting that I let someone do that to me, but I was in "SAVE HIM" mode. I was sure that if I just kept smiling and supporting him, he would see how much I loved him and then return my love. I had to shield him from the cruel world, where nothing in his life ever turned out right (because of his stupendous BAD LUCK, yeah right).   Finally I got my spine back and I gave him the boot - but he wasn't gone until after several very scary and aggressive fights, the disapearance of strange things, like: one fluffy white towel, my pepper grinder, the fleece he gave me for Christmas, some tupperware... The man was a klepto. I wanted him out of my house.  So, he was gone, and I was left OVERJOYED. To my surprise, I wasn't heart broken. I'd already been through that in the relationship. I was HAPPY. So so so happy. I was happy when I realized that I was not the bitch that he'd constantly told me I was. I was not a hateful creature. I was a nice girl, who had been taken advantage of. So he could go and fuck himself.  For the next six months he called me... he wanted to talk, he wanted to see me, he wanted to get back together. After constant rejection he screamed down the phone, "I'm SO GLAD I broke up with you!!"   So, Friday night, there he was. In my bar. Slime-ing his way around, shaking hands, schmoozing with the trailer trash. I tried my hardest to ignore him. He walked behind me and I turned my back on him trying very hard to remain calm. He still scared me a bit. My best friend sent out her best, "if looks could kill." I felt small. I turned around in time to see a self satisfied smile on his face and looked away quickly, as if I had been looking at a tree, or a piece of furniture. I hoped that it didn't show that my heart was bursting out of my rib cage and every nerve in my body was screaming, "RUN!"  He never said a word to me, just that awful sickly smile and then he left the bar. I spent the rest of the night trying hard to have a good time and then I ran into ANOTHER of my horror stories, but more on that later.  I was surprised at the effect the Black Hole had on me. It's been about three years since we broke up. I spent the next three days weepy, insecure and upset. At least it's over with. If I see him ever again I will know that he is no threat to me, even though my emotions will probably still run wild for a while. I felt pity for him too. He's very good looking, he's personable, he has the capability of getting people to open up, talk to him, like him and give him chances that they wouldn't give other people. He's got all these wonderful gifts and he FUCKS IT UP, every time. He lies, cheats, steals, is petty, unreliable, self-interested... it goes on and on.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that although he upset me, the lasting impression is "poor guy." He's a joke. He hasn't learned anything.

      Oops, my bad. It's the other way around.  Be ready, not afraid   urlLink Ready.gov - From the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  You want me to NOT be afraid, right?  Possible Signs of Chemical Threat   Many people suffering from watery eyes, twitching, choking, having trouble breathing or losing coordination.    Many sick or dead birds, fish or small animals are also cause for suspicion.   So how about you create a whole web site about all these terrifying things that might happen to me because the FUCKING US GOVERNMENT has SHITTE foreign policy. I like the cute little icons of the toxic chemicals, and people running away etc.   I wouldn't have to be AFRAID or READY if the USA was not home to so many political ASSHOLES with their dicks up their own asses. Who can seriously say that Bush has a hot clue as to what the fuck he's even talking about most of the time.

      Anyone else see the recent tabloid pictures of Meg Ryan's new pout? Anyone else think that maybe there was a little too much collagen in there? Anyone else agree with the term "Trout Pout"? Yes? Good. We talked about her at lunch today.  R.E. saw an add for "Against the Ropes" in the paper. He pointed at Meg and said, "I like her." I say, "Yeah, those fish lips are great. She looks like a large mouth bass. You like fish, don't you R.E?"  S.E. (Slovakian Engineer) chimes in, "That's perfect. No teeth!" And this is how we know it's Friday. Women without teeth become "perfect" at the office.

      S. posts about casual sex, and how she's not really into it, and how the physical side of a relationship can make the emotional side a bit of a mess. I have to agree with her there.    urlLink tales of ordinary madness : "i see so many men and women in love with someone completely wrong for them because of a powerful kiss, great sex or just a really strong physical attraction. I know i fell in love with an ass, i even stayed with him for 5 years! And every day i'd wonder why i was with someone who was so wrong and on a completely different wavelength. And it simply had to do with me being too much in love and the kisses that made my knees go weak. "  I've been in relationship where I've made the guy wait a long time before sleeping with him. I've made the mistake of giving in and sleeping with a guy too soon. I've had sex with guys I know I'm not ever going to love. I have to say that I was the most happy and comfortable, when we waited. The emotional side of things is so much more important than the physical.   True - bad sex can be a relationship killer... but as long as both partners are in tune with the other, the bad sex can usually be turned into great sex. You just have to get comfortable and give signals as to what you do/don't like.   Another problem with the purely physical: disease. Using condoms is only SAFER sex. Things like Herpes and Genital Warts can live (and therefore be transmitted) OUTISDE of the area  covered by a condom. 25% of N.America has Herpes. Of course, condoms break too. All in all, I think that biologically we are put together (at least women are) to thrive the best in a PAIR BOND. A couple. Two. Me and one other. It's healthier for your system and healthier for your mind. Don't try and tell me it isn't. 'Cause I won't listen.

      No, it's not a new exercise aimed at firming your tummy. It's a British T.V. Show and it's deeply and importantly funny.

I wanted to sit in all of them. In the end, I tried out the puke-y little smart car. It sucks. something like 30 hp and 120 km/hr top speed. Didn't like it. Sunday night - dinner out. Il Fornello on the Danforth. Had leftovers for lunch today which I forgot at home. Fark.   Note the dude in the plaid. There it is, that ubiquitous Von Dutch trucker cap.

       urlLink  John Strain  left this comment at  urlLink Fear Not .  I decided not to be anonymous, because I want the restraints in place. The restraints of which I speak have to do with, would I say this in front of my mother, or would I be embarrassed if ANYONE knew I said this or that. This way I am challenged to communicate more middle of the road. I have to get my point across without ranting or being extreme. I like the challenge, because, in the end, that IS me. I believe both sides have valid points and our views are dynamic.  If this is what works for John - that's really fantastic. Personally, I choose to be anonymous for exactly the opposite reasons John is under his own name.  In every day life, I'm REALLY middle of the road. I'm mediocre. Normal. Rather boring. I'm too [_____] (afraid, chicken, silly, smart, cautious, P.C., socially aware, insincere - choose one) to say all the things that come out in my blog.   For instance, I would never tell ANYONE that I had a very surreal dream about horse juice in real life. In my blog: there it is, hanging out all over the place. Being disgusting all on it's own.   This makes me happy. I'm really really really me here. I'm stupid or smart or obnoxious or mean or kind without worrying who I will offend. I can easily say, "You don't like it? Fuck you then." because really, I don't know any of you. I only know what you write and one or two measly paragraphs a day is a far cry from the sum of your existence.   The multi dimensional aspect of the interaction is missing. I don't have your tone of voice. I have no way of knowing what mannerisms you use when you talk. I don't know if you speak out of a gorgeous barbie body, or a not so plush "work in progress" shell.  Without all of these things... I will never really know any of you.   The bits I do get ... I appreciate.  For me, the challenge is to let it out. Let out all those things that are usually too scared to come into the light. So, John likes his restraints, they force him to make is points in non-offensive and lucid ways. I like my lack of restraints... I'm as offensive as idiotic as I feel like. And some days, like today, I feel just a little bit like making sense.   (mind you, it's all rubbish and tomorrow will be back to helldamnfart)

THEN they told us the bones were racoon penises - we just threw them on the floor.  They were just trying to mess with us - trying to make fun of us.  That sucked ass. But I think they really might have been racoon penises. Gross."  This girl can barely speak. How on the fuck is she going to write a whole book? I mean, won't it  totally suck ass ? Gross.

      I'm reproducing this article in full because I think it's important. Not enough women listen to their inner voices nowadays. Seems like society has squashed the idea that women's intuition is a gift, by calling us "irrational" or "emotional". Ladies... if your little voice is whispering something, turn down all other noise and for God's sake   listen to it .   Steer clear of risky partners  - From the  urlLink Toronto Metro Daily Newspaper , Feb. 3/04 ---------------------------------------------- Many women who are or were involved with abusive men don’t realize that early warning signs were there from the beginning. This article – the first in a threepart series on dangerous partners – is intended to help women identify some key indicators of risky relationships and to assist them in making sounder choices before becoming seriously involved with someone who is physically and/or mentally abusive.  One of the first red flags of an abusive man is his ability to become very serious too quickly. Usually he will claim to be totally enamoured with the woman because she is so much better than any of his exes. He will also talk very negatively about his past partners who apparently all cheated on him or deeply hurt him.  Ironically, the intention is not to make the new woman feel special but to prepare her for what he expects of her in their relationship.  On occasion an abuser will admit to having been physically violent with previous partners. This admission will entail a diminished version of the assault and an exaggerated account of how he was provoked to violence.  There also will be no remorse for his actions. Instead, all blame will be shifted to the abused partner. Some men will even expect “brownie points” for being truthful about their past violence. That type of absurdity is no different than a murderer showing no remorse at a trial and expecting a full acquittal just because he tells the judge where the body is buried.  Women should also be wary of men who in the early stages of a relationship discuss marriage and interest in having children. This information is of value to many abusive men because they are looking for women eager to get married and less likely to terminate their relationship if they act out.  Another red flag of abusive men is their incessant need to be in constant contact with the woman. While this desire to talk with or see the woman frequently is often flattering at first, the man’s real motives are more sinister.   First, these men are unable to defer gratification.  Second, they men inject themselves into the woman’s life to secure their position, influence her judgment, and ensure she is not seeing other people.   Third, by being together almost daily in the first few months gives the illusion they have had enough time to get to know one another - even though realistically they have only known each other a month or two. This also gives the abuser the excuse to push the relationship to the next level fairly quickly, whether it involves having sex, moving in together or getting engaged.  Finally, the reason these men desire to move quickly in a relationship is because they are aware of their inability to hold off on their explosive temper.  It is also not atypical for psychopathic men to ask women during the courtship phase if they were sexually abused as a child. This subject is brought up to affirm their twisted preconceived notion that all females from an early age are promiscuous sluts – deserving physical abuse and punishment.  They also seek out previously abused women because they believe they will be easier victims to control and abuse. These are only some of the primary key indicators of a risky relationship.  Women are encouraged to exercise caution, to listen to their intuitive inner voice and to the advice of loved ones when starting to date someone new.   Contrary to what the new man in your life might want you to believe, your friends and family members are not jealous of your relationship with him. Rather they truly dislike him for valid reasons including that you are unsafe with him and that you deserve a better partner in life.  Remember sometimes it is better to stay single for the right reasons than to be with someone for the wrong ones.  Before any of you men take umbrage at the male negative tone of this article I'll give you a little disclaimer. Okay?    Not all men are scum, just a significant few.   Yes, women can be abusive nutcases too. When I find an article for men warning about scary women, I'll post it.    As much as this article can give you hints on what to look for, ultimately you must rely on your gut feeling. If he is attentive, wonderful and talking about marriage and you have NO feeling of worry... then don't become a paranoid freak just because of some newspaper article.

       urlLink .you yes you. the work of jasonshogreen  one must wonder what is going on in this very talented head. I stole this link from Sarah------> She's over there. Under the "rockin' chick".    How great is this?! I am that sheep-y creature today. I feel like there is a munchkin sucking on my head. And I am mystified as to who the munchkin is, and why he's there. But he's definitely there.  Guess what I'm really doing today? Proofreading things that are like this: "The boiler plants were selected so we could examine the three most common boiler types. 'bent water tube','fire tube', and 'atmospheric'.  We also wanted to  include the most common piping configurations...." My most common piping configuration is me, on a couch, with a pipe pumping jello and potato chips into my mouth. That might explain the munchkin.   I'm not making any sense any more, am I? No, no I'm not. As Homer S. would say, "CRAZY LIKE A FOX!"  Matt is my biker boy toy. You look good in cherry pink leather, right Matt?

        With a  masturbating bear. And lots of red hair.   All the newspapers have picked up the story. There's a HUGE to do about it. It's Conan!   Admittedly, I'm a fan. He's funny, he's good at his job and I've never seen Tom Arnold quite as twitchy as he was in Conan's hot seat. It's a great show.  But seriously, I don't think that it merits front page. Aren't there more important things going on here? What about some of OUR celebrities? Real Canadian celebrities? Like Mike Myers, Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Jim Carey, Wayne Gretzky? Why don't they get all the hulabaloo every time then come to the big T.O.?  Yes, it's exciting that he's here. BUT NOT THAT EXCITING. I hope it snows a lot over the next week and the airport shuts down and he's stuck here for then next six weeks, buried up to his tits in ice and freezing winds. Then we'll all hear about what he really thinks of Toronto, Canada.

       1. She is on the receiving end of a pair of diamond earrings and she decides that she doesn't like them, so she makes him take them back. 2. He tells her he wants to hang out with his friends, for ONE night. She gets upset, he says, "listen I'm just going out with my friends." She's mad, he's mad, they hang up. Five minutes later she's bawling on the phone. He ends up driving across town to her place, to comfort her... and not hanging out with his friends at all. 3. She asks him to maker her coffee. He does this. She doesn't like it so she tells him, "You are GOING TO GO to second cup and buy me a proper coffee." He refuses, fighting ensues. 4. He makes plans to go out for dinner with me and his brother. His girlfriend hitches a lift into town with him. They arrive, I call the other brother to make plans and *bing!* they can't stay for dinner - she wants to go back home. RIGHT NOW. 5. She uses PMS as an excuse to treat him like dirt. 6. She issued an ultimatum last summer: "Either you are in Toronto, with a job, by September, or it's over." Because she was moving here to go to med. school. So what did he do? He moved.   I love my brother, but I want to tell him to pull up his panties and ditch the bitch. He keeps telling me that she's not as bad as I think she is.

      You could just kick 'em in the tea kettle.  urlLink Fear Not : "'I just want to snuggle. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?'  'There's a teddy bear in there, if you want to snuggle, snuggle with that.'   I just knew that if I fell for that 'I just want to snuggle' line and let him crawl under the covers, the next thing I'd have his hands in inappropriate places and he'd be pressing his hard-on against me, trying to find a way to worm his way inside me. When he'd told me he was cheating on Julie, he told me that part of the reason was that he just has this incredible sex drive. He just needs it - a lot. What, did he think he'd be doing me a favor?"  Please note: I probably would have said, "Sure, cuddles, no problem..." and then spent the rest of the night removing him from those "inappropriate" places on my body. At least it would have given me a good reason to tell him to go fuck himself. If he didn't think that was physically possible then maybe he could have a couple a ribs removed. At least he would be able to suck himself off.

      Who was the sicko who did the "let's boil a frog" experiment anyway?  urlLink OpinionJournal - Peggy Noonan : "But at least indignation is broad and deep. So broad and deep there may be hope in it. Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, in stepping over the line, could wind up being remembered as the entertainers who reminded us there is a line, or should be.  This might be a frog-in-the-water moment. You remember: You put a frog in a nice cool pot of water, and he's happy and swims around. But if you put a flame underneath the pot and slowly raise it, chances are he'll boil to death. On the other hand, if you dump a frog in a boiling pot of water, he'll jump right out and be saved."  Boiling water. Hmph.

      And a blog. Neither of which really concernes anyone else in the world. Except me. Besides these relevant points... I like this article. Very much.   urlLink ||Why your Movable Type blog must die || : "You are all pretentious twats  Every last one of you. You're all latte-sipping, iMac-using, suburban-living tertiary-industry-working WASPs who offer absolutely no new insights on anything whatsoever apart from maybe one specialist field if we're lucky. Most of you think that you're writing original content and that you're making a contribution by licensing your spewings under Creative Commons 'Some Rights Reserved' licences, just because it's the hip thing to do. You think you know all there is to say about blogging because you understand the concept of HTML and CSS, but the horrible truth is that 40% of you are all using the same shitty default layout. Then you take pictures of yourselves looking pensive or making vague allusions to mythology." There are some good points here, and some of the comments and responses are perfect examples of the greatest and worst the "blogsphere" (ooooo, I said it!) has to offer.

      I saw an episode of Sex and the City a few nights ago. The one where Carrie meets this hot, older Russian artist. That's right, Barishnikov. The world renowned ballet dancer.   At the end of the date, he asked if she wanted to go back to his place.  She shook her head. He murmurs, "So, not tonite, mmmm?"  I just have to get this out...    If BARISHNIKOV asks you if you want to go back to his place you bloody well do it. In fact, you ask him what position he would like you to assume.   Who the hell does this Carrie character think she is, anyway?!

      This is a good one folks...  urlLink finding my way home... : "It's easy to love without commitment. People do it all the time. Easy to love, to give of oneself for a while. But commitment implies bonding in such a way that one promises to keep the fires of love burning indefinitely. It also means shutting one's heart to the possibility of loving another who might even be more attractive, even more lovable. Not easy. This is why solid commitments are not at all as common as we are led to believe. In fact, more often than not, I think that the commitment two lovers make are not equal. What I mean is that the commitment of one might be a whole lot more or a whole lot less than the partner's. We see it all the time. One loves more than the other and is more committed than the other. We have often seen lopsided love relationships where one partner is giving so much more to the relationship than the other."  See.. I think a lot of girls just THINK they're committed to a relationship, or they're happy to SAY that they are, but when it comes down to it... they're not. Men are more open about saying, "Listen, I can't give you 110% right now. I can't commit," and then we yell at them. Really loud.

      I haven't had much time for blogging at work recently. Since they discovered that I had taught myself AutoCAD they've given me a lot of the draughting to do. The engineers are freed up to do engineer-y type things and I get to use my new skill. Happiness all around.   Although, everything else that I used to do has been sliding... I still have to mail out cheques from last week.   As for the rest of my life, I've moved back home after two months of house sitting. I can't believe how much the three cats vomited. Every day, I would discover new and unusual places to hide puke. I even found a really old lump of half-digested kibble under the couch. It was growing green wavy tentacle things. I'm glad to be back at my house, with my one non-puking kitty.   I never realzied how much I love my duvet until I climbed under it last night. The bliss of a goose down blanket is without par.

Koleman watched the file requests on OpenNap servers (to get numbers on which albums' tracks are being downloaded) and compared them to the sales-figures for each album, correlating file-sharing popularity against sales data. His conclusion: file-sharing isn't killing record sales"

      Actually, weekends are delicious, the things that sometimes happen on weekends are not delicious.  Here we go with the weekend wrap up: I spent this weekend in our beautiful nation's capital: Ottawa. My older brother is in his last few days of law school and it was time to lay down the books for some serious festivities. Hence:  Signs of a good party: 1. Beer cans on the back of the toilet 2. The smell of weed 3. Boys fighting over girls 4. Dancing (primarily salsa) in the living room 5.  People lying on the floor in the hallway 6. Post-it notes on my little brother's nipples 7. Ripped skirt 8.  2-day hang-over 9. Yelling 10. Extremely loud music.  All of this from a bunch of kids who are going to be LAYWERS. Good to know that the future pillars of our society are party animals, not averse to breaking some by-laws, according to mood.

      I usually HATE hockey, primarily because I've dated a few hockey players and they were all horrible, horrible men.  I used to go to their games and  freeze my ass off for three hours along with the devoted "hockey Moms" and red, bellowing fathers.  I would spend excessive amounts of money on stale popcorn and hot chocolate at the concession stand. I would band together with the other Hockey Girlfriends and discuss the various merits of the rest of the team. I would wait around after the game for my stinky boyfriend to emerge from the change room smelling like rancid equipment and deodorant. I would sit  in the car on the way home and listen to the family discuss every goddamed play that their son was a part of. Then there would be the discussions about OHL (Ontario Hockey League) and NHL scouts, the possiblity of their boy making the big time and the pep talks about what he has to do to get there.  I was bored out of my mind.  Last night was totally diffrent. The  urlLink Leafs  were on a hot streak, the game was fast and Boston was putting up a good fight. There was a little hitting from behind and a lot of scuffling in corners. A lot of penalties were called (esspecially since the Bertuzzi incident) and Belfour was saving like crazy. I'll admit, I got into it.  I still switched to  urlLink MXC  at commercials, though.  MXC makes me snort my wine out of my nose. Those Japanese folks are sooooo fucked up.

      I swear to god, someone should write a book about all the characters that take Toronto Transit.   Last night there was a small man sitting in the back of bus, across the aisle from me. At first I thought he was just fighting sleep, head nodding, eyes closing... but then it's not normal to have your eyes going in opposite directions. Nor is it normal to loose control of your motor skills. Nor is it normal to bounce your head off a pole in front of you and not register it. So, this guy is fucked up on something. Seriously fucked, because for the next half hour he seems to be fading in and out of consciousness, rolling his head off his shoulders and attempting to stand up, without being able. I think the worst part is that he never said anything. No drunken mumbling, no shouting, nothing.   I head to the front of the bus to tell the driver that Dude at the back is messed up. This fifty year old man who has been singing opera since we left the station starts to get into it with another older man. There's yelling, cursing and one of the old guys slaps the other. At this point the bus driver does NOTHING. In fact, no one is doing anything. They're all just sitting there watching these two guys almost kill each other. I grab the Opera Singer by the arm and do my best 'sweet young girl voice', "Please Sir!" He turns around to hit me, but drops his first instead and screams at the other man to get off the bus with him so they can finish the fight outside. Opera Singer gets off. The other old man doesn't. The bus driver slams the door and drives off at Mach 5. Opera Singer is left screaming "PUSSY!" at the departing bus.  Meanwhile, I had missed my stop.

      I was going to post this in the comments, but I got a big fat 'fuck you your comment is too long pigfucker' error (or something like that), so I'll put it here as a bona fide post.  I haven’t gotten permission from Frilly to post, so I hope she doesn't mind.  Here goes.  With inspirational titles such as the grammatically retarded  urlLink "Guys and sex: What girls don't know us"  and the aneurysm inspiring  urlLink "God knows what He's doing..."  I see this Silver Ring Thing going  far .  Stupid, lazy, god-fearing parents everywhere will see this as the salvation their kids need to get 'back' on the path of righteousness.  Aside from the whole “preach abstinence as the word of god and try to get kids motivated into not fucking by having them watch TV, instead of educating them and doing something useful like promoting safe sex” aspect of the Silver Ring Thing, the part that bugs me the most is that they call it the Silver Ring ‘Thing’.  Why can't you call it the 'Silver Ring Principle' or 'Silver Ring Promise'?  Why must they call it a 'Thing'?  I know arguing the syntax (?) is kind of picky, but how am I supposed to begin to take this crusade seriously when it's called the 'Silver Ring Thing'?  I’m going to start a better initiative called “Talk to the Parents and See if There is Reason That Their Child is a Fucking Retard and Fucking Around Unprotected at the Age of Thirteen Thing” or TPSTRTTCFRFAUATT.  Oh wait… we can’t blame parents for their child’s problems, this is America we’ll have to blame Movies, TV, Videogames, McDonalds, Pornography, Society, Fish, Hormones, Comics, Solar Flares, Germs, Bunnies, California, Music, Janet Jackson's boob, and the Easter Bunny for fucking the kids up because the parent’s  can’t  be at fault.    How can a parent be at fault for their child being a fuck-up when they weren’t even around to raise the kid?  Right now, before you all, I pledge my vote to the first Democratic Presidential candidate who supports the forced sterilization of everyone behind the 'Silver Ring Thing', even if it's Howard Dean.  I hate the world.

       urlLink American Virgins  I watched this documentary last night. I understand that STDs and Teen pregnancy have reached epidemic proportions in the States. I understand that parents, teachers, community leaders are concerned. I do not understand why this has to be a Christian thing.   The " urlLink Silver Ring Thing " take their show on the road, trying to convince teenagers all accross America to remain "pure".  One of their buses breaks down and the other bus immediately starts to pray. "Great God, please be with our other bus in this, their time of need. Great God, please guide them to the correct meeting place and please, Great God, be with their brake pads during their journey. Great God, we thank you for all your blessings and hope that this weekend is a holy success."    NB  by  pure  they mean PURE. No fooling around, no oral sex... nothing.  For some reason, I can't see this catching on.

      Sweet mother of God. This  urlLink guy  proposed on HIS BLOG. I'm still trying to decide whether it's absolutely the crappiest thing I've ever seen, or the sweetest.  I guess it will depend on Michelle.   Being extremely PRO marriage recently, I hope she says yes.   She does say  urlLink yes . I cried at work. This is crazy. They were both so eloquent... but it seems that there is dissention in the ranks. They've only known each other for a few months. Read it for yourself.

      Love scares the shit out of me.   There seems to be as many kinds of love as there are people. There's the hopeless love, dependant love, supportive love, platonic love, abused love, repressed love, joyous love, shallow love... love love love.  I feel like it's an abused word. Kobe Bryant probably still tells his wife that he loves her,  Lorena Bobbit loved her husband. L o v e has been dragged through the mud.  I propose a tax on the word "love".  $1000 every time you use it. Payable to charity. No wait, that would mean that rich people would get to love more than the rest of us. Oaky, 30 hours of community service - every time you say love. The word love comes out of your mouth and for the next four weekends you're in the soup kitchen, or volunteering at the library. Maybe people wouldn't abuse the word so much then.  Teenage girls wouldn't shriek, "Justin Timerblake I LOVE YOU!" Guys wouldn't say, "Man, I love my new playstation."  The word love would finally achieve more of the authority and dignity that it deserves.  Then it would be right that it scares the shit out of me. Because then, I would know that when R.E. says he loves me, he means it. And I wouldn't have to be so scared, because I would be more secure in understanding what the hell I mean, when I tell him I love him. It's saying, "You're worth 30 hours of my time doing thankless tasks." Not very romantic, but sure as hell better than using the term to describe the yummy feeling you get when you taste your favorite pizza. "Dude, I LOVE extra cheese!"   So people, I have a favour to ask: please don't use the word love so flippantly. Save it for those who really need it.

      I've only seen him a few times. Perhaps I'm being cruel, because he's obviously developmentally challenged but nevertheless, he will remain "frog boy" to me.  The first time he broke upon my conciousness was when he sat down on the seat beside me, put his nose almost in my hair and started to make a rhythmic croaking noise in the back of his throat. When I looked up, startled, the croaking got faster and more intense. I spent the next twenty minutes trying to read my book and ignore the bullfrog symphony that was my accompaniment.   The next time I saw frog boy, he was devoting his attention to someone else. I smiled at the poor girl in commiseration. She spent the time looking at her hands in her lap. Desperate to act like nothing was wrong, and totally unwilling to be rude and move to another seat. Just like me.   Today, frog boy didn't sit down next to anyone, he just hung out by the exit doors. Every time a woman would walk by him, his throat croaking would heighten to a fever pitch then slowly die down again. Everyone on the bus was carefully avoiding his eyes. No one wants a frog symphony.   Frog boy disgusts me and also makes me feel sad. Can you imagine if a real life girl ever kissed him? What would happen? Would the pouch of skin under his chin explode outward in a show of masculinity, or would the croaking stop altogether - having finally achieved it's purpose of luring a pontential mate?

      For my Warden tells me so.   urlLink The Globe and Mail : "The swampy land between Gainesville and Jacksonville, Fla., used to be known only for alligators, truck stops and trailer parks. Now it has become the launch pad for America's newest institution: the faith-based penitentiary. Governor Jeb Bush opened the first faith-based prison in the United States a few weeks ago with a characteristically spiritual proclamation to the gathered prisoners: 'I can't think of a better place to reflect on the awesome love of our Lord Jesus than to be here at Lawtey Correctional. God bless you.'"  Of course, it's a Bush family memeber.

      That's right. My very own apartment. A cellar dweller. In the basement. One bedroom, small, cozy, clean. Cheap. Love it.  I'm moving on the same weekend that most of the known world moves: May 1st. University students are all doing their summer switch over, people are changing jobs and housing, and I'll be in the middle of the melée.   I'm already planning how my furniture is going to fit in. Lucky I taught myself AutoCAD, because now once I take measurements of the apartment, I can make up a little diagram, with dimensions. I can measure my furniture and bingo bango! I know where everything will go the second it comes in the door. BEAUTIFUL.  I've been a bit naughty in that I haven't told the landlord that I have a cat. According to my brother's bitch-ass girlfriend it's illegal for them to tell me I can't have pets. Plus, the little pudding is 15 years old and spends most of her time imitating the carpet. She can hardly walk anymore. I'll be surprised if she lasts longer than my lease does. Either way, she's coming with me.   I've already rented a small cube van. Last time I drove a cube van I took the eavestrough off the corner of the house. This time, I'm hoping for some real damage.

Only one branded song was not connected to hip-hop or R&B... Good Charlotte's 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'. The most amount of brands in a single week of the Billboard top 20 in 2003 was 47, on April 12th. The most brands crammed into one song... 14 - by Lil' Kim in 'The Jump Off'. "

      This commercial makes me puke.  A guy opens a can of Maxwell house coffee and smells it. One of his nostrils starts to sing, like a mouth, "Smells fresh!  fresh!  and exciting! It's so exciting to me!" At this point both nostrils are belting it out.  Whoever came up with this idea, whoever approved it, whoever paid the money to make the commercial, whoever did the graphics work to make the nostrils look like they're singing... THEY SHOULD ALL BE FIRED. Either that, or the actor has a nasty coke habit and he's just twitching. It's embarrasing that our supposed "developed" western countries use this kind of advertising. Deeply embarrasing.

      Why this particular dog sucks: 1. His favorite snacks are: his own shit, other dog's shit, pee snow, dirty underwear, used maxi pads, snotty kleenexes, McDonald's boxes, wash it all down with water out of the toilet (even better if the last person forgot to flush). 2. He barks when I'm on the phone. He is jealous of the attention that I give to the electronic equipment in the house. 3. He likes to lick bare skin. Considering #1, this is disgusting. 4. He will not go to sleep until he has wiped his runny eyes, boogers and ass all over his bed. 5. Doing this gets him so excited that he starts to choke and puke. Once he has gagged all over his bed, he is happy and will curl up to sleep. 6. Did I mention drinking out of unfluhsed toilets? 7. He licks himself. A lot. 8. He follows me around to EVERY room in the house, lies on the floor and shows me his willy in hopes of getting belly rubs. 9. Because of his prefered diet, his breath is poisonous. 10. I cannot leave him alone in a room with a garbage can.  Two more days and then never again.  I thought that the cat sitting was bad, but this, this is real work.

      Last night I went to see a 1 bedroom apartment in a nice area of town. The building was alright from the outside, clean, low rise, cared for. The apartment on the other hand, was not. It looked like people had wiped shit on the insides of the closets, the bath tub dated from 1950, and when I opened one of the cupboards in the kitchen the freakin' thing FELL OFF in my hand. The landlady was like, "I'm going to need $840 up front" I was like, "I'm out."  No freakin' way am I living in some rat ass apartment that faces onto the underground parking garage.  I think my IQ has dropped by about ten points. I've been reading  urlLink Not Proud  for about 20 minutes and I notice all I want to do is swear and be vulgar. I'm still disturbed by some of the LUST confessions. "every time my boyfriend f***s me from behind I imagine that it's Daddy's big cock stretching me out." I can't believe this shit. These people need some help. Maybe they should have a reciprocal site: "Proud" where everyone can post about good things that they do. Although, who wants to listen to a bunch of twits talk about how great they are?  That's it. As of right now I'm swearing off Not Proud. It makes me grumpy and rude. No more.

      Bill here.  I don't know if Blogger is going to make it look like  sponge Frilly Panties writing this or not so i figured it'd be best to announce myself right off the bat.  It's not like i'm pompous and need to announce myself everywhere i go or anything, if i did that it'd be more along the lines of "Bill in the HIZZOUSE, ya'll" or "B to the mothafucking ill in the HEEZY" because, you know,  urlLink I'm  deluxe  son . That's not the reason i announce myself at all, i just want ya'll to know whose mind all this bullshit stems from so you don't think  sponge Frilly Panties got brain damage or something.  Now that  that  is all out of the way, what do i do next...  That's right now i have to come up with something to write, this is the tough part.  I can't write anything too 'interactive' because  sponge Frilly Panties still has no comments allowed.  The working title of the post is 'Busy Weekend', but that's kind of misleading as i'm never really that busy.  I'll go and make it an inside joke by changing it to 'My Kinda Sorta Possibly Maybe  Lady  Busy Weekend'.  Okay, that got a laugh out of Steve now i just need to account for my other 2.667 loyal readers and i'm set.  The 2.667 of you ready?  Here it is: 'poop, uhhhh-huh'.  Yup, that's about all i've gotta say to get a chuckle out of  urlLink Mike-aholic  and my little brother.  The other .667 of you don't even speak english, and are just following the link because you found me via  urlLink Justin  and think i'm linking to porn.  I can't come up with anything 'funny' for you 'Life is WooWoo' readers, sorry.  I just don't know how to pander to you people and your high brow humor.  If you don't laugh at 'poop, uhhhh-huh', then i'm lost.  This post seems to have nothing to do with My Kinda Sorta Possibly Maybe  Lady  Busy Weekend, so i'll stop now.  I'm leaving the title though.

      Those rich people, they don't know crap.    urlLink The Globe and Mail .  Picture it. Audrey Hepburn at the Academy Awards podium, tugging self-consciously at her gown, after telling someone on the red carpet she should have used toupee tape to keep her breasts covered. Or Ingrid Bergman announcing to the audience that her dress was see-through. Imagine a camera panning over to Humphrey Bogart's table to catch him chomping on a wad of gum the size of a golf ball.  Incongruous? Of course, thanks to a currently underemployed character trait we used to call poise, which once stood between stars and their ids.  But at the Golden Globes last month, some of our top actors -- Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise, respectively, in the examples above -- shared it all with us.

      Most things I come across are quite hazy, vague... annoying. This is the best site so far.    urlLink Orion Center: Education : "Most scholars agree that the Dead Sea Scrolls are the remains of a library that belonged to an ancient Jewish sect, the Essenes. This community inhabited an arid plateau on the north-east corner of the Dead Sea. Scrolls were deposited in caves situated in the cliffs behind the community's central building. The site was occupied by the Essenes from the late second century B.C.E. until the appearance of the Romans in the year 68 C.E. Most of the manuscripts were written in Hebrew; however, Aramaic and Greek are represented as well."

      I've heard a lot of talk about the dead sea scrolls, but I've never really learnt what they said, or what they were about. That's what I've been doing today... researching the dead sea scrolls. Ooops, I mean, mainly I've been working, but in between tasks I've been researching. You believe me, right?

      Such eloquence inspires me. That is all.    urlLink Meet a Tosser : "That I have great difficulty finding events to look forward to probably explains my antipathy towards surprises. The prospect of continued existence appears to be sufficiently cheering for most sentient beings. An abundance of rosy futures is what they foresee by default, so they hope for startling sharp spikes of delight that jerk them from mere contentment into temporary ecstasy, while I only set my sights on achieving a dread-free plateau of emotional neutrality. Spikes are easy to come by. Mere clicks and flips away, given the modern ease of access to information and my geeky fascination with several categories of it. It's the permanent, underlying rationale that's missing. I have yet to construct a bridge of self-deception over the all too conspicuous existential abyss."

      Frilly has offered to let me write a diatribe about the wonders of  RSS  here, and I'm happy to oblige.   First off, what is  RSS ?   Depending on who you ask you get different answers.   RSS  is thought to be an acronym for  R eally  S imple  S yndication,  R ich  S ite  S ummary, or  R DF  S ite  S ummary.  I've always been partial to  RSS  meaning  R eally  S imple  S yndication, and  the  urlLink specification  I found seems to agree with me.  No matter which acronym you take  RSS  to mean it all boils down to the same thing.   Put quick and dirty,  RSS  is data presented in a simple format ( XML ), sometimes referred to as an  RSS  'feed'.  Thoroughly explaining what  XML  is and how it works are  urlLink projects beyond the scope of this article  ( urlLink here's a start if you want to learn ), but put simply  XML  is a pretty open-ended markup language that structures data.   I usually find it easier to understand things when I can see them in action, so let's look at  urlLink Matt's RSS Feed  and seem some RSS doing its thing.   What you see should look something along the lines of  urlLink this .  The tags (the red and blue items in my example picture) are the important part, the text will change every time  urlLink Matt  updates.  If you have an understanding of  HTML  you can probably make out the syntax of the  XML .  All off the tags are enclosed in &lt; and &gt; tags, and are all pretty self explanatory.   To see what  RSS  has to do with blogging, let's look at  urlLink Matt's RSS Feed  again.  See all the text in between the tags?  That's the 'blog' part of Matt's blog in there, minus all of the  CSS  styling and formatting.  A blog without formatting seems pretty pointless.  Someone went to all that time and effort to make their blog nice to look at (in most cases), and you reduce it to plain text?  Not really much point to it until you introduce an  urlLink Aggregator .   A simple way to explain an  RSS  aggregator is as an  RSS  browser.  You use  urlLink Firefox  to view web pages, you use  urlLink NetNewsWire  (or your aggregator of choice) to 'view'  RSS  feeds.   Why use  RSS  and an aggregator instead of a browser?  Speed is one good reason.  Strip all that formatting and all those images out of the blog to get the  RSS  and you've greatly reduced the page size.  Not a huge benefit if you have a broadband connection, but it can be a huge benefit to dial-up users (yes there are actually still  urlLink a lot of dial-up users out there ).  Once again I'll use  urlLink Matt's site  for an example. As of this writing Matt's page weighs in at about 55.8 kb , while his  RSS  feed weighs in at a rather svelte 4.8 kb .  That means that the  RSS  feed can theoretically load  over ten times faster !  While Matt's site isn't quite light ( urlLink WooWoo  weighs in around 30 kb ) , it's not all that bloated either ( urlLink FUBAR  weighs in around 128 kb ).  An  urlLink acceptable average  for page weight is probably somewhere around 50-90 kb .     Another way to save time using  RSS  feeds and aggregators deals pretty directly with blogging.  How many times a day do you check your favorite bloggers to see if they have updated?  Instead of loading up  urlLink WooWoo  fifteen times a day to see when Frilly has gotten around to updating your aggregator can do the work for you.  Aggregators check the  RSS  feeds you subscribed to to see if there are any updates.  When a site has been updated the aggregator displays some kind of notification to let you know there's new stuff to read.  If you have broadband you can even leave the aggregator constantly running in the background throughout the day and have it check your favorite sites every fifteen minutes or so and be notified of updates throughout the day.    RSS  doesn't only benefit the audience.  If you're a webmaster of a fairly popular web site, and people are constantly checking your page for updates they're also sucking up bandwidth every time they refresh the page.  Take  urlLink FUBAR  as an example this time (because Justin seems to go over his bandwidth limit every other month).  Instead of having all those people sucking down 128 kb  every time some of them could be refreshing a 4 kb   RSS  feed.    RSS  can be faster, and save people money with just a little bit of work.  Technology can be a great thing.   Here are some questions I came up with.  If you have more leave a comment and I'll try to answer them as best I can.    What aggregator should I use?    This all comes down to personal preference.  Do you want it simple, or full featured?  Are you willing to pay for it?  Web based, or running on your computer?   On my  urlLink Mac  at home I use the aforementioned  urlLink NetNewsWire Lite  for now.  I'm waiting to see how  urlLink Erik Barzeski's   urlLink Pulp Fiction  turns out.  Erik has  urlLink mentioned how PF will work  and it seems to address a few problems I have with NetNewsWire.   As far as Windows goes I haven't found a aggregator I really like yet.  A lot of them require .NET support (?) which I can't install on my work computer (IT has me on all sorts of lock-down). If you have a favorite Windows aggregator leave a comment and I'll check it out, but the ones I've tried so far ( urlLink FeedReader  and  urlLink EffNews ) left me realizing how good NetNewsWire is.  For now I'm using  urlLink Bloglines , and it's good enough for now.  I only have to use Windows at work, so I'm not planning on paying for anything.    What about  urlLink Atom ?  Is it better than  RSS ?    The  urlLink Atom  versus  RSS  argument is a bit of a hot issue in geek-land right now.  You can  urlLink Google the issue  and get a good amount to read.  Right now I honestly don't know enough about the 'benefits' of Atom to argue if it's better or not.   RSS  was there first and until  urlLink Blogger   urlLink jumped on the Atom bandwagon  it looked like Atom was fighting an losing battle, now it seems like it's a closer fight.  Your best bet is probably to find an aggregator that supports both and ride it out.

      Not only have we lost 3 months work off the server (anyone know how to retrieve files?), the phone has been ringing off the hook, neither of the bosses are here (I was looking forward to working on my friend's website - yeah right) and the new monitors have arrived and have to be installed. Not only all that, but who calls? Mister S. The totally random guy I was dating  urlLink last summer .   Mister S has been a bit of a sore spot for me, because I slept with him, told him I wanted to be with him and then he told me that he wasn't ready for a relationship. I had assumed a different response - as he was behaving in a boyfriend-y sort of manner. Another lesson learned : Just 'cause a guy ACTS like your boyfriend, doesn't actually mean that he WANTS to be your boyfriend. Check first, then sleep with him (or not).    I've accepted the date with Mister S., mostly out of curiosity. I want to know what he wants. There's always an ulterior motive with him. Needless to say, I don't really want to date him again, I just want to satisfy my curiosity.    This summer is going to be interesting. Another ex just sent me an email, wants to know how I'm doing. What is it with spring?! Guys want to get laid? Want to make sure that they are not hated? Want to see if I love/like them still? Want to stir the pot?

      will someone please explain to me what this xml (Atom) feed thingy is?  I just turned it on for my blog but I don't have hot clue as to what it does. I know, I'm very clever, turning on things that may or may not be useful. I read the knowledge base here at blogger and it just sounds mumbly jumbly to me.    What, exactly, is the POINT of an atom feed?   Anyone? anyone?    -Update-  Okay, so of course, asking for answers from the internet in general means that I've been doing a little research myself. I've looked at bottomfeeder and Newsmonster so far and I think I'm getting the gist of this.    The whole feed thing is kinda like personalizing you msn home page with the information that you are interested in. Except that you're not limited by stupid MSN's categories and choices. This is good times. Usually I put my fav. blogs into favorites and I keep going back (almost daily) to see if they've updated. With sites like Belle de Jour now only being updated periodically, it can get to be a pain in the ass. So, I'm gonna set myself up with one of these aggregators and you all better get your little feeds up and running so that I can see you all in one fell swoop.    Please and thank you.

      1. I don't have to delete anthing - I archive instead. That way they don't show up in the inbox, but are still available to me.   2. Labels help me to sort messages - I don't have to pick just one folder to put things in.   3.  Haven't discovered the size of attachements alllowed - will look into it.  4. Complaint #1 - the interface. It's kinda cheesy 2-D 1980. I must admit that Microsoft's hotmail is sleeker looking with clearer buttons.  5. Complaint #2 Cannot figure out how to remove a label from one email, if I want to. I can delete a label, but then it is removed from all emails, by the looks of things.   -Update- my bad... I was just being stupid. The lovely people at Google got back to me right away with further details and I've figured it out.      -Update-  Thanks to  urlLink bill  we have a little further advice regarding Gmail: check out the security issue at the  urlLink Bradlands.  Even though bill's site is still being revamped - I totally got a kick out of the big OFF sign. Bill, that's way better than those lame ass "under construction" signs we see all the time. Thank you for making me smile!

      You'd think that Dad would give up after the luck he's had with women. No, no, of course he won't.  So, he's proposed to his girlfriend, who is 25 years younger than he is. She is almost my age. Am I angry? No. Am I sad? No. Am I laughing? Yes. Before he knows what's hit him, he'll be retirement age with a new house and a new baby. Just when he'll want to slow things down.    Mother of God.    I only found out about it 'cause there was a message on the answering machine abou the "ring" being ready.  What ring?! Oh right, of course, how silly of me, the engagment ring.    I looked at Dad, "You're going to propose?!"  "I already did."  "When?!"  "A while ago. It's the only way her mother would accept it."  "Um, yeah."  Her mother is his age. Congratulations, I guess. Just wait 'til Grandma finds out about this! She's going to have kittens.

      and I realized that almost every entry follows the same format:  1. This is the guy I'm dating right now, he's hot, he's cute, he's this and that.  2. I realize that I don't love him, but I hope we kiss/makeout/makeout more  soon.  3. There's this other guy who is interested in me, but I don't care. Yeah right.  4. We went out and these guys tried to pick us up.  5. This guy I'm dating, he rocks.  6. I hate my step mom.    Typical for a 15 year old. Boy obessed and hating the step-parent.  Nothing interesting, earth shattering or even intelligent. My idea of the best night on earth was when we went and hung out with the "yachties" during a regatta in England and I got served, way underage.    After reading a few more entries I realized I had reason to hate my Step-Mom. She took back birthday presents (especially a ring that they had saved for me for years, until I was sweet 16). She then wore these birthday presents herself, around the house, in front of me.  She always told me I was too skinny. Hello? As if a 16 yr. old can help it?! I was a grazer at that age, constantly eating.  She grounded all the kids because part of a chocolate Easter egg went missing.  I mean grounded as in, no TV, no phone, no music, no going out, no Sega, no allowance. Super grounded, over an Easter egg.     Recently she asked my Dad for some extra money (during their divorce and the sale of the house) so that she could help her two sons get through university. Dad loves those guys and so he acquiesced. How much did she give her sons? $20 each, for groceries.  Bitch.

       Two years ago it would have been the complete opposite.   urlLink  OKCupid!  The Maid of Honor: Deliberate Gentle Love Master (DGLMf)      Appreciated for your kindness and envied for all your experience, you are The Maid of Honor.

You're careful, extra careful, because the last thing you want is to hurt anyone. Especially some poor boy whose only crime was liking you.      We've deduced you're fully capable of a dirty fling, but you do feel that post-coital attachment after hooking up. So, conscientious person that you are, you do your best to reserve physical affection for those you respect...so you can respect yourself.

       that my posts are dealing more and more with the stupid frivolous things I did over the weekend. The onset of the warm weather makes me shallow... I start to centre around partying, sitting on patios and getting a great tan. It's the season of the exterior.. outside in the world, outside of my body.  I don't do nearly as much contemplation as I do in winter. It's easier in winter, shut up in a house with only the TV and books.    Summer is all about being easy-going, lightening up on clothes and attitudes. More sunshine, less worry. Is it like that for everyone in this city? The grey clouds and snow disapear and we're suddenly left with similarly evaporating amounts of intellectual thought?   I will have to think up a good rant for tomorrow. Something that I can really fill my bra with. Okay, yes, I'm still obessesed with my boobs.    See?! Shallow, at best!

      Friday night seven of us went out to La Rouge on Adelaide. Some promoter guy came and got us off the street and let us into the club- no line, no cover. So far so good. $3 drinks... even better.  The crowd was totally shady, but as we set about getting drunk, it didn't matter so much. One of my friends hooked up with the cutest 19 year old guy on the planet. By the end of the night we were giggling drunkenly and yelling at her "GO KISS HIM!" Eventually, she caved.  After their oh-so-romatic dance floor spit swapping, she wiped her mouth and said, "You HAVE to clean that up.  You cannot have girls wiping their entire lower jaw after you kiss them." He says, "Sorry, can we try again?" She says, "No" and walks away.   By the way, what is it with being drunk and deciding that it's a good idea to walk places? I think we spent about 1/2 an hour wandering around to various condo buildings downtown and buzzing our friends, who were either alseep or had their fax machine hooked up. It's like summer hits and every thinks, "Great! We're not freezing our asses off! Lets make a nuisance of ourselves because we can do it without getting frost bite." One good thing is that it makes the cab ride home cheaper.  Some promoter guy took our pictures at the club and then gave us his card. I checked it out and realized that this was the same company that had taken some pictures of my friends and I on Valentine's and never posted them on the website. I was like, "Guy, you HAVE to do something about that website! It's soooo 1980! You guys never post pictures until 3 weeks later and there are spelling mistakes all over the place." He says, "Um yeah."  The next morning I check out his card and find out that he was the web developer. "How to win friends and influence people." by ME

        Oh the joys of hearing Omarosa's lies again. I love how trump said, "Omarosa, I'm surpirised! It's too bad. I got along with you really well." Yeah, and "The Donald" also got along with the former "Mrs. Trump", aka Ivana, "really well." Look what a crazy bitch she turned out to be. Just as well that Trumpy didn't hire one of the ladies. With his blind spot for women he would have been screwed.    Speaking of women, I wonder what his girlfriend is thinking. I don't care how much money that guy has, he's a fucking megalomaniac. I can imagine him arriving home in his helicopter and picking her up so that they can go to the Jessica Simpson concert.   Can you imagine what an instant prick he would turn into if she wasn't ready? She seems to spend the whole time running after him, following him like a gorgeous leggy dog. He shows no concern about her - he doesn't let her precede him into a room, he doesn't even check to see how she's making out, way back there with  the security and the hangers-on.     I realize that chivalry is old fashioned, what with feminism and all but Trump's girlfried is a lovely European type, and deserves a little consideration - at least, her tits deserve consideration. Either way, you'd think he'd behave like a gentleman instead of some kind of midget mob boss.    And what exactly, is it with Donald's ass? I swear to god, the man has ghetto booty. He looks to be in quite good shape otherwise.  I won't even touch on the hair - everyone know's it's atrocious and I have the distinct impression that his hair stylist is blind and has Parkinsons.    And Jimmy Kimmel said, "So, this guy gets to work for Donald Trump for a year. Every day, for a year. Is this really a prize?!"    Even though The Donald is a little grunt, you can't help but like the size of the balls on the guy. He's made up his own coat-of-arms for Christ's sake.  He names everything after himself. It's like he's worried he's going to forget what he owns.  "Is that building mine? Yes, yes it has my name on it. It must be mine. What about that helicopter? Oh, yes, there's my name again. And you, do you work for me? Yes, I can see TRUMP emblazoned on your soul. You are mine too."   It must get tired, having everyone always tell you what they think you want to hear, rather than the truth.  It's like he's on a constant first date with the world.

They used to be just "cute"... a sort of average size but now, now they're lucious, juicy, round, jiggly fun-bags. They're gorgeous. My bras have never looked better.    I still have to join a gym.

      the Romanian, the Slovak and the Turk are discussing the merits of various parts of animals. Apparently Lamb brian is delicious, seved cold on lettuce with lemon squeezed on it.  Chicken ass is delectable because of all the muscles that they use to squeeze out the eggs. Also, the neck is some of the most delicate meat you will ever taste.   Around new year's they used to sacrifice a pig and cook it. They've explained to me in detail exactly how they killed the pig, gutted it and hung it from a tripod to let the blood drain.  And so this finds me here, at my desk, choking down my chick peas, chicken breast and rice. Eugh.

      Saturday night I was at the bar with grilfriends and what to my wondering eyes should appear  but a fifty year old woman and a boy she called "dear" The boy was dressed in his best pimping suit and she, in all black, to hide her caboose.  The boy, we all know, was a GIGOLO.  She spent the night grinding and feeling his pecs He being molested and paid for each sec.  By two o'clock he had her up against a wall Where she was squealing at the delight of it all.  My girlfriends and I were howling with laughter after all, we knew what she was after.

      Favorite bar is still closed so we ended up at the alternative we haunt. Walked into a highschool reunion (GAH!), with all of my graduating class hanging out around the front door.  Was thankful to leave again.  Ate a lot of candy. A LOT.   Went for long walks. Played with Chihuahuas. Went glow in the dark bowling. Ate birthday cake. Painted my nails.  Mastered some minor espinoage skills. Put on a lot of makeup. Danced. Baked Cookies. Schmoozed.  Ate more candy. Drove fast. Teased cousin. Watched Mickelson win. Watched the Leafs win. Ate more Candy. Saw Hellboy ***.  Shopped. Went to a deli. Fed bunnies at the park.   I think that's it.

      Due to the change of my handle, my site is now receiving quite a few hits from those who are looking for porn. Kiddy porn. I've noticed a lot of : 1) Kids in panties 2) Pre-pubescents in panties.  Ew. Go away.  Oh good, on further checking of site meter I've also found, "Smelling sister's panties."   Go Away!

      Don't believe me? Tough beans.   urlLink I Have No Life : "Any hesitation I bore about this movie prior to seeing it did not stem from the plot which revolves around an eclectic group of individuals holed up in a shopping mall while the re-animated corpses of what once were the rest of humanity mill about outside just waiting for the opportunity to launch highly violent and toothy partisan attacks against anyone who happens to have the political affiliation of 'the living' (making this one of the strangest election year films on record)"  A sharp wit is a pleasure to behold.

      At some point two people decided to lie down in the entrance way to the apartment building. My brother went downstairs to investigate, saw his two friends on the floor and decided, "what the hell." So, he lay down beside them. I went down to check on him and found three people, lying on cold cement, giggling drunkenly.  Again, with the tequila.

       In case you didn't know, Mr. Gretzky has a restraunt downtown Toronto. It's expensive and not so good. I ended up paying close on $20 for a sandwich and a pop. If you're ever in Toronto, don't go eat at Wayne's. They serve Surf 'n Turf $26, but you don't get anything with it. If you want some potates or salad, add another $5. Ridiculous.

      Funny, seems like they now have a name for what it's like to be ME. No, wait, this could be any kid. It could be anyone at all who is reasonably intelligent and a little Obsessive Compulsive.  urlLink Asperger Syndrome Individuals with AS can exhibit a variety of characteristics and the disorder can range from mild to severe. Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of "improper parenting".  I think I could describe most of my blogging links as great candidates for this "syndrome" Perhaps now that we know we have a "condition" we can all get disability cheques from our respective governments.

      I am so switching. As soon as I comes available, I'm outta Hotmail - who are ass-crap-bastards.   urlLink Google Prepares Free E-Mail Service f you're still getting over the jolt of Microsoft's announcement that it will compete head-on with Google search later this year, then hold onto your hats, because it looks like the two technology giants are about to square off in the free Web e-mail space, too. Google chose April Fool's day to announce that it is offering a free Web e-mail service, Gmail, which should compete with Microsoft's market-leading Hotmail service. Google's service will differ from Microsoft's Hotmail in two key ways: Gmail will integrate some of Google's search functionality and will offer users a free gigabyte of storage—many times the two- and four-megabyte limits imposed by other free services. Another teeny-tiny kick in the ass for Microsoft, from me.

       Friday  - out with big little brother and 3 of his friends. Boys in top form - cracking disgusting jokes (anyone  ever heard of the chinese finger trap?) and getting slutty waitresses to sit on their laps.  Used to enjoy these sort of shenanigans but now am glad that I mostly hang out with the ladies. Smoked some weed - first time stoned in about 3 years. Felt nice, all over again.  Saturday  - girlfriend from out of town visitng. Hit Devil's Martini for some "cack in the back" (grinding) - had several offers but turned them all down. Girlfriend met sweet (so far!) guy. Met a lot of people who went to my Uni. who I never knew, even though we were there at the same time. No cack in the back. Late night (early morning) street meat.  Sunday  - watched movies, went for walk, ate Gelato twice. Made special recipe Mac 'n cheese from scratch. Ate a lot of  Mac 'n cheese. Cuddled with the pudding (cat). Generally enjoyed self. 'Cept the dishes. Ugh. Monday - forgot moring appt. Got there an hour late, feeling sheepish. Consequently am behind at work and no time to post anything proper today. Can't wait to go home and do some more cuddling with the aged pudding (cat).

      This summer I am going to conquer the "perfect" blog entry.  You know those entries that are intelligent and introspective without being self-centred? Those entries that have a clear point and actually use facts to back up their opinions. Yeah, those are the entries I want to write.  The problem is that I don't think that I have the necessary motivation to start writing like that. I read people like the  urlLink  Stumbling Tongue   and I'm already completely intimidated.   I've always liked writing but I'm obviously not up to the standards of many of more popular bloggers.   That leaves me with the horrible specter of mediocrity. If that's how it's going to be: just okay, then someone please cut the tendons in my fingers so that I cant't type any more.  Truly excellent writers make me wonder. How much effort goes into every entry? Are there hours of agonizing, checking the flow of ideas, making sure of facts and editing down to the last punctuation mark?  Are there consultations with friends and co-workers about how a certain word works in a sentence?   I doubt it. The best entries read smoothly, naturally. They scan effortlessly and you can follow the idea from the begining to the end of each sentence. It's like Venus coming out of the sea fully formed. It just  is.   I suppose if I put a lot more time and effort into it, I could become a better writer... but really, I just want to have a natural talent. The things I like the best are the things that I don't have to work for. I want my talent to be recognized, not my hard work.   I suppose I have that completely backwards, but considering that this whole entry is a big waste of your time, you'll just have to forgive me for these precious moments of your life that you will never have back.

      It's the documentary about the history and the impact of corporations on a global scale. Infinitely informative.   Pfizer, the company famous for many pharmaceuticals used by people the world over, demonstrated how they "give back" to the human race. The Vice President took us on a tour of a neighbourhood that had previously been dangerous. Although, the only testament we have to the danger of said community is that the VP was "almost" mugged there, once. I don't know what an "almost" mugging is... it must be when that thuggish, big, black fella on the stairs cuts his eyes at you.   The community's improvements included Pfizer subsidized housing, and two improvements to the subway station: new barriers that prevented gate jumping and an emergency intercom system.   I like that this is how Pfizer chooses to make this community so much safer. Obviously the main threats you have to worry about are those hooligans who will jump the gate instead of paying the $2 (or however much the subway costs there).   The intercom is a laudable imporvement, although, if there was acutally someone on the other end to respond, it would be much more effective.  The subsidized housing makes me wary. Firstly, I only saw three townhouses that had been spruced up. Second of all, the people who live there are now "owned" by Pfizer. There is no way that the housing is given pro bono. There is leverage here. What Pfizer partners or subsidies benefited from this renovation? Are the appliances General Electric? Did a large corporation get  the construction contract, rather than a local builder? Is the local corner store now required to sell Rolaids© (Pfizer) instead of Tums© (GlaxoSmithKline) out of "gratitude" to Pfizer for fixing them up so well?  Has crime in this area really decreased? The two ladies on the street that the VP waylaid seemed to be utterly uninformed as to the improvements, as well as the initial problems. Were the residents of this area given the choice as to the form that these improvements would take? Did they decide that an important factor in neighbourhood safety is having daunting subway gates that resemble doors on jail cells?  Why was the VP calling these folks neighbours? Why? Because the office isn't far off. And that, my friends is why this community can count themselves so "lucky". Although the heart is in the right place, the affaire is mismanaged in classic form. Perhaps I misspeak. Perhaps the heart isn't there at all. Maybe this isn't an exercise in altruism, but rather a small cog in Pfizer's PR campaign. What they would call a "win/win" situation. At least they're trying, sort of.  Go see "The Corporation." Make informed political decisions.

Candidate #4: Mohammed... judging by the lack of imagery on the 'net, he was one forgetable face. Nevermind the fact that his teachings have been interpreted to mean that women should cover themselves so that no skin shows. Is this to make them invisible, or to boost the cheap india cotton market?

      Large projects at work. No time for anything except working. Perhaps will write posts at home and bring in to publish. Perhaps not.  Weekend brief:  Friday - my younger brother got denied at a club downtown 'cause he's not 25 yrs. old. We went elsewhere.  Saturday - cooked roast turkey for 8 people. No leftovers. Success. LOTS of red wine. Bed by 10 p.m.  Sunday - rollerblading in the cemetary, which they tell me is not allowed. Biking, allowed. Walking, allowed. Biking, allowed. Jogging, allowed. Rollerblading, no. WTF?  Monday: 11 hours at work.  Tuesday: shaping up to be similar.  R.E. wrapped his hands around my waist this morning and I got upset. He said, "Don't overreact." I said, "I'm not, but don't touch me. I'm not yours."

       I have to say that he had my vote too. On the down side, his life will be subject to even more scrutiny from the media. I won't be surprised when some horrible story about him eating babies or running over grannies comes to light. No human being can survive that much attention without having people nosing around for something rotten.   I truly hope that the media never find anything negative to print about him, except what we already know. We know he's insecure and immature and a little crazy already. Hopefully that will be it.   Yesterday I published my 400th post. 400 turds, spread all over blogger. Sorry, kids.

       he took his keys out of his pocket. A little white paper drifted to the ground.  I was crying to hard to say anything to him about it. I watched his back while he walked and got into the car. I went back down to my apartment, realizing that he was sitting in the car, trying not to cry. I stopped and picked up the white paper. It was a candy wrapper from the restaurant. It said, "Thank you."    I thought to myself, "Yeah, thanks."

       Can't tell the difference, can you? If you were here, then you would know that everything is moving along much faster, my keyboard is quieter and I'm finally getting used to Windows XP - although the stupid losers at Microsoft are pissing me off no end - associating all my MP3s with Windows Media Player.    I also installed my tablet and that little warning, "This device has not been given the Windows logo certification and may cause the system to cease to function in the not-so-distant future" popped up. Pompous asses. I bet it costs a bundle for those poor bastards to get all their devices Windows certified and Microsoft is laughing all the way to the bank. If my Mum was installing something and that message showed, she would have stopped installing, called me and worried forever that she was permanently damaging her OS.    Microsoft might as well put that warning on everything, including their own goddamed programs. "Warning! You are installing Windows XP! This may cause your computer to be vulnerable to virus attacks through as yet undiscovered security holes. It doesn't acutally matter that we've put our little Windows logo sticker on it, it's still gonna be fucked in a couple weeks." Why the hell would anyone bother with getting their shit certified if Microsoft can't make their system reliable and safe to begin with?  By the way, my boobs are still out-of-this-fucking-world.

      I went to one of the nicer spa/salons in my hometown last weekend and had a manicure. While I was sitting at the table, the girl sloughing gritty scrub all over my hands, I realized that the modern day spa is the equivalent to the ancient harem. The women chatter and gossip, the men are only present in the conversation and we spend the whole time beautifying ourselves, screened off from the real world.   I can only imagine what kind of papmered hell it must have been to be a wife or concubine to a man with many others like me. The atmosphere at the spa made me nervous... that many women together, tongues all lashing, no restrictions due to inappropriate audiences. The romantic picture of the exotic woman, draped on her divan while attendants hover with treats was foremost in my mind.   It's like there was an undercurrent of tension running through the place. The chatter was pleasant, civil, charming but as a woman you realize that under all that there is a significant amount of buried emotion, a subtext that is never referenced, words that are never said but exist between the women none the less. It's a aura of secrets kept, promises broken and thinly veiled barbarism.    All of the treatments are designed to be relaxing, sensual and comforting. Instead the atmosphere full of switch blades and concealed fangs made me extremely happy to leave. My hands are soft, my nails are beautiful and I won't ever go back again. I'd rather fill a tub at home and spend an hour to myself, scrubbing and moisturizing without the worry of constant scrutiny.

      This weekend was both debauched and relaxing. In that order.  Spent Friday night yelling with everyone over the loud live band at the Beer Market on the Esplanade. Good times, lots of drinks and hence a lot of relaxing to be done on Saturday.    Saturday got up early, had a manicure and headed up to the lake, where it was quiet, peaceful and my best-friend's mom stuffed me full of candy and steak. The perfect hangover cure.   Saturday night was at this cool next joint called "the campfire" where they serve "smoke" and "strange night noises" if you are lucky you can also aquire some "hot dogs on a stick". No really, it was beautiful watching the stars come out.    Sunday was more about relaxing, shopping in town, eating more candy and eventually getting back to Toronto to watch the Survivor Finale which was good, as far as Survivor goes. I like Rob better with the mustach. Sue's "re-working" was... well, I didn't recognize her breasts.   Home by 12:30 a.m. to crawl out of bed, crashing from the sugar to sit here at work and wonder at the new and imporved Blogger.

      In summer the owners like to take us out for lunch. They're also taking us to the theater in June.  They don't worry about keeping track of everyone, knowing that we'll show up eventually and work our requisite time without needing Hourly Hitler breathing down our necks. They let us learn new skills and expand our experiences in quiet times. We have close relationships at the office and there is little to no politics. Ordering a new monitor for everyone is not a huge undertaking. We have NO security on the server because there's nothing that the non-existant HR department should keep seperate from the non-existant marketing people.  I  am the HR and Marketing department. I talked them into summer hours this year.  That's something to put on a resume. "Chief supporter of summer hours policies."

I'm done with being angry, I'm done with being sad and I'm now into that doleful acceptance stage.     R.E. came to my desk today and said that he didn't want there to be any hard feelings and that he would like to be friends.  He's decided that I didn't just break up with him over our recent fight, but that I wasn't, "comfortable with the relationship at all."  Perhaps he's right, but his rudeness and disregard were definitely what put me over the top.    On the plus side, I had Dim Sum for the first time today. What deliciousness! Except, now I'm going to spend the rest of the afternoon reeking like fried dumplings. Maybe I'll catch me a new man. Not so much.

      I called R.E. last night at 10:30 and talking was like pulling teeth.  I let him know that I won't accept rudeness, or disrespect and he said, "Yeah? Good to know" and  started to laugh.   I said, "Good bye R.E."  He said, "Pardon?"  I said, "Good. Bye." and hung up.    So much for that.

      but the swelling has gone down now.   My house move this weekend went as smoothly as these things can go when you call U-haul 12 hours before hand and they tell you that they don't have a truck for you.  The location where I had the truck booked ( 2 months ago) had been closed and my order had obviously been lost in the shuffle. U-haul never called me to tell me anything. 6p.m. the night before I'm supposed to move, on the worst moving weekend of the year, I have no truck.   Thank God for fathers. Dad found me a utility van about 30 km away that he went and picked up for me, and drove for the day.     U-haul also fucked over my brother - he was moving from Ottawa to Toronto. He called to confirm and they told him that he could have whatever he wanted, so long as it wasn't a truck. Eventually he and his friends found a rental that had to be returned to Ottawa by Monday. 6 hours each way. Plus paying for extra mileage.  Seeing as my brother and all of his friends have just graduated from Law School I think it would be fair to say that they are going to try and shove a stick up U-haul's ass. Sideways.  In small claims court.    Other than the truck snafu the move was flawless. My friends all showed, the weather was warm and sunny and the apartment is too cute for words.  I never want to look at another cardboard box again.    Now I just need some trouble to get into.... then I can bring him over to my crib and take full advantage of living alone.

       urlLink New York Daily News  Good to know that the Republicans are doing their share to keep the U.S. economy running smoothly.    "With thousands of Republicans set to invade the city this summer, high-priced escorts and strippers are preparing for one grand old party." I bet G.W. met Laura in this means. Okay, well, maybe not. But the two Bush misses... they could definitely make some large coin off of it. That'd be great. The Johns would be happy to know that they're keeping it all in the party and the Misses would be able to afford their champagne for the rest of the summer. What say you Bush girls? Up for a little "slap and tickle" from some of Daddy's friends?  Of course, the sex trade booms during any convention. I wonder whether they look forward to times when all the Trekies congregate. Do they put up the prices for sex with a Klingon? What about Jean Luc Picard? Hummers for free for the captain? Riker probably likes them 3 at a time, pig that he is. He's not number 2 for nothing.

      I held out on the relationship talk for about 4 days. Not too bad.    I say, "You really know how to spoil a girl," and he says, "Only the special ones." That means  I'm special!    He looks forward to seeing me, rather than behaving like it's a dent in his plans.   When he's drunk he tells me, "I'm falling in love with you."   We wake up in the morning and he says, "Good morning, Gorgeous." I know this is a fib, but it's a nice fib.   He never says, "don't" to me, about anything.   He always wants to take care of me.   He is appreciative.   He pours me glasses of wine.   I say that I'd like to give him some money for gas and he says, "None of that nonsense."   He doesn't annoy me, FOR REAL.   He's completly open with me, about everything.   He's shorter than me but doesn't care if I wear heels.   He's told everyone about me.   I know, and like his family.   He calls when he says he will.   We have great conversations.   I put Chinese food on a plate for him and he says, "You're fantastic."   He's fit.   He's smart (but not didactic).   He makes it easy to be with him.  I can tell him everything.   He doesn't get upset and swear at the cat (like I do) when she starts to cry at 4 a.m. for no apparent reason.   He cuddles me to sleep  He will drive 1½ hr each way to come and see me, twice a week.   He tells his guy friends that he likes me, a lot.    As you can see, the honeymoon phase is still in full power. I enjoy this part of a relationship, but worry about the surreal feeling that comes with it. Nothing, but nothing, is this perfect for more than a couple months. I still want to know what he's like when he's angry... it's a moment of truth when you have your first quarrel. Only then will you know whether the relationship can survive rough waters.

      I swear to God the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) drivers live to play head games. I don't know how many times a day someone will get onto my street car and ask, "Does this go to King and River?" and the TCC driver will answer, "Well, that depends." Most often I get, "I might, just for you." Which I don't know how to take. Is that sarcasm, or are we really going to get me to work?  What's so hard about saying yes or no? I also often hear TTC drivers say things like, 'Well, just get on, and we'll get you where you are going." The poor bewildered person is let on, none the wiser for having asked their question, equally doomed to repeat it the next time they are trying to somewhere.

      We've hired on someone new at the office. Lets call him "Pilsbury." Pilsbury is round and jiggly, just like the name suggests. He is strange, having a penchant for making obscure and altogether much too convincing Simpsons references one after the other. I asked him for some information and he came over to my desk, bowed with his hands together and put on a British drawl, "You called, my lady?"   Someone asked him a question and he gave a devious reply, followed immediately by an obiously practiced, 'Muahahahahah!" that echoed accross the office and had me cringing in embarassment.   I hope he's only behaving this way because he's nervous and trying to settle in, not because he's always like this. I don't think I've heard a normally pronounced sentence out of his mouth, yet. There have been immitation animal noises, and about 8 different personalities so far. God help us all.  Oh yeah, and he was asking where to buy lunch around here but he said,"I kinda know the area, my stereo pimp is around here." I bet his stereo pimp wears glasses and has adult acne.    urlLink    This is Pilsbury. I suppose I should mention that he seems to be a nice guy - under it all.

      Weekend Wrap up: due to the non-relationshippy content I'm enforcing the weekend wrap up will be factual and un-adorned. Makes for easy reading.   Friday:  Dinner out with the G.Boy at the only 5-star restaurant in Ontario. Two bottles of Veuve Cliquot to start. Luck out because the restraunt gives us the meal free, due to a connection. Figure the tab would have been around $1400, for four of us. 8 courses, different wines with each, caviar, cappucino and port to finish. In the mix: Lobster, red snapper, bone marrow beignee, two kinds of fois gras, tomato basil turreen, chocolate ganache, and french cheeses. Fan-bleeding-tastic. Wear cashmere - finally a good excuse to pull it out!   Saturday:  Up to Niagara wine region with the G.boy to attend a deck party facing out onto the lake. Blissful sunshine, great friends, home to sleep 12.5 hrs after that.   Sunday:  To Hamilton to watch the G.Boy play rugby. More sunshine, very sunburnt, happy 'cause rugby is my favorite sport. Met some great girls, made new friends. Sunday eve, back home with the G.Boy to re-watch Bowling for Columbine.  Obviously didn't make it to the Pride Parade on Sunday afternoon - but one of my co-workers did. She said that it was a fantastic time.  Write up in the paper says that the parade is so mainstream now, it's realtively family fare. See lots of shots of families lining the sidewalks. Glad to see that Toronto is so accepting and diverse.

      Monday we are having a federal election. In Canada (for those of you who don't know) there are 5 major parties.  1. The Liberals - equivalent to U.S. democrats, but a little bit more leftward leaning. They've been rocked by scandals over the past few months and the general public is leery of them. They SHOULD win the election. They are the party that most reflects what "Canada" is.  2. The Conservatives (Republicans): have mentioned privatizing health care, only to back off. Want to give tax breaks and buy Canada three Air Craft Carriers. Against abortion rights. Are idiots. Will make us the fifty first state (sorry, but if I wanted to live in the US, I would).   3. New Democratic Party (NDP): as far left as Canada goes. This is our socialist choice. Pro-welfare, pro-affordable housing for the poor, pro-federal day care, pro-strong environmental conservation. A lot of lovely ideas but leaves me wondering whether it will be me and many other middle income families who would be paying for these services.  4. Partie Quebecois: a seperatist French movement, popular only in Quebec and some french-speaking parts of Manitoba. Want to make themselves into a new country. Other wise they are willing to partner up with whoever loses the election to make life hell for the winners.  5. The Green Party: on first glimpse, a good choice. Not many people are aware that other than their radical environmental stand, they are extremely conservative. Against immigration, against women's rights - this party could set us back about 50 years.  I'm going to vote Liberal - even though they've been in power for 8 years already. They seem best equipped to deal with the upcoming four years. Even though they've wasted a lot of the taxpayer's money, I'd rather it was them, than Stephen Harper and the Conservatives taking away my choice as a woman, and giving tax breaks to big corporations who are raping our earth.

      I've been reading the  urlLink retail blog . The retail blog is funny and good. The retail blog is not full of silly, self-serving whingeing about boys malarky.  I am declaring this blog a "relationship free" zone for the next 5 days. Five whole days. No talking about boys. I might save some things as Draft, but that would be cheating.  So, let me get this out of my system: Mister S., Golden Boy, Match Man blah blah blah, likes me, likes me not, me likes, me likes not... etc etc.  That being said...  I just recently realized how incredibly noisy my bed is.  It makes the dogs upstairs whine. VERY LOUD BED. If I can hear the phone coversations of the neighbours, can they hear my bed squeaking? Do they think that I am having too much sex recently? Would they like to strangle me like I want to strangle them every time they come outside to play with their trash cans by my window at 5 a.m.?   Can anyone fix it for me?

      A  urlLink few posts ago , I think I mentioned that the Noxious Neighbour Mother next door was SCREAMING down the phone at someone, using the worst potty mouth language I've ever heard. This went on for 20 minutes.  I was talking to the kids upstairs and I found out the rest of the story.   There was screaming, because Noxious Mother and Noxious Father had been to the Casino and gambled away their son's (I didn't even know he existed) tuition.   I told you they were a**holes.

      Mister S. the man from last summer who was too busy to call me back because of his Ultimate Frisbee practice... has struck again.  I was lying in bed with the Golden Boy on Friday night - around 1 a.m. My cell phone rings and a sense of dread settles in my stomach (why the HELL didn't I turn that thing OFF?!). It's Mister S., drunk, talking shit and trying to get me to come over to his house. Christ. As if that would EVER happen. This is so embarrasing. The Golden Boy is listening to the conversation with interest.   I tell Mister S that if he wants to call me to "see how I'm doing" he should do it at a more appropriate time. In fact, he should not EVER call me again. He gets upset at being shot down, I get upset because I don't want the Golden Boy to worry that anything is going on between us. In the end, Mister S. yells down the phone, "Is this because I honked at another girl while you were in the car?!" The Golden Boy's eyes open wide. I reply, "YES! Among other things!!" and hang up.  Why can't he leave me alone? I've told him I'm not interested!  3:30 a.m. and the phone rings again - still haven't turned it off (stupid, stupid, stupid). I see that it's Mister S. AGAIN. I answer the phone, "What, exactly, is it that you want?" He's calling to tell me that he got mugged. For real. At first I'm dubious. This could easily be a ploy to get me to come running to his house and "console" him. He's still trashed and contradicting himself. I hardly know what to think. I can't be really mean, in case he has been mugged, but I don't trust him enough to believe him fully. The Golden Boy nods off with his head on my shoulder while I try to calm Mister S. down.   Out of all of his friends, family, and the police, he chose to call me. This alone makes the situation suspect. I'm hardly his closest confindante. In fact, I'd just told him to piss off.

      I was off work yesterday with a minor cold, therefore no email access. The weekend was relaxing (thank god) and I got to hang out with the people who live in the upstairs part of my house. It was Joe's birthday and he had a little shin dig and invited little 'ole me to join.   Joe is this gorgeous, skinny, brown-eyed, gay man. He has tons of cute gay boy friends. They were all hanging out in the backyard and playing with the dogs. I have never seen anything so sweet. Sometimes I wish that straight boys could be just a little bit gay.   They were the nicest, most polite group of friends I've ever met. They all made sure that we were introduced, said, "Pleased to meet you" and made every effort to include me in the conversation. It was lovely.  The Golden Boy was over on Friday night. He had a home game (rugby) on the Saturday morning. He was embarrased, but he asked anyway, "Usually the night before a home game, I sleep with the ball in the bed." Oh lord. It was okay, the ball was clean. Say after me," I slept in a bed with a hottie and a rugby ball." Weird. But Cute.

      More like, my pudding (cat) hath murdered sleep.  Something is seriously wrong. She set up howling last night at about 4 a.m. For an hour, I could not get her to lie down, sit still or even purr. She didn't want me to touch her (unusual). She just cried. And cried and cried. To the vet's tomorrow.  Maybe she knew that I had been near some of her arch rivals.  I was walking down Queen St. (yet again, to go and sit on a patio) and I passed by several homeless people, begging for money. Nothing new. The last guy I passed was Willard. His name probably isn't Willard, but if you remember the movie, you'll know why I call him that. He had 6 large rats lined up on each of his arms. He was busy talking to them.  One of the rats climbed up towards his neck and he swiftly picked it up, put it on his knee, bonked it on the nose and said something like, "Yes, you're being bad, aren't you?"  Being a seasoned big city person, you come to expect strange sights on the streets. This guy shocked me out of my complacency. I even crossed the street to avoid him - something I NEVER do. Just seeing all those hairless pink tails made me nervous. Ugh.

      is that you can sit on a patio downtown, guzzle beer, oogle men and women and not feel even the slightest guilt. Summers in Toronto are all too short and we like to make the most of them.   Last Saturday my (big) little brother and I sat at the "Black Bull" on Queen W. and watched the scantily clad world go by. We played the "real tatas/fake tatas" game for a while and then started with "stripper/not a stripper." Little brother was happy to check out boobs and I was happy to note that most of the fake boobs looked bad, and the nipples of the fake boobs had stretched to the size of pancakes. Thank goodness I'm still pleased with my all natural jigglies.   Monday night was also spent sitting on a patio, with my other brother. I was drinking Tom Collins. This time we played the, "heckle the extras" game.  Russel Crowe is shooting a movie across the street and the extras kept going in and out of the building on their smoke breaks.  It's a period piece, around 1930's called 'Cinderella man'. I think it's about a boxer. Anyway, the extras would walk by and someone on the patio would yell, "Extra extra! Read all about it!" It was so easy to make fun of them. We're out enjoying the fantastic sunshine and warm air and they're bundled in wool suits with slicked back hair and shiny dress shoes.   In fact, there are a ton of stars in town right now. Vin Diesel is here, J Lo, Beyonce, Nick Cage, Ben Afflec, John Leguizamo, Ja Rule... Of course, we, the common people, never see hide nor hair of the beautiful people.  We just know that there's a movie and we can't get anywhere near those tempting directors chairs. My brother saw Ron Howard from a distance a couple weeks ago. That's about it.

      The upshot of the neighbours tearing up the walkway is that there was a thunderstorm on Sunday night. The water that would usually run off the cement walkway between the two houses, seeped into the ground instead.  Monday morning, I step out of bed into a large puddle. My entire appartment was swimming. My carpets were large sponges, the cat looked upset about her wet paws and my jeans, that had been draped over a chair, were suctioning water up the legs slowly. The puddles just reached my CPU on the floor, but didn't actually touch it.   I spent the next hour unplugging everything electrical, calling the landlord and sponging the floor dry, as best as possible. Oh, an CURSING THE NOXIOUS NEIGHBOURS.   In the end, no grave damage, just damp carpets and a horrible musty smell.   The landlord has fixed the blocked eaves-troughs, and the neighbours have finally re-paved.  I hope to god it never happens again.

      Just listen to the rhythm of my heart... -The Darkness.  I also believe in a thing called hate. Listen to the rhythm of my twitching hands. They're yearning to wrap themselves around the neighbours' necks and choke them into silent civility.   When I got home from work on Friday night the neighbours (whose lawn and walkway I am not permitted to set toe on) had plopped their three recycling bins, three garbage cans and four random overflowing buckets on MY FRONT LAWN. They were in the process of tearing up their walkway so that it could be re-finished. According to the people who live upstairs, a jackhammer had been going all day - the neighbours had given us no notice, whatsoever. The girl who lives upstairs works nights/sleeps days. She looked like someone had screwed in her eyes backwards.  I was the last one home and once I got there I found out that the people upstairs had already called the landlord, and the landlord had promised to send the Noxious Neighbours a letter. Fine.  I'm staring at this garbage shit all over my lawn and thinking... the Golden Boy is coming over tonite and this is what he will be greeted with. Nice.  As I'm doing my dishes there is a knock at the door. It is the Noxious Drunken Father Neighbour. His white shirt is unbuttoned to his navel and his bloated white chest is showing its straggly hair. He's holding a gin and tonic in one hand and gesturing at me with the other. His white sport socks are pulled up to his knees underneath his shorts.  He says, "Now, I don't want you to be upset, so come on outside and take a look at this with me." I follow him up the stairs to the area in question. He starts in, "You're gonna be real happy once this is done. It's gonna look so nice!" Me: "But, you're garbage is all over my front lawn. I have friends coming over tonite." Him: "Yeah well, shit happens, y'know?" Me: "You could at least have warned us. The house was shaking all day, pictures could have fallen off the wall... You should have at least left us a note about when the work will start and when it will end. You should have given us some notice." Him: "You know when I decided? This morning! Just like that (snaps his fingers)... there was a break in the flow and I decided what the hell! Let's do it." Me: "Well, that's great for you, but you need to take other people into consideration next time. Get it?" Him: "Okaaaaaaaaaaaay," and then his two little shit dogs start barking at me.  I turn around and head back to my little cellar, proud of myself for saying anything at all. Usually I'm such a chicken shit. After it all, I wonder what he meant when he said that I would love it when it was done? Why would I love  their  walkway? What the fuck does it have to do with me?

      Friday night with the Golden Boy was a total go. He arrived, we drank a glass of wine, got a movie, sliced some old cheese, drank more wine and eventually I was feeding him strawberries with my fingers. Delicious. In every way.   I can tell that he's still testing the waters. He's behaving in a most agreable manner - polite to a fault, considerate and extremely chivalrous. Having an interesting conversation with someone who refuses to disagree with you is imposible. I really really love all the attention and the nice behaviour, I hope it continues. BUT I'm anxious for him to come out of his shell a bit more, I want to know everything he really thinks, esspecially when he disagrees with me.   I asked him some of the "hot topic" questions du jour, such as, "How do you feel about same sex marriages" hoping that he's not an ignorant bigot. He's not, so far. He said, "Why not, if it makes people happy?" Good. Same sort tolerant response for religion, aethiests, abortion... I think his politics are in line with mine (just left of the middle) but I haven't found anything that he's really passionate about yet. I want to know what makes him angry...  I know about the things he loves, wine, rugby, conversation, kisses, strawberries, cars and friends, but I won't feel entirely intimate with him until I know what he can't tolerate. I don't think there'll be to much that he is against... he's a little wild and on more than one occasion has been, "that naked guy" at the party.   Once we get more comfortable with each other, I'll try and find out his dislikes. Not including lying, cheating, etc. etc. Nobody likes those things. The UNIQUE things he dislikes.

      I'm surpirsed, it didn't turn out totally mangled. In fact, I quite like it. As far as hair-do's that look like they were executed with hedge trimmers go.  It's been an eventful weekend. More on that to come.

      I'm a happy little bunny, because it's Friday, I only have two hours of work left and tonite I'm getting together with the Golden Boy (Fof) unexpectedly. YES! Drinking of red wine and snuggling on my couch. That's all I want out of tonite. Alright, maybe a kiss too. But mostly the snuggling.

      Is this normal? After having called the Golden Boy (Fof) and asking him on a date, we organized that next Wednesday would be the big day. He's coming to my house after work, changing clothes, we'll have some wine before dinner... It's all good.  Like most women, therefore, I don't expect to hear from him again until, Tuesday, maybe even Wednesday itself. Wrong.  Sweet, charming, lovely, golden boy Fof has called me every night since then. We've been having two hour converstions. I'm a bit freaked out. I'm starting to worry that he's just calling me because he thinks I want it, or that he's calling 'cause he's bored... well, quite frankly I can't figure out why he's calling so much. Twice a day, every day. I don't really mind it, we have a lot of "getting-to-know-you" to do. On the other hand, it's a bit strange. I'm going to take the line that he's just really into me, and really happy that we are finally going to go on a date.  This time last year I went to his birthday party. His parents were there, my Dad was there... Fof asked me to stay down there for the weekend. Not in a dirty "I want to get laid" way. In a "I'd like to sit on the sail boat and look at the  stars with you" way. Anyway, I made my Dad take me home because I didn't want him to think of me as a daughter who just wanders off to spend weekends with cute guys on sailboats. Especially since both the Golden Boy and I were drunk.   After that I thought about him a lot but never got his number and never called him. And now here we are, all set for some lovely good times. Wish me luck.

      Let me start this off on the right note: my neighbours SUCK ASS. They are the most inconsiderate, ignorant, hypocritical, middle class, vulgar people I've come across.  When I first moved into my apartment (which is the basement of a house), I found a note on my door about when garbage day was, and that they wanted to make sure I put my garbage out so that they didn't have to deal with  rodents .   Next thing I knew, they'd stolen my broom, parked in our parking space and told me that I should make sure that I don't ever walk on their walkway.  There's Mom, Dad, Slut/daughter and two pekinese dogs. Mom is about 250 lbs. and wears crop tops when she's out walking the dogs. I came home one night and she was screaming down the phone at one of her relatives, "If you FUCKING THINKING I'M FUCKING GOING TO DO THAT YOU ARE FUCKING INSANE!" and so on, for about 20 minutes. I hear her yelling at the hubby all the time.  The daughter keeps bringing different guys home from the bar. I'll be in bed asleep when I hear their front door open and she'll be giggling and letting in some dude. I can see their feet as they stand on the front stoop. It's never the same guy's feet. I passed the daughter on the side walk once, she was with a group of friends. I heard her say, "Can we stop at the bank-y?" and then, "Bank-y! I hate people who talk like that!" What?!  The Dad has placed the family's recycling bins just outside my bedroom window. Every morning at 6 a.m. when he leaves for work, he dumps last night's recycling in the plastic bin. It scares the shit out of me every time. Then it's 6 a.m., I'm crabby and I want to go outside and remind him that I am trying to SLEEP a couple of feet away from where he just threw down 12 tin cans. Remind, as in, punch in the face.  The pekinese dogs are yappy and spoiled.  Once the Mom was leaving the house and I heard her yell to the daughter, "Lauren! Make sure they eat their dinner!" How many dogs do you know who have trouble EATING? Not many? Right.  All in all, I hate the bastards and would gladly piss on their doorstep if I thought I could get away with it.

      Help. I'm under attack from the happy monster. No really, please. help. me. I can't take it. Okay, I can.  Life is pretty sweet right now. It's not perfect - but then I never expect it to be.  It's just as good as it can be. I've got a good job, a cute apartment, a loving pudding (cat), a great family, a cheque from Mum in the mail, sunshine/summer, a date next week that will be luscious, the office to myself, a blossoming blog (thanks for the motivation Bill), 16 bottles of wine, a busy social life and a rewarding television schedule (none at all!).  The only thing that could possibly make this better is having someone to share my perma-smile with. I don't believe in that "you complete me" crap. Love and relationships are things that you should only enter as a whole person. It's hard enough keeping yourself together, but when you are partially responsible for someone else's happiness, you had better know what you're about. I don't want someone to complete me, and I don't want to complete someone else. I'm a complete puzzle, no pieces missing.  The key to love is not just LOVE itself, but entering into it with the right attitude. So often people seem to lose themselves in their partner. You can no longer distinguish between Joe and Susie. They turn into Joe'nSusie. No matter how similar people are, there should always be a sense of individuality. This is the connection of two people, not a synthesis into one person.   Also, if you're heartbroken, lost, depressed, or otherwise "unwhole" - you have no right to tell someone you love them.  Until you figure out if you really LOVE them, or whether you just love that they fill a hole in your life, keep your mouth shut.   One last thing: don't ever say, "I didn't do anything wrong, I don't owe you an apology. I have my pride." If you've upset someone you love, you should care enough to at least apologize for hurting them. They should do the same for you.

      Sarah has said it perfectly. It's been a long time since I've had a proper boyfriend and all of a sudden men become BEAUTIFUL. Even those small town boys in their souped up 1985 Mustangs and the t-shirts with the sleeves ripped off. They're BE-oo-tiful. And manly.   urlLink tales of ordinary madness : "one of the main reasons i refrain from going out too much is cause i end up meeting men who interest me. and if they interest me, then i may like them. and if i like them, i'll fall for them. and if i do fall for them, i'd ruin my relationship with mr. right. once my relationship is ruined, i will discover that the interesting men/man are/is not interesting anymore. they are ordinary. dull. boring. and then i'll lament about what a great thing i had with mr. right and how i ruined it all. all this is unavoidable if i go out because my loneliness colors my view - and every man looks like a great catch. so usually, its just safer to lock myself, with my hormones, at home.

      Three cheers for me kids! I asked the "friend of the family" (Fof from now on) out for dinner in Toronto and he accepted! I've had a crush on this guy since I was 10 yrs. old. He's only about 5 yrs. older than me, but when you're ten, it makes a big difference.   It took me a lot of back/forthing before I decided to take the plunge. His parents and my Dad are really close and there's the possibility of nasty reprecussions if anything goes horribly wrong. On the other hand, I've had a crush on him since I was 10.  Seeing him at work at the Vineyard last weekend was the end of my self control. Nothing is more attractive than a man confidently going about his business, happy in his chosen profession, handing me glasses of red wine.   He called me sweetie at the end of the conversation.  Woohoo!

       Clip #1:  Sprawled in the backseat of the sports car, sunshine beating down on me, red wine bliss seeping into every bone in my body. The beautiful Southern Ontario scenery blurring by. Dad and brother up in the front seat talking shit at each other. Brother pauses, "Look! An emu!" Dad looks at him, "Don't you mean, 'look! A llama?'" Indeed, it is a llama.   Clip #2:  At the grand opening of the winery. Dad and I contemplating which case of wine to buy. The wine master (friend of the family) overhears us. He says, "Like fuck, you're buying anything!" We roll away from the winery with $800 worth of free wine.   Clip #3:  My older brother's graduation from law school. He has the highest overall average out of the whole graduating class over ther four years. Fuck, when did he get so smart? I tear up a bit while he stands on stage and they read out his awards and accomplishments.   Clip #4:  Sunday moring, after swearing off wine for at least two days... champagne and orange juice for breakfast. Five glasses of it. Rest of Sunday spent in a bit of a haze.   Clip #5:  The disgusting former step-mother is present. She has lost her figure and has celulite all over her arms. SCORE!

      I just realized how many things about R.E. make me absolutely crazy. When I was lovin' him, I was willing to take all the weirdness - the way he taps his fingers on the wall while he's walking down the corridor, the constant need for a tooth pick after every meal, the quiet burping that happens EVERY TIME he has a cold drink, the squirrelly way he is about how packages are sent out of the office, the fact that he HATES it if people sit on his bed in their outside clothes (he only has one piece of furniture in his apartment - it's his bed).   The guy is full of annoying habits. But, because I was "lovin' it" I was willing to overlook every one of these small dementias (sp., I know). Now, I'd like to tell him to shove it up his ass sideways.  "Don't put dots on my graph!", "Don't put that tape on there, it is ugly!", "Don't kiss that dirty animal!"   That "animal" is the pudding (cat) and I will kiss her as much as I like.  Besides, if she has dirt on her, it's dirt that I've created, in my own apartment - she doesn't go outside.   "You cannot send that envelope to that man, he will see the other address underneath!"  No, he won't R.E. 'cause I'm going to put a big 'ole PUROLATOR way bill over top of it. Get out of my face, get out of my space and quit trying to tell me how to do my job.   On the other hand, it makes me wonder how annoying I am. What little quirks do I have that make me intolerable to other people? Should I be more aware of them or am I just hyper sensitive today because the menstrual monster is in the hiz-zouse?  So, I'm cynical - everyone is fucking full of neurotic behaviour and I'm awe-struck because I thought I was willing to put up with  his  particular habits. Love is a weird and twisted thing.

      I'm blogging furtively at work.  As usual. I'm supposed to be proofing and re-writing a massive 45 page report, but I'd rathing poke my eyes with pins. Boiler systems are difficult to make interesting.  I went on a date last night and it was so-so. Actually, it gets a thumbs down. The guy was funny, kinda cute and pretty on the ball. Except, we went to this Thai restraunt, way out of downtown... it was pretty empty, just us and a table of three. The food was quite good, yummy crisp wontons and cold rice wraps.  At the end of the meal, the guy pulls out a coupon.   A coupon!   On a first date, I ask you! I know how to pick the good ones, eh?   We left it that I would call hime the next time I wanted to go out. I don't think I'll be calling. I'm looking for someone who does not use a coupon on a $20 meal (he drank water). I offered to help with the tab, but he refused. MEN.  Tonite I'm going to see Shrek II. I hope it's as good as they say it is.

      I suppose I could write a post about almost anything. The picture above my desk. The dream about being in jail. How busy I am. How different the subway is at night, compared to rush hour. The question is, what do I want to write about that you, my fair reader, would be interested in?  Surely the painting above my desk is lovely... but a picture would solve the problem of how to describe it.  Surley my dream about being locked in jail was strange - but most dreams are.   How about the subway?  People walk slower at night, there's more couples and the trains are more empty. There's less of a rushed feeling and more a relaxed, tired feeling. I went north for two extra stops because I wasn't paying attention and found the most beautiful station. The walls were covered in tiny mosaic tiles with depictions of huge leaves and blooming flowers. It must date back to the 50's or 60's as nowadays things are all clean, clear and colourless. The newest station in Toronto has a mosaic of it's own, but the colours are muted and it resembles a paint by numbers creation. In fact, it's a photograph that has been pixelated and then transfered to the wall, each tile representing a pixel. I prefer the freeform flowers and plants.   The couples on the subway in the morning are all dressed in suits and they talk amongst themselves very seriously. The couples in the evening sit on each other's laps and giggle a lot more. There are no kids or teenagers in the morning. At night, you can listen to about 12 different songs blasting from headphones while the kids yell at each other over the squeal of the metal wheels.   There are a lot more shopping bags, small pets and children at night. There are a lot more brief cases, newspapers and small purses in the morning. There's always spilled coffee on the floor.

      Don't start thinking that she's a wild party animal who drives too fast - it's the opposite. She never, ever seems to be just plain old happy and healthy.  She would have been perfect in the 1800's. A delicate woman, always fainting at the sign of any excitement.  I don't know if she's just susceptible to viruses and bacteria, or if she, as an organism, is not healthy. Maybe she's just incredibly accident prone.  Some cases to illustrate my point:     We joined the gym.  She started working out in old running shoes. We ran for maybe, 5 minutes a day, at first. Withing two weeks she had a stress fracture in her foot. The next month she waded around with a strap on cast.   She tripped on the street last week and scrapped up her ankle and bruised her hip. She spent the next week visitng chiropractors because she felt nauseaus every time she sat up. She was so upset that she also screwed up her stomach and almost had to go to the hospital.   Her boyfriend stepped on her foot and her toe nail fell off.   She got elbowed by mistake at the bar and spent the rest of the night bent over in agony. We had to leave within half an hour.    She wore uncomfortable shoes to the bar one night and spent the next three days in slippers because of the agony of her feet.    She cannot drink brown pop, but she can drink any colourless pop.    She cannot eat salad - it gives her "gall" attacks.   Going outside at all, activates her asthma.   Unsing kleenex when she's got a cold makes her sneeze more. She is allergic to it.   We walked for half an hour over the May long weekend and her hip joint hurt her for the rest of the day.   Orange juice and Tomatoes give her hives   She is afraid of driving, of elevators and escalators, of the subway and of homeless people.   She will not go outside without all of her makeup on.   What the hell is going on with this girl?  I don't want to think the worst of her, but some of this has to be in her head. The pain might be real, but there has to be some subconcious need for attention, or pampering that makes her react so badly to so many things. I don't think that I can ever name a time when she was just "normal". Mind you, her family is riddled with health problems and they are all constantly self medicating. Maybe  normal  to her is having something  wrong .    Either way, it made for three very long days with her - while it rained outside. Cooking for her is a nightmare - no garlic, no onions, no vegetables with seeds in them, no orange juice, distilled water only, no spices...   I love her to death. She is my support system and she is always there for me when it counts. We usually have an effortless friendship, finding each other in the same frame of mind most of the time.  Last weekend I couldn't wait to get rid of her. Her boyfriend came to pick her up from my house and I was SO happy to let him take her home to deal with all the issues.   We've been friends for over three years now, and in that time, none of her neuroses have improved. I find myself wondering if they ever will. I find myself, for the first time, in a crisis regarding our friendship. Can I be best friends with someone who seems not to grow? Who has no sense of adventure? Who never wants to try new things? Is it enough that we care about each other? How do I avoid growing out of this friendship? I don't want to. I do care about her, a lot, but I'm afriad that my frustration will show through - and consequently hurt her. She is so fragile...

      I get back from buying some office supplies and R.E. accosts me.  "I want to talk to you." Me: "Okay" Him: "Now!" Me: "Okay, already."  At which point we wander down the corridor whispering heatedly about how he hasn't been talking to me and I think it would be best if he was at least civil.   10 minutes later he's still telling me that he has to get over loving me and that it's hard for him etc.  etc.   I tell him that we would not have worked out anyway, so there is no point in mooning over me. I say that we are too different, he, too squirrely, me too irresponsible and lackadaisical (sp?). Add to that his criticisms and it would have crashed and burned, either way you look at it. He says he never meant to criticize me, he said "these things out of love", he was trying to take care of me. I tell him that that's alright, for children, but I'm 25 and can take care of myself. If I don't take care of myself, that's my choice too. I tell him that I'm convinced that we wouldn't be good together and I think that he's got himself convinced otherwise. Him: "Don't tell me that I'm falling in love like an idiot." Meaning that he's blind to the reality of the situation. I look at him. All of his friends told him NOT to marry his ex-wife, but he did. She came to Canada and started sleeping with another man, while she was living with him. This went on for six months. If that marriage wasn't a blind/bad choice, then I don't know what is.   Still he tells me that he was only half a man when we were together... he knows that he is someone different but he has to "jump over" his problems before he can be in a relationship. I counter, "then why the hell did you start anything with me?!"   On and on, in whispers, in the hall.  Eventually he says, "I do not have any problem with you, that is the point here." Me:"Okay, fine, do what you have to do."   Thank god we're not together - this is ridiculous. I don't know what the hell he's mooning over, although it's easy for me to say because I'm the one who had no problem moving on, and now I'm very happy with the Golden Boy. I don't know what it's like to be the one left behind, but perhaps I should try and be more empathetic towards R.E. and not give him such a hard time.

      The Golden Boy recently said that he would like to have a shirt with French Cuffs. You know, the kind of dress shirt that requires beautiful manly cuff links.   Cherie, I beg to differ.  I happen to have a lovely white stretchy dress shirt, that I wore for the first time today. It is not itsy bitsy or teeny weeny, it is tailored and stylish and each cuff has a pair of cuff link type holes, done up with two buttons tied together.   In a foolish attempt to preserve the pristine condition of my beautiful, new, white blouse, I rolled up my sleeve at lunch today. This involved undoing the lovely cuff-link type cuffs.  It is time to go home and I would like to look as little like the sectretly slobby, messy person that I really am. I want to do up my cuffs again.  Subsequently, I have spent that past 20 minutes fiddling, nay, flailing in a "where's those padded walls that are so dear?" sort of manner while I try and slot a button through two layers of material at a 180° to the hand that must do the slotting. Or slutting, however you'd like to say it.  It is time to go home and I would like to look as little like the sectretly slobby, messy person that I really am. I want to do up my cuffs again.  Either way, it is now t-minus 6 mintues until home time and I am still unable to do up my own clothing. Does this mean that I must ask Pilsbury, with the horrible laugh track and the sausage fingers, to aid me in dressing myself? Does this mean that I will be denied boarding of the street car while the passengers stare on in shock at my deshabille? Does this mean that I am slowly losing my motor skills and 12 hours from now will have to type all of my posts with my nose?  No, it doesn't. It just means that I will only ever wear this shirt again when I am certain that I will not be eating, painting or participating in any other rolling of the shirt sleeves activity. Unless of course, the Golden boy is there to help me do them up again. A situation which he might take advantage of by buttoning my wrists together and then UN-buttoning every other button he can find. I suppose I wouldn't be totally against that. As long as we weren't at work with everyone looking on.   As it is... everyone is now looking on while my arms seem to have taken on mystical bendy powers and my wrists writhe in heretofore unmentionable manners. I think I've got the sleeves pulled so far down that my bra straps are showing.   I still can't get the damned things done up. At least I don't have  urlLink cabbage in my bra.

      9 a.m. is too early to be climbing out my bedroom window because the roof has come down so low over my cellar door that I cannot open it.  The rain and the humidity has swollen the wood ceiling outside my door and now it sags well below the top of the lintel. I would have been stuck, if I'd had a screen in my window. Other than that, the mushrooms are coming along a-cropper.   Oh, and the neighbours like to use their hose to power spray any stray dirt off of their walkway and down my stairs, into the area in front of my door.  It's like a tidal deposit, every day. Bastards.

      It's not educational, or pretty, in fact, if you are queasy at all, I wouldn't recommend it. But the whole idea, it's fabulous.   urlLink Nicole : "Mine started very early. I didn't know what was happening to me. Such matters were never discussed in our house. My skin started coming away from my chest. By the second day, I could slip my hand completely beneath it. My breasts were still tiny, but I was already sloughing. It was in September, at the beginning of the school year. The weather was extremely hot, but I hid myself in a roll-neck sweater. When my thighs began to peel as well, all around my nearly hairless sex, I concealed them in a pair of jeans. But then my hands started. At my school desk, I peeled off entire stretches of my skin until I bled, pulling them as far as possible so as to get it over with. I spent hours rolling them up in my fingers. I no longer listened to the teacher. I had not time for anything else. What scared me was the thought that my face might start sloughing too. I was so ignorant. I watched my female teachers and wondered: are they sloughing right now like me? Are we all the same? In the end, it was my sister who gave me the necessary practical advice. Then, after a few days, the sloughing stopped quite naturally."  I was quite mystified until I figured out the extended metaphor and now !BING! the light was on and we start on our journey to dark humour-ville.

      First of all I should tell you I was only a sorority girl for a week. After that, you have to pay money. Oh, and they have to want you. Which they didn't. I didn't mind.  During my first week of University - before classes - also known as FROSH week, I "rushed" - that is, tried out for - two of the sororities available on campus.   I went to the initial meeting for the first one (Sorority GD) where they introduce themselves, talk about the sorority, tell you what it's like to be involved etc. Now DG girls have a sorority house, where lots of DGs live. In this house there were to be no: 1. Drinking 2. Overnight guests 3. Drops in grades 4. Illegal substances This was the first and only meeting I went to for Sorority DG. I'm not going to pay $600 a term so that I cannot do things. It's just not going to happen.  I went to the initial meeting for the second one (Sorority AO) and they did allow drinking and boys and well, not so much the illegal substances, but I was willing to  overlook that.  Evidently, AO would serve my purposes. I was only a sorority girl for one week, but in that time I used every moment to my social advantage.  I suppose I should let it be known that it was not ever my intention to join either of these sororities. My primary motivation for "rushing" was to meet Frat Boys. You see, sorority sisters were almost always invited to Frat events, esspecially during rush.   I went to two wine and cheeses, two keggers, and a mixer. My best friend and I both met frat boys and both short lived relationships (if you could call them that) ended badly. But - for that first week on I knew not only the Frosh, but 2nd and 3rd years, guys and girls.  I never looked back.

      There were some strange conversations during the weekend. As you can see, below.   I'm going to spank you like a bad, bad donkey.  Did you smell your cut? The inside of your body smells like dog's breath.  He slapped me on the ass, grabbed a handful of tit and promptly fell asleep.  We saw Dink's dink.  I love you like I love cooked meat.  Maybe if we grease it up a little? Well, good luck with that hemorrhoid.  I cut myself while I was cutting open cuttlery

      R.E. called me last night and once I answered the phone he gave me some lame excuse and hung up again. It was odd. This morning I get an email about how he realized that for the first time in 8 months he had to tell me who it was calling and he felt like I didn't want to talk to him. He says he's happy for me in my relationship and that he hopes that we can continue to be friends.  My response: Ah! A misunderstanding!! I'm sorry...    I should have explained to you. My cell phone does not work very well in my apartment, so I have to answer a call and quickly put the phone on my window sill and then press a button to put you on speakerphone before I can hear anything at all. So, I didn't hear you say hello, and when I finally did hear you speak it was quiet and I couldn't tell who it was.    I do not mind when you call - just don't assume that I don't want to speak to you because my cell phone is messed up and I didn't hear you say hello! If you think that I don't want to talk to you, why didn't you just ask me what was bothering me, instead of thinking the worst thing and getting into a panic about nothing?   Yes, I am very happy with my boyfriend. Yes, he is a native English speaker and we suit each other very well. Things are going great, but it's a little too early to tell if he's Mr. Right!! That takes time.    I have not kept you away this month anymore than other months. We just reverted back to our working relationship. In the end, I do not think that we would have been compatible. Our personalities are very different and what originally made me attractive to you would eventually have made you crazy, and the same goes for me. I'm much more relaxed and you are much more serious. In the end this would have cause a great deal of strife.    In answer to our relationship, I will not be totally comfortable while you still have feelings for me. Perhaps in time when these have gone, then we will be able to continue as proper friends.    All the best, ~Frilly I feel like I was a little mean, at the same time, I need him to understand where I'm coming from, seeing as he's not BLOODY LIKELY TO ASK!!!

       Sunday  I woke up at about 11 a.m. Deliciously refreshed and happily in the arms of Golden Boy. We watch the final stage of the Tour de Lance, I mean, France and head into  urlLink Niagara on the Lake  for brunch with two other couples. Niagara on the Lake is twee, kitsch, cutesy, overblown, and pretentious. Lunch hamburgers cost $18. We have Mimosas to help dull the pain of the locale.   Sunday afternoon: napping. thankyougod.  Sunday evening: To friends' new condo. 8 of us. We eat steak and spinach salad. We start a game of  urlLink Trivial Pursuit (the Pop Culture edition) . There is a lot of red wine involved and a lot of smack talk from the pathetic losers' team (aka "the Boys"). The beautiful, cultured and decorous team (aka "The Ladies") wins said game. I get smarter the more wine I drink. Smack talk comes back to bite the men in the ass. More red wine is consumed and I am stuck in St. Catharines for the night, due to the unforeseen event of a double bottle of  urlLink  Wolfblass Yellow Label, 2002 . My favorite wine.   Monday morning:  5 a.m. I get up and get in the car and drive 1.5 hrs. back to Toronto. I sleep (sorta) until my alarm goes off, at which point I fall into a deep sleep and wake up the very moment I should be walking in the door at work.  Hasty shower and quick car drive later: I'm sucking back water and eating a bagel. Please god let this day be a quiet one at the office.

      Weekend wrap up - of course.   Saturday : I drive to Ottawa and back. Grandma (who is pretty cool) is going up there for a week to play bridge. She needs someone to drive her up. That someone is me.   Time taken to reach Ottawa from Toronto: 5 hrs. (1/2 tank of gas consummed) Time taken to reach Toronto from Ottawa: 3.5 hrs. (full tank of gas consummed) Approximate difference in speed according to said presence of G'ma: about 50 km/h (that's 30 miles an hour for you Americans). That's right. 105 km/h on the way there. 150 km/h on the way home.   While I was in Ottawa I picked up my Lawyerly brother, who had been visiting his girlfriend and carted his ass back to Toronto with me. We chat in the car about relationships, the vagaries of women and men, our strange non-family.  Saturday night after spending 8.5 hours in the car and being tired beyond belief my two brothers and I (the lawyer and the engineer and me) head down to the Beaches Jazz festival to meet up with my Dad and his girlfriend. Jazz festival ROCKS. Leave said festival at 11 p.m. nearly ready to cry with tiredness and subsequently:... are you ready for it?... Drive another hour down to Niagara Falls.  Where I meet up with the Golden Boy and some of his mates at a bar... and have a few drinks and a lot of laughs, since they've been drinking since 5 p.m. and it's now 12 midnight.   1:30 a.m. The Golden Boy and I finally leave the bar. We get back to his place 1/2 hr. later and I fall asleep fully clothed.

      I have a crap phone that I got free from  urlLink Rogers  (my cell phone company) when I signed up for their service package. I've had nothing but problems with this phone and nothing but problems with Rogers. The original phone was faulty, and instead of just replacing it for me they gave me two choices. urlLink    1. I could pay $25 a week to have a temporary phone while they fixed mine.  2. I could pay a "convenience fee" of $10 in order to have my non-functioning phone replaced on the spot.   Call me crazy, but if a company sells you a phone that doesn't work... shouldn't they just replace it? Shouldn't there be groveling and whining and apologies? In any case, there was no such thing and ended up paying the "convenience fee" - after having driven around most of Toronto to find a Rogers store that still had it in stock. Convenient? I don't think so.  My contract with Rogers is almost up, and after another couple of customer service cock-ups in which I was on hold for at least 10 minutes each time... I'm ready to find a new service provider and get the hell out of there.   urlLink   Enter lovely  urlLink Fido . They offer a flat rate plan - unlimited calling all month, no time constraints for $45. This is the first of it's kind in Canada and I was excited, let me tell you. I don't have a land line at home, so my cell phone is my life line outside of work. Plus, I'm not home much.  Last night I bought this beautiful Sony phone. I signed up for the beautiful flat rate plan. I took my beautiful phone home and charged the beautiful 6 hours of talking battery. I set up my beautiful phone.  ^&($%#)*%*!!@&$*!!  I have no reception in my house.  The ancient, ugly, problem ridden phone that I got for free from Rogers works better in my house than the beautiful new phone.   This sunny afternoon I will have to go back to the store, return my beautiful phone, find another phone that has better reception and try again. If I still have nothing in my house, then I will be forced to stay with Rogers.  Please God, do not make me stay with Rogers.

      This morning R.E. came to my desk and said, "You're glowing! Why are you glowing?" This is his passive agressive attempt at discovering if I'm sleeping with the Golden Boy. He thinks that women "glow" if they are sexually active/satisfied. I'm fed up with this game already. "I'm glowing? Yeah? Well, isn't that nice?" He says, "You're blushing. You're a little bit red." I look at him coldly. "Mmmm, yes, possibly."  10 minutes later he's back. "Is he good?" I'm shocked. "EXCUSE ME?"   That's right R.E. God hates you.  R.E. "You heard me." Me: "Is it any of your business?!" R.E. "No, well, at least, is he good to you?" Me: "Yes, I'm very happy." Him: "God is against me."  That's right R.E. God is totally against you. He hates you. How about you take some responsibility for your own situation? YOU need to sort yourself out. NOT GOD. I can't stand that kind of attitude. If you really want something, you should be capable of taking matters into your own hands, doing what needs to be done and striving for that goal.   As for me, I'm glad that things with him are over. The bi-polar ups and downs, the pessimism the totally anal habits. We would NEVER have worked out. Nevermind the fact that "God is against him." And last, but not least, I'm incredibly happy with the Golden Boy, and thankful that we're together.

      I've been quiet about my personal life at work recently, because I don't want things between R.E. and I to get weird. This morning there was a rip in the space time continuum and I told him I have a boyfriend.  He was trying to trick me. My phone was ringing, and I wasn't at my desk. I asked him to pick it up and went back to concentrating on what I was doing. When I was done, I asked him who had called. He said, "Some guy." Alrighty.  I call the lovely, gorgeous Golden Boy and ask him if he called me. No, no he hadn't.   Right back to R.E. "Who called me?!" Him:"That guy." Me:"What guy?" Him: "You know, that guy." I'm getting fed up at this point and I just want my phone message. So, "I just called my  BOYFRIEND  and no, he didn't call me." R.E. starts to laugh, "Well, as long as it wasn't your  boyfriend , then it doesn't matter."  I still don't know who really did call me and now I'm ticked at the immaturity of R.E.  If he really wanted to know, he could have just asked me but his ego seems to be to fragile for even that. I was trying to be tactful, but if he's going to behave like an idiot... well then, he gets what he deserves.  Now we're cranking the  urlLink Bloodhound Gang  and I've suggested that R.E. takes a close listen at "Lift your head up high."  Cause life is a game that no one wins But you deserve a head-start the way your life's goin' So throw in the towel 'cause your life ain't shit No take that towel and hang yourself with it Life's short and hard like a body-building elf So save the planet and kill yourself If you're feelin' down-and-out with what your life is all about Lift your head up high and blow your brains out  Not that I'm being malicious in any way.    Update: I tried translating this page on  urlLink Babelfish  and quite frankly, it's very good. Here's the result of the first paragraph:   J'ai été silencieux au sujet de ma vie personnelle au travail récemment, parce que je ne veux pas que les choses entre R.E. et I deviennent étrange. Ce matin il y avait une déchirure dans le continuum de temps de l'espace et je lui ai dit que j'ai un petit ami.  Much better than what  urlLink free translation  offers.

      You know the  urlLink one.  Not only is she supremely cute (pretty, beautiful, whatever you want to call it), she's reasonably intelligent and has interesting things to say.   Her site surely receives a lot of hits because of the title and the oh-so-teasingly coy picture of her in all her cute-ness, but I daresay that people stay on to read what she has to say.  Her site meter has just clicked up past 200,000 visitors... maybe I should change the title of my blog to something like, "Hot Canadian Chick". Oh wait, that would be a lie.   Ha.

      Every body say "Hi Golden Boy!" - admittedly, he hasn't visited yet.  I lay awake for an hour worrying about my decision to let him read this site. I've decided that I'm going to continue writing here just like I would if he wasn't reading it. Hopefully he will understand that.   I am feeling incredibly exposed, but at the same time, it's liberating to know that I can share this with him. He knows that I spend a lot of time on this site and that it's an important part of my self expression. Now it's not shut away from him.   I must say, I think he was just curious, more than anything. Is that the case, darling?  Anyway, welcome to the site, I don't take any responsibility for what you think of me when you're done reading it. You asked for it.

      He knows it exists and he's curious about it. He wonders why I would be upset if he found it. I've tried to explain to him how exposed I am here. I've also tried to explain that this blog doesn't really represent me. Sometimes I'm just blowing off steam and I say things that I would never really mean. E.g. hoping that the neighbours are dead.     Can you help me out here? What can I tell him to really seal the case? I understand that he should just respect my wishes and not look - and he probably will. I would just feel more comfortable if I could give him a proper reason WHY. Otherwise, I will clean up the site, take down some posts and let him read it.      Update - I'm going to let him read it.

      Grocery shopping should be the benchmark to which I hold all of my boyfriends. If we can get along at the local food store, then everything should be alright.    I should have known that things with R.E. wouldn't work out. He kept just leaving the cart and wandering off. Who does that?!    I should have known that things between R.E. and I wouldn't work out. He kept just leaving the cart and wandering off. Everybody knows that you can't just leave your cart in the middle of an aisle and run to get something. It's just not done. An overzealous (not likely) minimum wage clerk might think that the cart has been abandonned, and start to put your groceries away. Also, even though R.E. didn't have a car, he took full advantage of my presence to buy a lot of heavy items, because then there would be two of us to carry them. Natually, he overestimated my carrying power. And he used the backpack.      Walking the ten minutes back to his appartment was agony, wil the plastic handles insicing their wrinkles into my red, sore hands. I'm not usually a wuss, but I think that grocery bags are perhaps the worst engineering things in creation. They are made specifically for carrying things, but they are painful to hold.      The Black hole and I would grocery shop and he would disapear and return to me later, with his arms laden. In the mean time he'd had conversations with several of the stores employees, applied for a job and smoked a joint with the meat packing guy. He'd also bring back strange items like bottled lemon juice (two), stickers and a comb. It's like a giant metaphor for our relationship. I sat at home and loved him and was good. He galivanted around, made new girl "friends", came back when he wanted and expected me to accept it all with good grace.      The shopping with the Golden Boy last night was beautiful. He enjoys wandering arond the store as much as I do. He's patient, not pushy or controlling, helpful, and asks me if I like things. He's sweet and patient and we work well together as a team. It was a stress free, domestic exercise and it was lovely. Life with the Golden Boy is going to be great.

      Eventually I'm going to have skinning buttons so that you can choose the colours you want. For now, I'm going to change it as often as   I want . Is that alright with you? By the way, I get my pattern files for the backgrounds etc from:  urlLink Squid Fingers . You will go into eyegasms. I swear.

      who are into S&M, being tied up, using toys, flogging, leather, lubes and potions, food, animals, orgies, dildoes, piercings and porno... those people CANNOT have ever had a Bladder Infection. Because, once you've had one, you never want one again. And all of these things mentioned above, create an excellent opportunity for re-infection. Fantasy is fun, but it's not worth sitting on the toilet trying to pee all night.

       The Golden Boy is taking me to a wine function this weekend and we will be staying over night in a little country hotel. Hence: shopping for lingerie last night.   There is something to be said for lingerie stores. All the pretty colours, the soft fabrics, the essence of the feminine wafting through the air.   In the end I went over board, got two sets of proper "lingerie", two tank tops, and three new pairs of brazilian undies, pictured at left.   He came over last night, crawled into bed with me, took one look at the undies... and well... I think he likes them. ;)

      I was sitting in the loo (where all truly good thinking happens) when I realized that all this ranting about my neighbours and the worry that they cause me must be having negative effects. I've had to deal with these people for two and a half months and I've been make indignant and angry much more often than usual.   Perhaps I am dealing with this situation in the worst possible way? Perhaps I should take a Zen-like approach and attempt to let these people live out their miserable, horrid, angry lives - without getting upset myself. Is the answer to just "chill"?   I think that I'm exposing myself to too much bad karma when I insist on getting so worked up about all of  their  problems. On the other hand, I can't help how upset I get when someone sprays me with a hose. There is no reason why I should have to put up with that kind of thing. How do I stick up for myself without getting caught up in all the negativity?

      Another possible problem with the lack of concrete action against the far/right.   urlLink A Fundamental Understanding :One of the important things I learned as a cops-and-courts reporter lo these many years ago was something about crime victims: That they often make themselves vulnerable to violent crimes because they are not prepared to deal with people who are sociopathic, or who exhibit antisocial or narcissistic personality disorders, or in some cases outright psychoses. That they project their own normalcy onto these other people -- they really cannot believe that someone else would act in a way substantially different from their own decent, sane base of operations.

      "Get the fuck out of my face you fucking idiot! I've been trying to move that goddam truck for two fucking hours! Get the fuck off my property! I'd love to kick your fucking ass! You fucking idiot!"  "I'd love to kick your fucking ass! You fucking idiot!"  That's right, the Nasty Neighbour father flipped out last night.   Some poor man knocked on Nasty's front door and said (ver timidly), "I would advise you to move your truck."  I think it was about to be towed and the guy just wanted Nasty Father to know about it.  The above quote was what he got for his troubles. Nasty Father was screaming this at the top of his lungs while advancing menacingly on the poor man. The man's face was a picture of utter shock.  Not only do I hate my neighbours, but now I'm a little scared of them too. If he ever threatened to "kick my ass" I would be on the phone to the cops  so fast.   No diagram, sorry.  ;)

      Two more  urlLink reasons  why I adore the Golden boy.  1. He got up this morning just to drive me to work, even though I don't mind taking the subway and he was plainly tired. 2. He went back to my house and did my dishes before he showered and went home.  I think I l*** him.

      I had to call off a date one night because I was in the middle of having strong Russian women impale me with blunt knitting needles, right in that there groin area. Cramps, people, I had horrendous cramps.   Anyway, I had to call the guy and tell him that, "Listen, I'm just not feeling so hot right now. I've taken some pain killers and they're not really doing anything. All I'm capable of is sleeping, today. Can we re-book for another time?"  Him, "Is this, er... cyclical?"   Isn't that a nice way to put it?

       Friday night:  With the Golden Boy. To Ikea to fritter away money on things like drawer organizers and cool wrapping paper. Sprayed by hose wielding bitch. Out to dinner at a little French resau. called Lolo. Fantastic food. Gelato. Bed. Sleep.   Saturday:  Sex count = 3x in 12 hours. BIG SMILEY FACE. Golden Boy goes home. Spent afternoon cleaning the appt. Girlfriend from out of town arrives and we catch up for a bit, then strap on the roller blades and spend the next two hours sweating and swearing at hills. Late dinner, bad food. Gelato. Rented "Big Fish" - would have liked it more if I was fully awake.   Sunday:  B-fast with out-of-town-girlfriend. Home to tidy and nap. Golden boy arrives, head out for dinner with my family. He and Dad drink a lot of wine. I don't mind a bit. Dinner goes extremely well. Bed. Sleep.

          Friday night the goddamned bitch 300 pound "lady" of the house sprayed me and the Golden Boy with the hose. ON PURPOSE. She was out watering her plants when he and I arrived home. I have included a diagram for your edification. You can't tell me she wasn't aiming for us. 'Course, she denied it.  Any helpful hints on how I can get them back without them knowing it's me?  I've already canvassed some friends and so far the best idea has been to salt their lawn.   Later that night I was leaving the house with the Golden Boy to go and get some Gelato when I spotted one of the dogs on our lawn. I looked at their door, it was shut tight. The dog was squatting, taking a dump. Even though I hate them deeply, I would hate to see an innocent animal lost or hurt, so I figure I'm going to have to take the dog to their place and ring the doorbell. Ugh.  As I turn around to look down the street, I notice that the Dad is leaning against one of the cars parked on the street,   watching his fucking yappy dog take a dump on our lawn.  After which he said, "Are you done Fido? Good, lets go." and they went back in their house.  This means war.

      I'm certainly going to try.  Take care of yourselves, your loved ones, your pets and pet peeves. Hug your children, computers and anything else that makes you happy. Take some time for yourself, for others and for doing nothing. Listing to some loud music and then when the headache starts, put on something peaceful. Read a good book without thinking about it too much. Rent a great movie and a stupid/funny movie. Eat some Gelato.   How's that for unsolicited advice?

      Dear  urlLink Matt ,  I have the feeling that you are one of those nice guys, who, right up to this very moment, has been unlucky in love. From some of the comments you've made, you've nudged me in the direction of a certain opinion. Now, this opinion may be completely wrong, and if that is the case, I apologize. I am going to write you this open letter because I have come across so many nice men, who seem to be forever lost in unrequited love. I will also be speaking on the behalf of women in general, which is taking a liberty that I hope women the world over will forgive me for.   Matt, (and all nice men out there) please understand me. WOMEN LOVE NICE MEN. We really do. What we cannot cope with is men who, after two weeks, are ready to lay down their lives for us. We cannot deal with the sappy look you get in your eyes, if it's on the first date. It's really sweet that you like us that much, but it makes us worry.   Yes, be nice, but also show your individuality. Show us that you have opinions of your own and will contradict us if you don't agree. If a girl treats you badly, for God's sake: GET ANGRY with her. Yes, women in general need to be treated gently, but the minute she becomes self-serving and ceases to give you the same amount of consideration you are giving her - then my friend, it is time to grow a spine and tell her that it's not okay with you.  Until you are capable of confronting these women you care for, you will find yourself locked in a battle that you cannot win. Don't make excuses for us. Don't smile and say, "It's okay, you tore my heart out, but I'll be fine." Playing the martyr will only let you in for pity... not the respect that you want.   Women find men who are  confident  sexy. Know who you are, what you will accept (or not) and be willing to speak up if she crosses your boundaries. DO NOT let her walk on you. Love her, by all means, but don't love her so much that you put yourself last. Women can sense this in a man and until you shape up, they will continue to manipulate/use/deceive you.   Matt, I love your kindness, your goodwill, your sense of romance. I would love to hear that you are happy with some charming girl who loves you to bits. Just don't let your heart melt your spine. There is such a thing as TOO nice.  All the best in love and life,  Frilly

      I ran into one of my old University friends "J" in the Subway last night. We talked about everything, our jobs, our lives, our significant others. Our friends. It's nice to catch up with someone from the past, someone who was part of a group that I spent a lot of time with, but is now scattered all over North America. It turns out, it's a small world. I mentioned that I was having a great time with the Golden Boy and that things were going really well.  My friend says, "Can you believe  urlLink Mister S .?" Me: What about him? J: Well, I never would have believed it, but he's had a serious girlfriend for like, 8 or 9 months. Me: *laughing* Yeah right! J: No, I'm serious. He's in Cuba with her for two weeks, right now. Me: What? J:?? Me: Then why is he calling me  to go on dates? And by the way, did he really  urlLink get mugged ? J: Yes, he got mugged. What do you mean calling you? Me: Never mind, I'll let you discuss that with him. I'm sure he'll tell you his version of the story.   For those of you who don't know, Mister S. and I go back about a year. I wanted to be his girlfriend, he wasn't interested. This summer he called me and wanted to try again. It didn't work out.   I got off the subway laughing. That  urlLink cock sucking Mister S.  had a girlfriend! I had to go through the whole process of accepting a date from him, putting time aside, and then telling him it wasn't going to work.   Mister S. had fought me tooth and nail when I told him that I didn't think we were compatible. I had to go into my reasons and I was so careful not to be accusatory, to try and take care of his feelings, to use "I" statements such as, "I don't like the way I feel when you honk at other girls while I'm in the car with you." All that time he was with someone. What a fucker. That poor, poor "girlfriend".  I am pleased to say that I was the one who told him I wasn't interested. I was the one who was honest and said that I was indeed going on other dates (he must have been quite careful to hide his current relationship) and I was the one who treated his feelings with respect.  I'm half angy, half amused. What a slimy idiot.

      That's it. He's (the Golden Boy) used the "L" word. We've only been dating for three weeks. Admittedly, we already knew each other but not in the context of a relationship. How can he be so ready to use such a powerful word?  Love, to me, is about permanence... not the bliss you feel during the first few weeks of a relationship. The bliss is a sneaky emotion, tricking people into thinking that everything will be alright. It's when the bliss receedes and I look at my partner objectively, and I still feel the same way, THEN I feel like I can use the word LOVE.I think I tried to explain this to him at the time, but didn't do a very good job.   On the other hand, the happiness I feel when we're together, sipping wine on a patio, snuggled on the couch, walking down the street... it demands to be expressed. I "love" what I'm feeling, I "love" how he makes me feel. It makes me want to talk about love, certainly. As a disclaimer, I CAN see myself loving him, I adore him already but just need more time to cement my emotions.  "...it's not yet all of him I love. It's what we're going through."  The fact that he's said, "love" now adds pressure to this situation. He's not intending it that way, but now that I know he loves me, I have to realize that there may be a "broken heart" involved if something goes wrong. I would just like to think that we are caught up in something beautiful, but still keeping our rational minds. The fact that he's willing to be irrational and emotional makes me a wee bit nervous.   Maybe I'm just being too uptight. Maybe I should choose the romantic path and follow him and my heart to happy oblivion. The problem is that I've chosen the oblivion before and it doesn't seem to turn out too well. I don't think it's ever safe to let myself get too caught up in things. I need the reassurance of clear, COLD thinking. I can't help but feel that a relationship founded on common sense stands more chance than the romatic swirl of a love affaire.   There's always the chance that the love affaire will work out to something long term and this is what I'm going to hope for. I'm going to hope that I can follow him down the path of bliss and emotion and come out the other side even happier than I thought possible.   God help me.      Update. Alright. I love him. Hopelessly, giddily in love. Absolutely madly happy. Sickeningly smitten.

        "If you've decided to reject the gift of forgiveness and you die in your sins, there is no hope for you. There is no purgatory. The wrath of God abides on you and you will spend eternity in Hell."   Maybe if  urlLink he  was doing some more horrible acting he wouldn't be so wrapped up in  urlLink sucking God's dick.    I cannot believe that there are people out there who actually feel this way. What kind of life do they lead? How do they feel about coming into contact with the damned every day? Do they forbid their kids from watching Scooby Doo because it's demonic? Do they refuse to watch Shrek 2 because of the "ugly sister" bar tender?    urlLink Here  is what hell is supposed to be like.   If heaven and hell do exist then I have valet parking in hell.

      I think I've got about 5 of them. If you'd like one, let me know - I'll send you the invite.  I've already offered them to friends and family but of course, they are all frightened of the idea of new email interface and would rather stick with their crappy hotmail or yahoo account.   Get with the program I says to them!  I told the Golden Boy that I have a website, but that it's private (sorta!) and have asked him not to look for it. I also warned him that I used pseudonyms for everyone so it wouldn't be too easy to find. Although, if he was smart enough to google the Four Seasons hotel he would probably discover my post about that fantastic meal we had. Anyway his response was: "I won't look for it. I wouldn't even know how to go about it anyway."   I felt silly 'splaining to him that I have a " urlLink internet study buddy " who I only know through his blog(s). The Golden boy seems to have taken it in stride, accepting that I am a cyber kind of girl and that I enjoy the internet, computers and all things technologically related. I never said that I was cool. I'm a geek, and I know it.

      The weekend wrap up:  Friday: spent with the Golden Boy enjoying patios and shopping (these patios are getting to be a nasty habit) and then dinner out at an Italian restau. where he is going to bring his wine for the owner to sample, and possibly stock.  Saturday: down to Waterloo for visits with the BestFriend. More patio sitting, a football game, drinks and appetizers at friends.   Sunday: Shopping, brow wax, home, dishes, vacuum, BORING!  All in all, relaxing in the extreme. I was hoping for a little drunken craziness, but seeing as the favourite bar in Waterloo is closed, the BestFriend was not up for partying anywhere else.   Last night the cat (delicious pudding) had another one of her seisures/strokes. They're getting more frequent. Vet had nothing to say, "It's old age." Which makes sense. She's almost 16 now.

       "Turkish law currently allows sharp reductions in prison sentences for rapists who agree to marry their victims"  urlLink Herald Sun  No wonder the Turkish Engineer in our office left there and came here. She must have had such a different life there.   I love how the men get REDUCED sentences for marrying their victims. This poses several problems:  1. The poor girl is married to her rapist.  2. Even if the girl is remotely happy about being married to her rapist (which I highly doubt): her husband is in jail anyway.  What the fuck is going on here? At least they're trying to legislate the loop-hole closed. I love the Dad's comment at the end. Goes to show the mind set of the parents.  Stole the link off  urlLink Matt.

      I've been blogging semi-actively for two years. Tomorrow will be the second anniversary of my first post. Looking back on everything I've written, I'm amazed at what I've been through, but also amazed at how little of my real life makes it into the blog. There are some  urlLink gaping holes  that I could have filled with volumes.   I skipped almost my entire life as a Retail Manager - a time that I would like to erase forever from my memory.    I don't think I've ever blogged about my Dad's heart attack, or how lucky I feel every day I have him around.   I've never spoken about that one really great boyfriend I had in Uni. who treated me like gold and gave me a benchmark for all the other poor guys to meet.  I've written only two posts about my best friend, who is a huge part of my life. Same goes for a lot of other people.   I haven't said, "Kack in the back" nearly enough.   On the other hand, I've given my uninformed opinion on many topics, ranted about men and women more than is healthy and found irony in many things that others wouldn't.   Have I ever mentioned that they support us having naps at work?  I have met some great "internet" friends - even though I have to be careful about not saying, "Oh yeah, I know  urlLink someone  in Dubai." Perhaps I would be better to say, "I read articles by someone who lives in Dubai and she paints an interesting picture of life there." Because I don't really KNOW Sarah - I assume that her blog is missing large pieces of her, just like mine is. I don't know many people's real names, I don't know what any of you look like, except a couple. Can I really claim to "know" you?   Ah well, two years of verbiage.  I wanted to pull a monumental post out of my ass for this occasion. But not so much, eh?

      The Golden boy was driving me to work this morning and we pulled out behind a nice Porche (Carrera 4, 9-11 if you care).   "Guys that ugly shouldn't be allowed to drive Porches."   The Golden Boy has a thing for Porches, having owned a couple, and he can't wait to get another one. He speeds up to get a good look at the car and the driver, while making grasping motions with his hands. I say, "That lady is going to think you're waving at her." As we pull up beside, he looks over and says, "Lady, eh?" Not so much. It's a guy with long hair. Brown hair.  Golden Boy says quietly: "Guys that ugly shouldn't be allowed to drive Porches." Just then the ugly guy with the long-ish brown hair pauses in his phone conversation and looks over at us.  The ugly guy with the long-ish brow hair is Russel Crowe and by God, he is not ugly.

And when I say, "You weren't even talking to me!" Tell me that it was all in my head.   Result= one pissed off, ready to snap Frilly.

       Friday  was spent as expected. I lurve the Golden Boy.   Saturday  was spent as expected.   Sunday  was spent mostly sleeping becuase Saturday night was much more fun than is legal. Sunday night I went to Spring Rolls for dinner with my brother after he left me sitting on his couch for an hour while he talked to his girlfriend in Scotland. Arse.  Saturday night my girlfriend from upstairs: Ms. M, and I went to Devil's Martini. That is, we tried to get into Devil's Martini. I've NEVER, ever not go into that bar, but Saturday night the  bouncers were being ass hats. They closed V.I.P. at 11:30 p.m. and so we figured that the rest of us in line would finally get a chance to get inside. Not so. Even though V.I.P. is supposedly closed, the bouncer working the line has about 8 million best friends, each of those with girlfriends and maybe a personal assistant or two. All of these best friends walk right on in.   I even tried my luck with the manager and said bouncer. Usually if a decent looking girl walks up to you and asks nicely if you can let her, and her cute friend in... usually they'll do it. In fact, most clubs pull the girls out of the line and make the guys wait. Anyway, it was no dice. We waited in line for an hour and then the bouncer at the door announced that it was one in, one out. With VIP getting in FIRST. FUCKERS.  Luckily, Ms. M suggested a bar that she had been to before called " urlLink the Mod club  theater". Off we go. YAHOO!! What a great time. Great music, great crowd, bubbles from the ceiling and dancing until 3 in the morning. Will definitely have to go back.

            Son masturbating with maxi pads . Sweetie, if that's what he's doing, you need to be taking the poor boy to a REAL person, not looking it up on the internet.    It's like a woo woo.  Is it?! Is it really?! How exciting!     Stories of frilly panties and guys in panties.  Maybe  urlLink Joe  can help you there, although he doesn't seem to take requests.      And from our friends at  army.mil  " smelling panties " - good to know where your tax dollars are going, isn't it?

      This time around I'm staying in town. How about a weekend preview instead of a weekend wrap-up?   Friday : The Golden Boy is driving up - he's only a few hours late ;) and we're going out to dinner.   Saturday:  Gym. Then, family dinner and then out with the girl who lives upstairs. A little leery about going out with her - have heard a lot of her drunken stories and am not sure that she always behaves in an apropriate manner when in public. Leery, definitely, but aching to go to the club and so am going.   Sunday:  Swimming. cleaning. all that regular sunday crap. Watching hangover movies on TBS. For the millionth time the "encore" presentation of Blue Streak or something equally as CRAPPY.

      I really did. I joined the gym last night. I'm actually looking forward to taking the yoga classes and will try spinning - both free with memebership. Another location has a pool - sweet. Get ready for newer, firmer, Frilly!   I'll let you in on a secret: the only reason I work out is so that I can eat what I want without worrying about the weight gain. French Fries are my favorite things on earth. You can see how this could be a problem.

       "The internet has no government, no constitution, no laws, no rights, no police, no courts. Don't talk about fairness or innocence, and don't talk about what should be done. Instead, talk about what is being done and what will be done by the amorphous unreachable undefinable blob called the internet user base."  - Paul Vixie, 2004

      My best friend (let's call her Bunny) recently sent an email to a girl (let's call her Biatch) who she had been close to a few years ago. The frienship had been dying and it was difficult for Bunny because Biatch was demanding and she kept bringing up topics that she knew were painful to Bunny. She would call Bunny almost every day and then demand to know why Bunny didn't call her back immediately.   Bunny's email was pretty straight forward. She told her that she cares about Biatch, but that the friendship was not ever going to be as close as it was a few years ago. She was having problems with the relationship and thought that it would be better to end it, for many reasons. This is what she gets in return:   Bunny,  Well what can I say?I am not at all mad, actually relieved...   But to be honest I feel it is a good thing that you and I are no longer friends because I spent so much time worrying about how you were all the time when you were going through all kinds of crap, I worried and thought about you all the time....and neglected myself and my life in the process. With my life the way it is now...I know that there is no way I would be able to do any thinking about you seeing as I have a lot of things going on in my life as well...and I have realized who my real friends are....and they have been there for me...like I was for you.  You were a drain on me mentally and I was ok with that... but now I see that I kinda wasted my time...trying to build a life long friendship, silly me! I put a lot into our friendship and for you to push it away due to the fact that S. is my brother, well to me seems petty. I see we are in two different stages in life. I am mature and stable...where as you seem to still be lost in the ways of life and are acting like a child. Maybe when you grow up you will realize the mistakes you have made, it will be too late for us, but maybe people you meet later will be able to stand the drama of being your friend. Someone needs to smack some sence into you.  I think you need to take some time and look in the mirror and ask yourself "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME??" Because you are going be asked that a lot by other people in your life if you keep this teenage logic, it is best to be prepared and have an answer for them.  Life is short and I am not about to waist my time with someone who can not be mature about anything in life. Good luck to you in life because you are going to need it. But I think your Boyfriend is going to need it a bit more.  Biatch  p.s Reality is going to creep up on you and you are not going to be prepared. Time to open your eyes.  My best friend wants to write this Biatch a reply but I've been trying to tell her that someone who writes an email like that does not deserve a response. What chance does she have of talking any sense to this girl? Obviously Biatch is hurt more than she says, and she's taking that pain out on Bunny. She's using every weapon available to her, guilt, personal attacks, insults... Women can be so very AWFUL.

      I think it's the most  urlLink horrible thing , now. I guess I made it about 3 years ago. They paid me well for the work I did, but now I look at it and some of the changes they've made to it... and I cringe. All that horrible text, very little white space, links that are almost invisible... I almost want to email them and ask if I can spiff it up a bit: if only for the sake of my pride.

      Which is unusual. Sorta. I mean, usually I LIKE them a lot... I enjoy spending time with them but after two days together I want to snap their heads back like a Pez dispenser.   Not so this time.   In fact, when I wake up in the morning and he's still sleepy and his blonde head is almost buried in about three pillows and the cat is meowing and he spent the whole night pressed up against the wall, being careful not to roll over on her... I can almost feel my heart stopping. He looks like some kind of delicious naughty angel.   Every morning I wake up with him I feel like I love him more. Is this possible?   How lucky am I?  Are you tired of hearing about it yet?  Have I told you how he performed a miracle with the Cabernet? Last time I tried his Cabernet it was very bitter... last night he brought home the finished product and it was as smooth as the inside of a maiden's thigh. I couldn't believe it was the same wine. He's so FREAKING clever!!   Alright, enough, sorry.

      He returns an email (paraphrased here):    ME: "What does this mean? You hope that we can be together in the future? I still have to say that I don't think that we would work out."    R.E.: No, from the beginning I warned you that I wasn't right for you. I knew that we could never be together. I want you only as a friend. It looks like you are confused. I'm not a hypocrite, I wouldn't want you to jeopardize your relationship.    You will not heal until you have a support system of friends.    Help me find my friends.    ARGH!!! In the begining, once, he did say, "I think I'm not the right guy for you." and I got upset and asked him why but his only response was, "Because." Perhaps this is what he's referring to. I'm even more ticked now than I was before because I feel like he's trying to make a fool of me. He's trying to make it sound like I'm so wrapped up in myself, and convinced that he still wants me. I can't help it if that is what I thought. The things he was saying were certainly enough to make anyone believe that's what he meant. If it isn't - it's another case of crossed-wires for us, and yet another reason why our relationship was so DAMN difficult.  My response will be along the lines of this: sorry if I misunderstood you, but that is why I told you I was confused and I needed you to clear up the situation for me. That being said... let's just get on with our lives.   Why did this have to be such a huge issue? If all he really wanted to say was that he'd hoped I would have come to him in person and that he'd appreciate it if I didn't blab about this, then it could have been said in a much less emotionally loaded email. DRAMA!

      How much more clearly do I have to tell R.E. to move on with his life and to stop holding out any hope of us EVER getting back together?   He's just written me an email... about how he was hurt that he found out about my boyfriend from someone else... about how he understands that I'm wrapped up in my boyfriend right now, because it's new, but in time it will cool and then he hopes I will remember the good things I had with him... about how the atmosphere in the office has changed and he wants to put it right... about how he doesn't want me to talk to anyone about what is going on between us.   I AM SO PISSED OFF. This guy has a lot of nerve. I wrote an email back, stating in stronger words that I am happy with my relationship with the Golden Boy, I would never do anything to jeopardize it, I still think that we wouldn't work out. EVER. I also told him that as a woman, I get my emotional support from my friends and therefore I would certainly be talking about this situation with my best friend, at the least. I'm not going to blab it to the office, but I DO need objective opinions!  What else can I do?

      We haven't had a nice post about the boobage in a long while and I think it's my civic duty to inform y'all that I still have these great breasts. For me, that is. Not for Pammy Anderson, but for me. Pammy Anderson makes me look like I have sport socks stuffed in my bra.  But wait! There's more!  Along with said lucious boobs arrived a somewhat less than desireable J-Lo wannabe bootay and a slight sticking out of tummy. THESE MUST GO. Otherwise, there's no telling where it would end. I'd be stuck in speciality shops for those "tall women with big shoulders and large guts." This is to be avoided at all costs.  Hence, tomorrow night (if I feel like it, of course) will enter that god-less, over-crowded, sweat filled place that is known as "Goodlife Fitness Clubs" and see how much money they want to take my lucious boobs, bootay and bulge from me.   This particular club is the one closest to me, but quite frankly, it scares the living shit out of me. I've been a member before, but not at this location. The one time I walked by it, it was filled to bursting with people doing all sorts of ungodly things such as "running" and "cycling" and "breathing hard."   The only thing I really like about the gym (okay two things) are the results I get, and the fact that it gives me an excuse to go out and buy a proper MP3 player so that I can at least block out all the grunting noises coming from the weight room.    I hate busy gyms. I hate waiting for machines and I HATE that SWEATY smell. But I like my ass when it fits into my jeans.

       urlLink    Find it  urlLink here . If you like fractals, this one's for you. I guess I could go into detail about how the jewel tones interact within the piece, blah blah, but I don't want to sound like some pompous art critic. I like it. That's all there is to it.

      There is a small animal making "scratchy scratch" noises in the ceiling above my head, in my bedroom when I am trying to sleep. I think it's making a nest so that it can later come forth, and multiply. It's freaking me out. How do you get rid of the "scratchy scratch" type animals in walls and ceilings? I don't want them to die, they would start to smell. I just want them to go away.  The pudding (cat) is completely unconcerned. Next time I promise myself, I will get a fully functional kitty that hunts-down and frightens-very-much, scratchy-scratch type animaliosises. They do not belong in ceilings when I am trying to sleep.

       N.B. I spent the entire weekend with the Golden Boy. 4 days of his unrelenting company. I did not want to kill him, not even once. This is good.   In fact, I think I love him even more now than I did on Thursday. Which is hard, but I guess it's happened.    Friday:  out for overpriced dinner at "Miller's Tavern" at Yonge and York Mills.    Saturday:  drive down to Niagara and help the Golden Boy set up for dinner for 13. Rest of day/night a little wine riddled haze. Excellent times.   Sunday:  wake up late, read and clean up while Golden Boy mows enormous lawn. Prep for another party - this time at a friend's house. By the time we arrive, most of the boys at the party are total train wrecks. One can hardly walk, and keeps falling down on the  lawn. There is a fierce slip and slide competition going on, involving many small injuries and a great deal of cursing. We leave the party early, not standing a chance at catching up with the drunks. Play a game of "The Simpsons game of Life" and sleeps it is.    Monday:  Back to Toronto to have dinner with Brother, a couple friends and Golden Boy. Go and see the Bourne Supremacy (quite good). Pudding (cat) is howling her head off for some reason, again. Tuck her under the covers and all is quiet. Sleep badly, strange dreams and now I have about 2 hours of driving to do, so that we can get some proposals signed.  Ugh.   Update  Two hours wasted as was pawned off on secretaries both times. Have spent entire morning driving around Toronto to no avail.
