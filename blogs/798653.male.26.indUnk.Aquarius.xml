      that's quite an analysis. i like my avc soulplayer - kinda out of date now with the neato stuf on the market. it plays discs, full size or 8cm. that's the way to go. 128MB is too tiny!

      I've got 64 MB MP3 player for a few weeks as I thought I bougth the 128MB version of the rio 800. I have until the first week of february to return it and shop around for the bigger one. It's probably gonna be $99. I got this 64MB one for $49 but I can't find any of the expansion packs for sale online. That could bump me up to a 256 or 512 MB. So am am going to get a different player, as another 64MB pack is $70 I might as well get the 128MB player for $100.   So here is what a different bitrates makes: 107.7 MB  encoded as MP3 bitrates 128-256 kbps - 22 songs   61.5 MB encoded as MP3 bitrate 96 kbps - 22 songs  Which gives me 22 songs for  1 hr, 29 minutes of music at a smaller bitrate. Leaving them encoded as I found them would have given me 13 songs, 50 minutes, 17 seconds of music to stay within 64MB

      By Art Jahnke, CIO.com MacCentral   Like just about everyone else, Francis Uy has no use for spam. In fact, Uy hates spam. He hates it because it fills up his inbox with a lot of offensive junk, and he hates it because of the hassle that it brings to one of the most helpful technologies that has appeared in his lifetime, the Internet.   "Anyone who uses the Internet for business knows how much time and bandwidth it takes to deal with all of that junk," said Uy.   But unlike just about everyone else, Francis Uy decided to do something about spam. After receiving an unwanted offer to buy anti-virus software, Uy, a tech specialist at Johns Hopkins University, visited the seller's website and found the name -- Allen Moore -- and address of the spammer. He then posted that information on another site, where he encouraged site visitors to use Maryland's anti-spam legislation to sue spammers.   As it turned out, site visitors took a more direct action, calling Moore on the phone and signing him up as a subscriber to magazines that he never subscribed to.   When the issue finally did make it to court, it was Moore who brought it there, claiming that he had received eight harassing telephone calls, more than 200 unwanted magazines and dozens of products that he never ordered. Moore sued Uy for harassment.   On Monday, a Maryland district court judge ruled that Moore was wrong: Uy had not harassed him. At least, Uy hadn't harassed him any more than a newspaper harasses people whose names are published along with descriptions of their misdeeds. The website could stay, the judge said, and Moore could either take a hike or appeal.

The XServes will be modified by a unnamed third-party and will be running a custom kernel. The XServes are destined for US Navy submarines and will be used for real-time image processing.

      First time drunk. I think I was a junior in high school.  A friend of mine knew some kid who scored some Avalanche from his job at the liquor store.  He was selling them for like $10 a fifth.   So I decided to take four bottles off of his hands since he still had like a case and a half.  (For those of you who don't know, Avalanche is mint schnapps with the crystals at the bottom).  So I decided I was going to drink a whole bottle while I made my two friends split another.  Only thing I remember about that night was talking to the cops at my apartment because one of my friends decided to be stupid and invite his girlfriend over with whom he was fighting with for the past three days.  But they decided to take their fight to the parking lot when one of my neighbors called the police. So, after I somehow got the police away without them knowing a thing except about the fight, I decided it would be my last meeting with the Avalanche as I decided to puke it all up and pass out in my bathroom.  Interesting side note to that:  My friend and his girlfriend were fighting because he aparently discovered alcohol a lot sooner than myself and my other friend so at that time he was a full fledged alcoholic (minus going to the meetings of course).  I lost track of that friend, but I can gaurantee sadly that he probably still is a drunk.

      Let's see....it all began when an old friend of mine were listening to some House of Pain and commenting on the beverage of choice the gentlemen on the recording were speaking of. Their choice of brew was something of the 40 ounce persausion, and was known as Mickey's. No since my counterpart and I were new to any sort of drinking, being the juniors in high school that we were, we thought in terms of what we knew. We knew that in the course of a few hours we could drink a few 44 ounce mountain dews with no problems whatso ever. So we decided to get eight 40 ouncers of Mickey;s malt liqeur. Four for me and four for him. So midway through...the first one...things started getting a little unbalanced, a little woozy, a little spinny...and a few sips into the second one I think I was puking in the washing machine, and or into a box....I'm not sure if I ever been as drunk- no that's not true. I've never been as unaware of my limitations, even though for some time after we were determined to drink four of those bad boys...160 ounces of malt liquer was our goal...160 each...we never made it...today I don't get wasted on a 40 ounce but one sip of that stank booze and I'm as near to throwing up as I would be if I drank the whole damn thing....

      Ah yes, drunk off my ass, I remember it like it was yesterday... I must have been about eighteen, me and the guy I was dating were house sitting for these rich people who's house is on a golf course (that's right green # 14). They had a hot tub on the deck, I made brownies, we had like 3 other friends over. That was the night I met goldschlagger. I started off with a fuzzy navel- to this day I hate peach alcohol, then moved right to the gold. I'd take a shot, proclaim I didn't feel anything and pour myself another. And another. And another... pretty soon a friend looks at the bottle and asked if I was the only who had had any.   Yeah, well 20? 30? mins later I couldn't even sit up straight in the hot tub, I had to be physically lifted out of the tub when all of a sudden they say I went quiet. I got over heated and I somehow made it inside the air-conditioned house where I was lying on my back until they came inside to check on me. I remember being carried up the stairs over the big guy's shoulder and put in the shower where I couldn't even stand at this point. Another friend checked on me and held my hair when I vomitted a good 3 time before I was put in bed where I slept for a good 11 hours and woke up refreshed the next morning.  To this day I'm not allowed to make or pour my own drinks says my friends. And the nickname "Super Anita Champion of the World" has stuck ever since from when I was apparently yelling at the top of my lungs when I was slung over the shoulder of the big guy, as he carried me upstairs.

      College... at some point. Freshman year? The night of 1,000 beers? Some guys down the hall bought dozens of cases of Old Milwaukee... so much, in fact, that the store owner gave them the stand-up display, of a woman in a bikini. So, they built a throne out of beer cases, got a scepter and a crown, and took pitctures of everyone sitting on the throne with the standup of the woman. You had to be there.  The first time I ever vomited while drunk? 21rst birthday. Why is it that your friends try to kill you on that day? You have so much life ahead of you, you know?

      I think the first time I was drunk was New Year's Eve of 1992/93...we had a party at my parent's house in Farmington (memories...my old house...).  Anyway, there were kind of two parties going on at once - the one on the ground floor was adults - my family and my parent's friends - and the one in the basement was all the underagers - all my and my brother's friends...I don't remember in what order, but I remember drinking champagne, wine, liquor and beer all in the same four hour period.  I was a mess...I was so drunk, I convinced one of my brother's guests - some girl from a different school (who didn't know us very well) that he and I were actually twins and that I was older by 4 minutes....of course, everyone who knew the truth totally kept the lie going just to mess with her...by 2am I was talking on the big white telephone with all my aunts and uncles beating on the door laughing at me....

      Ahhh, I remember the first time I was drunk fairly... OK.  It was at Dan Boujoulian's Graduation Party.  Yes The one from GVSU.  Yes Dan and I are close to the same age.  Yes that means that I was 23 (going on 24) the first time I was drunk. I got a late start but have been making up for it ever since.  I crashed in his basement, where I had spent the night many times during our adolesence.  When I woke up the next morning in the strange yet familiar surroundings it gave me a start.  I was still in a haze, and wondered if I had dreamed the last 7 years of my life.  Threw me and my whole day for a loop.

      LOL. Nice new topic, El Capitan!  My first night drunk was at the TGIF in Novi I would work at a few years later. I am lame, so my first time drunk was on my 21st birthday.  I went to dinner with my family... The TGIF crew tied balloons to my hair and I returned the favor by letting go of them into the fan above me until it stopped... smoking from the stress of the balloon strings holding it from spinning.  I drank once before when I was 14, but I don't think I was drunk. Maybe I was. I just felt stupid. Thats why I always smoked pot over drinking because alcohol makes me feel dumb and pot makes me feel smarter. When I got my laptop I went to go write and I ended up at 5th ave outside on the deck, had a beer and decided that going out to write on your laptop sounds cool but once you get a beer in you the screen is hard to look at. So no more of that. I am just trying to add to the list of places I've created cool shit on my laptop at..  (and on the people mover I edited a short film entitled "Around In Circles")

      Doc, what are "shamz"?  Is it along the same lines of a floogie? As far as the origins of the word... I think it's an old school pop culture sort of thing.  Maybe they said it once in Monty Python or something like that.  If not, then the only reason I know of it is because of Dan and my brother... they may be the co-creators of this silly nonsense which I hope will soon be sweeping the country.

      REGRETS! That is what my life is about. It all starts in grammar school. I attend St. ALphonsus. In seventh grade my mother asked if I wanted to transfer to St. Andrews which I knew a few girls that played  was our rival basketball team-they sucked balls and swallowed and took it in the ass, (later in life I have a great friendship with a few girls that attend St. Andrews). Of course I did not want to because I had friends at my current school that I did not want to leave. 8th grade graduation passed and I was enrolled at Good Counsel and all girls school. At first I was like- wicked fun! No bullshit from boys. I met up with the girls from St. Andrews and knew from that moment I regretted not transferring. There were 4 girls. I was the odd. We had wicked fun and shit but I knew that there friendship was hella stronger then a new friendship I had with each of them. Not only that but in "Good Kennel" I was getting some bad grades.. In religion.. Who would of thought, Right??? But I so thought I knew more then my nun teacher, "Miss Penguin I have learned about God since Preschool! What could you teach me that I do not know already? When he took a piss or shit?"  So due to that I had went to Lake View H.S. in Chic-e-G. (-Jack Black) So I was a sophomore at this bad ass school that my parents were scared to death that I was going to .. I mean there were kids shot right out in front. This was the first time I ever went though a metal detector since the airport!. I was soo nervous. I was a white kid in an all black school. That is like a black guy at a clan meeting! I mean I played sports and shit and I got along w/ about everyone. Of course my nick name was obvious :"White Girl". I eventually graduated and moved to Cali to fuck up some more.   I know if I stayed at Good Kennel I would have went to College somewhere and made something of my self.   I moved to Cali. Worked at the double tree hotel and met some hella kool people. I also fell in love for the first - well maybe second time- ( You can't count Joe for New Kids on the Block) He was of different race and religion but he was great. I learned hella shit form him and even straighten out some. I kicked a few habits but I also picked some up. In the summer of 99' my cousin who lived with decided that she was selling her house and that meant I had to bust my ass and be responsible. No more drugs, concerts or shit like that!. I had to get an apartment and a car to commute. My Love at that time talked to me, he said" move to Chic-e-G and go to school live off your Mom and Dad and make something of your self." Of course I am all in love and I think sure.. I do not have to live off my cousin any more I will go back to my parents. So I did! Big mistake.  So those are my regrets:  Not Transferring schools. Transferring. Moving from Cali. to Chic-e-G

      "Don't you ever wonder maybe if you took a left turn instead of taking a right you could be somebody different?" -dave matthews  What do I regret? It's hard to say. Every time I think about what might have been, it makes me look at what... is. I'm happy with what I've done so far, and even happier at what I hope is to come. I'm comfortable, energized, motivated and in a good situation. I could be better just as easy as I could be worse. . Of course I'd do some things differently now rather than then - I'd be more bold, mostly, I'd risk more - but I feel that I've made the best decisions I could given the information and situations I was in at the time. To feel otherwise is useless and counterproductive. Making any sort of rational judgement based on incomplete or inaccurate information  - such as 'what might have been' - is no way to live.  So do I have any regrets? No. Any ones that pop up in my mind I smash with the knowledge that they're inherently negative and irrelevant.  It's a struggle.

      "Regrets" Ben Folds Five  i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade i couldn't keep the pace i thought i was the only one moving in slow motion while the other kids knew something i did not but if i acted like a clown i thought it'd get me through, it did but that don't work no more you're not a kid no more i thought i'd do some travelling never did  regrets, regrets  i thought about the hours wasted watching t.v., drinking beer i thought about the things i thought about until immobilized with fear and all the great ideas i had and how we just made fun of those who had the guts to try and fail and then i ended up in jail  regrets, regrets  ... but just for a day seems the police had made a computer mistake said there must be  urlLink   thousands like me with the same name    anyway, i thought about the things i settled for or never tried i never visited my grandma even once when she was sick before she died so i don't blame you if you never come to see me here again  regrets, regrets...

      WOW.  I was fully convinced that this topic was going to get a turn out of nil.  EVERYONE gave me lots to think about.  As a future teacher I need as many different viewpoints as possible to help me connect to as many kids as possible.  For no real measurable reasons other than she wrote a cool response, I don't know her, and she was the first to respond to my first topic Anita is the blue ribbon winner, and she gets to pick the next topic.

      Mike (Murph) , Your marketing people are freaking me out. I am not your demographic. Stop with your classifications of my expected comsumerism behavior.  Where's that cave you were talking about, I am gonna go find it.  The current generation doesn't have any more of an attitude than any previous generation. The last generation that didn't try to take more than give were the 18 year olds in the late 60s. Most of that generation died in a jungle war.  Jimi Hendrix sang a song called Machine Gun on his last new years eve, in 1969.   Machine gun, machine gun tearing my body all apart Machine gun tearing my body, body all apart evil man make me kill you it's tearing my friends all apart   Teens gravitated to London's art section or San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury area attempting to bring in a new way of thinking to the world, changes started to spring up in our country. Movements causing real breakthoughs and causes worth fighting for. (not like oil, which isn't a good reason to die for.)  What happened to that way of life? Go to Haight-Ashbury now and you'll see the shadows of human souls littering the heroin laden streets. Independent thinking and free love lead people straight to uncontrollable drug habits and multiple kids riding around with them in a VW minibus.  Those that didn't get caught up in drug addiction became something else entirely. The motto used to be "Don't trust anyone over 30" and then as they become the people they used to hate the motto became "Don't trust anyone under 30."  That mentality only permeated the ideologies of the kids growing up. Festering in a pile of humanity with a lack of respect for those around. (Remember the 80s?)   Somehow the children of the 90s turned out pretty good. We had that same angst, but the music caught up with the emotions and all we needed was Kurt Cobain to verballize what we were all thinking so we could let go of the angst.  Now the "Core" music is even harder than the grundge we listened to, but it's not helping them move past their emotions. They still give you attitude at the movie ticket line, they cut in front of you at the amusement park, they cut you off on the freeway at 85 MPH.   I don't know what's up. I have no real hypothesis on it. Current world political situations are not to blame for current teenager attitudes. There's always something messed up in the world people alive have to deal with.

       urlLink Topical Paradise - ItWillFail.com  The Topic is: When was the last time, when walking around in public, that you have seen a teenager/high school student and  A. Felt that the future was doomed or B. Felt that the future was gonna be just fine?  Oh, geez.   A. Every time I go to the coffee shop by my house, and see them hanging out.  B. After I think about it for a minute or so.  When I was at college, not long ago, my job had me interacting with the incoming freshmen every day. I've saw some things that were disturbinf. I think there's a glut of marketing and breakdowns of community that have created a sense of entitlement among young people. The more affulent the student was, generally, the less mature, responsible and modest he or she was. Basically, a lot of people woke up this morning way high up on the economic and social ladder and didn't feel the slightest bit fortunate. That's what I see where I live (Rochester Hills).  That said... I think, well, The Kids are Alright. They're screwed up, but so we were, so were our parents, and so their kids will be. I can be the change I want to see in the world around me, or I can hide in a cave and wait for it all to come crashing down. I hate waiting.

      Pat-  Obesity is "going to become" an epidemic?   urlLink http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/epidemic.htm   From that page: Among U.S. adults aged 20-74 years, the prevalence of overweight (defined as BMI 25.0- 29.9) has increased an estimated 2 percent since 1980, increasing from 33 percent to the 35 percent of the population in 1999 (based on NHANES II and NHANES 1999 data).  In the same population, obesity (defined as BMI greater than or equal to 30.0) has nearly doubled from approximately 15 percent in 1980 to an estimated 27 percent in 1999.

      This just to say... I'm not too sure if I agree with you, Pat. But please do explain, expand more here. In terms of social security and such, Generation Y  (stands for wireless- which is them kids generation after Gen X and those who graduated from high school in the year 2000 would be the first year of this new generation) now outnumbers the baby-boomer generation. And as we have been steadily moving into a more service-oriented economy I don't see the jobs going away. Older industries i.e. maufacturing, auto industry, I can't think of any more right now, are seeing a drop in their "profits" earnings but they're still making a profit. But as our population is growing we're going to be needed more stuff. This has a bad and a good side, good in that more jobs and such to get the things we need, and bad because we're turning everything into an urban sprawl and loosing valuable land for farming, and green space to keep the air quality ok but we won't get into environmental issues I could go on all day...  Today, we now have more investment oppertunities, new laws being created all the time, 401K's- best things ever, stocks are getting shady it seems, bonds- in the long term has always been steady. There's plenty of way to save but I've notice in my peers and those both younger and older, are on this get rich quick mentality. It doesn't work. Hard work, and putting in their time doesn't entertain the fancy of those who feel the world owes them because they've got an issue. Everyone is so quick to blame, where their faults are from: they were picked on in school, their father drinks, they grew up in a single parent family, they're racially, sexually, and/or by age discriminated. But excuses aside, yes these kids are snots, obesity has become a problem, advertisements have gotten out of hand, and no I don't want that supersized.

      Good topic. My theme for this summer so far has been, "Who do these kids think they are?". It stemmed from an incident at Cedar Point back in May. We were going to get on a rollercoaster (I can't remember which one) and we got up to the top of the stairs and were at the point where everyone fans out to get in an individual line for a row. This girl in front of us goes to the right and then stands back against the wall, seemingly not in a line. It is not too full, since it's a slow day, so there is at least a 5 foot gap from where the end of the lines are to where she is standing. I figure that she's waiting for a friend, so we get in a line in front of her. She waits a moment and then makes her move, "EXCUSE ME!" (In this snotty teenager tone, of course). So we move on to another line. Flash forward about 2 hours. Millenium Force line. This line is about a 30-40 minute wait and the longest wait at the park at the time (It was a slow day, ). Anyway, long story short, she's behind us in line quite a bit and shouting to her friends, who are in front of us a ways. Well, ..... As we move up and down the queues she line jumps by about a total of 150-200 people to get up to her friends. They just don't have common decency anymore, their lives are too fast paced. Remember when you were a kid, and you would "play". Kids don't play anymore, they have "playdates" and fucking Franklin Planners. Plus today's children are innundated from the womb with advertising. Carmakers design new models for people who don't even have licenses yet. The Dodge Razor concept car comes with Razor scooters. WTF! And in America our test scores, grades, etc are all going downhill. Have you seen what amounts to a "small" serving of french fries at fast food places? Remember when that was a large? IT IS! McDonalds even has "Big Kid Happy Meals". Obesity will become an epidemic.This will create more jobs in the medical field but these kids won't be qualified for them! Who's going to take care of me when I'm old? Where's my Social Security going to come from? I think my generation will be hard pressed to have the economic freedom of our parents, the baby boomers. It's already happening.   Sorry for going off on a unibomber rant there. ....   If I could only build myself a shack..... out in the woods.....

      I was thinking about it, and I can't say they're any more or less doomed than people might have thought of us when we were growing up. I don't know how to relate to high schoolers anymore that's for sure,  because do they not understand because they're young and lack life experiance? Or do they just not care about things. Our society hasn't died out yet. People have thought our future is doomed since the begining of time we haven't yet. Somehow things always balance out. There will be war and violence, then there will be peace and creation. There will be suffering but there will be comfort eventually. History has a way of repeating itself. Our grandparents survived, our parents survived, we survived, so will the future.

So  even though I'm not relly brimming with ideas, I'll give it a shot.  Now keep in mind I just got back form overseeing about 100 high schools kids for 2 weeks, so I've got weird ideas floating around in my head.     The Topic is:  When was the last time, when walking around in public, that you have seen a teenager/high school student and  A.  Felt that the future was doomed or B.  Felt that the future was gonna be just fine?     If that's unclear tell Dan, He'll tell me, and I'll rephrase.

I am going through a town or city looking for clothes to hide my body. I never find clothes. My dreams usually end with someone dying or already dead. It is usually a close friend. I always wake up during my dreams and make my self fall back to sleep to finish my dream. I NEVER go back to the same dream. I wonder why?

       First dream  was to be a archaeologist.  I still dream of that, but I now know that it doesn't mean being Indiana Jones, and that it requires as much scientific/mathematical knowledge as historical.  I hence settled on being an historian.   Most memorable  dream is the repeating nightmare I had as a kid, whenever my bed was positioned by the bedroom window; I would dream of a hand reaching in at night and grabbing me, pulling me out.  It progressed to where hands were grabbing at me from the hallway ceiling and floor, and from the streets of my neighborhood.  Yikes, can't forget that.   Scary dreams ... well, see above.  That was my most memorable dream and only nightmare that I can vividly remember.  Though I have had dreams in which I was shot by a gun, or beaten up, but those never seemed as scary for some reason.   Remembering dreams ...  I dream a lot, and usually remember the dreams quite well when I first wake up, but once I start going through my day, I forget them.  Sometimes I forget them entirely, sometimes I only remember a *feeling* about the dream, and sometimes I just forget details.  Sometimes, very very rarely, I recall vivid detail in its entirety.   Lucid dreams ... I rarely realize that I am dreaming during dreams, or even if I do, I don't seem to have the ability to change them at will.  I do recall having dreams in which I know I'm dreaming, and am waiting to see what's going to happen next (often I am pursuing something in the dream that I'm afraid to do in reality) but usually when that happens I wake up before I progress past that point, DAMN.  I've often had dreams where I'm conscious in the dream that I need to wake up, that I'm late for something, and lo and behold, I wake up and I'm late for something.   Day dreaming ... I do that a ton.  Especially when I'm listening to music.  I put together novels listening to music, for goodness sake.  I used to day dream a lot in high school, but not anymore.  Nowadays at university I really do have to pay attention, or I'll freak come test time.  I day dream a lot in my bedroom, either with music or while I'm working on my artwork.  I also daydream occassionally when I'm driving on nice days, and day dream a lot when I go outside into nature, or when I exercise.  I'm artistically inclined-- we HAVE to daydream.  The mind never rests.  ;)  Did I cover everything? ^__^

       First dream  was to be a taxi driver. No, wait, here me out. It was back in my wee-um days being very impressionable and watching cartoons. It was in fact the increadibly educational show of Muppet Babies that gave me the idea. I had seen in som episode where Kermit the Frog drove a guy to the moon and got a million dollars for it. I was very young and had no concept of distance, money or humor that these shows totally put forth. Trust me, my family- every holiday reminds me of this.    Most memorable  would have to be my most recent dream. What was it? I don't know I can't remember. But no, I do have re-occuring dreams. That would be about tornadoes and snakes. Tornado dreams are never scary they just always have the smae plot line: It's a beautiful and nice day and suddenly I get the urge to look up at the horizon and I see 3-7 tornadoes ominously looming a short distance away all coming towards us. I'm always with a group of people and they just don't see it. They don't realize the danger they're in and so I get everyone to shelter 'just in time' and then after it's done we go out and see the huge amount of damage everywhere. They all say then wow, we had no idea, it's a good thing that you were there to warn us. Then it end. Just like that I'll have it like once every month, every two months, for the last few years.  Also the snake ones, there's a snake and I wake up and I can't move. I'm paralized and tingley with random fright. The thing is, I'm not afriad of snake, I'd be the first one to pick them up and scare my sister/friends with it. I don't get it.     Scary dreams  would be the ones where some one is in trouble or I'm in trouble or there's a 'bad guy' and I'm powerless, he's going to hurt me and I can't scream, I can't hide, I'm just frozen but crying. Just basically the dreams where I can't control them, it gets scary.    Remembering dreams  the only time I don't remember them is if I have to wake up really fast because I'm late for work, need to be somewhere and such. If I have time, and wake up causually (i.e. via not alarm or random cat) I always do remember them. I might write them down if they're noteworth or just weird at the time. I used to totally keep a journal of them, but I have so many of them, and what do you do when you're done? So I threw them all away I had like 12 or so usual notebook size. A good portion of my dreams I don't want to share because I can kinda see my train of thought in the dream and what might have influenced me and it's just not a good idea to make thing public knowledge, or I should say, I've read too much of Freud.   Lucid dreams  all the time, probably a 50/50 mix of my dreams, if I'm getting close to waking up then I can control them, and it's in the few seconds or so when I realize I can control things in my dream and am aware of things is when I wake up. It sometimes feels like I'm looking up into a camera telling myself to wake up, it's all just a dream Anita and stuff like that.   Day dreaming  do I have to be awake for this? If not, I'll at very random times, while driving, while people are giving me instructions for my next project at work, while watching a movie, playing the piano, on occasion having sex, I'll just zone out and still be functioning fine but by looking in my eyes I'm so somewhere else. I've never been in an accident because I've been day dreaming- actually it makes my trip go faster, all of a sudden I'll snap out of it and be like hey I'm approaching my driveway, hey this song is almost done, oh the movie is over. Hrm, maybe I should do a bit less of this day dreaming. Some people take it for absent mindedness- when that's exactly the opposite, I was thinking  so  much I was distracted by what was literally infront of me. Also clearly what ever was infront of me wasn't that interesting or else I wouldn't be day dreaming. I'm not talking about the random productive thinking like making a grocery list, what's on Dave Letterman tonight?, did I remember to water the plants? Daydreaming for me is the stuff where I'm just very much not conscience of the thinking that's occuring.

      Well let's take this question by question.     My first dream was to be a Jedi.   Now everyone is saying "of course Mike Martin dreams of being a Jedi."  But keep in mind I saw  Return of the Jedi  when I was 7 years old.  A very impressionable age, and one of my most vibrant memories is of Luke Skywalker all in black (now you know the real reason behind my morbid wardrobe) with an emerald green blade wading through Jabba's thugs like a scythe through wheat.  It was the most awe-inspiring thing I had ever seen up to that date (keep in mind I was only seven).  And the scene at the end where he flat out stomps Vader and stops just short of killing him.  Then he just tosses his only weapon away in the one of the best examples of an enemy showing contempt for another enemy I have ever seen.  The images were just thrust into my mind and there was nothing I could do about it.  That's where most of my Star Wars obsession comes from, and also where I realized that I wanted to be a Jedi.     My most memorable dream?   Can't really say.  I have a repeating dream where my teeth fall out, but that's not what I want to declare as my most memorable.  I did have one once where I banged Jenna Jameson AND Asia Carrera at the same time, that was a pretty good one.     Scariest would be a tie.   I have one every once in a while where I'm being chased Michael Myers from the Halloween movies.  I never get caught because I'm smart and I always go fast enough to stay away from him, but slow enough so that I never lose sight of him.  Second would be one that I had shortly after Julie and I broke up a year and a half ago where I was interacting with this Julie/Marie Hybrid *shiver*.    I frequently  remember my dreams,  but since I have yet to start my dream journal, as I go through the day I forget all but the most vivid details.     Lucid Dreaming?   Is that when you realize that you're dreaming and start to pull some reality altering shit?  If that's the case I lucid dream quite often.  My first time was when I was having a nightmare about Jaws (I was really young)  and I caused the seas to part in order to suffocate the shark.     And I day dream all the fricking time!

      The most exhausted I've ever been...  What comes immediately to mind is the time I got lost in the woods...in the snow...at twilight.  I was visiting Lake Tahoe with some friends.  My then girlfriend, her dog, Jeroux, and I decided to go off and spend some time alone.  She had gone through a relativley stressfull day involving a speeding ticket, driving for two hours in an attempt to acquire some last minute concert tickets (in vain), and Jeroux peeing on the bed.  Yeah, it's time for a quiet walk in the woods.  Well, since I have this fascination with being on top of things, I decided we should try to get the top of this peak down near the southwest coast of the lake.  We found a good place to park the car in a place that wasn't so much advertised as a place for just anybody to leave their car (in a neighborhood), but was nonetheless far enough out of the way as to not draw attention.  Hiking up hill in snow is tough, but we had a lovely trail to follow of previous adventurers who hit the same trailhead as we.  The trip up was a lot of fun and included some jumps off rocks into snowbanks and a friendly snow ball fight.  (Jesus, I loved that girl and was/am a total moron for lettting her go...another story)  The daylight was fading faster than we were ascending, so we made the decision to turn back before making it to the top.    Where exactly we left the trail for the first time and why is still somewhat of a mystery to me.  I remember running downhill for a bit and having fun "falling" and rolling in the snow.  This was obviously something better done off the trail and in the unpacked snow off to the sides.  Ok, so we left the trail to frolick.  When we first crossed OVER the trail is definitely still a mystery.  I sure as hell didn't know then, because when I became aware of the fact that we needed to find the trail to make it back to the car I was convinced that direction I would lead us in for the next hour and a half was the correct way.  It was after entering woods that were wholly unfamiliar and spending a great deal of time crawling through brush, and trying to wade through powder snow up to my waist, that my error in judgement became excruciatingly clear.  If this had happened when the daylight wan't fading into night I might have turned around and backtracked uphill and got us on the path, but that wasn't the case, and that isn't what we did.  By the way, this whole trial was made worse by the fact that THE WHOLE TIME Colleen (the girlfriend) had been lobbying to go the other (which turned out to be the right) direction.  We just headed down.  Down towards the lake which would eventually put us on the road which we could follow to the car.  The dog's paws started to bleed.  We were occaisionally crossing stream beds that were hidden by the snow and sucked us down.  It was long, it was arduous, but the sight of the road was like a rebirth...I have never, ever been so happy to see a road.  Then we had quite a nice walk just to get to the entrance of the neighborhood where we had left the car.  Then the horror truly began...we had to walk UPHILL to get to the car.  We had to meander through this maze of roads without the aid of light to gaive us our land marks.  Yup, we managed to take a couple of wrong turns (which we decided on together, thank you very much).  When we finally made it to the car, I was so sore, so tired, so exhausted, I could barely walk.  I was never so happy to see a car. Ask Colleen, I had been telling her for the twenty minutes before that moment that I didn't think I could walk anymore.  But she was right, I did it for another twenty minutes.  She was the strong one for us that night.  I think it helped that she was a marathoner.  (Is that a word???)  Getting back to the chalet where our friends were sorta wondering where we were was a quiet car ride.  There was a brief snarl I indulged myself at the bitch friend of a friend who just had to mock people in pain and then I headed off to take a long, hot shower.  Our friend Pam happened to have some Vicodin and offered me one.  I was never so happy to see a Vicodin.  I then slept like a baby for a solid ten hours in the bed that I had never been so happy to see.

      Most exausted was my senior year of high school, despite my parents very strict rule and my beyond busy schedules I would routeinly go to bed at sometime like 1am and then ben up by 6am to get ready for school and whatnot. So a usual day would be, get up, the whole breakfast deal, drive to school, fall asleep in at least one of my classes, go to work at the bank, go to play rehersal, and then go out for dinner with the older cast at the local Big Boy and close the place down, then crash when I got home. I never had homework so things worked out ok for me.   That is until Easter weekend in 2000. I convinced my parents to let me drive to Adrian MI to see some friends in Jesus Christ SuperStar at the Croswell Opera House. Saturday night I hadn't slept much at all, and after the show we they had a cast party. Well about 4am the party finally breaks up, I drive following my friends back to his place. I faught to stay awake, I had the music blaring, I was singing at the top of my lungs, I drank a juice box for some sugar, I had the windows down it was freezing, but to no avail. I was like 10 mins from the final destination, and I had just turn the corner in the farmland area just south of Ypsilanti and gone maybe about 100 feet after turning the corner and I hear a noise. It sounds like gravel, I wake up and try to swerve but I watch as if in slow motion the sign hit my car, snap in half, break the windshield and disappear and then feel this huge bump as the little foot bridge keeps me on the road.   The sign had been a creek warning sign, and that little foot bridge kept me from driving off into the ravine where a man eating tree could have gotten me. I somehow have enough wits to flash my lights and the guy comes around and says to turn off my car. The other half of the sign had spliced the underneith part of my car and fluids or all colors and textures were streaming down the hill. I then went into shock and don't remember much, I took all the stuff from my car and then left the car there and then going to sleep at my friend's house. Yeah not a happy story, I will never drive tired again that's for sure. I now try to get more sleep, things could have been very serious had I gone off the road and into the ravine, not to mention the car was totalled I had to buy one now. Luckily I had been able to save $5,000 in my "Going to Europe Fund" but I needed a car and so there went that dream.

      The most exausted I have ever been was some weekend in August of 2001.  Dan invited me over to his place for my second acid trip ever.  I got up to wrok at about 9 that morning and got off at five.  Got some food went home packed waited for Dan to get home and we dropped I think between 8 and 9.   The next ten hours ruled.  When we started comming down Dan went to go crash in his bed and I hooked up my DVD player.  I thought it would be kind of cool to fall asleeo to a movie.  I put in the Sci Fi cannel remake of Dune.  I sat there and I watche dall four and a half hours of it straight through.  When it was over just before I decided that enough was enough Dan came down ready to chill out some more.  No tripping just hanging out since "the acid was long gone."  We chilled and talked, and then went to see a flick.  I ended up getting home around 730.  I checked my e-mail then went to bed around 8.  This put me at being up for about 35 hours straight with ten of them tripping my balls off.  I slept for about 17 hours I think.  Can't wait to do it again.

      Mike--  No prob.  As Dan wrote you, I ended up doing a new page anyway and he got it up.    As far as the topic goes, I have a few times-- one being back in high school when I played violin in pit orchestra, and had to do three weeks of rehearsel from after school until midnight,  five days a week and weekends, and then still attend school regularly from c. 7am to 3pm.  But, if I think more recently, I would say my New Years' trip to Montreal and its 11 hour train ride.    Even more recently would be the start of my current relationship with a guy I have pulled numerous all-nighters with.  I started falling asleep during the day, and then that trend continued on the days that I have 9am classes (like tomorrow!) since I can't get used to going to bed early!

      Finals, my last semester at GVSU.  My studying method was that of reading for as long as I could before sleep overcame me. I would set the alarm for two hours and take a nap.  Upon waking up I would repeat this method until I knew the material or I had to go to class.   After doing pretty well for those finals I went home. I wouldn't know until January if I was graduated or not, it all came down to how well I did in Statistics class, they told me a B was the minimum I needed to get credit for that required class. I specifically told my mom I did NOT want to know my grades until I got back home. If I still had to go to college after all was said and done I would deal with that fact in January.  I came home for Christmas and lo and behold I couldn't sleep for longer than 2 hours at a time. I had conditioned my body this way through the week of finals.   I slept thru Christmas dinner somehow and 2 days after festivities I was back to a normal schedule.  Then I hopped in a car and drove to Florida with Matt Cox. We alternated driving and sleeping so by the time we got there my schedule was once again out of whack.   We partied wit 75,000 hippies to bring in 2000 on an indian reservation so far south that I-75 goes East/West. After new years festivities my body was totally torn up and I had a weeklong rest in Kentucky and took the bus home from there because Matt and I had a falling out along the way so I gave him the car I rented and told him I'd stay with my friends in KY until I felt like going home.  Defeated and tired from what felt like a month away from home my dad picked me up from the bus terminal in downtown Detroit. It took the better half of a week for my body to forgive me for the punishment I had put it through.  On a sidenote, I did find out what my grades were while on the road. My mom let out a "You got a C in statistics.. that's passing!!! You're done with college!!"  To which my reply was "I said I didn't want to know. You need a B to pass that class so I have to take it again. Thanks for keeping it off my mind during my vacation, mom."  But they actually didn't care and a C was fine for that class. I guess the film students didn't need the B to pass thing so it all worked out in the end and I never went back to college ever again!

New topic:  Since I've slept in five cities in five days, and been completely trashed the last two nights, and have been living out of a suitcase running around looking for vests, and I think somebody got married somewhere in there, let's try this one:  Describe the one time when you've been really, really exhausted. I mean, more exhausted than you've ever been. How'd you get there, and how long did you sleep?  I have a top 5 for this, which will be coming up... after my nap.

      Scars...the first one I remember getting was when I was like four years old and my six year old brother threw a wooden chair at me and hit me in the head.  I recieved five stitches and now have this indentation on my dome.   I also have a nasty one on my leg from falling on this metal box with sharp corners.   I was five or six when that one happened and the funny thing is... I didn't cry once.  In fact I freaked my mom out when I actually watched the doctor put in the stitches.  I guess I was a pretty gross kid.

There are those not so literal scars of the the emmotional sense, but those aren't real...(I got a good scar once, while watching something japanese...I'll just leave it at that...) There are a few skateboarding scars....but those don't really have stories...I mean..I fell, end of story... there are the tattoos, but not scars from them, but the tattoos themselves (a type of scar) but those are more personal things.. I guess that's it... I'm sure I'll come up with something better, some other time... -Captain

      I know I picked the subject and all, but I just checked myself over and I don't have any interesting scar or battle wound that's very note worthy. So by default, this barely noticible scar on my right knee from my days as an energetic tomboy who was the fastest runner in the first grade. Well during one of my usual lunch-recess challanges, I was racing and some third grader. Well he saw he was loosing and decided to pushed me in order to win, sending me tumbling to the ground. But after I healed, a day or two later (wow, I healed fast as a kid) we had a rematch and I soundly smoked him.  -Anita

      Now I consider myself an organized person, but I really like having the internet. I have my complete calander, address (snail mail) phone lists, random other stuff only on the internet. I can keep track of my finances and in truth I go to the internet first when researching for every paper. At the same time, I do know how to do it the old fasion way with the library and card catelogs (which are convienently also on-line) but I'd rather do things in terms of organization and research on the 'net. Also, I take care of reading the news, and checking out the weather, yahoo-maps on the net. When it comes to people, I'm on the phone or visiting them more than I'm on any chat messanger. I could survive without the internet, but it would throw of my entire routein. After a week, I woulds go nuts.

      Survive is such a specific word, as I don't think anyone's life is dependent or exclusively bound to the "internet", so much so,  that depriving one of it would result in death. But since I don't think the literal sense was implied, I will verbally gesticulate on the notion/question of "could you get by as well without the internet?"   I do think I would get by, in fact I would probably be better off. Let say that there was no such thing as the internet (as opposed to it existing and just not having it) I'm sure I would have filled my days with more reading, more writing and maybe even more travel. Friends that I keep contact with via email, I may have just jumped in the car and gone and visited them (which is what I did do on a few occasions before the internet really got big) if I didn't have that email connection.  Since my first experience with the internet (I feel that when trying to be sardonic and trying to date yourself at the same time, one should call every thing "the" as in, The Internet, The Nintendo, The Rock 'n Roll...), and even today, I marvel at the generations of the future that will have this technology laid out before them. The internet is the first really significant invention/technology that I was around and "functioning" before it was common place. In fact, I can hear myself say "back when I was in school, we didn't have the internet" and the like. I find it remarkable that when my grandpa was a child, most of our modern day technologies didn't exist. It makes me wonder what the hell they are going to come up with between now and when I am grandpa age.  I do, however, think that many of the generations to come will become more and more dependent on the internet, and would suffer greatly without it. Not only is it a sole means of communication for some of the inept youth of today, it is the focal point of informational reference. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a dependency on it could be. Would one have any idea what "the Midas Touch" really meant without copying it to Yahoo and trying to find out that way? I'm reminded of a series of books where the evolution of the net is fully developed to the point where people have implants to access remote networks that can be viewed internally, in the mind's eye. Their dependency on it was so severe, that when it fell, there were nations of illiterate people,  unable to write, or properly function in society.  Personally I can see how the internet has made my life more convienent in most regards, and in that sense I guess I appriciate it for what it's worth.  I think it's a very good question, though. It makes one look at an internet they may take for granted, and perhaps even enable one to appriciate it(or fear it) Normally this appriciation is only accomplished when that something is lost, which for the sake of itwillfail, the Captain, blogs, and everything else, I hope does not happen any time soon. That's all for now

      I suppose I will be the first to respond to next weeks topic even though this weeks isn't over yet, so I hope I don't get into any trouble.  Surviving without the internet?  For myself, that would be all too easy.  About six years ago, I would have said that I couldn't survive without BBSing.  That was a fun release for me and it was fun when I actually had my own board.  But until recently, I have pretty much ignored the whole internet thing.  My brother believes that it was because I was scared, but honestly I don't know what there is to be afraid of.  Maybe just the sense of being overwhelmed with so much information at my fingertips.    But I believe that the internet is a tool of evil though to some extent.  It makes life very inpersonal anymore.  I don't know, maybe I'm just not keen on the idea that people need a machine to keep in contact with one another.  But I suppose that would mean I have to be anti- telephone also, but I'm not.  At least there you can hear the voice of another human being on a telephone.  Maybe I'm just older than my age, but technology scares me.  I mean it's suppose to make our lives easier but at the same time it gives us even more to do.  But all in all, I don't believe my life would be any different, internet or no internet.

      Ok. Since Dan chose me for this week.  The Topic is: Do you think you could really survive without the internet? I mean seeing as most of our everyday lives revolves around WWW, do you think it would make a difference in how your life is, or will be, had it not been for the internet?

      Escape-- definitely listening to music.  Also, drawing.  Art for me is a big escape.  Reading used to be an escape, but is less so since becoming an English major.  Certain books still do it.  Movies like Lawrence of Arabia.  Writing is often an escape for me too-- real, novel writing, where I lose myself in the research.  But overall, my imagination as a rule is my big escape, and I find myself able to use that at most times and daydream. :)

      My only real escape now a days is music. Any kind, I have my "angry" music : u.s.bombs, virus nine, Poe, Alanis, SOAD, Meat Loaf,. Those sort of artist. Anything loud, fast, or angry lyrics.  I turn it up real loud(or put headphones on) and just listen. Or write while I listen. Or read. Or anything that is not going to involve me having to make contact with my family or anyone else for that matter. I usually do this in my room or at my laptop in the office in out house. I really like to be alone. Even if I am a social butterfly, I like my space and my privacy. Although my way of relaxing or escaping to others can really be hetic on its own. I guess my escape is distraction. This is usually all really good for me when I am really pissed off or upset.  When I am in a good mood, I like also to escape. You know what I mean? Stay in the moment for as long as I can. Also during this I love music to help. I play Ani, Dispatch, J. Buffett, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor or some  fun punk or ska or something. Anything that has an upbeat tune to it.  Something I can dance around the house to, or draw to. I really like teh feeling like I am just barely on the ground. When my heart and body are just so in tune with everything else, and music is the greatest way so far that I have to achive this. . . .

      Escape...hmm..does sex count? How 'bout pornos? Writing, music and reading are escapes to some degree. I guess it depends on what exactly are you trying to escape. As mentioned to some extent by others, I tend to try and gear my life that is avoid of things to escape from. If work sucks that much that I feel it is creating some sort of sepereate life for me, a life not that enjoyable, a life that I would need to escape from- then I just quit the job. It's very easy to find enough escapes and realize that all you've ever done is just that, escapte.  Real change, real growth comes from taking chances and standing up for the convictions of your life. And if those convictions include a "life worth living" then escaping is merely only trying to be comfortable in the trench you've dug for yourself. But I suppose a 'release' and an 'escape' are different two different things.

      What can anyone really do to escape life, but die?  Morbid, yes, but true. To escape from the madness that life brings on a daily basis, I tend to either play video games or write.  You would think that I would've gotten good at both, but unfortunately not.   But I suppose that's why its a hobby and not my job to do these things.  Sleep is a good way to just forget about lifes troubles for a while also.  Escaping love?  Is that even possible?  I've been told that love just has this crazy way of finding you, and once you are found... you can't espace...EVER!  I think that I've been in love maybe twice in my life, and according to the movie "A Bronx Tail", I only have one good one left in me.  Sad if that's true, but I just feel sorry for the last one that finds me.  I'll probably cling on to it until all the life has been sucked out.  Is there a term for guys that do that?  I know for the ladies it called being a suckubus.  Anyways, everyone needs a good release every once in a while.  Fortunately for myself and others, I am working while they sleep and vice versa.  So I really can't take my frustrations out on other people.  But I've been told that's not really healthy either.  But when I do escape for a while... just take a drive... listen to either Kid A or Amnesiac.   "I'm a reasonable man, get off.  Get off my case!".

      On the 9-11 observance.    I don't know what would be appropriate.  I'm sure some grand public speech or something will be given at ground zero, and that's great, but that's what they always do.  No matter what the occasion/tragedy, someone stands up on s chair and gives aspeech about how important what happend here/there was.  I mean I'm sure I won't a whole lot different from a regular day.  Not that what happend isn't important with me.  It's just I'll save the real mourning/ceremony for the people that were there, or lost someone there.  I'd just feel like I was cheapening the grief of those  people cause who am I?  Y'know?  What I think should happen and what I'll probably do is take like twenty minutes for myself.  No TV, no music, no work, no nothing.  Just think about what I think is important or something.like that and try to hold on to it during my whole day.  Everyone should just take 20 minutes and let all their bullshit float away and think about what's truly important to you, and how you're making things a little better.  I don't know I feel like I'm talking out of my ass here.  On escape.  Video games are a big one.  A half hour or so and I am so relaxed.  I read.  Lots of sci fi.  But my favorite one right now?  I go to Borders/Barnes & Noble.  Smoke down in the parking lot, take a snack and a pop inside and grab like 3 hours worth of comic trade paperbacks/graphic novel and chill out with comics for a few hours.  Wasteful, but almost all of the tension or worry's that I had when I came in are gone.

      I'd say it depends on what I'm trying to escape from. From family, I get in the car and go for a drive listent o music and sing at the top of my lungs, or go and visit friends. Work is something to do between weekends. Don't get me wrong- I take it seriously. I'm just not the kind of person that gets stressed out in the workplace so to get away from 'it' I simple go home. From friends, I usually don't need an escape, I'm usually not around them for such an extended period of time where all the little annoying qualities come out. Come to think of it, the only time I need an escape is when I'm getting bored with the mundane and usual, or I have way too much energy. So then I either watch a very dramatic, passionate, often sad movie to snap me back into reality, or I find a park- depending where I am- the greater Brighton, Ann Arbor, or Rochester areas, I find a park and walk, kayak, or bring some paper and draw/write. I find that being out in nature and receiving a good massage the most theaputic things out there.

      I don't think I've caught up just yet ...   on what to do on 9/11..  hmm, what did they do on dec. 7 1942? or say '45 even?  I suppose the world was very much a different place in most respects, but especially in regard to the media...  I think it's Fox (surprising me) that will run its normal broadcasts, but will run them commercial free. At least that's what I heard, I can't confirm it. Anyway I think that isn't such a bad idea, because do we really need every channel to cover 'whatever' ceremony? And if I go the whole day without seeing some goddamn verizon comercial , or that insipid, stupid, inane, vapid car comercial where that goose chin techno girl does her little stupid stiff bullshit dance to that "without you" song, I will be happy.   If it were up to me (and it never is) I would suspend all programing for the day, with the words "in memory" displayed.  I feel any further confabulation with me,  on this subject, within this forum,  would be amiss, since I'm simply a wry cretin when it comes to most things. Stick that in you fife and smoke it!

      Well it was already a national holiday. It's been the UN's  "Day of Peace" since like 1983 or something. We need some sort of additional observation of course. I don't think attacking someone else is the proper thing to do, but then again, given who we're dealing with we should do something.  What about Ground Zero? What should we do with those grounds?  I am all about building something fantastic to stand in it's place. There should be some sort of memorial, but at the same time we should show them we will rise above anything. They attacked them because skyscrapers are a representation of American life. Hoping to break us apart, they made us 10x stronger. The empty space in the NY skyline needs something to replace the twin towers.

      Well, I've been nominated to put up this week's topic. Here it is: What should we do on the September 11th anniversary? As a country, locally, personally, etc. Should it become a national holiday? Should there be memorial concerts on TV with corporate sponsors? Should we take the extreme approach put forward by some to attack Iraq on 9/11 as some sort of memorial or symbolic event? What do you think of the possibility of other terrorist attacks on that day as a symbolic event? What do you think?

      on regrets  one thing I regret,  that one little moment in time, a flash, a few words and then boom, there it is- regret, was during my seventh grade year, playing basketball against one of our school rivals. We were going back and forth,(both in the literal sense that we were going back and forth over the court, and in the figurative sense as the score was going back and forth between who was winning) but there isn't enough drama for me to play this out, really. Anyway I was really trying to get some rebounds and I kept pushing against this defender. A natural move, and a semilegal one at that. He was so perturbed, so upset that I kept moving him out of the way, that he did some sort of cry baby face and yelled 'quit pushing'. Now, I'll admit this next part with shame...at some point later in the game, shortly thereafter, I actually said "sorry about pushing you". What the fuck? I regret it because I did stop pushing him, and subsequently didn't do as well as I could have. Years later when I was playing at a higher level I found out how much better I was at 'getting into position" (which is slang for pushing), and realized that my sense to have everything balanced overcame my sense to do well, and I let some cry baby little fuck change the way I did something, I really regret not stepping up and not pushing...the defender, and myself.

      On trips  I heard my uncle's voice shouting to me. I heard something in his voice, something that was serious, something fearful in an otherwise fearless man. He told me something happened to Grandpa...maybe he said heart attack, maybe I just knew. Something instinctive inside triggered, my heart suddenly beat faster and an overwhelming sense of worry struck me the moment he shouted. We're going to the hospital, he said. My eyes and my heart kept asking "what's going on?". I was old enough to know, but the fear, the oncoming sense of loss, propelled me into something almost childlike. Had to be strong, like him, like Grandpa. Had to show Grandma that everything would be okay, the foundation was strong. Had to show Mom that there was no reason to worry any more than the situation called for, had to be strong. I don't remember the trip to the hospital, other than thinking that. The doctor said 'he's gone....come in...say good-bye..." Tears pushed on my eyes so much they hurt, had to be strong...show my uncles that I was tough like them...we walked into the room, where he lay....defeated...my grandma wails out 'what am I going to do now?'  as she clutches his hand. We whisper good bye, my vision blurry, tears soak my face...my breath shortens up....everyone whispers good bye. They had to pull my Grandma back. If I only make one of those trips in my life, that will be fine with me, though I somehow suspect it won't be...such is life, such is death.

      ON A TRIP:  My first time I watched a garbage truck look as though it was EATING A DUMPSTER.  That same time we were chilling out in a park at 3am and as we became surrounded by them, we found it was funnier to refer to them as "wildlife" and not "animals" or "ducks."  One time a friend of mine didn't know where he ended and the rug floor began.  One time a friend of mine and myself laughed ourselves silly repeating "THE BATHTUB IS ALSO THE DOORSTOP"   One time we walked from our house in downtown Grand Rapids up the freeway on ramp that had been shut down the day before. We proceeded to walk down GR's illustrious "s-curve" since the cars had all been detoured. We got to a large chasm in the middle of the concrete structure over the city and decided it was a good time to turn back. After all, we had already proven that it wasn't shaped like an S at all.  One time my friend couldn't even talk and when he pointed at his feet the other guy with us said "I think M*** just realized that he has feet." M*** pointed at us and shook his head 'yes.'  One time we went into Meijer and hunted each other with water squirt guns until they made us leave.  One time we couldn't stop laughing in the bathroom at 12 Oaks because the guy in the stall kept asking us to STOP LAUGHING IT ISN'T FUNNY.  One time I had the fourth dimension explained to me with a shaker of salt.  One time I left the coney island as 3 cop cars pulled up. They thought I pulled a breaking and entering. They left us alone after making me throw a metal bowl and some smokables down into the sewer.  One time I laid down under an oak tree and watched the helicopter leaves falling from above for hours.  One time we fell asleep together after a Phish show in Indianapolis. Awoken by the sound of the alarm as she's screaming "TURN OFF THE ALARM CLOCK" I sit up.. decide I am still tripping.. and I inform her that it's not the alarm clock on fire, it's the plastic television case we left the candles burning on that is causing the fire alarm to blare.  One time M*** climbed a flag pole because he wanted to and I had to watch.  One time we stared at the wall and the world melted away.  One time I decided that I could rob a bank if I wore a hat because no one could recognize me without my hair.  One time C**** fought with 6 police officers and got beaten to the ground.  One time everyone stood on the rails of the World Trade Center observation deck and were declared  "The Highest High People In New York."  One time I threw the phone out the 5th floor window so M*** in the grass could talk to D****** on the phone. It smashed into the 2nd floor window. Fortunately, I knew the people in that room. I found out a week later they were also very messed up that night and freaked out when they all thought something hit the window but couldn't see anything since I had pulled the phone cord to retrieve the phone before they looked outside. D****** still tells people I threw her out of a 5th floor window.  One time M*** got really mad because we walked for what seemed like ages to reach a brick structure he wanted to sit inside of and as we got within feet of it a sprinker went off and squirted right where he wanted to sit.  One time my cousin called and asked me to fill in a shift at the Taco Bell he was managing. I explained that I was watching the walls move. He assured me that I would have to do minimal work such as dishwashing and filling little nacho bags full of nachos. I went in. I kept screaming that the water in the sink was a whirlpool that was going to suck me in. I dumped a whole can of salsa into the trash because it looked really neat as it slid out. Everyone thought I was retarded. You can imagine their surprise when I kept on working there for a year and never again acted like I did the first day.   One time I walked 20 miles to a Steak and Shake through cornfields in Indiana because I had no one to hang out with and it sounded like a good idea. It was actually really great (except for the haunted looking house I had to walk by) and I took a cab home at the perfect time. As I got there, the person in the tent waiting for me was 5 minutes away from being ready to leave back to Michigan.  One time I watched Pulp Fiction upside down at the State Theatre. I laid down in front the screen and look back at it. I decided my brain would flip the image to make it right like it does when you are a baby and you are born with vision upside down. It didn't work. (Which is actually good because I ended up driving later which would have been hard if my vision was upside down.)  One time we stared into the glass of Yuppy Puppy Daycare Center and decided that it had to be a hallucination.  One time we were hanging out in a park and a car alarm sounded like helicopters surrounding us as it said words like "You are in a restricted area"  "Step away from the vehicle."  "You are not authorised to be here."  One time I noticed that the platform we returned to from earlier was NOT the one that would take us BACK to Long Island. It would take us to New Jersey.  VERY LOUDLY  on this New Years Eve in 1998 I proclaimed "I think these trains go to New Jersey. We don't want to go to New Jersey. Hell, I bet all these people going there now don't WANT to go there but they HAVE to because they live there." We quickly left after this statement.  One time Pat noticed we weren't just high this time around.  One time Jason stood on the table at Denny's in Farmington and the only thing that made him sit down was when we said "Jason, you're standing on the table at Denny's in Farmington pointing to faces the wood grain forms and telling everyone about it."  One time I went swimming and when I went into the bathroom to get changed I hallucinated myself into the leach scene in Stand By Me.   One time I figured out how everything works together.  ***** The rules: &#149;If you think you can fly, always start from the ground.. &#149;Whoever is tripping always gets their way, even if sober people have to drive somewhere they don't want to just to see a sunrise or get a slurpee. &#149;Pop Rocks are too much for the mind to handle. &#149;No matter how well you plan the next day, you will always end up trying to function on 2.34 hours of trip-sleep (read: tossing and turning until you blink and it's morning.) &#149;If the windshield wipers are on and it's not raining, you shouldn't be driving.

      A good trip story.  Ok got one.  First time on acid.  It's going fantastic.  We went for a walk and watched the stars.  I'm checking out music on acid for the first time and Dan walks in and says "Get up Dude, we're going for another walk."  So five tripping people and one drunk guy go for a walk in the middle of the night TO THE CEMETERY.  It was all Haylee's idea.  She wants to go so we go.  As soon as we get there she starts crying and saying she dosen't want to be there.  Then the drunk guy takes a branch and LIGHTS IT ON FIRE.  It quickly turns into a glowing ember and all the tripping people go "oooooooooo."  Then the drunk takes the glowing hot ember branch and JABS IT AT OUR FACES.  Naturally we freak.  After we calm down the drunk guy starts trying to light a brush fire.  We all decide to LEAVE.  [Editors Note: The fire station was called by neighbors as hours later a small fire was brewing.]   Drug induced trips... can't help you there.

      Alright kids.  I've got a new trip.  I started the first day of Alpine valley (around 1pm when Phil and Friends came on stage), tripping on two hits of acid.  It was kinda weak, but I sure was laughing alot and seeing lots of sweeeet visuals.  Then, as we were walking out of the show, this dude dosed us with some mesculine.  Sure, Why not?  Free?  SURE!  But, that's not the trip I was talking about either,  we get to back to the VW and my girlie Katie has a friend with a Nitrus tank.  UMmmmmm....yummmm, yum.  So, we sit in the car for 3 hours until we are pushed out.  But, I don't know if any of you guys have ever phished out on balloons before, but I finally figured out the base of the trip.  Everything is going backwards.  I've never done it with so many people, so this time i noticed how AMAZINGly in tuned with each other everyone was.  Everythihng was going backwards, or just slower.  In line, around the circle, everyone was answering what the person next to them had said seconds before!  Yet, everyone has no idea when they're finished.  It's such a crazy thing.  And that my friends, is a Small aspect of what I can remember from that trip.

      Trips, but not as in road trips...hmm.  Your ideas intrigue me. Sometimes while at work I get these out of body type expierences where my mind will take me to places the eyes have yet to see.  Not geographical either.  It might be considered spiritual, but at these moments I feel at total peace with the surroundings my mind has created for me.  Then two minutes later I snap out of it and realize I am at a crappy drug store.  Oh cruel fate, how you tempt me so only to put the preverbial slap to my face.  Drug induced trips... can't help you there.  To quote South Park's Mr. Mackey:" Mmm drugs are bad, mmm-kay!"

      When I had to work at McDonalds in 1995 after I left CMU I used to get really pissed off that I had to run the drive thru for income. As a way to help myself get thru this challenging portion of my career history, I would take little trips into the walk-in cooler. Where I would almost meditate to stimulate my mind to a feeling where I felt high. These three minute sessions would releive the stress of the day and take me into another place for a spell.  Frequently as I go around in this world I have little moments where I stop participating and start observing myself. Sometimes it's in the middle of a conversation but mostly it occurs when I am absorbing the environment aorund me, running into a forest for an afternoon adventure, overlooking the skyline from a stimulating vantage point, pulling over during a road trip to sit at at rest stop and lie in the grass, etc.   It's a way to step outside of myself and notice I am actually alive and I can do anything I set my mind to.  You get all rushed around through life it's good to take a few moments to take it all in.   What's a drug enduced trip? I don't get that at all.

      I'm going to pick....... Trips ~ And not like vaCATION trips. Like... Real trips. They don't have to be drug enduced , they can be a feeling, or an environment.   I'll start. I'll talk about my last trip. I just tripped on LSD at a show in Michigan. It started off (at 2pm) dropped the hit. I drove to the venue....got into the lot. Started peaking and sat down to take a look around. Everything seemed normal. It was the Allman Brothers and Phil Lesh. I was convinced that Allmans were opening so you should've seen me Jump to my feet when I heard Phil on the stage. I ran to the front..gave them my ticket and ran into the venue. Up the stairs..up the stairs. To the top. Whoa! The whole fucking venue was in my view. I went down and rocked out to Phil in the front row. Then..the Allman brothers came on stage for the evening show. I was a bit disappointed..but damn..the Allmans do rock. THe trip turned strange because..this was the first time Tripping in this kind of environment. Bikers/Hippies. Tie-Dye/Leather. It was amazing how beautifully it went together. The backdrop the Allmans had had me glued. I was coming down for the Allmans. Beautiful colors and people. It was awesome. One of the best trips I'd had in awhile.

      I regret sacraficing myself everytime I thought it would be easier than actually confronting a problem or issue at hand for the past 2 years. I regret changing myself to be how other people want me to be. Luckily that's all different now. I am champion of the world. Everyonce in a while I wonder if I should have quit playing the piano, or that I bought a car instead of going to Europe after my senior year in high school. But there's nothing I can do about those, they're forever ago. Other than that, I usually win. I can accept no and understand why I did/didn't do certain things so far in life and take them away- I still think I'd do them over again, if only at a differnt time in life.

      How do I like it? It really depends on the mood I am in. A lot of times I like to get "fucked", and sometimes I like to "make love". I love it hard core, raw and wild. The best is "69".  I have the best organisms ever! I also enjoy "doggie style", riding, and last but not least riding backwards! I usually get it 4 times a week. When I am a good little girl.... I love it. It is totally relaxing and sensual. You can put all effort in it and tell that you were the shit. It turns me on when the man cums. It makes me feel like "who's yo'MAMA".. - I did it! I made you cum because I am the Shit! LOL. As far as TV goes there is enough on there. If you need more- rent a Porno.

      Not quite an astronaut but, when I was 4, I wanted to be a Taxi driver. I had watched Muppet Babies and saw Kermit the Frog give some guy a ride to the moon and then was paid 1 million dollars for his faire.

      Is my life anything like how I pictured it when I was younger?!?!  NO!  You know how I pictured my life at the age of 24 when I was a wee little lad?  By the age of twenty-four I pictured myself to be a successful writter, engaged and not worrying about any finances.  What my life is really like... I am single, haven't even been to college long enough to even full-fill any requirements for becoming a true professional.  The kicker to it all, I live with my brother and we share my car.   Lots of kids have big dreams when they are growing up as to what they want to be.  They start off at the age of four or so.  You start off "I want to be a fireman, or a police officer!", "I want to be an astronaut!"... and so on.  But I never once uttered the words that I want to be a supervisor working midnights in some retail place.  I don't believe any kid in their right mind would.   I don't regret the situation I am in... afterall regret only leads to anger and depression.  I am working to get it all back together though and that's all anyone in my situation can really do.  When I was 16 and thinking about my future, I pictured myself a writter... before writter, my choice occupation was going to be lawyer.  Either way you look at it, I dish out a lot of crap in my choosen profession and get paid for lying.  But shortly after I turned sixteen was when I met the lovely Mary Jane... and she made me forget about everything I wanted... even helped me fail a few classes.  But I kicked the bitch out.  So my choosen dream profession is now a sports journalist.  I think to the level of Mitch Album as far as my ideal recognition is concerned.  Was I talking about the right topic hear, or did I just go off on a really bad tangent there.  If I missed it, sorry guys!

      16, that would be like what, my sophomore year of high school? In the big picture of it, I have done/am doing what I always thought I would be. I'm going to school and I'm working at good job, and eventually I plan on having a family. That has always been the ideal, even younger than 16. But in truth, those are things I always thought of as a given. I always knew I'd be doing this. I never had any specific goals just the general living the good life. I can't say I ever had any one passion that I needed to follow, just be happy and follow my own mind. The things I wanted to do, I've done. The things I haven't done yet, I know will happen eventually.   Now in the small picture, at 16, I would have never guessed the paths I've taken to get here, nothing too wild or crazy- just not the me I was when I was 16. I was a lot more idealistic and serious, now I'm much more relaxed and open. I wouldn't have thought I would be like this, even a year ago. The big picture hasn't changed, just the small things.

      When i was younger i wanted to be able to write stories and draw characters.   I have a bachelor of science in film/video animation but I can still not draw well.  As for the stories, I've opted to tell them with audiovisual aides instead of pen and paper.  By day I type in the text that lawyers write for commercials, find specific videotapes without enough information, assist in the creation of visual commercial art, or make copies of finished spots. By night, I am Batman. No, ok, at night I do my own thing, write or shoot /edit videos, animate OTHER peoples drawn work or do what I did all day staying late on a job. It makes for a lot of free dinners and lunches but not nearly enough freetime to do all the things I want to do, making about 2/3 of the money I did before I got a job in the field my degree is in. Yet, I am thrilled to be alive 99% of my waking hours and love the industry I chose and the company I work for.

      I remember reading something in the X-men once.  It was a french saying that I believe goes a little like this:  La plus ce change; La plus ce meme chose (or something like that).  Loosely translated:  The more things change; the more they stay the same.  On some levels my life is no where near where I thought it would be (for one I thought I'd be graduated by now).  But on most Wednesdays I'm still at Dan's reading comic books (Wednesday, for the uninitiated is the day that new comics hit the stands).  In about 15 months I will be (fingers crossed) an official teacher in the State of Michigan (what I want to be hasn't changed).  But my major is now in English not History.  I find that as time goes by the details are what change.  The general pictures still remains however.  Back in my goth days (a detail that has fortunately changed) I remember being amused that the vampires in Anne Rice's novels didn't change over the centuries they just became more like who they truly were.  I think that is very true of people too.  By 16 even if we don't know WHO we are we kind of know WHAT we are in terms of our behavior and how we react to certain stimuli.  Is my life now what I thought it'd be like when I was 16?  No way.  Am I like I thought I'd be? With a few details that have matured I think so.

      Well as a male part of me wants no part in this conversation.  Far be it from me to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body. I understand the arguments "against nature...wasn't ment to be...blah blah blah."  But that's kind of what modern technology and modern medicine is all about.  I met a co-workers niece once who was just the most adorable littel girl I had eve seen, and her mother was able to concieve only because of fertility drugs.  Now I'm not about to tell that woman who was fortunate enough to give birth to such a great kid that it shouldn't have happend.  With everything there is some risk, even natural child birth.  Is it ok/right for a woman who is maybe/definatley past the "traditional/biological" child-bearing age?  I have no clue, and I'm very glad that ultimately (despite what input any future theoretical mate I might have asks for) it is not a decision that I have to make.

      On issues like this, I tend to take the traditional side. I can respect the idea of holding off on having kids until your older, being young with kids isn't for everyone. But I'm not a fan of fertility drugs for women who have a 'limited' chance to get pregnant due to their age. With the drugs, all of a sudden she has like 4-6 babies and in truth it's costing us tax payers when they can't afford the bill. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't want to be a ' special case' in any books. I'd rather have children before I can't have them without the help of modern medicine.   This stem cell idea, sounds good if you want only one child at a time. The cloning part disturbs me. Makes me think of that part in the Matrix, or an article I read by Johnathon Swift (The guy who wrote Gulliver's Travels) about Ireland growing babies to feed the British. It was a satire, if you're curious look it up.

      OK, I will go first. I think that if you wait until you are old as hell, you should not try conceiving. By the time your kids 20 you might be 6 feet under. A lot of women are trying "Stem cells", they have 4 eggs frozen, when women do this 99% of the time they can get pregnant with one egg and sperm, Then that means that there are 3 left. With those 3 eggs they want to testing on cloning and shit. I am so not for that. So My whole theory is have a child, before your biological clock runs out .

      Actually, I did nearly everything I had set out to do. I met a lot of new fun great people, got to know my friends better, healed old wounds, wrote some, a lot actually just not here, went on a few trips, landed a high paying internship that resulted in part time position while I go to school, earned the respect of very good contacts at a major national conference, manages to save up money for my "Going to Europe Fund", secured my own apartment for the school year. But I think the big difference about this summer compared to others was I did what I wanted. I took the chances and reaped all the rewards. I have a big dose of common sense with an equal portion of curiosity and mischief. I win. It was no trip to Europe, but someday soon....

      MI = Michigan. They were talking about a Michigan left turn. A crazy twist is what they call it in the upper peninsula of Michigan- it's called a Yooper Loop. So what's a yooper? I'm guessing non-Michigan people wouldn't get it. I'll explain, a yooper is a sort of northern-lumberjack version of a southern hick. There was a band formed in the U.P. called the Yoopers who brought us great songs like "The second week of deer camp" or "Gandpa got ran-over by a beer truck" Which they then turned into "Grandma got ran over by a reindeer" for the festive holiday season. Still don't know what a yooper is? Go rent Escanaba in the Moonlight. It's great, I had seen the play it's based off of by the same name at the Purple Rose theater that Jack Daniels own in Chelsea, Mi. They used most of the same actors from the play in the movie.

      Daylight savings time bothers me to no end.  For one, I had to work that night (and as some of you know, I work midnights), so I had to stay at work for an extra hour.  Plus, since it turned back at two in the morning back to one, that meant that all the drunks had an extra hour to buy their alcohol.  That upset me to greatly seeing as even though they had that extra hour, there was still the "last ten minutes left to buy" rush.   Plus now it is getting lighter earlier.  I liked to drive home and have it somewhat dark when I got home.  I believe that this whole daylight savings is a plot against me!

      Public Transportation in Chicago blows! If you compare the time you spend in traffic and the time you are on a train or bus - You are better off dealing with road rage! It costs $1.50 for one way and $ 1.80 for a transfer which gives you two rides.

      In a Kinko's in the middle of the night a man came in and asked me to color copy some $20 bills. I said. "No way, the FBI would come after me." (It's actually the Secret Service that would I would later find out.)   He then proceeded to scream at me. "JOHN ENGLER IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FBI!!!"  And after a few of those I let me know he had to leave as I was picking up the phone to call the cops. He scampered out, but then stuck his head in a few moments later to give me a final one and then ran away.

But Dan asked me to choose a topic in case no-one has yet.  So if the topic you see to the left is in fact new, disregard this message.  If not, then the topic for this week is... what is the craziest, most weird thing to ever happen to you while working?  If you feel your jobs have been uneventful, then talk about the thing you hate most about your job right now, or the worse job you ever had.

      Books. (1. In honor of Holloween I'm reading short stories from this anthology of ghost stories I got from Borders last week. I have this love/hate relationship with fear. As long as they don't sound too realistic I'm ok with it. But I read this one Thursday night and ended up not being able to fall asleep. Stories, movies, plays tend to really affect me. I get so sucked in, by making their experiance my own in my head. (2. Carmen. It's the book-translated of course, that the opera Carmen is based off of. I'm totally digging it, because I already know the plot owning the opera on CD and reading the plot, I like how it adds in the details. This book also from my recent trip to Borders (3. Then finally, The Kalevala- Epic Story of the Finnish People. It's an on-going thing. It's also in little sections or "cantos" so it makes it easier to read. And then also, the text books.   I'm in an exceptionally great mood today and feeling no fear, and well you asked...Sex, it very much depends on my mood. Like there's the "Lords of Acid" kinds of moods vs. the "Celine Dion" kinds of moods and all the in-betweens. Right now, there's no one in my life I exactly want to be sleeping with and where I thought I'd die without it, I find myself keeping a busy schedule and just not thinking about it. If I'm watching a movie and a sex scene come on while at my parent's house yeah I'm going to sit and squirm, but if hanging out with friends I don't have a problem with it. I'm a silly person so I might make a joking comment about it, not as a defense mecahnism but rather because it was thought provoking and that's what I thought of first. Should there be more or less on tv? I have no opinion, I don't care either way. I don't have a child to worry about, I'm not worried about my younger sister, I have confidance that she'll be true to herself whatever she chooses down the road.

      I'm reading Noam Chomsky's  9/11  and the banned in China   Falun Gong  by Li Hongzhi whenever I have a free moment, I keep them in my car and read when I have time to kill.  I don't make enough time to read. Unless you count comic books... X-Men is pretty cool lately.. it went bi-weekly so its like a double dose for the last few months. The next issue has a refugee Afghani Muslim joining the X-men team. Daredevil has been cool, they spread his identity all over the papers so he's been dealing with that. The Incredible Hulk has been phenomenal, Bruce Banner is on the run from the law so he shaved his head and the Hulk looks BAD ASS with a bald head.

      Ah yes, thinking in bed. For me it's a three step process. First, I get into bed and lie on my back and and think about what I need to do/get done tomorrow, in the next fews days, make mental lists, etc. Quite often I'll remember oh shit, I had to do an exam for my online Environmental Law and Policy class by midnight- so then there's me doing it in 5 mins, (sometimes that's all it takes). I'll go to bed then, and then remember I forgot to shut the sound off of my computer. Then go back to bed, then remember the streetlight that shines through the bathroom window and shut the door that connects it to my bedroom. I'll remember to set my cell phone/alarm clock for the appropriate time depending on which day of the week it is. Eventually, I'll run out of things to remember or just get bored and I'll move on to the next step.  Step two, I turn and lay on my side and review my day. Usually just smile, remember little moments and silly remarks that caught my attention, think about the really great people in my life, maybe say a little prayer- give thanks, things like that.   By this time I'm tired, I don't even bother going to bed unless I am tired or I never leave step one. I eventually will feel everything is accomplished then and only then I turn over once again and finally go to sleep on my stomach.   The first thing I think about when I wake up? Lately I'll wake up and smile and think about the things I had thought about during step two just before I went to bed. Otherwise, it depends on the day actually. It's either ok- gotta get ready for work   now   no time for the snooze, or hit the snooze about 2 time and go to class. On the weekends, usually I can breathe. On days I'm not in a rush I will without fail remember my dreams and quite often write them down or tell the first person I see in the morning about it. Usually my friends will humor me, and listen, but I know they're not nearly as awake as I am, or they're getting really good at the smile and nod thing. I think the most important part of that interaction is just hearing myself out loud so I can reflect on it, make an attempt to interpret it and so forth.

      Right now I'm looking forward to playing our next show, and looking forward to our Five Shows in Five Nights at Five Different Venue even that we are starting to set up. I"m looking forward to finishing this little story I'm exclusively working on... I'm looking forward to this book project that has been in the works for some time and is now just awaiting final proofs. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, to christmas, to the hundred or so books I want to read this upcoming year, to working at a new job, to having my endeavors bear fruit,  to ideas that make me shake my head, to people that make me angry and enable me to overcome myself, to people that argue with me to strengthen my point or to show flaws in it, to the warm embrace of a loved one, to the first cup of coffee after an intense night of drinking and philosophizing with other boozing chums, to really cute girls walking by, to a simpsons episode I haven't seen, to ones I have and love. Like food to a hungry stomach, I look forward for each and every moment of life, and furiously chew in a glutinous manner whatever life has to give me. I hate the bad, but I love overcoming. I hate that I had to spend 2000 bucks on a new shitter and some pipes, but love that I was able to figure it out and make it all work. I love that I need to make almost 2500 dollars a month and I'm considering quitting my job. I look forward to how that will resolve. Sure there is pain, there is suffering, there is weird cough in the morning, an ache in my joints, but it is all life, and I look forward to someone reading this and responding. Good, bad, or otherwise.

      The last thing I really looked forward to was leaving town to follow Trey Anastasio on his summer tour. I knew people along the way, but the driving to and from was by myself. First I went to Chicago, picked up Pam, drove to Milwaukee, picked up Athena, then we went to the  urlLink Alpine Valley show .   Next stop was Indianapolis. I went alone to the  urlLink Deer Creek show , but I bumped into tons of people I knew on the lawn (could you do that in Indianapolis when you live in Detroit?)  I went to Kinko's and made up some backstage passes as I had been studying them at both shows and knew all the artwork used on the passes were also used on the PDF about the tour on the phish website.  Up next was Ohio, I had two days to get there though. I made friends at a rest stop and spent the night with them We found a campground by a lake and went swimming, then we drove to the  urlLink Polaris show  together and I never saw them again once I got there. I did bump into about 12 friends from Michigan and we partied it up there, but I lost my pass when one security guard noticed it was a fake, he even told me it was a great fake, and said he was sorry for taking it. The other 80 people I showed it to didn't notice it was self-made, he must have been on the design crew or something because it was definately passable as real at a glance. I should have made more than one for myself.  I ended up leaving the show early because It was too similar to the other two shows I had already seen. I was sick of being in Ohio and just wanted to get back to Michigan.  Overall, I looked forward to this for months, but didn't enjoy it as much as I would have hoped. I should have started earlier, maybe caught a show on the east coast or something, the midwest stuff gets boring after too long. I had a LOT of fun along the way, but something was missing...  ( Page, Mike and Fishman maybe???)

      Just voted.... mad absentee style from 600 miles east. There's a ton of stuff on the ballot in michigan to decide... basically the power structure of the state is at stake. A Senator, Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, and the usual representatives and judges... it's a big deal, people. I urge you guys to vote your consciences.. check out any of the newspaper web sites or online voting guides, figure out what you want to support, and go do it.   urlLink http://www.detnews.com/politics/index.htm   urlLink http://www.freep.com/index/politics.htm   Any of you creative and artsy types in Oakland and Wayne Counties better go vote for Proposal K...   urlLink http://www.freep.com/entertainment/newsandreviews/pkbox7_20021007.htm  which is a huge arts funding bill. I generally don't unleash my personal political views on the Internet, but it's fairly obvious where a guy like me would stand on that one.   There's other proposals that decide whether we're going to upgrade sewers, let people vote straight party on the ballots or now, how we're going to spend the tobacco companies money from that big settlement, and the like.   My point is: FREAKING GO VOTE.

      I won't go into  candidates , since most people know what they want and aren't swayed with others' opinions.   Well I made up my mind this morning reading the Farmington Observer's take on the  proposals.  They don't have links , but apparently The Free Press agrees with them all, so thats where the links take you to, the explanations by The Freep.  Proposal 1 - ELIMINATE STRAIGHT TICKETS -  No.  To continue straight-party voting, vote  no on Proposal 1.   urlLink [The Freep]   Proposal 2 - ENVIRONMENTAL MONEY -  Yes.  This investment in clean water won't fix everything, but it moves the state rapidly in the right direction.   urlLink [The Freep]   Proposal 3 - STATE CONTRACTS -   No.  Asks voters whether state employees should be entitled to binding arbitration to settle their contracts.  urlLink [The Freep]   Proposal 4  - TOBBACO FUNDS -  No.  The proposal is being pitched as a way to put Michigan's share of the national tobacco settlement money into anti-smoking efforts, but it doesn't do that.   No.  Proposal 4 is wrong way to reprioritize money.   urlLink [The Freep]   Proposal K - K IS FOR KIDS -  Yes.   Proposal K, on the ballot in Detroit and Wayne and Oakland Counties, is also about economic development, regional cooperation and quality of life. All these elements make it worth supporting. The tax revenue would provide one stable funding base for not-for-profit organizations that now pursue funds through myriad changing sources -- including the state, private donations and ticket sales. It also would allow them to do more outreach in the communities that pass the tax -- it must pass in all three jurisdictions to take effect -- focusing especially on children and senior citizens.   urlLink [The Freep]

      Is it just me or does Christmas seem to lose a lot of its "magic" once you hit 19 years old??  Here I am at 26, and Christmas is beginning to feel like another capatlist rollercoaster that I'm forced to pay for every year.  Call me a Scrooge, but being a kid seemed to be so much easier.

      Well I am a typical shopper. I like to start picking up things all the time. I start buying gifts after christmas. I like it that way because I always have gifts in my closet so when a birthday comes along I always have something. As of this year though, I have been extremely busy so I am not going shopping until Wednesday. I justed register for Spring semester and that broke me. Financial aid sucks.  Christmas is a huge holiday for my family. But as I grew older it has not meant as much as it did when I was a little kid until now. I have like 12 people (adults) tobuy for, 22 little brats and and 2 grab bags. I think I am going to Wla-Mart!!

      Yeah I'm a very late shopper, mostly because I know exactly what everyone is getting, I just don't get it until later, busy with school and all I suppose. That and the stuff I get people isn't stuff like the latest toy or anything that will get sold out. Just random things. So for I have 2 presents done, something for my mom, and I just ordered a t-shirt of one of my little sister's fav bands online. Hopefully it'll get here but if not, no biggie. Christmas tends to be very casual around my place but still quite cool.

      Same as last year and the year before, I'm only as busy as I let myself get. I know my limits and there are things like school which I won't let take over my life. Luckily work is something I can leave at work and not think about during the rest of my time. I think as time goes on, I may have had more things to get done, but I think at the same time you learn how to deal with it. You just have to choose and pick your battles.

       The Music Industry  is pissing me off left and right. The fact that they are suing individuals AND making ISPs police peoples downloads is bullshit. They are realizing that no matter what encryption they put on a CD we can rip mp3s from it. IF I CAN HEAR IT I CAN RIP IT. as soon as it's an analog signal it can be encoded. Who care's if it's not 100% digital.. it was 100% digital up until it was encoded so what is one generation of quality loss..    Ethnicity Marketing  is funny. I dunno.

Somehow I became co-dependant to him despite my best efforts to stay stoic. Anyway lived with him, I wasn't working anwhere, I owed him money, I did aweful in school that semester, my relationship with my parents were still strained. Then the light at the end of the tunnel. The semester ended, I moved back home, got an awesome internship, learned who I was again and became the once outgoing and silly Anita I used to be.

      By far  the most notable of beginnings and endings have been what I like to refer to as the DAZE. Mornings/Beginnings (distinguished by the buzzing of the alarm clock)  The nite as slumber ends... and the time i fall asleep... the ending of the day but the beginning of slumber Usually in the recliner with a 40 ounce of Private Stock between my legs, and a steady river of saliva trailing down my chin and forming a reservoir on my Cool Aid stained undershirts...  In fact i have them hung in my closet according to what flavored stains are most  predominant...  color coding if you will Some of the shirts are down right art...  (those have their own storage area) i like to keep them balled up along the wall under the bed so the cat hair doesn't ruin them because they are my favorites...   i'm gonna sell them and retire one of these days...  Lately I have been just taking notes of who is and isnt a good friend so when I do decide to sell them, and get really rich, I will know who is and who isnt my friend  (Is that is kinda like a beginning of the rest of my life or something like that?) This is some damn good herbage  Wait what the hell is this about again?    OH YEAH  this is about my art shirts what i consider to be my greatest t-shirt stain masterpiece in the alcohol haze the nite before, may just look like a dirty undershirt the next morning...  but again, it will look really good the following nite as i pull the lever by my right hand back and prop my dirty "once white" socked feet up to enjoy another evening of whacking it to Meredith Baxter Bernie movies on the Lifetime network...  Wait this wasnt about my art shirts its about beginnings and endings  a forty ounce begins and ends... a pack of smokes... a hour movie on lifetime... my sleep... orgasm  well hell I guess even this letter must en

      Funny story, not really about roommates but dorm life in general. Friend of ours,  urlLink Brother Mark  was going to MSU. We picked him up for the weekend on a Friday afternoon. He decided to leave his stereo on in his dorm room all weekend (his roommate was also gone). He left "I Like Traffic Lights" by Monty Python blaring on the stereo. Go download the song and listen to it ten times in a row, you will go crazy I guarantee. You could hear it in the hallway three doors down with his door closed. Needless to say he had many death threats and other assorted things (including a floppy disk) stapled to his door upon his return. But extremely funny nonetheless.

      i think that language and where it is heading is completely relative...   depending on who is verbalizing, and what their intention is with their words...   i believe... (due to personal experience mind you)  that language will eventually evolve to the point of pure understanding void of vocalizations    sound will be used only for therapy, medicine, entertainment, and the like  communication will be so advanced that it will be simple a thought will be transferred and understood without the need for a spoken language   just impulses of energy understood by their vibrational rate...  if youve never experienced anything like this then maybe this excerpt will assist you with what the experience meant to me and how I concluded this seemingly insane hypothesis:    excerpted from Communiqu  Copyright 2002 Vincent Mann  As I gaze into the familiar face of my sole companion The mirror My eyes divide Sectioning  Divided among the spirits  all of whom wish to speak souls eager to be heard by one who can see some overwhelmed with tears of joy others with tears of guilt and sorrow some mighty warriors some brilliant intellects  others still common folk wishing to express their feelings   most wishing to speak  many with words of guidance suggestions or well wishes many of the images and faces that materialized before my eyes were foreign  until I realized how poetic  and moreover how simple the visions were  metaphors materializing before my eyes not verbal or word metaphors but mind metaphors visual metaphors metaphors that originated with the thought  not literal visions but figurative symbols no verbal conversation is exchanged what so ever only thoughts being a simple minded human as all of us are only my responses to the questions are audible communication not a matter of sounds or even the visuals for that matter indeed after a while even the visual metaphors had become obsolete giving way to the simplest form of communication simply  understanding a state of knowing that was so pure that symbolic/visual/audio communication was unnecessary  a form of communication that consisted of a thought and then the understanding... the question and then the answer  this was the epitome!  I thought... Until this simple understanding type of communication segued into a more advanced faster version of the same thing...  As if the mind was given the question and the answer simultaneously  And soon the questions came so quickly that you werent even sure what the questions were But you understood And that you knew for sure Transcending the human experience  Thru intuitive understanding This would seem to be the form of communication that we as  Primitive human begins are capable of evolving into It can be done  That I am certain of

So I went up to him and said, "Come on, man, how about giving a guy a break?"  He ignored me and continued writing the ticket.  So I called him a Elitist Nazi.  He glared at me and started writing another ticket for worn tires!  So I called him a piece of horse manure.  He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket!  This went on for about 10 minutes... the more I abused him, the more tickets he wrote.  I didn't care. My car was parked around the corner.  -nicknamils

       "Pat - I invested my tax return in a mutual fund, and I've lost 15% of it in four months. Does this mean I'm a gibbering moron, or are they conspiring against me? And if they're conspiring against me, what's their plan? What do they want with me? I think they bugged my dog. Did they bug my dog? What if I don't have a dog?"    Mike,  Just leave your money in there. It will be fine. The magical fairies will sprinkle their pixie dust on it and it will grow and grow. And don't sweat it, the mutual fund managers know that all the money they have is everyone's retirement. It's not like people get pensions anymore (well some do). They don't really do anything drastic. You are young, so make sure it's in a growth fund. These have a lifetime rate-of-return around 15-17%. Yes it's more volatile but you aren't going to take that money out for a long time so you can ride out the bumps. By the way, they bug small burrowing mammals mostly, so don't worry about your dog. If you don't have a dog, then I suggest that you invest in one. They won't make you money like the mutual fund will, in fact they cost money to maintain. But you do get companionship. Plus they tend to scare away the small burrowing mammal spies.

       Question: Why is it that every time I turn on the radio, I hear the same five songs fifteen times a day for three months?    Mike, it's called  urlLink Payola . Well I don't know if they still do that but I imagine that some form of it still exists. The multi-mega media conglomerates need to make money so they push certain records. Not because they are good or bad, but because they can be marketed. For every 10-20 small bands they keep on the payroll they need a boy band or big time R&B/rapper. And the radio stations need stead advertisment income so they play the popular records or the ones that the companies say will be big.   If you can't stand hearing the same music all the time, listen to  urlLink WDET  and support your local public radio station. After all, they get your money anyway from the government (but not for long if the lawmakers have their say). And I guarantee they don't replay songs over and over. But you can always do what I do, listen to CDs....

       "Pat, if it's true that what goes up, must come down... then does that mean that the sky is falling?"   It's all relative, so it depends. Another "it depends" answer, I love it. The sky itself might not be falling but you could be, if you were in orbit. You would be falling around the earth. That's why you are weightless, because you are falling. The spaceship is falling but doesn't crash into Earth because it is moving fast enough horizontally to fall around the earth, because Earth is round. Weird, isn't it. Anyway. The sky while not actually falling is moving. The Earth moves around the Sun, The Sun moves around the center of our galaxy and our galaxy is also moving. It's more like we are falling into the sky than the sky is falling into us. Yes it's very trippy. And what goes up does come down, unless it's velocity exceeds the escape velocity of Earth's gravitational field. This speed is about 11,100 meters/second or approximately 25,000 MPH (this does not include air resistance which is a factor).  If it's going that fast, then it will not come down. The object will leave the planet. Neat huh?

      A brief interlude to the Q and A.... Ran across this article about  Fast Food Nation , written by the National Restaurant Association, a lobbying group for the fast food industry.   urlLink The Truth about  Fast Food Nation    Funny, they only quote 3-4 articles, but there are 10-12 quotes. And of course the Rocky Mountain News is going to be pissed. Colorado Springs is his example of what's wrong with America and the paper is very conservative....   A quote from the article, with my rebuttal... "Real power lies in the right to choose, a right that customers exercise each time they make a dining decision. By establishing and maintaining the highest standards, fast-food restaurants are assured of having a vast number of choices made in their favor." - Restaurants & Institutions   2/1/01 (article not available online)  Of course we have the right to choose, the author of  FFN  is not saying that you can't choose fast food. He is merely telling us what in the hell is in the food, because the restaurants won't. He is a voice for the consumer which is something that the companies fear.

       "Pat,   Am I going crazy, or it it the world around me?"   Dan, I would have to answer Yes and Yes. You are going crazy. Everyone does eventually. You are slowly growing into old age where a host of things will destroy your mind and body. But it's not all that bad I swear! Don't worry. And the world is definately crazy. No one has a spare minute anymore to think about the person next to them. No more politeness or courtsey, it's too time consuming. People are more sheltered and don't interact with each other anymore because of modern conveinences, like the internet. I could call you or stop by and visit but it's much easier to e-mail or blog something. At the same time, corporate America is removing the individuality of our communities. How many independant restaurants and businesses are left? Not many, and they usually exist in older "downtown" areas where people go to get away from the corporate sprawl. Sorry I've been reading urlLink  Fast Food Nation , it's extremely interesting and depressing at the same time.

      "Pat, How did that guy die by drowning in a vat of chocolate.. wouldn't we be lighter then the dense chocolate? Shouldn't he have just floated?"  Here is the news story if any of you missed it,  urlLink Man falls into chocolate vat   Well Dan, if you could imagine what liquified chocolate is like... Well it's very sticky and pretty thick but I'm not sure how thick. What I imagine happened is the guy fell off of the platform and probably got stuck. I don't know how he landed, but if he hit face down I don't know if he could move. He's got clothes on and it's not like you could swim through the stuff. He wouldn't sink too far initially, but as he struggled he would start to sink. It totally depends on the viscosity of the chocolate. If it was too thick I think you are right, he would hit it, get stuck, but not sink. Too thin and he could probably swin through it. But I'm guessing it's much thicker than water but not thick enough. Also they really don't mention what the vat was for. If it was a mixing vat which is stirring the chocolate with a big mixing tool, then he's definately a gonner. He'd just get stirred up into the chocolate and suffocate. Maybe there will be a follow up story, we'll see.

      Wow, the questions are exploding and multiplying. "Given the financial means, do you plan to clone yourself? If so (or not!) why and what are the implications of that choice? I can handle it dude. ~mel"  I don't know. If I could clone parts of myself and grow a new kidney or liver then I'd be all for it. Many diseases would be cured if we can grow our own organs and then just get fixed up like a car in the repair shop. But as far as cloning a Pat 2.0 well I don't think so. One of me is enough. Plus, I really think that you are a product of your environment. I chose the career I have and have the beliefs that I do because of my upbringing, I know that. A new me would probably have the same potential as I do, but depending on how and where he was raised it would turn out differently. But if I could make a "mini-me" that would be a different story....

      "Pat... what line from Shakespeare do you quote the most?"  Well, I must say that I haven't read too many of his plays. Mostly the tragedies. I am fond of "Impudent strumpet!" from Othello, although I admit there isn't much use for it on a regular basis. For those of you who skipped Shakespeare the phrase is a nice old-english way to call to call someone a whore.   I guess I like Hamlet though, "Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day." There are so many phrases from Shakespeare that we have put into our lexicon.

      "HEY PAT! When you wake from a dream and make yourself fall back to sleep - WHY don't you go back to the same dream you were in before you woke?? "  Kirstie,  That is an excellent question. I guess it would depend on how awake you were. You only dream when you are in REM sleep. Once you wake up it takes a while for you to get back into REM sleep again so that is probably a reason. Plus your brain is consciously thinking when you wake up so that probably reboots what you were dreaming about. Here are some good links about sleep and dreaming.   A brief paper from someone at Harvard, it's ok.  urlLink To Sleep, Perchance to Dream " This has a really good description of sleep cycles and tries to answer why we sleep (But we really don't know why we sleep.

      "Pat,  Is a Penis Head Man really as scary as everyone seems to think? I don't understand the creature. Please enlighten me."  Well, to be honest Dan, not much is known about the penis-head man (or PHM, as he/it is sometimes known) There is only one rare video of the PHM in existance and I have not seen it (Because certain individuals refuse to host the video on their website, but that is neither here nor there.) Actually, the PHM is a friendly creature who might look strange and scary to us, but is just different. You should use caution of you encounter the PHM in the wild, at a first encounter he can be quite brash. Any yelling, sarcasm, or fun-making is purely a defensive mechanism however, the PHM means you no harm. He is more scared of you than you are of him. You can try to attract the PHM into your own backyard environments as well. The best method would be to have a bar-b-que and have much Canadian beer and marijuana on hand. This seems to be the best combination attract the PHM. Hopefully I can answer your question better in the future as there are ongoing explorations into the PHM's territory, which is rumored to be near Grand Rapids, MI. It would be wonderful to be able to observe the PHM in it's/his natural environment. I will keep you posted.

      Mike (Murphy),   Well I had a nice reply to this, then I switched pages in my browser and it blew it away, so here's the take from an article on mlb.com  The Infield Fly Rule was instituted to protect the offense from a possibly "unfair" double play. If there were runners on first and second (or bases loaded) and less than 2 out, runners would normally hold their base on a pop-up to the infield since the ball would, in all likelihood, be caught. Without the Infield Fly Rule, an infielder could drop an easy pop-up (or let it drop untouched) and turn a double play, since the runners would then be forced. The rules makers didn't think this was fair and instituted this rule.    The Infield Fly Rule is only in effect when runners are on first and second (or bases loaded) and less than 2 out. It states that the batter is automatically out if he hits a fly ball "which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort." The umpires loudly announce and signal, "Infield Fly, batter is out!" so that the runners are alerted that, even if the ball is dropped, they do not have to leave their bases.

      No problem Dan, this one is easy. If you asked some people they would say that the 4th dimension is time. Our world is in three physical dimensions and then it moves through time so that's the 4th dimension. This is an ok answer I guess, but slightly incorrect. There are at least 4 physical dimensions. Einstein (of course) proved it. But more on that later.    We can't directly see into the 4th dimension because we only exist in 3D. What would the 4th dimension look like? Carl Sagan had this thought experiment in one of his books (Cosmos, if I remember correctly). Picture a 1-D world, It would just be a line. 1-D creatures could only exist and move back and forth on this line. Then take the line and add a line at a right angle (90 degrees) to the first line. Now you can move back and forth, up and down, but only in a 2D plane (picture a square). This is the traditional X-Y axis if any of you remember geometry. 2D creatures could be any shape, squares, triangles, whatever - but they only exist on a single plane. Now make another right angle to each direction on the plane. Instead of a square shaped plane now you have a cube. This is the world we live in. Objects can be of any shape, they have length, width and height. Now this is the hard part, which we can't really understand because we don't live in 4-D. Take a cube and make a right angle to each direction on the cube. That is what the 4th dimension would look like. But like I said we can't grasp the concept.   Anyway, back to Einstein. This is how he proved that the 4th physical dimension exists. I forget when they did this experiment but I can look it up if anyone is interested. Einstein predicted this: He said that during a solar eclipse that was upcoming that we would be able to see a star that was behind the sun at the time. Based on the position of the Earth, the Sun and this particular star we should not be able to see it because at the time it would be on the other side of the sun from us. (Remember, the earth rotates around the sun so we knew the star's location already because at other times of the year the star would not be behind the sun) During the eclipse obviously the sun's light is diminshed greatly. And on the edge of the sun, where normally the sun's intense light would make it impossible to see, the scientists did in fact see this star, which should have been BEHIND the sun. But it was not! What was going on here? The 4th Dimension! The light from the star curved around the sun due to the fact that space is in (at least) 4 dimensions. Matter is what causes space to be curved and the Sun is the most massive object in our solar system so it causes space to "curve" more.   Ok, now I have to get back to work. Send in more questions! They can be about anything. I'll answer them all.

       Pat? Is it economical to buy a special router just for an alcoholic ice luge?   Well, you actually don't need a "special" router. Any normal router will do. But I would suggest buying a router bit and only using it for the ice. You wouldn't want to use a router bit that you had previously used on wood, that's just not sanitary. But the question I believe you are asking is, "Is it economical to buy a router for the sole purpose of cutting grooves into a 300 lb block of ice once per year?" The answer to this question is also yes. A decent router can be had for $60 or so and will usually come with a few bits. Now what you have to do is quantify the "fun factor", how much is it worth in some vague "dollar value" to have a party with an ice luge? Priceless. I'd say you'd payback your initial investment in the router instantly. It is way too much fun. And who knows, maybe you'll get the router out sometime and put a nice beveled edge on your deck railing.

If that's the case, then I'd say stay with him until it's legal for him to be here on his own and then give him some new papers, divorce papers. If he's really only with her to get his papers, then the divorce shouldn't be bad at all. He's probably already planning it anyway. She should just tell him, "Hey listen, I have this feeling that you are only with me so you could get your papers, if that's the case, then tell me. Honestly." If he's not honest with her, and frankly women are really good lie-detectors when it comes to men, then he's not much of a husband at this point anyway.

       Pat, Why a best friend of 9 years choose her Boyfriend over me?     Tough one, it's hard to say without knowing the people involved. But it reminds me of when I got in my first real mature relationship and got me a girlfriend, whom later became my wife. My friends were very protective of me and wanted to make sure that she wasn't going to mess with my head... too much. Also it took a while for them to warm up to her. And yes I did spend less time with them as I spent more time with her, which was difficult for me and probably my friends. But you only have so much free time and each person has to decide their own priorities. Eventually my friends realized that I was serious about this girl and they understood why I was with her "all the time". Like I said though, in my situation I knew my relationship was serious and it was worth investing the time into it. I don't know your situation enough. But if it's a serious thing then I'd say she'll make time to hang with you but it might be less than before. But if this is just some fling for her then she's definately blowing you off, which is not cool. If this is the situation, then I bet the guy is either pampering her or is good in bed or something like that. I need more intel on this one for further diagnosis.

       How do you break up with your b/f when he wants to marry you, but you want to be single and enjoy your single life while you can?   Just tell him exactly that. Sure it's going to hurt him, it would hurt anyone. Guys usually admire honesty and like it when you are straightforward. Unfortunately girls will a lot of times be wishy-washy and try to do things with subtletly. And just as unfortunate, guys don't catch on to your subtle things and innuendo. Also I have witnessed many times where one partner wants to break it off but doesn't have the guts to do it. So they try (badly) to get the other person to break up with them. DON'T DO THIS! People usually think that if the other person breaks it off then it's not THEIR OWN fault that the relationship ended and all of the world will take pity on them because they got dumped. Problem with this method is that it usually involves doing bad things in the first place to get the other person to dump you and then just hoping they get fed up with you and decide to end it. So just give it to him straight and if you are right for each other then you can get back together in a few years or whatever. If it's not right and it's not going to be, don't drag him along anymore. He's going to want to enjoy his single life too.

And yeah, it would be a bit weird if Einstein's theories were proven to be wrong. More likely they will just be tweaked a bit. Quantum mechanics, which is the physics of very small particles, was founded because Einstein's theories did not explain the physics of atomic particles. Much work is still being done. In fact a lot of quantum theory and Einstein's theories contradict each other, so there is still much to be learned. Go read some books by  urlLink Steven Hawking , he's the best at explaining all of this.

       Why am I healthy all winter long but I get sick right before my birthday in the dead of summer?   Dan,  It's hard to say, but germs are a year-round thing. Actually one of the reasons "they" think we seem to get more sick in the winter time is because people spend a lot more time inside. Therefore, they are closer to each other, sneezing and coughing on each other and spreading disease. Just be glad you don't have a job like an elementary schoolteacher, they probably get colds all the time since they are around the kiddies who do understand why it is good to wash their hands. But my guess is that you're sick because of dumb luck, sometimes it just happens. Sorry man. Your birthday is in a week, you'll be better by then.

       Pat, SO, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?   Maybe you're too busy trying to do all this stuff and for what? Choose the few things that you really enjoy and focus on those. I think you are streching yourself too thin and since you are so busy you aren't enjoying any of it. When was the last time you had a nice relaxing evening at home by yourself and read a book or watched a movie? You are young and contrary to what the media and advertising are telling you you will not be an old man when you turn 30. There's no need to rush and do everything that you want to do in your life in your 20's. Sure there are some things that are best done when you are younger, but plenty of old people climb mountains too.

       Pat- On Tekken 3 for P/S how do you link four throws together as King?   By the way, the chimps loved this one. I set them down in front of 500 playstations so they could go one-on-one with each other. Eventually one of them mashing on the buttons got it down cold. Here's what he told me. The normal throws are Button 1 & 3 and Button 2 & 4. The four combination throw is this: 1+2,3,4,1+2,1+2+3+4 , it's apparently called Romero's Special after a bit of researching.

       Pat- How do you do it?   Well Michael, since this is an open ended question (my favorite) I will assume that you mean this: "How do you come up with your pearls of infinite wisdom?" I've been reluctant in the past to divulge my sources but I'm feeling a bit saucy this morning so I think I will let you all in on a bit of it. Most of my knowledge is gleaned from the crack team of 1000 chimpanzees that I employ. Only the best and brightest are selected to participate. They are taught sign language so I communicate to them each question that I get. Then they are led into a room with 1000 word processors where they type up their answers. This can take days sometimes as they do get a bit rambunctious. After a few days in the room the answers are collected and the chimps are led back out into their normal living area. Then I put together my knowlege with that of the chimps to form each answer.

       Pat- Is the universe really infinite, or is that just some propaganda that NASA uses so that we don't go out exploring and getting lost?   There are many theories about this. We do know that the universe appears to be expanding, but could still be infinite. Space exists in more than 3 dimensions. Here's one theory that I have. Let's say that you get in your really really fast spaceship and you take off from Earth and try to travel to the edge of the universe in a straight line. Well let's say that space is curved in more than 3 dimensions. What was a straight line in 3D is now a curved path. You could conceivably travel in a straight line and end up back at earth if space is curved enough. Think about driving a car across the country. From your perspective it is mostly flat and straight. But the earth is round more or less, so if you look at a globe and trace your path it would look like an arc. This is just what I think though, there are many other theories out there.

      Pat,  I've noticed that most people are content (or at least satisfied) with a job, a hobby or two, and a close circle of friends. I'm working on six contract jobs, exploring other jobs, have a ton of hobbies and struggle to keep track of people I know and care about.  I had five minutes to eat dinner on Wednesday. I've eaten dinner at 10pm the last three days. Six hours of sleep is fantastic. I get sick every month or so because I run myself down trying to do things, read things, write things, and hang out. And yet I still feel unsatisfied, and discontented.  SO, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?

       So if something good happens too easily should I trust it?   I'd say yes. But if it's too good to be true then be wary. If it is good and easy then that is the best. Hard and good is sometimes more rewarding though. Go with you instinct, that's what I say.

Astronomers have detected what could be a 'missing link' in the development of the universe: mid-size black holes that are neither supermassive nor as light-weight as a handful of stars. These middling black holes were spotted using the Hubble Space Telescope in two separate globular star clusters in Earth's celestial neighborhood, astronomers said on September 17, 2002.

       Do you think living creatures nesting in hardware is a warranty covered situation?   No, the speakers are still working so I don't think that it's covered. They probably wouldn't cover it even if the insects broke the speakers somehow because it's not considered a manufacturing defect. It's only covered if something that is part of the product fails. It's the same as if you spilled pop all over it and shorted it out, they aren't going to cover it because something external to the product caused it to fail. But like I said, most consumer products have a warranty that is only about 1 year max, so if it's out of warranty, just open the sucker up.

Kristie, I am going to assume that you are using some type of windows-based computer. I know there are a few weird people here that have computers from that fruit company, maybe they can help you if you have one of these strange computers. Assuming that you are using Windows, go under "Programs" in the "Start" menu. Run the "MS DOS prompt". Then when the prompt comes up, type "ipconfig" and press return. It will show you your IP address. But most ISP's use dynamic IP addresses so it might change every time you connect to the internet.

      Pat, they say when you are spinning out of control on snow / ice you should turn the opposite way of how you want to react.  Is this for front and rear wheel drive cars?  Rita and I spun out on Saturday as I was teaching her how to drive (she' 19 without a license still)  Anyways, we were turning left and she pulled a 180. Not too much traffic, but still scary.  She said she didn't want to drive again, but I took her to an empty parking lot and made her get over the fear. In my focus (front wheel drive as you know) if you are turning left and you start to spin out, a quick right on the steering wheel gets you own of it.  My dad says 'always turn INTO the spin' but I don't know what that means. It would appear that it means turn left, but I don't understand how that would get you out of the spin.  I couldn't explain it to Rita with words.. it's just a reaction you develop... I don't get it.. She's semi-comfortable now after doing donuts for a half an hour but still it seems like there could be an easier explaination and I just don't understand the physics of it all.

       Pat, they say when you are spinning out of control on snow / ice you should turn the opposite way of how you want to react. Is this for front and rear wheel drive cars?   Listen to your father. Usually when your car starts to slide it is the back tires that will slide out. To counteract this and to get the car pointed straight again you turn the wheel in the direction that the back end of the car swung out. Let's say you are turning left in your example or rounding a corner to the left. The back of the car goes to your right, so you want to cut the wheel back to the right to straighten the car out. Here's the basic physics: Centripetal forces act on the car when you change direction (like turning around a curve). This force is outward from the curve, it would tend to push the car off the road to the outside of the curve. Normally the tires do a good job of gripping the road via frictional forces. But when you hit a slippery part the tires lose friction and the centripetal force takes over and the car slides to the outside of the curve. Now if all four wheels lose friction with the road... Well, you are pretty much in trouble at this point until the front tires get some grip back. In that situation you should turn the wheel in the direction that you want the car to go in, and apply some power. This happened to me actually. On freeway, it was wet. Cut wheel to avoid car in front of me who slammed on brakes. Cut wheel back sharply and overcorrected, send myself into a skid sideways on the freeway. Front of car was facing toward the far left lane, so I cut the wheel to the right so I was pointed back in the right direction.

      Well Dan, that's an excellent question. I wish I was more sober, but  I'll give it a shot. Celsius is actually an SI (Standard International  ?) unit. As well as the metric system is an SI unit (Kilogram, meter,  liter)   Bet you didn't know the basis for the metric system. The kilogram is  measured by the mass of water that is confined by a cubic decimeter  (that's 10x10x10 cm) of water. Which is also the definition of a liter,  a 10x10x10 cm cube. Freaky isn't it. Anyway. Farenheit is just silly  compared to this. Also don't forget Kelvin. This is the same unit as  Celsius but starts from absolute zero, or -273 degrees C.    So freezing temp for water is 0 celsius, 273 K or 32 Farenheit. Convert  Celsius to    fareheit  via the 'Bob and Doug McKenzie method', double it and  add 30. Therefore a 6 pack of canadian beers is about 42 american  beers. Just remember this and you'll be ok.      Yes, it's 2 something AM and I am drunk

It was like we were all heading to the same place, in one fashionable line...  Hey, any Lord of the Rings fans, I saw the film for the third time last night, and they are showing a preview of the second installment, The Two Towers, which comes out in December, following the film (all three hours of it, and let me tell you, that ain't easy to watch at 1am).

      Home safe and sound....  Lazar- You were so right, dude. I dunno what it is but it must be that Detroit mentality of driving that made me go nuts on I-75 when no one would drive faster than 55mph.  Am I rude, or is it cool to hit the gas a little? I live for downtown driving. I hate the highway (when there is other traffic around.) I seriously prevented 5 accidents by being a defensive driver. I'm constantly thinking "what is this asshole going to do." when I'm in traffic.  I dig downtown driving because at least you expect weird shit. You expect cars coming out of alleys you can barely see. You expect people walking into the road. I don't expect the pick up truck to slow down and swerve at me on  the highway with only feet for me to avoid it.  I don't like driving in Ohio at all. If it wasn't for The Pixies, Radiohead and Phish I wouldn't have made it to Kentucky without taking my own life. Something about Dayton that just sucks the life from you. At least Cinncinnati is cool to look at as you pass. There is one good thing about Ohio... it pushes you to LEAVE.. motivating you to get to your destination.  On the road, time is miles, miles go by with songs, and songs let you step outside of the harsh  reality that is the state of Ohio.

      I am now in Louisville, Kentucky. I drove to Russellville, almost to Tennesee (9 hours) to NOT find Brandy's house 'cause she said she lived on 7th, when it's OFF 7th on another street. So I slept in my car, woke up, went to her work, they told me about the little road off 7th.  So I find it, but she's not home. I leave my car there so she knows I'm there and then i come back in about an hour after taking photos around her small little down and looking for lens wipes 'cause my wide angle is dirty as heck.  So this dude wanders over, doesn't really talk to me, I figured he's the neighbor. We make small talk, which is really small because he doesn't really talk like I said.  About 2 hours later, I'm sleeping on Brandy's porch swing, her mom had told me sh ewas running errands and will be back. so this guy comes back and I find out he's her jealous fiance. I am not allowed over. So I just wasted a trip out and one of my 5 days off of the year (2-4 are saved for Phish in Nov/DEC?!?!?! PLEASE!)  Now I'm in Louisville visiting a friend in town from Colorado.  This happened last time I came ot see hte same girl, with a different boyfriend she had. Is it me or somethign about these Kentucky boys that seems a little odd. It's like they view women as property and they can't share friendships between multiple guys.  I don't get it. I just wanna see my friend I haven't seen since Jan 2000.  Shaking My Head, Dan

      The state of the economy as it relates to the unemployment factor...a lofty goal, let's see what we can do.  First off, job security, in today's business environment, is an illusion.  Regardless of what industry you work for, how long you've been there, and whether you're considered a "just cause" or "at will" employee, you can and possibly may lose your job at a moment's notice.  A law may have created your job, but, the next administration could just as easily un-create it.  I work for a University, which normally would leave me with no question as to my future employment status. Two people in our department just got laid-off because their division wasn't bringing in enough money.  The biggest problem people in Detroit are facing (and Dan can back me up here), is that the entire economy of southeastern Michigan is inextricably linked to the automotive industry.  When the economic downturn started, the Big Three made fewer ads (advertising and marketing are also huge), bought less ad time (Detroit is the 9th largest television market in the country), sold fewer cars (nationwide), made fewer cars, laid off workers, and closed a couple factories.  To actually attempt to detail the butterfly effect of that is mind-boggling, but it's not hard to imagine the effect it had on the banks, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, movie theatres, bars, pool halls and shopping malls.  The saving grace of the auto industry was the morning of the 11th of September.  When all this unwashed patriotic brouhaha was first being whipped up by El Presidente, and particularly the part about everybody doing their part, going back to "life as normal," and maintaining the economy, the auto industry kicked in the the 0% financing campaign.  This got people buying cars again (we bought a Focus, mid-October), which is great, but the car companies were losing their asses on it, which, as you might suspect, isn't so good.

      yeah, chicago does have some pretty crazy drivers...but it seems like the children of detroit are in more of a hurry and have less respect for posted speed limits.  as one drives across the country...you find that many motorists are content with 60 or 65 mph.  this is rare in motown.  we appear to have more people driving very large trucks rapidly while talking on their cell phones at the same time the eat a sandwich and smoke...oh no...i think i am rambling now..............................................

      Murph - give up the Ben Folds thing. Dude, thats a personal blog thing, don't infect us with your poor musical taste virus.  Sorgoid - I don't think Detroit is any worse than anywhere else. Your friend is here, so of course they think its worse here than anywhere else. People always think that if they were somewhere else it would be different. But as Dave said, it's mostly auto-related out here. My job is 80% car commercial related. DODGE, GRAB LIFE BY THE HORNS  PAYS THE RENT. Ok. I don't pay rent, but if I did,it would pay the rent. That and Ford CRUSH THE COMPETITION. I had to create a matte of some images and separate the foreground rust colored junk from the background rust colored junk so when the Ford truck climbs the mountain of crushed Chevy's it looks nice and pretty. Watch for it on your local TV screen.  Debbie - When you want to add a link, be sure to highlight the text you want to link and hit the little World-Chainlink thing onthe top right (near Bold,Italic,Post,etc.) and then it will link the text to the WWW site you speak of. I dig your artistic style.   Murph - we need to set up a sort of field where people can just add to the blog right from the page without logging into blogger.com is that possible?  Lazar - Have you ever driven in Grand Rapids? Those people drive with the "Gods Will" philosophy in that if you are going 55 mph down a road and they are turning left and crossing past you, it's okay for them to make the turn at 15 mph and turn towards you because if you hit them, it must be Gods will. What about Chicago, have you driven there? It's like a mad house on the freeways out there. I think Detroit drivers are mostly nice, although I did notice a big attitude change when I moved from the Ghettomobile 1998 sunbird to the 2000 Focus. People used to not cut me off 'cause they figured I didn't care if I hit them, and when i got the new car people cut me off all over the place 'cause they know I wouldn't want to hurt my new car.

      First of all, there's nothing like  having a bunch of people tell you your art sucks just prior to turning some of your art in for possible exhibition (lol).   Second of all, just got back from Chicago and have to promote a showing at the Chopin theatre of "To Kill A Mockingbird" which was superb.  Loved the city; it was naturally windy, but sunny, and very different from Detroit (I am under-travelled:  sue me).  Curious about the play?  Visit http://www.collaberaction.com. Third of all, figurative drawing is fun... especially when your model is male, nude, and forty and the class is full of girls...

      Ladies and gentlemen, would anyone care to discuss the state of the economy as it relates to the unemployment factor?  I, myself, am gainfully employed and enjoying a great deal of job security in that I perform work making sure that a utility (California's PG&E) conforms to state legislated ordinances enacted for fire prevention.  In essence, a law created my job.  Does anyone know, or living, any stories of folks living that dream of sitting around all day being poor?  I have a friend, Ted, back in Michigan who says that the Detroit area is one of the worst places in the country right now as far as unemployment goes.  He is, coincidentally, unemployed.  Used to work in the banking biz, he did.  (that's my Yoda-nese, I guess)  I don't know exactly what happened to him, all I know is that he ain't workin'.

      Guys, you know the drill.   Every 14th of February you get the chance to display your fondness for a significant other by showering her with gifts, flowers, dinner, shows and any other baubles that women find romantic. Every Valentine's day you rack your brains for that one special, unique gift that will show your wife or girlfriend that you really do love them more than any other.   Now ladies, I'll let you in on a little secret; guys really don't enjoy this that much.   Sure seeing that smile on your face when we get it right is priceless, but that smile is the result of weeks of blood, sweat and consideration. Another secret; guys feel left out. That's right, there's no special holiday for the ladies to show their appreciation for the men in their life. Men as a whole are either too proud or too embarrassed to admit it. Which is why a new holiday has been created.   March 21th is now officially "Steak and Blowjob Day."   Simple, effective and self explanatory, this holiday has been created so you ladies finally have a day to show your man how much you love him. No cards, no flowers, no special nights on the town; the name of the holiday explains it all, just a Steak and a Blowjob. That's it.   Finally, this twin pair of Valentine's Day and Steak and Blowjob Day will usher in a new age of love as men everywhere try THAT much harder in February to ensure a memorable March 21th. Its like a perpetual love machine!   The word is already beginning to spread, but as with any new idea, it needs a little push to start the ball rolling.  So spread the word, and help bring love and peace to this crazy world.  And, of course, Steak and blowjobs.

      Hey ya'll-  Sorry if it seems like I've been distant or hard to reach, lately. I've been moving, and, well, you know how that goes. I'm almost all moved in, but, uh, I haven't exactly bought a bed yet. I'm thinking futon (so as to make my bedroom a teritary living room should the need arise). I gotta write an article by this friday for another web site, so I'll put it up here, too, since I can do that.   Dan - Hey, we are going to hang out... the 19th is a good night for me... I hear Midnight Oil is in town.   Debbie - Luckily, I was completely physically exhausted when I had to give that sort of talk last March, so I barely remember it. You can't control what other people say, and it's much better to have an ex who's disgruntled than to stay in a bad situation. Also - it's not surprising that your ex might be a bit upset - as I told a friend of mine recently who went though the same thing - "they're probably not going to thank you for dumping them." Anyway, I hope it works out. It's summer, you're young, and you're single. Good things.

      Debbie- I totally just went through/am going through the same thing. I can feel your pain. At the end of it all, you have to do what's best for you first and foremost. I tend to avoid conflict and confrontation like the plague, but the"talk" can't be avoided and I don't think there has ever been one in the history of the talk that has ended in a civil fashion or where one or the other parties wasn't hurt or angry in someway or another. It doesn't matter one single bit what  he  says. Only what  you  think about yourself is important. Don't let him or any one else make you feel guilty for feeling your own emotions.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?  Why can't they look in a mirror and see what they really are?  Why is it so hard to let go, even when it is in that person's (whom you claim to love so much) best interest?

After the show, the two friends I had came to see the play with all discussed how we could identify with various characters. That's always exciting when a script is thought provoking. Well anyway.

      Hi Dan-- we had an instance where the b/f me and my friend went to the theatre, and while my friend and I were chatting and kidding about things, the b/f grabbed a newspaper and sat away reading, lol.  I guess my friend found that annoying.    I understand that I can't change my feelings-- I just needed to vent.  We do have fun together, but he is more serious about the relationship than I am, and that changes the "vibe" sometimes, whether we like it or not.  I've shared my feelings with him, and he has opted to stay anyway.  It's all very odd.

      You can't MAKE your feelings do one thing or another. I'm sure you know that. I wouldn't stress it. If the guy is presuring you for something with a specific label for your relationship, then maybe you need to think about what you're looking for. If you're just having fun together, don't ruin it by trying to dwell on things that bother your FRIENDS.  How is he no fun? Does he not interact with your friends, etc?

      RE:  Suicide  I've never really been able to get a firm handle on that, myself.  I have friends who have had to suffer the consequences of having a friend or relative die at their own hands, and basically, that's something from which you never recover.  I know someone who attempted to take his life and through some circumstance or other did not.  Just going back to think about that makes me shudder.  It may seem a bit selfish, and again insensitive, but I can't even begin to imagine the number of ways my life would have been affected had my friend killed himself.  Even though I haven't talked to him in probably at least six years, not many days go by when I don't think, at least briefly, about him being one of my first friends in school after we moved to Livonia.  Our plan to create a comic book,  Street Urchins .  Him being the person that introduced me to the Martial Arts movie genre.  Him being the person that got me interested in playing the keyboard.  Him being the person that introduced me to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.  Him being the person that made me see how wrong I was, not the first, but undoubtedly the last time I ever uttered a racist slur in anger.  Him being the person that had more impact on my current musical landscape than anyone else, because it was at his house that I heard for the first time ever Depeche Mode, Nirvana, the Sisters of Mercy, Bob Marley and Skinny Puppy, just to name a few.  Him being the person that introduced me to BBSing and consequently many of the people I now consider life-long friends, up to and including my wife.  So, no, I can't even begin to imagine the number of ways my life would have been affected had my friend killed himself.  Because my life, as I know it, would not exist.

      Okay, so I'm the only one who wants to use this space for long-winded, debate-inducing diatribes.  I'll deal with it.  As I was tooling around the net, my attention was drawn to a  urlLink column in the Boston Globe about the "blog phemonenon."   Personally, I thought it was an ill-conceived hack-job, and told the author as much.  Here's my e-mail to him:  To:   urlLink beam@globe.com  Subject:  talk is cheap, indeed....  Alex "Esteemed Journalist at a Widely Distributed Corporate-Owned Newspaper" Beam -   As I'm sure you've heard by now, more than you ever possibly thought when you started writing that piece, your remarks on the "blogging" fad are a little off-base.   "Welcome to Blogistan, the Internet-based journalistic medium where no thought goes unpublished ..."   This is your first mistake, really...most web-loggers don't try to convince themselves, or their readers that they are journalists, or are subject to the supposedly high standards of "journalistic integrity."  They are, if thinking about it in old-media terms will help you, stream-of-consciousness op-ed writers.  Which is actually kind of funny, considering how many stream-of-consciousness op-ed writers "in medi(a) that people actually read" try to convince folks that they're journalists...  Secondly, if John Ellis' whole purpose in updating his blog is to please the 35 people who are "really into" his updated golf scores, so be it.  Web-loggers are neither attempting to meet the general public interest, nor are they catering to the lowest common denominator.  Because our solvency is not dependent on being able to sell enough advertising to off-set the costs of operation.  Web-loggers take the notion of narrow-casting and run with it. Old-media icons (television programmers and the cable industry, in particular) have been trying to make that idea sell for years.  Not to mention that Lileks' blog is probably the least-travelled portion of its site, because he is far more widely known around the net for his collection of pop-culture iconography.  Thirdly, Andrew Sullivan, and John Ellis and James Lileks have old-media backgrounds.  Their puffing up over their personal blogs is something they brought with them.  I am fully aware that from an organizational standpoint it is standard operating procedure in the commercial news biz to pretend as if your past employment and body of work don't exist when you move to a new organization, or in this case, medium.  You mock bloggers because it is in your best interest to do so.  Much like The Globe mocks the rival newspapers, and perhaps even the broadcast news operations in your market.  It's in your blood, as someone tied to (or tied down by) an "old-media" organization. The Boston Globe's survival, and consequently, your livelihood, pretty much necessitate it.  If tomorrow you started working for The Boston Herald, it would be the Globe (and bloggers) that you were mocking.  That's kind of the beauty of the web-logging phenomenon, and the self-congratulatory, self-referential nature of web-loggers.  There is no organization to which they owe allegience, except themselves.  No one is going to fire  urlLink Tom Tomorrow  when he makes reference to the work of Ted Rall in his blog.  Nor, for that matter, are the indy.alt.rags which publish his comic likely to drop him for making reference to your article "in a medium that people actually read."  Web-loggers are in a community, not a competition.  Anyway, you are correct in saying that many blogs and bloggers are inane.  More than a few people say the same thing about newspapers and newspaper columnists.  And trust me, we are defnitely mocking you, even if there's no one to read it but ourselves.  peace, Mark Geralds  [UPDATE] There has been a huge backlash from the web-log community about this.  Two of whom happen to be people that the writer sent letters to, soliciting their input.   urlLink James Lileks  -  urlLink www.lileks.com  (a fascinating place to go if you have any appreciation for Pop Culture or "Americana")   urlLink Virginia Postrel  -  urlLink www.dynamist.com  (today was the first day I ever heard of her or her work)

       urlLink  So, here's an unlikely thing to come from me... Maybe this whole "G.W. Bush-in-the-White-House" could turn out okay after all.  He's obviously a bigger fucking buffoon than anyone, even his Right-Wing cronies, could have ever possibly imagined.  He's, in fact,  urlLink such a fuck-up , that we may actually get some positive social reform out of his term in office, anyway.  For instance:  He really put quite a few of his proverbial eggs in the " urlLink faith-based initiative " basket, with the idea of having religious organizations take over important social programs.  Reality:  George & John (but not Paul & Ringo) froze the assets of a good number of "faith-based" charities, whose faith happened to be Islam.  On top of that, one too many Catholic priests fondled one too many Catholic schoolboys, and public support for that institution is dwindling faster than Bob Dole's erection after his Viagra wears off.  Secondly:  The "War."  Don't even get me started on this fucking war.  Day 1:  "Osama bin Laden, most hated, evil, wanted man ever in the course of history, we will not stop until he is in custody."  Weeks later:  " urlLink Osama who ?  It's all that Hussein's fault.  You know, he's just much more evil-er right now."  Hey folks, just stop and think for a second - Don't you think, that perhaps, if Saddam Hussein and Iraq had not been demonized and made into America's punching bag for the past 12 years, that, maybe, just maybe, that situation wouldn't be as volatile?  Yes, Saddam has done ill by his people and his neighboring countries.  "We," meaning the leaders of our country, in auspice of serving us, have done more ill to the people, economy and infrastructure of that country than the average American has the capacity to comprehend, mostly because it would take longer than 10 seconds to tell.  When is the United Nations going to find its balls and tell that self-important petroleum-mad prick that if he lashes out and starts another assault that there will be serious consequences???  BTW - I was referring to  urlLink Georgie boy  there, not Saddam.  Thirdly, and this'll be the last point for the time being:  The continued prosecution of  urlLink The War on Drugs , with two points in particular.  When countries like Canada, The Netherlands and  urlLink Great Fucking Britain  of all places, see the need to end the persecution and criminalization of cannabis, we have John Ashcroft sending the DEA to  urlLink raid  facilities in the cities and states which have been forward thinking enough to start decriminalizing.  Much to the chagrin of said cities and states, mind you.  The second point on the War on Drugs -  urlLink the advertisements .  You know, the one which says "if you buy illegal drugs, you could be funding terrorism."  How disingenuous could they possibly be?  Let me just flat out say it, people, "If you have EVER paid your taxes to the Federal Government of the United States of America, you have UNDENIABLY had a role in paying for acts of aggression which would fit neatly into the classification of "terrorist acts," as defined by this administration.  This country (or more appropriately, this country's leadership) is in no position to consider itself the world's "moral compass," and anybody who thinks otherwise needs to pull their head out of their ass, wipe the shit off their eyes, and look at " urlLink exactly   urlLink what   urlLink the   urlLink fuck   urlLink is   urlLink going   urlLink on   urlLink around   urlLink here ..."

      Here's a quick one, since I'm not sure what the e-mail will be like in D.C....  Our day in New York had a decidedly slow start, but interesting things happened after that.  We left Dave's apartment in Queens and hit mid-town NYC in the afternoon.  The information overload of Times Square threw me for a loop. Jason Bryce and I saw the new Toys R Us, a three-story toy store that makes FAO Schwartz look like a Kay-Bee Toy Store. There's a three-story indoor ferris wheel, a really big and kinda scary anamatronic T-Rex, an empire state building made of Legos (with King Kong) and enough blinking, beeping and flashing to drive just about anybody to convulsions.  We wandered uptown, then took a train downtown and saw the city from the top of the Empire State building. I hadn't done that in years, and it's a cool thing to do every once in a while. It was a hazy day, though, so the limitations of our view were at just about the waterline of the island. It gave the place a "Mists of Avalon" sort of feel that was cool, but it also didn't give off the full effect of such a cool sight to see.  There's a lot of street people in New York, and some of them do some crazy, impressive things to ask for your money - or maybe they just do them because they themselves are crazy. Ask me sometime about the guy who told an entire subway car that he was the Queen of England. Yesterday, we saw a guy walking around with a picture frame over his neck, telling people that - yeah - he was 'framed.' Hilarious. Today I saw something truly impressive. A woman - I think, though Jason thinks he was a man - so -  a person, a blind street person (there we go) walked up and down a rough subway car, in motion, tapping his/her cane on the ground in a complicated rhythm while singing an enthusiastic motown medley, all without losing his/her balance, and while holding out a cup to take tips. Then, when the ride stopped, he/she gave the entire car some important (and probably accurate) directions about subway route changes due to the holiday weekend. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am with that performance. Wow.  Later, we stopped by the hotel Roger Smith, where our friend Geoff Renaud was having a small get-together on an outdoor patio. Geoff is a Rochester-area guy (and former WXOU DJ) who now manages rock tours for a living - yes, that is just about as cool as it sounds. Check out his treats at  urlLink www.geoffrenaud.com . If there's a guy out there who inspires my own wacky travel, it's him.  We had dinner down in little italy, a place where there are so many restuarants so close together that they're all good by the nature of competition. I have so many carbohyrdrates in me after that amazing meal than I can live for a week off of milk and cheese.  We searched around for a bar, and found that many of them were closed because of the holiday. All we could find were cheesy places (okay, one cheesy place), so we packed it in.  On the way back, Dave wanted to check if the subway train went where we needed it to go. The E Train was what we were thinking of taking, but it's usually an express train during the day - which means it won't stop where we want it to. At night, during the week, it becomes a local train and does stop where we want it to. Dave was trying to see if the  train had turned into a local train tonight. It was 1am, and he walked up to a fare booth attendant who was seemingly asleep. The guy wakes up slightly, and this is their conversation:  Dave: Does the E train go to Queens right now, local? Guy: It runs normal. Dave: So it's an express train still. Guy. It runs normal. Dave: Because during the week it's a local train at night. Guy: Normal. Dave: So is it a local train now? Guy: It's a local train late night. Dave: Is it late night now? Guy: Yes. Dave: So it's a local train? Guy: It runs normal.  Uh-huh. At the next booth, Dave asked "Is the E Train local right now?" The attendant nodded.  Goes to show.  That's it for today. I'm turning in, slightly. I've got about three hours to sleep before Jason and I have to bust out to take an absolutely sickening 7am bus ride to washington dc. I think it'll be my first big non-charter bus ride. I hope everything turns out well.  Talk to you all soon. Somebody call me during the hockey game tomorrow and tell me how the wings are doing.  Murph.

      I wish I had my camera at the festival yesterday. I didn't want to take it because it's just another thing to worry about. I've been running around with equipment so often lately that the days when I don't have to do that are just fine with me because it's a weight off my shoulders I don't have to deal with. I still haven't insured my stuff (I've acquired about $8,000 worth of film related equipment now.) So it freaks me out that something could happen and my dreams would go away as quickly as someone could steal a camera/tripod/computer/lights/etc.  ANYWAYS. I wish I had my camera yesterday because of the way people were acting. I've been to raves before but for some reason the DEMF doesn't have the love I've seen in the party kid culture before. Everyone was kinda mean. There were nice people obviously, but the majority were not the nice kids I've partied with in the past.  There were a few trees around us and this concrete slab that overlooked the fountain in the main section of Hart Plaza. Every 4 minutes or so som fool would think they were the first one to think of cliombing up to the concrete slab. Sitting up there with a smuglook on their face they always would look down upon us with an "i have a WAY better seat than you attitude."  and then a few minutes later the security guard would make them get down. This happened seriously 100 times at least. And every person had the same smug look and every time the security guard would shine a light on them to make them get down.  one time a cop saw a guy in the tree shines hsi light on the guy and said "are you gonna fall" "no" and the cop walked away.  The festival was a great time and I had some really cool people with me to make it even more enjoyable. Eric (emperer), Jason Roth (MEEP!) and the beautiful Julie who I had just met. I met up with a few others along the way but only those 3 stuck with me the whole day. Well we drove together so we HAD to go home together.

       From Murph in NYC:  It's New York, it's 3:30 in the morning, my head's achy, my feet stink, and I'm dog tired.  The last two days have been pretty eventful - Me and my hetero-life partner Jason Bryce spent yesterday in Philadelphia, and today in New York with our friends, Brandon Oblinger and Dave Havasi. Some highlights:  -We spent a night at Jason Hammonds's place in Philadelphia. The younger of his two cats is only 8 weeks old, but is already self-aware enough to identify its mortal enemy: my feet, whic he repeatedly stalked and attacked. I woke up at 4am with a Kitten wrapped around my big toe, locked in a desperate struggle for survival. I said "What the hell are you doing?" out loud - but he didn't care. I had to launch him across the room and give up a sock to distract him.  -In Philadelphia, the Jasons and I were hanging out in the park. I noticed two attractive young women across the way who were talking to some guy who had a puppy on a leash. The puppy was doing its excited puppy thing, jumping all over the place, and the guy looked embarrassed talking to the women, as if he were saying "oh, sorry, this dumb dog just runs out and leaps all over the attractive women in the park." After a while, he pulled his dog away and left. A minute later, I saw a different guy walk his dog by the same two women, and let the leash out so his dog does the same thing, and he has the same embarassed conversation. Then, he left... and another guy did the same thing. I mentally crossed out the "dog walking to get chicks" trick from the book... I think it may be just a tad overdone. To their credit, the women seemed genuinely surprised and amused each time some yokel's dog came running up to them.  -We slept in too late today and had to use aggresive driving tactics to catch the train to New York. When we were there, we took it nice and easy. We arrived in Penn Station, took the train to the village, took the train back up to the upper east side, walked through central park (on a spectacular day) to the upper west side, took a train back to the village for dinner, then took a train back up to the upper east side for the evening's drinking, then a cab back to Queens. Keep in mind, Jason Bryce and I also lugged our backpacks - with four days gear - through this whole adventure. So, my shoulders and I are no longer on speaking terms. It was like Europe again - without the rash and the limping travel buddy.  -We used the rail system extensively, and visited landmarks in both Philly and NYC. Nothing blew up, and we weren't gassed (to our knowledge, anyway). We may have been face scanned - I hear they're using that at the Statue of Liberty. I did get searched twice at the airport on Thursday, but I think that's because I didn't shave. So, we're all safe and sound.  -It was Jason Bryce's first time in the city, so Jason, Jason Hammonds, Brandon, Dave and I visited Lucky Cheung's, a bar in the village where the wait staff are extremely attractive women - transvestite women - extremely friendly, outgoing transvestive men dressed as women. I highly recommend this place - it may challenge your sexuality, but you will have a good time in the process. The staff loved Jason Hammonds... a lot. He went to the bathroom and returned a shaken man. He said: "They freaking mauled me... they were lifting up my shirt and I was like,  'man, can I just go to the bathroom'?"  Jason Bryce: "Dude, that hot one was into you. "I don't feel good saying that."  Maybe you had to be there. But check it out.  What else? We ran out of a bar away from a crazy Russian man who trying to set Brandon up with women, I nearly got hit hit by a fleet of cabs jaywalking, Dave almost got run over by a cab when the driver took off in reverse as he was walking behind it, the five of us nearly got into a fight with one angry man on the sidewalk, I hit my chin on a taxicab door getting into it, and I spent about $500 dollars on food and drink.  That's the story so far. We'll be in NYC all day tomorrow, and hopefully something interesting will happen. Talk to you all soon...  Murph

      I'm sitting here drinking a martini, a slightly dirty one, pulp fiction resonates in the background, and a frozen pizza is nearing its completion. I don't know really how I'm able to function in this medium. Generally, I write in a little black book that I received this Christmas, and during my sorties on the retail warfare front, I carry little MEAD memo books that rest comfortably in my pockets ready for any sort of mental spooging that occurs. It's a mess, the here and there thoughts strewn upon here and there notebooks, comprising the general disarray that is my thoughts. I have to let go. I need to let go. I yearn for questions and debate. I feel as though my semi literate mind of mush is furthering its trek towards blahville. I wrapped each thought in private jokes, or puzzles of the inane. I really only know one thing: I do not know a great deal. I've thought that this admission/realization of my ignorance, my knowledge of my lack of knowledge, was somehow the first step in becoming wise...but  then again, I'm still a fool for the most part...this frozen 'za ain't all that bad

I think you need to find yourself a little S&M girl who will ride your penis back to its normal state.  Dude maybee your seeing an early sign of impetent.  Viagra for you my young friend.  If its truely a problem maybee we will just have to experiment with weird fetishes until we find what turns you on  like pealing the scabs of Misses Hemingway's pussy rip!! give me a call Danny boy

      no, Dan.  only a few rare persons of high-weirdness ever get to check the  "penis has fallen asleep"  box under the life experiences section of the survey.  Perhaps you're taking the pound puppy for one too many walks a day.  Perhaps it's not getting enough exercise.  I don't know, but if it happens again, I'd seek medical advice.  I think a doctor's opinion would definitely be in order were it to happen again.

       In support of the cause ...   If you have  any  interest in the political/economic/social "debate" that we've apparently opened up, please go read the rest of this  urlLink article , in  urlLink U.S. News :    That wasn't the end of it. Stevens and his colleagues didn't finish adding amendments to the $318 billion appropriations bill until nearly midnight, after a mammoth round-the-clock session of horse-trading and arm-twisting ... Less than two weeks later, the final version of the bill passed the House. The vote was 408-6. In the Senate, the tally was 94-2; McCain and Phil Gramm of Texas voted no.    Here's another U.S. News  urlLink story  specifically detailing some of the pork projects that were added into that $318,000,000,000 (yep, that's  nine  zeroes) appropriations bill:    There was $8.4 million for a celestial observatory in New Mexico, $3 million for a new public-health laboratory in Las Vegas, and the acceptance of an estimated $50 million in liability for pollution caused by the Homestake Mine in Lead, S.D. The Army was also forced to spend $2 million to buy nitrocellulose from a New Jersey company in danger of going bust.    And yet  urlLink another one , which tells about how the government sometimes deals with and sometimes makes deals with crooked businesses:    Company workers have been killed and seriously injured and national security potentially put at risk. Yet, together, these firms have corralled more than 4 of every 10 federal procurement dollars. "If it was a food-stamp recipient, they'd go to jail," says Rep. Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, who complains about repeat offenders. "If it was a student-loan recipient who wasn't paying, they'd have their wages garnisheed. It's an extraordinary double standard."

Not going to ruin anything, just the script was kinda- it needed help, the special effects rocks, too many cliches for my liking, Ewan McGregor has very nice blue eyes, and this is the teen-age angst at it's best. All in all, I left with one of them I-just-saw-a-great-movie high.

It's at  urlLink http://homepage.mac.com/mokumperfect/perfectworld_sml.html  or in the visuals menu at  urlLink http://www.mokumband.com   More Good News: Well I keep their files on mac.com on an idisk or two.

More are on the way, so we'll eventually have a terrabyte at our disposal before the end of the year. Pretty cool I think... We can fit a LOT of videos on that size server.

       ... rotten in Denmark   Anita - first of all (here i go again), I wish to apologize for jumping down your throat like that.  It is the direct result of ignorance and arrogance on my part -- ignorance of the context under which you made that post, and the arrogance of assuming you were responding to my bitching about CorpAmerica.  As I said earlier, I've been a bit overly crabby the past few days.  I hope you don't think I'm being an antagonistic dick toward you ...  That being said, yes, I think the topic is extremely worthy of continued (rational) discussion.  And this is the perfect crowd to have it in, almost everybody being (as far as I know) in that 18-25 range.  I've got friends on both side of the monetary spectrum, and having grown up in a FoMoCo house, have seen a little of both sides myself with the waxing and the waning of the auto industry's fortunes.

      Mark- eek. I've found it to be true that when any piece of literature starts off with "First of all...." there's something amiss.   Anyway, you got me all wrong. Tuesday night I was at my friend's place and we watch "the Gilmore Girls" some random show on some random non-cable station, and well the mom "Laura" got her degree from community college after life seemed to get in the way. Well in the show a few of her fellow graduates were making comments on the fact that there was this rich looking woman who had hired a profession video-guy to tape the ceremony and how pompous and snobish it all looked. The girl who's mom it was, had to listen to that and felt obligated to join in and say something to the effect of them damn rich people. Anyway they ask the girl to go out for pizza and she said he had other plans. Later on they find out of course she's rich and was like who corse you don't want to go out for pizza you want to go home and eat cavier and drink champaigne.   Then my friend and I discuss after the show how typical the behavior the the gradutes were in the 18-25 year old bracket. She's in a business where she sees lots of people all different walk of life and saw a genral trend. I in my awe of the great conversation we had tried to bring it out on the web-site here. Looking back on what I had written previously, and even after this I'm sure, the random thought I had had is now totally lost in translation from Tuesday night's memory to today.   Here I was at work with some down time checking up on the web going to the site here and and never expecting a response like that at all. Ignorant? Yes I am. I don't think enough before I do things, it came out all wrong. Arrogant? Not even a little, there's no one I know who'd come to that conclustion. But hey seriously, do you want to talk about this more about this, am I clear now? I really hope I'm not sounding like an ass here, this totally did upset me and I want this cleared up.

       If you can't beat 'em, join 'em?   Anita - First of all, you saying that peoples' angst toward the rich being a result of lack of education is about the most blatantly ignorant and arrogant statement I've heard since Dan Rather, on September 17th said that terrorists hate Americans because they're jealous.  It's tough to self-educate when most newspapers and popular magazines are written to a reading level of 6th graders.  It also doesn't help that most major media outlets in the U.S. - newspaper, radio, network television & film are  urlLink owned by fewer than 50 companies .  The deal is, that the rich  do  create quite a few problems for the rest of the world, some consciously, and some coincidentally.  I don't hate rich people,  urlLink I've got no room for hate in my heart .  I'm disturbed by the social disparity between the rich and the poor, and I'm not just talking about the "digital divide."  There's been a controversy up in Lansing recently that involves one of General Motors production plants, and allegations of toxic fumes being released into a largely residential neighborhood.  When the residents told GM that they would oppose a permit application to increase the emissions, John Engler, our Governor publicly likened it to blackmail.  When GM told the residents that if they didn't get their permit, they would shut down the plant, Engler didn't make a peep.  How was Enron allowed to happen?  Why does our country have the largest per capita prison population in the world?  Why is it okay for Ford, GM and/or Chrysler to shut down factories in Michigan and open them in Mexico?  Why does Trent Lott think it's okay to have ships that the military neither needs nor wants built in his home state when it means that schools in his home state face severe budget cuts?  Why is the small-time American farmer all but a thing of the past?  If the answer to every one of these questions isn't money, you're lying to yourself.  My attitude has nothing to do with a lack of education.  I went to school.  I have one degree.  By this time next year, I will have my second.  I have a career which affords me a decent living.  I own a home, albeit not a 1/4 millian dollar one.  I'm still pissed, and now offended.

        Ok what's the deal? It seems everywhere I go these past few weeks, I keep running into these "kids"; these post-high school to around age 25-year olds who have this angst against the rich. It's like it's  trendy  now to not only hate the rich but to think that they're totally awful and are creating 100% of the world's problems. You know why they think that, it's because they're uneducated. People open their mouths and complain more when they don't know the whole story. Instead of complaining about how bad the rich are, get over your envy, go to school and earn a living and get that 1/4 million dollar home you so clearly want.

      Being single is nice.  I believe it is true, Anita, that you find people when you are not looking very hard.  Also, as of late, I've found some of my most intimate and most special relationships to be found in close friendships.  It's amazing how much love and warmth you can get from a close friendship without the ties and bonds of an actual "relationship," i.e. boyfriend/girlfriend.

      Anita - Saying that people can't be evil doesn't mean that people don't do evil things; if what one does is more important in defining them than what one says, then by association, people can be evil.  Just because you perceive your action to be "the right thing" inside your head, doesn't mean that your head is necessarily right -- good and evil are societal notions, and thus largely defined by societal conventions.  Even the ten commandments, the basic tenets of Judao-Christian dogma, were laid down with the good of society in mind, be it earthly society, or the society of whichever flavor of afterlife your belief system subscribes to.  Murph - Cake is overrated.  Give me the fruity goodness of a steaming-hot-just-pulled-from-the-oven apple pie every time.

Hey Dan, thank you!!  I really am.  I was so self-absorbed this week that I didn't realize that spring semester started on the 1st OF MAY and not the 6th OF MAY.  Hence, I've lost my scheduled courses!  I may still be able to retain one, but it is funny how things work out like that.  I really didn't want to take two courses in the spring, I am so burned out at the moment, and I am applying for possible internships.  Very weird.  I don't know where my mind has been lately.  By the way, saw Spiderman last night without any knowledge of my school situation and thoroughly enjoyed it!  I have my gripes, but it was a nice "welcome to summer" type of movie.

      anita. Normally the computers that talk to your cellphone use infrared technology. I haven't personally seen anything with wires.. it exists but I've never seen anyone use it. Sarah from  urlLink sw33t.com  has a cellie she chats online with her PDA with, that also uses infrared. Extra fees apply.. one of my friends racked up a $400 cell bill using the internet last month. Be careful. You probably have a PC, but here's info from apple's site.. the technology is the same for other computers.  I think  Windows  are a  pane . Maybe one of the PC buffs can shed more light for ya.  -dan   Can I connect to the Internet using my cell phone?  Yes. Certain digital phones from Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola allow you to connect to dialup services when they are connected to the PowerBook G4 by cable or infrared. This generally requires phone hardware using the GSM standard and an additional service fee. Check with your mobile phone provider to determine whether your service offers this capability. Third-party developers also offer wireless PC Card modems for use in the PC Card/CardBus slot of the PowerBook G4. For more information on third-party products, go to  urlLink www.apple.com/guide.

Well I want to hook up to the internet through my nokia model 5100 phone as opposed to stringing a cord all the way upstairs and at the other end of the house from where the second line is located downstairs. Is this possible? I'm so convinved there has to be some kind of wire out there that connects my phone to the computer's modem. I went to all them local computer and electronic stors and a few at the Novi Mall (I know it has a real name but it's always going to be Novi to me) but to no avail.

      Rosanna was an usher, but they took away her job for one of those lousy Americans. Now she's just a bum, following Cirque around our country to be with her boyfriend. LOL. The girl that does the usher thing now is from Texas, and she's got a head of hair that rivals mine. Actually, her's is bigger, I wonder if I can get everyone to call HER bighead instead.  Rosanna's boyfriend is a technician, he makes the platform spin, and releases balloons from the underground catwalks. The rest of the people I hang out with are bunch of clowns or backstage crew. Most of those involved are these long Circus bloodline families that don't accept outsiders and keep to themselves. I've gotten dirty looks as I get hugged by girls. I can just see them thinking how much of a bum I look like and I'm sure they say all sorts of things about the people that are nice to me at the parties. These people rent our mansions and clubs for themselves.  Natalie does this cool rope swing act, she will be the only one you could recognize individually. She wears a cute blue dress leotard thing that some of my friends have said is skintight, but gosh I'd never noticed. Her and I hit it off because we have the same Macintosh laptop... except mine is faster.... I am trying to hook the girl up with the special pricing I get on videotapes, she needs PAL compatible tapes because she lives in Australia and her camera can't use American MiniDV tapes.  I am still healing from our last encounter. I don't have a car until monday, but it's probably for the best that I can't spend all weekend out there in Auburn Hills. I've decided that being European is like partying while you're in college... but on tour... hanging around Circus folk.

I've been rather hesistent to continue blogging it up knowing that I'm pushing older material out of the way to be forever falling down the lost void of chatter...not that anything really needs to be continuosly viewed, but I will often reference other blog posts that, if those prior ramblings are inaccessable, it renders any referencial utterance even more vauge and loopy...just wondering....  Jeremy- I see you too have seen the comercial I was referring to. Ambien, is that what it is? I must admit that most of the new drugs are starting to sound the same to me and I get highly suspicious of the seemingly 'increasing' market. Only through increased revenues and an increased market or market share, would cause so many new drugs to have fanciful little prancing comercials...which means that either, everyone is getting more sick more often, or eveyone is becoming convinced that only the drug they saw on TV will cure them....I don't know why they just don't combine every company and every company's product, so I can go down to the store and buy a Bottle of EVERY, the soft drink, energy drink, packed with antibiotics and smart pills, loaded with fat reducing memory enhancers that will cause my hair to grow, my sinuses and my vision to clear, my nourishment needs to be met,  my grades to go higher, my dick to get hard, and my posture to straighten, not to mention it will have all the new  hip ingredients ginko, gensing, cat litter, and will effectively make me both very tired and extremely awake  at the same time . Then I can just sit back with my bottle of EVERY and watch SHOW on the one TV channel and finally feel like I can relax....

I really like your most recent about Ambien I'm sure you are refering to with the "warning, may cause drowsiness".  But the anti-distraction pill has already been around for a while.  Ritalin.  Turns the most hyper-active kids into a vegetable! And hell yes, they should invent a pill that will let you sleep for three hours and you would feel totally revived... but I think the drug market thinks caffiene has that market cornered... but if they only knew that caffiene just isn't enough.

      A friend of mine and I used to constantly try and figure this one out as well, since what emo was originally has now expanded into something much more vauge, it is even more difficult....emo used to be semi punk that put a primary and almost exclusive emphasis on the 'poor me, woe is me' lyrics, and tended to be more of the hardcore persuasion.... You could spot an emo band by it's semi self indulgent (and goofy, I think) name like The Shout Gone Silent, Arms Still Empty, The Rose Has Fallen, and other ridiculous teen angst names. Now a days, people tell me the bands that are being classifed as emo and they're not like what I first thought was emo. Jimmy Eat World has been called emo by a lot of people and that just made me think that I was wrong before, because from what little I heard of them they didn't sound like the other emo bands...but then again, I've tried to stay clear of it all if I could.....because if its just a sub-classification that the only requisit is to have an emphasis on emotional lyrics, then shit, any band could be called emo. I agree with you and am all for dropping such a sub classification. For me there are two schools of music: The Ramones school, (which has an inpressive list of bands directly influenced by...next to the beatles, led zeplin, few bands out there can say they've inspired generations of bands (many of them are poor ramones ripoffs and others are quite different (Bono from U2 has exclaimed on several occassions that there would be no U2 if it weren't for the Ramones...)))) and  then there's everything else....

      Alright, now I have to ask this, and I do apologize in advance if this does offend anyone... but what necessarily classifies a band as "emo"  (emotional rock)?  Honestly, this just seems to be another attempt to classify music that doesn't want to be considered (as I hate to type the word) alternative.  I am all about putting a stop to this whole music sub-classification thing.  Who ever came up with the term "alternative rock" should be shot.  Alternative to what?!?  It's still rock and roll, isn't it?  And as far as "emo", well from the few people that could give me a hazy definition, is that it's either soft rock (easy listening), or hard rock with thought provoking lyrics.  But enough of this sub classification, please.  Why do people have to make it sound so artsy?

      Hola, el capitan -   Bands from the West Side: I'm really into  urlLink 19 Wheels  lately.  I'm a huge  urlLink Knee Deep Shag  fan, as well.  I've heard a couple other bands that I think were from out that way -  urlLink Slowdrag , whose live set I really liked, but didn't dig the disc nearly as much;  urlLink Lacklustre , who had a good presence, but otherwise nothing that snuck up and smacked my ass.  Some interesting old-school local East Lansing shit is a noise-rock band called  urlLink Gravitar , I knew the drummer,  urlLink Eric Cook , who does okay for himself down in the Detroit area and is these days doing a solo experimental project under the name  urlLink Persona .  And, as always, I give a shout out for my peeps in  urlLink Cool Dry Place  from Detroit.  I get exposed to a lot of Michigan based music from the  urlLink college station  in East Lansing.

      Dan...    I read your story, and I understand where you are coming from.  I am working at a restaurant called Kahunaville...it's basically TGIFridays with palmtrees and watershows.  I'm trying to find a "real" job, and it's depressing to me that I can't be happy until I do, and I fear that it won't happen.      Some realizations that I have since made...      Happiness is in excitement.      Happiness is in rest.      Happiness is in being with friends.      Happiness is in being alone.      Happiness is in entertaining.      Happiness is in being entertained.    Dammit...the reason the whole world is depressed is because happiness is in whatever you aren't doing at the time.  Even ecstasy causes depression.  We are all chasing a dream, and I don't know where it will lead us, but I'm dying to find out.    A friend of mine is a youth minister at a church in California.   He was telling me that his church is so liberal that "some of the kids believe in god, they just don't buy that whole Jesus thing."   He said, the parents in the church were the same.  I looked at him and said, "at that point, one wonders what the point of going to church even is."  The youth minister said, "for spiritual guidance."  My question is, how can someone who doesn't know where he's going be  the guide?  How long have we just been following lost people?  Why are we following them?  I don't have any answers yet, but just more questions.      Anyway, I have to get going.  You have fun, though.  And I'll  talk to you later.     ...jason!

Daddy got laid off from his IT job in the dot-com bust.  Daddy just drinks now.  Mommy looks like she should be selling either Real Estate, or Avon - I'm not quite sure which.  When Junior goes to college, he will be arrested for possession (he's also got two previous MIP's), be given 12-months probation and 100 hours of community service, lose his financial aid and drop out to eventually become a manager at a chain of local convenience stores.

      Actually, I think both the parents look about the same age. This picture is from the late 80's/early 90's thus the parent's weird do's. That and the mom apparently never lost all her pudge from having the kids. The daughter is clearly adorable however. The two little boys (who's names do doubt ryhme somehow or at least all children's names start with the same letter) are little hellions. But it's your classical family. The father got lucky, she was the first girl he ever dated, they met in a college marketing class and in 5 years they poped out 3 kids.

That's about the most contrived family unit I've ever seen, and if that's what it means to not be a geek, I'm glad I'm not not a geek. [grin]

      Hey guys, hate to skip back behind the web development talk - thanks for working on the site, by the way, I appreciate it - but I wanted to chime in on this Citizen Corps/Operation TIPS thing...   There's a difference between the Citizen Corps and Operation TIPS. The Citizen Corps is a program intended to increase community infrastructre, especially times of crisis. Ideally, it's supposed to set up a volunteer police force, medical reserve corps, a neighborhood watch program, and a community emergency response teams. None of those ideas suck. Hell, I signed up for the community emergency response teams, which means I get a few days of emergency medical training whenever they get to calling me. After that, should something awful happen in Rochester, I can go do something instead of stand around like a chode. Love that idea. Huge. Great. Wonderful.  Operation TIPS, though, is no good. A system by which regular citizens can report "suspicious activity' of other citizens to the government is a really bad idea, especially in this age of anti-terrorist "detainees." It's got a good heart behind it, I think. Or, at least, I'd hope it does. If you read what Tom Ridge has been saying about it, he sure seems surprised that people have reacted to it in this way. In a warm, fuzzy, nice world, it's a system by which truckers and fast food workers and flight school instructors can do something if they see some dude acting like a terrorist. Of course, in a warm, fuzzy, nice world, there aren't any terrorists. So in the cold, slick, mean world that we live in, this is a bang-up way to create a system that can be so abused, and so powerfully abused, as to cause absolute havoc and mayhem nationwide. So, no good.  But the citizen corps is not all bad, I don't think. If it's a way to strengthen communities in America, I'd love to try it. Seriously. Because communities could use some strengthening. You know?

      Debbie, when you change that page, in your editor, the images should NOT be displayed as you edit. the links should look incorrect. Don't fix them. Now the images don't load. I'll fix it.  OK I fixed it. Either you, or your software unbeknownst to you, changed the IMG SRC links from: http://www.itwillfail.com/images/head3.gif to head3.gif  So watch out for that. I don't know what software you use. I think in DreamWeaver its something like "links relative to [ site / document ] root"  and document is the way it should be set. If you're using something else I have no idea.

       The Track 7 theory  was re-visited by me this week. Macintosh unveiled a new version of iTunes at the NYMacWorld expo. I can now create smart playlists of mp3s by criteria I set. They are ever changing, they add songs to themselves if I want them to.   So I programmed all my track 7s I encode to my computer to add themself to a Track 7 playlist. You can also do by date, genre, rating (you can give mp3s in your library from 1-5 stars, title, artist, composer, last time listened to, date of copyright... anything)  So it's really neat to hear all just Track 7s, it really takes me back to the days Pat and Mark would spin CDs and say things like "See!! Track 7...1965 (the Afghan Whigs album) Track 7... John The Baptist.. GREAT SONG!..."

      I remember saying the Pledge of Allegience everyday in the second grade, then we'd go on to sing silly songs as part of our morning routein. I never thought twice about the words, they just followed a pattern and rythem and you just kind of say it. Then we'd all giggle and say "with liberty and   ice cream   for all". To us it was just another silly song.   I think this issue has very little to do with God. If we gave special attention to keep this nation politically correct about everything, we'd grow to be cold, lifeless, unimaginative, and apathetic. We can't swear, we can't fart, we can't have sex, we can't dress, we can't laugh, we can't dream without someone being offended. Are we insensitive as a nation? Insensitive my ass, Insensitive would be people flaunting off their religion, blatently mocking and jeering people who don't agree I think as a nation we're past things like that. And those of us who aren't, I wouldn't call them contributing memebers of society.    In truth, I think people like to pull crap like this for attention. Everyone needs to feel that they're opinions are important and special. So what could be more fun than causing a national controversy? Politicians like to use controversy like this to gain support. Just like the people every 5 years or so where they try to change Kentucky's (is it K?) flag because it's similar to the formor confederate flag which to some people stands for support of slavery? Or the person who sues McDonalds for not putting "Caution- Coffee Maybe Be Hot" on the cup. That's silly. But so is this. You can't please everyone.

       Pledge of Annoyance   Okay, here's my two cents on the Pledge thang:  Here are a few little factoids about the Pledge that aren't getting much mention from the  urlLink wingers  and  urlLink pundits  and  urlLink politicians  who are so outraged by this ruling:    The 9th Circuit Court did NOT rule the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.  Only the phrase  urlLink "under god,"  which was found to violate the Establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution, based on  urlLink established case history .  The Pledge of Allegience was written in 1892 by  urlLink Francis Bellamy , a Socialist who was forced to resign his position as Baptist Minister because of his 'socialist sermons.'  The original Pledge read as follows: ' urlLink I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. '  Against the wishes of Bellamy, In 1923 and 1924 the National Flag Conference changed the Pledge's words, 'my Flag,' to 'the Flag of the United States of America.' -  urlLink They were afraid that immigrants and their children would pledge allegience to the flag of their native country.   In 1954, after a campaign by the  urlLink Knights of Columbus , Congress added the words, 'under God,' to the Pledge. -

       I can't say it any better than this article from SatireWire, "...ONE NATION, (Sponsorship Opportunities Available), INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"...    urlLink And definitely not any better than this Tom Tomorrow cartoon   Maybe I can. If we're shaking our heads at this decision, it's because there's some serious cultural schizophrenia happening. I think the 'seperation of church and state' doctrine in the United States is just as vague and confusing as the 'well regulated militia' of the Second Amendment and the definition of 'pornographic' media.   What do these things have in common? They're all gray areas that need to be worked out in the community so that everybody can get on with their lives. We need to figure out how much religion people should be exposed to, how many glocks they should have, and whether or not they should be able to get some porn with that.  It's a community decision, I think, made up by a consensus (or barring that, a majority) of the people. Problem: the 2000 census reported 281,421,906 people in the United States. How the hell are we supposed to set up a community standard that works for 281 million people?  We don't. It's impossible. The country's too big. Gray area issues like this - religion in schools, guns, porn - should be decided on a state/city/county basis, within reason. And if you don't like the rules in your part of the United States, you have to work to change it or go to another part of the country. See? That sucks, but sometimes that's what ya gotta do.    urlLink It's like the one time at the radio station...

      "Its a nightmare out there.   We live in a cynical and wasteful culture where opinions are made on first impressions and the nice guy finishes sixth. Our culture sabotages our self-image for the sake of profit and prosperity. We are bombarded with marketing and media that tell us that we need to spend to be richer, thinner, or appear wealthier.    We are told to submit to a peer-group-directed life twisted towards superficial sentimentality and living in the moment. We are instructed to waste our time and attention on status symbols, interpersonal politics and must-see TV. The reward for our belief in these ideals is a bland-tasting feeling of complacency and a haunting sense of loneliness and alienation. The penalty for failure to conform is eerily similar.   Its hard to love life under so much negative reinforcement. Nevertheless, we must love our lives unconditionally.   To truly love a partner, we must love everything about them, warts and all. Loving life is no different.  We can whine about how unfair our lives are and how we never get what we deserve, but remember this:   If we love our worst days as much as the best, if we love crying as much as dancing, and if we love our worst enemies as much as your best friends, we will good lives, miracles will happen in our path, and our goals will be realized  Nightmares lose their power over us in the instant that we realize theyre not real."

       C to the D to the mutha fuckin' P   Jer, in my opinion, is the man who will bring screaming back to prominence in the music biz.

      Want to get drunk and crazy? Then go to the RenFest. There's other smaller faires like the one in Galesburg? Galeston? -it's the Silverleaf Faire and that was a month ago, and then various other Scottich or Irish Fests here and there, but this is Michigan's biggest one. The run starts this weekend and lasts through the entire month of September (also open Labor Day). So if you can't go this weekend, plenty of other chances.

      the fish thing was told to me by an Italian guy, (former boss), who came to america 40 some years ago, didn't speak the language yada yada, now he owns a business that made more than 80 million bucks last year... he ran his company according to that fish analogy... it was cool because it always placed the blame not on the person who drew the poop end of the stick, but on the person who caused the stick to become poopy in the first place... the origin of the poo if you will... and the origin of the poo was usually from the head or top guy in that department, not handling/managing his operation properly... in any event... that is the origin of the fish thing... thanks for taking the time to comment.

The Justice Department's inspector general said Monday that law enforcement groups including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Marshals Service suffer from "a lack of accountability," with at least 400 laptop computers missing, lost or stolen. The Drug Enforcement Administration has such poor accounting practices, Inspector General Glenn Fine concluded in a 43-page report, that it could not provide a total count of missing laptops.  now for the poem  THE GOVERNMENTS LOSING A WAR ON DRUGS THAT THEY WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO INSIGHT YOU CANT WAGE A WAR ON A CREATIVE GROUP  WHO WOULD RATHER GET HIGH THAN FIGHT  MAYBE THIS COUNTRY DOESNT REMEMBER THE 80S, WHEN LIFE AMERICA WAS HOTTER THEN HADES HOW THEY FILLED THEIR DAZES/DAYS WITH COKE HAZED WHORES AND THE LEGAL ABORTION OF BABIES  THESE AGENCY TYPES SHOULD HAVE ADMITTED THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE WHOLE IRAN-CONTRA THING BUT DECIDED INSTEAD TO PAY OFF OLIVER NORTH TO TAKE THE FALL FOR THE WHOLE PHUKING THING  DELORIAN, REAGAN, & GOOD OLE CARTER, WHAT A PHUKING MESS FROM THE GET DELORIANS COKE, AND A PRESIDENT DOPE, AND CARTER COULDNT MANAGE A SHIT      IS THAT THUNDER I HEAR, NO ITS THE BABIES-A-BOOMING AND THE BIG BROTHER CAMERA THATS LOOMING SO REMEMBER YOUR COKE BINGE AND LEAVE ME BE FREE IN MY QUARTERS WHILE I AM MUSROOMING  WAS 1984 JUST SIMPLY A BOOK, OR AN AGENCY GUISED AS FICTION WILL JUST WRITING THESE WORDS MAKE MY LIFE GROW SHORT AND BECOME A NATIONAL SECURITY INCIDENT  I CANT BELIEVE THAT I DIED ON THE SLOPES WHAT AN OVERLY PUBLICIZED/TELEVISED TRAGEDY WAIT A MINUTE THAT HAPPENED TO A KENNEDY  BUT ME, I DONT EVEN SKI  PLEASE LEAVE ME FREE JUST TO BE ME, WITH MY PEN, AND MY DRUGS AND MY POETRY   TRIAL AND ERROR BOTH BENEFIT HOW QUICKLY WE SEEM TO FORGET WHEN YOURE ALLOWED THE PERSONAL FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEN YOU LIVE AND YOU GROW NO REGRETS  BUT WHEN YOU CEASE TO REMEMBER YOUR OWN TRIAL AND ERROR AND YOU JUDGE WITH AN IRON FIST YOULL REALIZE SOON (THAT) YOUR LATEST MISTAKE, WILL LEAVE YOU WITH RESULTS LIKE THIS  SECRET SOCIETIES WILL BEGIN TO BEGIN, THEYLL GROW AND THEYLL MANIFEST, FROM COFFEE SHOPPES TO UNDERGROUND SPOTS OUR WISDOM WILL START TO CONGEST       AND WHEN OUR EVOLUTIONS OPPRESSED AND SUPRESSED,  AND THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS THEY GAVE IT THEIR BEST THE REVOLUTION WILL BEGIN TO BEGIN, REPEAT THIS IS NOT A TEST  FROM THE INSIDE OUT WELL MAKE OUR WAY AND REORGANIZE YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE WERE ALREADY PART OF YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE YOU PATIENTLY WAIT AS THE VICTEM  DRUGS HURT THE MIND,  WELL MINE IS DOING JUST FINE AND MY MEMORY IS AT ITS PEAK COULD OUR AGENCIES OF ACRONYMS BE bigger THIEVES CROOKS OR CHEATS  THATS UNPRECIDENTED YOU HAVE NO FACTS WEVE SHREDDED OUR PAPER TRAIL THEN EXPLAIN TO ME PLEASE HOW 400 LAPTOPS ARE GONE AND NO ONES IN JAIL  ENRON, A-O-L, AND WORLDCOM WHOS NEXT TO GO BELLY UP FROM THE LIES TIME WILL EXPOSE WHO HAS POOP ON THEIR NOSE FROM THE GREED AND MISGIVINGS OF TRUTH   (AS IT DIES)  I UNCHOOSE YOUR WORLD IF THATS HOW ITS TO BE, FOR I WANT NO PART IN YOUR HELL THOUSANDS OF JOBS, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND STILL NOBODYS IN JAIL  (THATS RIGHT JAILS ARE ONLY FOR BLACKS AND HISPANICS JUST LIKE CRACK COCAINE CIA FBI ALL THEY TELL US IS LIES AND THEY SCRUB AND WASH OUR BRAIN)       THE GOVERNMENTS LOSING A WAR ON DRUGS THAT THEY WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO INSIGHT YOU CANT WAGE A WAR ON A CREATIVE GROUP WHO WOULD RATHER GET HIGH THAN FIGHT  DRUGS IN THE AIR TEARS IN YOUR EYES, NO WONDER EVERONE IS ALERGIC BECAUSE THE MARKET FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MAKES THE GOVERNMENT RICH OFF NARCOTICS  THE BEST INTEREST OF THIS NATION OF US UNDER A FOOL INDIVISIBLE MAKE THE PRESCRIPTION PEDDLING DRUG DEALING DOCTOR PRETTY MUCH INVINCABLE  SO YOUR RIGHTS BECOME INVISIBLE, AT THE MERCY OF YOUR PUPPETEER RAISED IN A WORLD WHERE MONEY IS GOD AND UNDER GOD YOURE LIVING IN FEAR  YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD  AT A JOB THAT YOU HATE OR YOUR LIFE BECOMES SUBJECT TO VALUE NOT THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM ENJOYING YOUR LIFE BUT THE OPPINIONS OF THOSE JEALOUS OF YOU  YOU WERE TOLD, TRAINED OR TAUGHT OR RATHER PROGRAMED FROM YOUR YOUTH ON INTO ADULTHOOD TAUGHT TO FEAR WHAT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD AND STAY CONFINED IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD  RACIAL PROFILING MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHO IS AND WHO AINT FROM AROUND HERE ONCE AGAIN THE LIMITING FACTOR THAT PERPETUATES LIVING IN FEAR  THESE LAWS THAT WE MAKE MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER TO MAKE MAKING MONEY ILLEGAL UNDER THE PREMISE THAT IT SOME HOW LIMITS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM     BASED ON THE FACTS  LOOK AT   TOBACCO PRODUCTS SHOULD IT NOT BE ILLEGAL TO SELL THE HEALTH ISSUES ARE HEAVILY OUTWEIGHED BY MONEYS GREEDY GREEN SMELL  DOCTORS SWITCHED ROLES WITH PUSHERS AND PIMPS WELL OVER 10 YEARS AGO WHEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BEGAN TO HAVE WORSE SIDE EFFECTS THAN HERB AN BLOW  DID WE GET DUMB OVER NITE OR DRUGGED OVER NITE OR WERE WE BRAINWASHED OVER THE YEARS ARE THESE ALERGIES REALLY ALLERGIES OR ARE THEY FREEDOM LOSING TEARS?

       Editorial Judgment?    It appears that we Americans, as protected by our freedom of speech as everyone would like us to believe, are less and less entitled to an opinion these days. Individual rights are being replaced with the rights of the majority. It would appear as though all you have to do these days to stop someone from an independent thought is to stamp your feet and throw a temper tantrum and a dozen supporters will instantly come right out of the woodwork to agree with you. They will say their rights have been violated because someone did something outside of the norm. Ultimately we all know that they are only protecting their own self-interests. How can anyone possibly know the difference between right and wrong these days when everyone else gets to decide it for you? I say we need to examine the motive. Blowing the whistle on crooked politicians is what we as Americans are supposed to do. It would appear that the editor from Houston Cronicle either has something to fear or simply needs a good old fashioned enema to clear his brain.

      Tracy and Jum.. Welcome..  Jum.  I know nothing of the radio in Houston or how hard it is to get music you dig. I live in a musically thriving area but what they play of local music is very minimal. They play the same bland stuff as the rest of the country. We live across the water from Canada so we get their radiowaves. My favorite radio show comes from Montreal (it's re-broadcast across CBC) and it's called Brave New Waves. It showcases all sorts of intersting sounds, some ranging from ambient all the way to near-pop sounding. All very differerent than what you'd normally here. I think they stream the music off cbc.com  Tracy. I can hear ya. What you gonna say ?

       Hey Nonny-Nonny   I listen to very odd music, considering my age group and where I currently reside in the States.  Unfortunately, I don't see the oddity in my actual favorite band --  urlLink Counting Crows .  I understand that Counting Crows are not as common as they were in the mid-to -late nineties.  Still, why is it that I cannot hear a song from their new album on the radio?  I call.  I request.  Yet they do not play.  I ponder the reasons.  There isn't any profanity on the cd as far as I can tell.  The songs aren't all that long, plus for their singles there  are  radio edits.  Hmmm.  I really just don't know.  So I suppose I should just say if you live in Houston, call your radio station and ask for songs from the Crows' new album, Hard Candy.  I beg of you.  Over and out.

       Nya Nya Nya   You guys remember a while back when I was  urlLink bitching about VeriSign  trying to scam me into switching my domain registration to them by sending me a scammish type letter?  Sweet, sweet vengeance has come knocking upon their door.    To date, VeriSign has been hit with four lawsuits stemming from the campaign. Two lawsuits were filed by VeriSign competitors Go Daddy and BulkRegister.com, who said their customers had been targeted in the campaign. (BulkRegister.com succeeded in getting an injunction). In March, a California consumer advocacy group filed a complaint, and in April, a law firm began proceedings to start a class action against the company.    In addition, they are being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive marketing practices, and by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for possible mail fraud.

No feature,opinion,entertainment... no we'll have sections similar to Blogs, Satire Fire, Moving Pixels.  I guess Folly of Thought would work. You don't even want yourself to be the only contributor, do you? You took that guest appearance. Maybe we could keep that going, like have 3-7 regular "folly of thoughters" and everyone rotates. Maybe you go every other week and then one of the other people goes on your offweek. Of course I am just making up deadlines for you haha. whatever you want.

(I don't agree with the adage that the locution "and/or" is improper and I use it like toilet; quickly and daily) (I don't think using big infelicitous words like "locution" proves anything other than how to use a goddamn thesaurus. Not that anyone other than myself has used that word recently (to my knowledge). (I do think excessive parenthetical, semi witless, satirical aphorisms (or sayings) can be annoying and are only funny for short burst, if at all. Like passing gas.) Okay thanks.  humbly, El CaptainO

      Take pause traveler and see the forest for the trees And watch what youre doing with your hands  The keys are within reach and you have less gas Today Than yesterday  You cant win if you dont bet And you will crap out someday The house always wins in the end But so do blind squirrels and dogs  The urge to quit, to move and make the move, to lean in, to make the call, to turn your back its in those agonizingly precious moments that you diverge from the person you are and the person you want to be  For the love of god LIVE LOVE AND RISK IT ALL ON WHAT YOU REALLY WANT! Dont you ever, ever settle, dont you ever wait, dont you ever hold out or hold back just hold on and try harder and fail and fail and never ever be afraid of failing because you can spend your whole life comfortable and safe and quiet but its just not worth it, its just not taking the shot you have  I want to change the world, but I cant seem to wake myself.  Be gone, be out there, be doing what you really want. If you think youre better than where you are, then you are.   Break it off, turn in your notice, cancel the lease. If it doesnt make you fulfilled or move you towards your goal, leave it by the side of the road.  Dreams are meant to be realized, not forgotten And Life is meant to be lived, not to be smiled at as it passes by  but the hardest part of being wise is taking your own advice because it's as easy to be comfortable as it is hard to be bold

      depends on the length of the trip, and, interestingly, who else is on vacation at the time. for my position, one week, probably, for a longer trip. Not necessarily because of any rule, but because I'd need that kind of time to put together a package of articles that can be distributed into the sections I maintain at regular intervals while I'm away, and arranging for someone else on our team to cover any ongoing tasks, and to preemptively finish anything that's got a deadline while I'm away. (my full-time contract is in web production at a big old company web site)  If it's a day or so, then less. But my job is extremely understanding and flexible. They're good people.

      Jeremy-      My respect for Christopher Walken just shot up even more, he is actually my all time favorite guest on SNL. He did these sketches called "The Continental" he talks into the camera (we're to think that he's talking to a woman) and tries to seduce her. I just can't say enough how hillarious it is. There's this movie I ran across last year called Illuminata, he plays this gay play critic set in the 1900's or so, and he's the perfect combination of the ever witty Victorian author Oscar Wilde (my fav author) and his character in SNL's The Continental. That movie has got a lot of big names in the cast John Tuturo, The mom from National Lampoon's.. I forget her name, Susan Sarandon, Rufus Seawell. It's always exciting to find out these actors/actress did other things before. Like did you know that Robin Williams got a degree in Piano performance from Guilliard? And Lisa Kudro from friends has her PhD in Geology? This is good stuff, I need to know they're not just a pretty face before I can totally like an actor/actress.  Rob-      You get an actual 3 points (remember max is usually 2) if you actually looked up that article by Johnathon Swift, and 5 points if you actually knew that off the top of your head. I am impressed either way. But have you read it?  -Anita

      Well Anita, Christopher Walken is actually a professionally trained dancer... believe it or not.  But yes, the video is really cool.  It made me believe that MTV should come up with an award for best performance by an actor in a video award in their VMAs.  If you ever catch some of the old SNL's, there is this one where Walken hosts and pretty much dances through his entire monologe.  Good stuff.  I think it's hilarious when Walken  does those sort of things, just because he is always the type casted bad guy/ gangster.   Irony is such a beautiful thing.

      Rob-      Are you ready for this?      I just remembered where I heard it... "Obermann" was a compilation of letters that the French writer Senancour (17701846) wrote. He was known principally for his autobiographical epistolary novel Obermann (1804, tr. 1903). The sentimental attitude toward nature and the morbid melancholy of this novel without a plot are reminiscent of Rousseau, but a pervasive preoccupation with intellectual problems sets it apart from other works of the same genre and period.   Well, how I remembered all this was from last year in my Victorian and Edwardian Literature class where I did a presentation on the author Matthew Arnold and his work "Stanzas in Memory of the Author of 'Obermann' ". In that piece as with so many of his works, he tries to pinpoint the cultural significance of a creative historical figure who is both individual and, to a degree, representative of that time. Arnold conceived and partly wrote the poem "Stanzas..." while in the valley going down from the foot of the Gemmi Pass towards the Rhone in Switzerland. I'll make the attempt to find the poem on the 'net here and you guys can read it. Or something like it, go to:   http://www.bartleby.com/223/0405.html And that would conclude out Literature Lesson for today.  > Where the state ends- look there, my brothers! Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the over man? Tell me Rob where was this from? I'm trying to figure out if the use of the concept of Obermann/Over man is the same.

I haven't written in the "Ask Pat"  blog at all, so I understand if I've been removed from that, but I last wrote in the "Topical Paradise" blog August 21st and am not sure how often you have to write in these things to be considered 'active.'  Do tell!  Otherwise it's a problem with Blogger in which case I am clueless as to how to fix it *mumbles*.

      How it works when you want to write for ItWillFail.com  It's easy.  First, you WRITE.  Then you make sure you have a blog just for columns. Create a new one if you don't. Then you post what you wrote in that blog.  We're going to adopt THIS template as our normal template as soon as we're done configuring things.  you copy the URL referenced in the [link] text to your computer's RAM. (ctrl-c) Then you go to the IWF Whats New Blog.  You write the name of you column, a short description and then highlight the column name and then click on link and paste the link. For instance, Anita's new column is linked to http://www.itwillfail.com/anita/2002_10_01_AR_anita.html#83857145  Now if you happen to write two columns in a day, they would appear on the same page, but who write that much besides The Captain?  Now you hit post/publish and poof. Your column is now online and readable. Even if Mike Murphy is in Europe scratching a rash on his ass and having the Swiss poke and prod him for tissue samples and I'm off on Phish tour. Doesn't matter, no one else needs to do anything once you hit publish.

A lot of you might even be asking "who  is  this asshole?"  You may have heard of him; John Ashcroft's and the Can't-Turn-Down-A-Good-Slogan Media refer to him as the dirty bomber.  The man accused of plotting with al-Qaeda to detonate a bomb containing radioactive material.  But still, an American Citizen.  Who may or may not be guilty. He is not going to be given a trial, because he's being held without any charges.  As an enemy combatant.  Against an intangible opponent.  In a world of problems with no causes; at least none we'll admit.  As our administration sees fit, the manner in which to deal with these problems is by tightening the proverbial noose.  Except in this case, maybe the noose isn't as literary as literal.  Regardless of what you think of the government's logic behind doing this, you cannot allow yourself to forget about this man, being held on a military base with no contact with the outside world, not the least of which are his family and his attornies.  If we forget him, who could be next?  Maybe the next time it won't even be somebody with brown skin.  Think about it.  Peace.

       something's different about you, but I can't put my finger on it...   Okay, folks,  urlLink The Murph  and I decided that we needed to rejuvenate this blog by changing the routine up a little bit.  Things tend to get a little sloppy when the page is filled with a cadence of posts, which are, in effect, replies to previous posts.  This problem is exacerbated when someone posts something completely unrelated in the middle of a series of related posts.  So ...  Here's how we'd like things to work from now on:  Each post to this blog should ideally be something unique; ie, not necessarily related to that which preceded it.  In the case where you've got something to say in reply to a post that someone's made, simply click on the " Squawk " link, and your comment will be posted within that context.  Everybody cool with that?  Word.

      We originally thought the template error was a blogger.com issue. Well it was but it is fixable by us. They deleted all the non-pro blogs (my theory) so if you go in and re-customize it it will work again. Whether or not this is a temporary fix is still to be determined.  To fix the blogger template error:  download http://www.itwillfail.com/BlogTemplate.html  open it up in TextEdit or an HTML editing program.  Change AUTHOR NAME to your name  change the links underneath your name to your index page, your profile, etc.  copy the entire HTML file into your computers RAM  log into blogger.com  open your personal blog  click template  choose a new template pick the one that looks like the one we're using already.  select all the text paste the text you copied into your RAM from when you opened the template file.  hit save changes  hit 'publish'  check it out make sure it looks right  if good, go to archives and select -re-publish all

      How intense do you want the page to be involvement time to be? make something simple.. Just make a template for blogger or edit an existing one, and have the page auto update. do the calender with a yahoo group and then you can have the calender public and e-mail interested people about it..  id on't like front page. I would use netscape composer before front page. my choice is dreamweaver for myself. the new version doesn't crash (or maybe it's the OSX?)

      The way I blog on the group and topical paradise blogs is I go check out itwillfail's site. If I have a responce to something, or random thought I'll then go to blogger.com and make a post.   Question now, I need to make a web-site, I've done one before way back in high school when I actually had to type in the HTML- now pretty much forgotten by me. My question is, what's a good web-page creator? I'm hearing some people say use frontpage, some say don't use them they're creating a monopoly. My intention for the web-page I'm to make is to have pictures, a calender I would update, and then general info about this particular group I'm involved with. Any ideas? Use geocities? I want people to be able to search the web by typing in our club name, or by a general search or surfing in from other related clubs (we have permission and all). Just everyone is busy and computer web-design illiterate so I was volunteered for this. Now that I'm setteled in to classes and the first wave of exams are over, I figured I should start looking into making the site.

      Okay, this is what me and some yokels in some writing work shop do and I think we should try it here. One is to come up with "Onion"-esque headlines.

I know that sounds lame and all, but the up coming OC BOOK will have loads of these little lines. So if things are getting stale and static, then send one in.

Things will be changing, design will be updated.. we are working on a few things at a time. Trying to figure out how the blogs can integrate most of the site and make maintenaince automatic so Murph and I don't have to directly oversee stuff.   There is a way to make web pages fluid so that all involved can change aspects of things we want people to have access to. I'm no programmer, but if we can make it work it would really be an interactive experience. More details to come as we figure out what we exactly want to do.

      Does anyone object to eliminating the majority of the names on the left index/frame, and piling them into one "OTHERS" type.(those who have embraced the fail part of itwillfail) I think we are lying when we try to portray this site as having thirty or so people keeping it active, when it's only a few. I'm not talking about totally doing away with, just minimizing our "spin" a little. Bunny. Puppy. Sunshine. There's some words for you. Hopefully no one will accuse me of being a negative ass for suggesting anything. Nor assume I'm some sort of cynic riding the horse of my caustic phrasings and suggestions. And Dan, or Murph, even though part of me is pained to say this; but give me a deadline... for anything. And maybe for others too. If I miss a deadline, and see my failure as an almost tangible thing that reflects said failure, then I may be more likely to try and change that.

      What is the most pressing issue in each of your lives? Perhaps this is better sutied fodder for the Topical blarg, but I think it could fit here. To further out the idea; what is on your mind right now? and not in the "what are you thinking about right this second" sort of way either. More of the "what issue in your life is most on your mind these days' kind of way. For instance, financial shit, job shit, shit shit, love, lack of love, pain in your hip, Christmas anexity, excessive smirking at purposeful misuse of the english language and its spelling, a weird cough in the morning, sex. I'm sure many, if not all of us, can safely assert that our complex and complicated thoughts and feelings cannot be merely labled into a catagory and then expressed with any severity in a forum such as this, but just a little talk won't be so difficult. As for me, I'm thinking about my glorious crash and burn attempts at controling a system that has been blanket upon me (at work) and loving/hating all the stupid little drama that is in my flaming entrails. And I'm also thinking that my decision to spend a longer christmas with my family this year, even if means I have to quit my job to do it, is one of the better decisons I've had in a while, and lately I've had some really good decisions, so I'm really saying something there. Okay, your turn.

      TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian police are looking for a phony sorcerer who conned a man into believing he was invisible and could rob banks, the Jam-e Jam newspaper said Thursday.   Customers at a Tehran bank quickly overpowered the deluded robber after he started snatching banknotes from their hands.  Appearing in court, the repentant thief said he paid five million rials ($625) to a man who gave him some spells and told him to tie them to his arm to become invisible.  "I made a mistake. I understand now what a big trick was played on me," the would-be bank robber was reported as telling the judge. His name was not given.

Anyway....Perhaps I should post this on the music blog, but The Perrack Attack has come out of its slumber. We played a Halloween show on friday, our first in a year. We will be playing numerous and various clubs in the area in the next month or so, including four shows, in four days at four different venues. The CD is still on it's way, major MAJOR house problems have eaten away at my Perrack nest egg, delaying the release,  but stay tuned.  AND!! the Book is at the printers and I'm awaiting a proof copy. For any of you that have material in said upcoming book, the time is near. Maybe this should go in the movie blog, but, we started work on a "Replace The Drop" movie (that's the name of the Cable thing). We've only started writing it out and planning it, but one of our 'cohorts' will be getting some boss filming equipment, which means as early as Feb. we could start filming the little short. And what does anyone/everyone think of starting a little corpus, or a Pass This, if you will. One person starts a story, picks someone else and then they continue on with it. It's not all that profound, and it's more of a writing 'exercise' than anything else, but it could be slightly entertaining. Okay that's all for now.

       The Stella awards     It's time, once again, to consider the candidates for the annual Stella Awards.     The Stella's are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonald's.  That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful lawsuits in the United States.     The following are this year's candidates:     1.  Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably   surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son.     2.  A 19-year-old, Carl Truman of Los Angeles, won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord.  Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car   when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub caps.     3.  Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage.  He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning.    He couldn't re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut.  The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days.  He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food.  He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of $500,000.     4.  Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.     5.  A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx (tailbone).  The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had   thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.     6.  Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms.   Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge.  She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.     7.  This year's favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot Winnebago motor home.  On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, he set   the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee.  Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr.  Grazinski sued Winnebago for not   advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new motor home.  The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were   any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.       I wonder why our insurance rates have become so outrageously high?

I'd like to write at least one a month if not more (kind of like a book review meets book report meets me), AND can I get an ART blog? where once a week I will pick some piece of art and give some thoughts on it, etc etc. and of course open it up for discussion or criticism.

      Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.                                       Address delivered in Acceptance of Nobel Peace Prize                                                                      10 December 1964                                                                         Oslo, Norway   Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, Mr. President, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when twenty-two million Negroes of the United States are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a civil rights movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice.  I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs, and even death. I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.  Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleaguered and committed to unrelenting struggle, and to a movement which has not yet won the very peace and brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize. After contemplation, I conclude that this award, which I receive on behalf of that movement, is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time: the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression.  Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later, all the peoples of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.  The torturous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama, to Oslo bears witness to this truth, and this is a road over which millions of Negroes are traveling to find a new sense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress and hope. It has led to a new civil rights bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened and lengthened into a superhighway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numbers create alliances to overcome their common problems.  I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind. I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history.  I refuse to accept the idea that the "is-ness" of man's present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal "ought-ness" that forever confronts him.  I refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him.  I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.  I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.  I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.  I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow.  I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men.  I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.  I believe that what self-centered men have torn down, men other-centered can build up.  I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed and nonviolent redemptive goodwill proclaimed the rule of the land. And the lion and the lamb shall lie down together, and every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall be afraid.  I still believe that we shall overcome.  This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization struggling to be born.  Today I come to Oslo as a trustee, inspired and with renewed dedication to humanity. I accept this prize on behalf of all men who love peace and brotherhood. I say I come as a trustee, for in the depths of my heart I am aware that this prize is much more than an honor to me personally. Every time I take a flight I am always mindful of the many people who make a successful journey possible, the known pilots and the unknown ground crew. You honor the dedicated pilots of our struggle, who have sat at the controls as the freedom movement soared into orbit. You honor, once again, Chief Lutuli of South Africa, whose struggles with and for his people are still met with the most brutal expression of man's inhumanity to man. You honor the ground crew, without whose labor and sacrifice the jet flights to freedom could never have left the earth. Most of these people will never make the headlines, and their names will never appear in Who's Who. Yet, when years have rolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvelous age in which we live, men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land, a better people, a more noble civilization because these humble children of God were willing to suffer for righteousness' sake.  I think Alfred Nobel would know what I mean when I say I accept this award in the spirit of a curator of some precious heirloom which he holds in trust for its true owners: all those to whom truth is beauty, and beauty, truth, and in whose eyes the beauty of genuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold. Thank you.

      Hey Dan, and Everyone let's start that  urlLink Debate blog . Let's start with something a on the lighter side before jumping into war talk, or race talk, something all deep and heavy like that. And let's try and avoid "re-debating" issues that have been/ are being debated to death. For instance no one is really interested in what band has sold out or hasn't. (all this use of the word debate is getting me....tired).   And of course, let's try to remember;  if you are arguing something that you are uninformed about, then there is no point in debating it. I'm not being facetious, I just mean the whole point of debating (well, what the point SHOULD be) is to take two informed, thought out sides and pit them against each other. Not in any Sophist way, where one side is just trying to win (i.e. make fallacious arguments to give only the appearance of making a point without actually making the point) but in a way that opens up all the perspective and really flushes out the ideas of each point.  There is nothing against using the so called, devil's advocate, either to try and flush out ideas and weak spots (though often playing the devil's advocate is done merely to try and win)or to move the argument to each logical step. Remember this is not a competition, and we are trying to debate in the sense that a winning conclusion must be sought.   How does anyone/everyone feel about this?

      Alamo under siege by termites  SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) -- There is a new battle cry in Texas: Remember the bug spray when you remember the Alamo.   The 250-year-old structure, where a small band of Texas volunteers battled to the death against the army of Mexican General Santa Anna in 1836, is under siege again -- this time by termites.   "We have some termite damage in the shrine, in one of the windows at the top of the shrine," Alamo Director David Stewart said. The Alamo is mostly made of stone. The termites are attacking wood beams and window frames at the biggest tourist attraction in Texas.   The siege of the Alamo lasted thirteen days and ended on March 6, 1836.

      well perhaps our policy of diplomacy is a bit poop hole for lack of a better term...  here goes... how much does it cost to go to war?  a whole bunch... how much do some of these smart bombs cost?  a ton each one of our bradley tanks, each stealth, each F14/F15, apache, black hawk... not to mention the lives...  it would stand to reason that if our intention was honestly to disarm this country, soon syria as well... than that is what we should have done...  to protect "our" oil in Iraq, which is worth in upwards of $5 Million dollars... that's a lot of oil...  here is the problem, we are spending $18 Million annually for the firepower, personnel and technology to do so... this is also poop hole...  as for a somewhat viable solution to the gulf war part 2, we should have been spending this money buying back all of the weapons, tanks, aircraft that we sold to them... the firearms, rockets, grenades etc...    the people in this country would seem to have more use (in a constructive sense) for the loot than for the weapons...   buy their weapons from them (as many as possible)... this seems like a somewhat more peaceful solution than invading the country...  it's too late at this point... (not condemning or endorsing this war... it's too late for that... all we can do at this point is pay attention and obsorb what is going on and find similarities with previous conflicts, and wars... and hope for the best...)  (we do this in the ghettos of the us to this day...)  to roughly quote Bill Hicks:  "with the Billions of dollars we spend on national defence, not to mention the other countries... which brings the total to Trillions of dollars... we could feed clothe and house everyone on this planet many times over... and there would be no need for a child in Africa to die of starvation..."  especially since africa has a diamond resource that clowns almost all other countries... although dietrich and a few other jewelry "Corporations" are over there right now pulling a european / Native American move all over again... whoring the land and underpaying the resident's for what is inherently theres...   WOW talk about tangent... Phuk jewelery... (a diamond ring doesn't symbolize crap)... except another worldwide travisty...  what is value and who is to judge?  than again this whole thing that we all agree on calling "life" isn't real anyway... just merely the most controlled dream...  pardon the spelling but in my dream it's not important.  nick namlis

      I hear a lot of anti war talk with little to no alternative solutions. Or if there are, they are vague, or overly simplistic, or naive. (I think someone actually said "war is never good, for any reason" what planet are you on?) I'm not disagreeing or agreeing with either side, but I'm just not seeing much in the way of alternative, realistic, approaches to the situation. Of course many may point out the fallacious foundations of the initial reasons for going to war in the first place, but I'm aware of all of those. What I'm looking for, in this context, within the reality of the situation, however fallacious and fictitious its foundations are, is a clear alternative to what is currently taking place. I know that is worded weird, but hopefully it makes enough sense. Anyone?

       "The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom, and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism." ... And so it came to pass, as this quote dates not from the current atmosphere of political and idealogical upheaval, but from the midst of the ill-fated Police Action in a land called Viet Nam.  I came across it in a speech from a man who is sorely missed in the realm of moral clarity and duty to humanity,  urlLink Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr .

      Dan -   This is as close to right as I can make the blog template with the image slices being placed where they are.  I can make it work the way it's supposed to if you re-cut the image in photoshop - slice one being the entire vertical portion of the bar, and slice two being the entire horizontal portion of the bar.  Is there some particular reason you've been chopping it the way that it is currently?  Also, I hate the HTML program you're using.  To use an anatomical analogy, it makes the source code look like you've taken two human beings, gutted them, then shoved all the bits and pieces back into one human being.  Finally, for the love of all that is good and decent,  PLEASE  save a copy of the current template before you start your next operation, Dr. Frankenstein.   update:  getting closer, as you see. still working on that little drop-down vertical section, but we're moving in the right direction.  too many table cells. trying to k.i.s.s.   update update:  fuck! Fuck! FUCK! I hate HTML.  I hate Blogger.  Thank you, good night.

      I don't think the site has failed necessarily, but it's on its way. Half of the links on most of the pages are broken links,(the ask Pat page is nearly impossible to get to) you can't get to anyone's profiles without some digging, some of the blogs have never had any participation, some pages have disappeared all together, the front page is a great start, the magazine section is good, the rest seems cluttered, and forgotten. Some pages have all the names on the left, some have it on the right, some pages have the blog links, others don't. Some have broken link buttons, others have the buttons but don't link.   I think the first step should remove this clutter, so we can see what we are working with. The next step would be to send an email to everyone asking for a response to be either on this site or not(I know this was done once already, but there were still thirty or so names on the left (and sometimes right) from people that haven't contributed. Nothing against them, but why waste the space?. ) Let's tighten formation, close ranks, find some identity, instead of being all over the place. When I direct people to itwillfail that is what nearly everyone tells me. It's cluttered and all over the place. Is is an online zine, is it some sort home for journalism majors, what is it will fail? Even though it appears to be a collected group of creative and semi creative people, it's hard to convey that.   So, some solutions:  Get rid of all the blogs, except for the super blog. Conceptually all the others are great, the idea of various discussions on music, movies, Topical topics, and so forth, is great, but they don't really have much participation, so drop 'em.(yes, even my own Collective cable blog. I stopped working on the cable job, and subsequently stopped writing about it.) We have the comment system links that people could comment on particular topics all within the same Blog.   All the personal blogs seem to be flourishing rather well. Most of the ones I've checked are fairly up to date, keep those, in fact let's incorporate that into the site more, seeing as though it is the most frequently updated aspect. But maybe have a FEATURED personal blog on the main page, for a day, or a week or something. Just something to put it on the front page, maybe even a teaser line or two from it.

      		 A YOUNG mother this week watched helplessly  as a baboon snatched and ripped open the skull of her only child and ate his brain.   The mother of the dead child, Lettie Goitsimang Tukane (34), told City Press the baboon sank its powerful canines into the skull of her three-month-old son, removed the brain, climbed up a high telephone pole and ate the brain before fleeing into nearby bush.   The bizarre and tragic incident occurred at a cattle post in the remote North West village of Madipelesa outside Pampierstad, where Tukane and  fianc&eacute; Oupa Goeiman live.   Tukane said her  son Neo was sleeping in a bed in one of the rooms while she was busy washing dishes in another room when she heard his screams.   She said when she rushed outside she saw a huge baboon carrying Neo under one of its arms. She tried to scare it off, but the baboon was aggressive and it wanted to attack her  too.   &quot;It happened so quickly that by the time neighbours came and threw stones and set dogs on it, it had already eaten the brain and scuttled  into the bush. I could not believe my eyes when I picked up Neo.   &quot;He was still breathing and his skull was opened and he was bleeding profusely,&quot; said Tukane.   She  said Neo was her only child and she hoped he would live because her other children died of natural causes before they reached one year.   She said after the funeral they would contact a sangoma to check if the incident was not witchcraft related.   The incident, the first of its kind in the area, has shocked people in the North West, especially in the areas of Seoding, Sekhing, Madipelesa and Pampierstad.   Petrus Malgas, who tried to help rescue little Neo, told City Press that when he and other neighbours threw stones at the baboon, it climbed up the telephone pole and nonchalantly devoured the child&#39;s brain before it fled into the bush.   Saomeng Phalatse of Sekhing said the whole episode boiled down to witchcraft, because it was unheard of that a baboon would eat a human being.   &quot;Although some people with western beliefs do not believe it, we know for a fact that African chemistry works in these areas.   &quot;A few years ago in Taung  an inyanga, through her medicines, caused a young man to find himself with his bed and all on the top of his roof.   &quot;The incident was even shown on Bop TV. Why should we not believe Tukane was bewitched?&quot; said Gomotseng Badirwang, clutching her two-month-old baby.   North West senior environmental officer Richard Gasealahwe said chacma baboons were prevalent in the area, including at the Blue Pool heritage site near Buxton in Taung.   Gasealahwe dismissed suggestions of witchcraft, saying the baboon might have thought the child was one of the small goats which Goeiman kept in one of the rooms at the cattle post.   &quot;The area is teeming with chacma baboons, which are normally tame. However, when they are very hungry they become aggressive and they eat small goats, starting with the brain.   &quot;They also rip off and eat the goats&#39; udders and would also go to residential areas looking for food,&quot; Gasealahwe.   William Mekgwe of  Nature Conservation said the baboon that killed little Neo was an old male, &quot;Rotwe&quot;, which had been rejected by the troop.   He said they had arranged with their problem animal control unit to trap the baboon because it would go back to the house again, hoping to get small goats.

      I don't think the site has failed necessarily, but it's on its way. Half of the links on most of the pages are broken links,(the ask Pat page is nearly impossible to get to) you can't get to anyone's profiles without some digging, some of the blogs have never had any participation, some pages have disappeared all together,  the front page is a great start, the magazine section is good, the rest seems cluttered, and forgotten. Some pages have all the names on the left, some have it on the right, some pages have the blog links, others don't. Some have broken link buttons, others have the buttons but don't link.   I think the first step should remove this clutter, so we can see what we are working with. The next step would be to send an email to everyone asking for a response to be either on this site or not(I know this was done once already, but there were still thirty or so names on the left (and sometimes right) from people that haven't contributed. Nothing against them, but why waste the space?. ) Let's tighten formation, close ranks, find some identity, instead of being all over the place. When I direct people to itwillfail that is what nearly everyone tells me. It's cluttered and all over the place. Is is an online zine, is it some sort home for journalism majors, what is it will fail? Even though it appears to be a collected group of creative and semi creative people, it's hard to convey that.   So, some solutions: Get rid of all the blogs, except for the super blog. Conceptually all the others are great, the idea of various discussions on music, movies, Topical topics, and so forth, is great, but they don't really have much participation, so drop 'em.(yes, even my own Collective cable blog. I stopped working on the cable job, and subsequently stopped writing about it.) We have the comment system links that people could comment on particular topics all within the same Blog.   All the personal blogs seem to be flourishing rather well. Most of the ones I've checked are fairly up to date, keep those, in fact let's incorporate that into the site more, seeing as though it is the most frequently updated aspect. But maybe have a FEATURED personal blog on the main page, for a day, or a week or something. Just something to put it on the front page, maybe even a teaser line or two from it.

      Captain, your notes did not go unread. We've all just been busy GETTING AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER for summer. I think site inactivity is a direct result of better weather. Once the snow comes back I know traffic will increase again.   Your suggestions are mostly valid... We may be getting rid of some blogs, but what exactly is to be decided still.   The Archives are now working again(woo hoo!)  Profiles will be listed from the main page very soon, that index is still a work in progress.  The old articles will have a new life at Classic ItWillFail. Classic will be the place to put everything that meant something special to us as a part of IWF, but as I'm sure you noticed, all articles are now happening at IWF/magazine. Classic IWF will house articles from our early era (Sep 2001 - Feb 2003) That index is still a work in progress but you can see where its going if you click  urlLink here.  It's actually the old "Whats New" blog, since nothing is NEW at IWF.com besides the blogs and multimedia, theres no point in listing it all on a whats new page. Once its a day old.. its CLASSIC.   SIDE NOTE: Blogger.com has been bought by Google and thus they have more money to do things.. all for FREE. We had payed for Pro Blogger to help them in their dire time of need and we got special features that were not available to others (such as post to the past, better archiving, etc) but now all that is available to anyone ( urlLink see post from Ev for details )

      Suspected Penis Snatcher Beaten to Death Sun Oct 12, 9:46 AM ET   BANJUL, Gambia (Reuters) -  A 28-year-old man accused of stealing a man's penis through sorcery was beaten to death in the West African country of Gambia, police said.    A police spokesman told Reuters that Baba Jallow was killed Thursday by about 10 people in the town of Serekunda, nine miles from the capital Banjul.    Reports of penis snatching are not uncommon in West Africa, with purported victims claiming that alleged sorcerers simply touched them to make their genitals shrink or disappear in order to extort cash in the promise of a cure.    The police spokesman said many men in Serekunda were now afraid to shake hands, and he urged people not to believe reports of "vanishing" genitals. Belief in sorcery is widespread in West Africa.    Seven alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by angry mobs in Ghana in 1997.

A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said.  Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home,authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail."

       From:  urlLink Tana  Date: Jul 27, 2004 11:46 AM  I've noticed that very few of the conservatives that send hate mail can spell correctly.  Here are some highlights:  "butt faggets" actually that would be "butt faggots"  "FUCK ALL U PEACE LOVERS NON OF U HAVE ANY BALLS" really, NONE of us peace lovers have any balls, and because I am a female, I would consider this a benefit.  "michael moore is a big fat lieing white guy" He's a big fat LYING white guy, if you are going to insult someone, then get it right, asshole.  But even worse, he goes on to say: "BOOSH IS A GOOD FUCKEN PRESIDENT! any one that thinks michail moore is a good person there a fucken dumb ass... he donsent know what he's talking about... he is a fat fuck that dosent pay taxes but wants to raise taxes... do you pay fucken taxes? do you? if you do then you should understand that he just wants to fuck you over... so look ass hole, bush is at good at what he dose... I wouldent have done anything difrent then what bush did..... I WANT YOU TO WRITE ME BACK TELLING ME WHAT YOU THINK BUSH DID WRONG AND I CAN TELL YOU HOW FUCKEN LOST YOU ARE! you are a bad american and dont diserve to live here... i hate you... and yes 11000 myspace users CAN be wrong and they are  I'm just going to make a spelling list for this guy, like the kind we all had in elementary school, so here goes:  The wrong way: Michail Boosh Fucken donsent/dosent dose wouldent difrent diserve  The right way: Michael Bush Fucking Doesn't does wouldn't different deserve  Here's yet another spell check:  Subject: Hey fuck head Message: You Stupid Liberal left wing fuck. george bush is a phenoninal president "Phenoninal" What? No, he's a PHENOMENAL president (who might describe himself as a "phenoninal" president if he didn't have a speech writer, and even then, who knows?)  "And kerry can try to find them god damn weapons on mass destrustion." I'm with you on this Tim, what the FUCK does this mean?  "Fuck you and your liberal belifes."  No, fuck me and my liberal BELIEFS.   "Fuck affrimitve action. all it is is whiny minorites that shouldnet even be in our country bithcing becauuse cacasins where here first so they get more "puplicity". name one way george bush has destroyed thae enviroment u fucking tree huging liberal left wing rat ass motherfucker. i will be voting for bush and ill do n e thing in my power to keep a dempcrat out of office."  I'm just going to make a list here so that I can "decode" this paragraph:  affirmative minorities shouldn't bitching because caucasians publicity the environment hugging everything democrat  Oh, now that I have decoded what you wrote, I see that you are one homophobic, racist son of a bitch. Fuck you too! I actually hope you never learn to spell so that no one will ever be able to read anything you have to say!  And finally:  Message: i disagree with u bush is a good president and freeing iraqis is sumpthing that had to be done SUMPTHING that had to be done? i bet if u had living conditions and a way oflife like theres u would want sumone WHO is SUMONE? to rescue from that psycho there are weapons of mass destruction sum where WHERE? oh, SUM where, I see. hidden he had plenty of time to hide or send them to an allied country so dont put bush down  You know, I'm thinking that perhaps as part of the electoral process we could have a spelling bee.

      (For more on Charley Reese: http://conservativechronicle.com/columnists/reese/  Interesting reading from a Republican.    For those of you who may not know Charley Reese, he is one of the most far Right writers around. He used to be one of the Orlando Sentinel's favorite neoconservatives. This is astounding! ---------------------------------------- Charley Reese is still writing a column through King Features.  Vote For A Man, Not A Puppet  Americans should realize that if they vote for President Bush's re-election, they are really voting for the architects of war - Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and the rest of that cabal of neoconservative ideologues and their corporate backers.  I have sadly come to the conclusion that President Bush is merely a front man, an empty suit, who is manipulated by the people in his administration. Bush has the most dangerously simplistic view of the world of any president in my memory.  It's no wonder the president avoids press conferences like the plague. Take away his cue cards and he can barely talk. Americans should be embarrassed that an Arab king (Abdullah of Jordan) spoke more fluently and articulately in English than our own president at their joint press conference recently.  John Kerry is at least an educated man, well-read, who knows how to think, and who knows that the world is a great deal more complex than Bush's comic-book world of American heroes and foreign evildoers. It's unfortunate that in our poorly educated country, Kerry's very intelligence and refusal to adopt simplistic slogans might doom his presidential election efforts.  But Thomas Jefferson said it well, as he did so often, when he observed that "people who expect to be ignorant and free expect what never was and never will be."  People who think of themselves as conservatives will really display their stupidity, as I did in the last election, by voting for Bush. Bush is as far from being a conservative as you can get. Well, he fooled me once, but he won't fool me twice.  It is not at all conservative to balloon government spending, to vastly increase the power of government, to show contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law, or to tell people that foreign outsourcing of American jobs is good for them, that giant fiscal and trade deficits don't matter, and that people should not know what their government is doing. Bush is the most prone-to-classify, the most secretive president in the 20th century. His administration leans dangerously toward the authoritarian.  It's no wonder that the Justice Department has convicted a few Arab-Americans of supporting terrorism. What would you do if you found yourself arrested and a federal prosecutor whispers in your ear that either you can plea-bargain this or the president will designate you an enemy combatant and you'll be held incommunicado for the duration ?  This election really is important, not only for domestic reasons, but because Bush's foreign policy has been a dangerous disaster. He's almost restarted the Cold War with Russia and the nuclear arms race. America is not only hated in the Middle East, but it has few friends anywhere in the world thanks to the arrogance and ineptness of the Bush administration.  Don't forget, a scientific poll of Europeans found us, Israel, North Korea and Iran as the greatest threats to world peace. I will swallow a lot of petty policy differences with Kerry to get a man in the White House with brains enough not to blow up the world and us with it.  Go to Kerry's Web site (http://www.johnkerry.com ) and read some of the magazine profiles on him. You'll find that there is a great deal more to Kerry than the GOP attack dogs would have you believe.  Besides, it would be fun to have a president who plays hockey, windsurfs, rides motorcycles, plays the guitar, writes poetry and speaks French. It would be good to have a man in the White House who has killed people face to face (in war). Killing people has a sobering effect on a man and dispels all illusions about war. ----------------------------------------------------------  2004 by King Features Syndicate, Inc. ----------------------------------------------------------

      GEORGE W. BUSH RESUME ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:   I attacked and took over two countries.  I spent the U.S. surplus and bankrupted the Treasury.   I shattered the record for biggest annual deficit in history.   I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 2-month period.   I set all-time record for biggest drop in the history of the stock market.  I am the first president in decades to execute a federal prisoner.   I am the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal record.   In my first year in office I set the all-time record for most days on vacation by any president in US history.   After taking the entire month of August off for vacation, I presided over the worst security failure in US history.   I set the record for most campaign fund raising trips by any president in US history.   In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their jobs.   I cut unemployment benefits for more out-of-work Americans than any other president in US history.   I set the all-time record for the most foreclosures in a 12-month period.  I appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than any president in US history.   I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any president since the advent of TV.   I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than any other president in US history.   I presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed.   I presided over the highest gasoline prices in US history and refused to use the national reserves as past presidents have.   I cut health care benefits for war veterans.   I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind.   I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history.  I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in US history.   Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US history. (The 'poorest' multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her).   I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states of the Union simultaneously go bankrupt.   I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud in any market in any country in the history of the world.   I am the first president in US history to order a US attack and military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the world community.   I have created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of the United States.   I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any other president in US history.   I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the Human Rights Commission.   I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the Elections Monitoring Board.   I removed more checks and balances, and have the least amount of congressional oversight than any presidential administration in US history.   I rendered the entire United Nations irrelevant.   I withdrew from the World Court of Law.   I refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoners of war and by default no longer abide by the Geneva Conventions.   I am the first president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors access during the 2002 US elections.   I am the all-time US (and world) record holder for most corporate campaign donations.   The biggest lifetime contributor to my campaign, who is also one of my best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation).   I spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in US history.   I am the first president to run and hide when the US came under attack and then lied, saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1).   I am the first US president to establish a secret shadow government.   I took the world's sympathy for the US after 911, and in less than a year made the US the most resented country in the world (possibly the biggest diplomatic failure in US and world history).   I am the first US president in history to have a majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability.   I am the first US president in history to have the people of South Korea more threatened by the US than by their immediate neighbor, North Korea.   I changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.   I set the all-time record for number of administration appointees who violated US law by not selling their huge investments in corporations bidding for government contracts.   I have removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US history. In a little over two years I have created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided that the US has been since the civil war.   I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years turned every single economic category heading straight down.    RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine (Texas driving record has been erased and is not available).  I was AWOL from the National Guard and deserted the military during a time of war. I refused to take a drug test or even answer any questions about drug use.   All records of my tenure as governor of Texas have been spirited away to my father's library, sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.   All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.   All minutes of meetings of any public corporation for which I served on the board are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.   Any records or minutes from meetings I (or my VP) attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.   For personal references, please speak to my dad or uncle James Baker (They can be reached in their offices at the Carlyle Group where they are helping to divide up the spoils of the US-Iraq war and plan for the ext one.)

      We watched Orson Welles' Mr Arkadin this past weekend. I love Welles so much that I gave him more credit than the other two (Mike Martin and Jason Roth.)   It was confusing but I'm not entirely sure why. We were tired and a little screwed up so I have to watch it again.   It did inspire me for scenes to write in Ones and Zeroes so I can't complain. I gotta see it again...more to come.

      Nobody posts, or you all just don't watch movies. I don't care. I am gonna keep posting and then one day you'll all say "Dan was onto something"  Tonight I watched:   Suddenly  - Everyone says it was film noir but I didn't feel it. There was no beautiful composed shots, there was no rooting for the bad guy, it was just a typical crime story. Frank Sinatra and his compadres plan to kill the president of the united states. Sterling Hayden (The guy from Dr. Strangelove or How I learned to love the bomb and stop worrying  that was going on about the sanctity of fluids and the flouridation of water) Overall decent, but not very inspiring and that's what I'm watching the noir for, to get a feel for the  Two Chez  prequel. I gotta write it by Sunday to meet my personal deadline. It was $7.99 on DVD packaged with a Sinatra / Judy Garland disc that is probably going to be lame.   The Crow  Wow. I forgot how much i loved this movie. I also forgot that it takes place in Detroit on Devil's night and thats where I am now, and thats what night it is. Beautifully composed and wonderfully paced, I became a Brandon Lee fan just like everyone else... too late.

      Spiderman DVD - Extras  Watched the Spider-man DVD last night. Yes, I know it doesn't come out until another week or so but I am people who know people so I got one.  I was a little disappointed.   The cover artwork gallery was cool and all but just didn't really do it for me. The outtake/gag reel wasn't really that funny, I expect at least 2 outbursts of laughter from outtakes and I only laughed once. There's and E! special as well as a how they did it documentary, great for the average consumer I guess, but nothing new to me. I love Sam Raimi, so it wasn't all bad, plus I'm a big spider-man fan.  Oh, and it disturbed me to see Erik Larsen. I love his comics, but damn, those comic book guys are freaky.

      Watched  The Third Man - Carol Reed directed this mystery that follows the investigation by Joseph Cotten finding out the events that conspired during the death of his close friend. Cinematically beautiful and a twist around plot brings everything together in the noir style. The BFI says this is the  urlLink greatest film of the 20th century,  but I like Citizen Kane better.  The Stranger - Orson Welles directed this film about a Nazi living among the upperclass. I gotta watch it again before I understand it all.

      It's Film Noir month.   To help the creative writing process of    urlLink      Mike Martin and I will be immersing ourselves in the the dark dark world of film noir.  On Saturday we watched:   The Trial  - An Orson Welles exploration of a Kafka story. Very very weird. The accused is never told of the crime he's committed. Lots of shadowy figures and odd story elements.   From Hell  - Technically not film noir, but alludes to the same mood. This Jack the Ripper story was well done and visited the elements of a madmans mind and leaves you wondering what kind of man could do such horrible deeds.   Bladerunner  - Again, not technically film noir, but dark and dreary just the same. This Ripley Scott epic of an android hunter was so well done it deserves a digital revisitation of its special effects.   Up next: The Stranger, Maltese Falcon and The Crow

      Mark Geralds and I just watched the DVD of  Easy Rider , which I actually had not seen previously.  The music was incredible. Most of my favorites represented.  The title track was written by Bob Dylan when asked by the film's producers, he basically said "Take this to the Byrds" and then they performed it.  Overall very insightful and entertaining, but the depressing end is just out of place for me in someway. Dissolving all hopes of a 'happily ever after' isn't at all optimistic as I would expect of a film of this era. I can't think about it right now. I'll expand later.

If you haven't seen it, go see it now. It is one of the few things that could spark the dialogue that could lead to some real change in this country.  Most of that change may be people deciding to move to Canada.  Strange, eh?

      Well last night I went and saw 8 Mile. Unlike all of you I am not from Michigan nor have I been there as a tourist. I thought that this movie good. The actors were real enough to believe. The movie was supposed to take place back in 1995. The movie is based on a white man trying to come up in the black man's world. (Which is not big). Emeniem does a great love scene with Alex played by Brittany Murphy . I think this is a first where a male actor playing the part actually a made some noises while fucking Alex in a steel plant. Watching Emeniem battle was impressive. Mekii Phifer was good. But I like him better on ER. In one part of the movie where they show the neighborhood of 8mile was depressing. How can any one  live in the "Ghetto"? Just the looks of it gave me the creeps. Of course music was great if you were any bit interested. While in different scenes you were able to jam to Tupac and Biggie. As for me I listened to them for years, They rock the Cas Barr!! I liked the movie.

      Just watched  Koyaanisqatsi  (Life Out Of Balance)   It's weird. Not sure how to explain this one, it's like a slice of time, of lives, landscapes, buildings, fire, water, earth, the people and the places of our world. Set to tribal sounding music by Philip Glass. An graphics artist at work gave it to me and said to "get all fucked up and watch this." I did the first time and I passed out during it. I just watched it again. It's soothing. It makes you appreciate the beauty of our surrounding world.   Everything from common people in cityscapes, to shrapnel from rockets lauched into the air.

       Memento  was awesome, dude. But I pretty much love any out of order story that is done well ( Citizen Kane, Back To The Future Trilogy, Pulp Fiction, Lola Rennt,  etc.)  It was amazing to view a story in reverse, and even more amazing to find out that you know things that the protagonist doesn't know. When people double cross him, he doesn't know any better, and eventually the viewer knows that the people around this guy are not the friends you would think they are.   Brotherhood of the Wolf  was awesome, I never saw the original Anime, but I dug that story a lot.   Fight Club  was well done. Said a lot of things a lot of people were thinking, about the carbon copy thinking of our culture. The Ikea store shit was hilarious. And When you find out things about the character, other things from earlier in the movie make more sense. I like layered stories like that. My first appreciation of that was  Back To the Future  when marty Crashes in to one of the trees of what would be "twin pines mall" and when he gets back to 1985 its now called "lone pine mall."   Donnie Darko  I have not seen.  If I had to pick five favorites:  Citizen Kane, Sullivan's Travels, Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt)   .. no.. sorry I can't do it.. there's a century of film to pick from. I like different movies for different reasons, different moods spark different tastes, what I like now would be different in a few hours.  Favorite Directors I can do:  Orson Welles (Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil), Preston Sturges (Sullivan's Travels), Carl Reiner (Summer School, Dick Van Dyke Show) , Albert Brooks (Real Life, Defending Your Life) , Stanley Kubrick (2001), Kevin Smith (Clerks) , Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) , Luc Besson (The Professional),Tom Tykwer (Lola Rennt), Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), Jason Roth (Mad Cow Incident, Time Guy, Angry Chair) , Edgar Blair III (Absolve), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie) , Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado) , Billy Bob Thorton (Sling Blade), Christopher Nolan (Memento), Grant Gee (Meeting People Is Easy), Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints), Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas), The Coen Brothers (The Big Lebowski), Michael Moore (Roger & Me, Bowling for Columbine, Canadian Bacon), Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Spider-Man), Steve Buscemi (Trees Lounge), Sean Pean (The Crossing Guard), Tim Burton (Batman, Mars Atttacks, Beetlejuice) & Peter Howitt (Sliding Doors).

      Watched  The Big Sleep  which centered around the Bogart's investigation of murders. It was this film that inspired Mike Martin and I to bring back the word "dame" into normal conversation. I love the way movies like this start out with you not knowing anything. You find out what the characters do and jump to conclusions as they do. Swirling around in new a different ways you never know what to think or who to trust.   Casablanca  I hadn't seen Casablanca since it was at the Fox Theatre in 1993. I love this film, call me lame, but it still does it for me. With the rain pouring down and Bogie is telling you the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans, you really beleive he just wants her to be happy. I doubt most people could do that. I love Peter Lorre. He is so facinating. I am gonna pursue his filmography. RICK RICK HELP ME HEEEELP MEEEEEE.

      Bogart boxed set came in yesterday.  The  Maltese Falcon  is regarded as the "stuff dreams are made of." in the final line of the film. You start out with false stories and incorrect assumptions of characters intentions with each other. Just enough death and intrigue to keep you guessing what happens next. This token film noir epic told in 1941 still impresses viewers in the 21st century.

      Last night Eric Ming, myself and his friend May watched Pricilla, Queen of the Desert. I've seen it before, but I didn't remember Guy Pearce being in it. He's awesome, one of my favorites now that I realize how many of the films I love have had him as the main character. He kinda creeps up on you like that.  Pricilla was a bit different, as he was in drag. It is so funny tho, the whole movie just shouts 'late 80s gay culture'  It's important to archive people and eras of our culture. This movie is just great all around.

It is about these kids at age 5 who have night terrors about these animal demons. 20 years later they are back and collecting them. They made some mark on there bodies and when the mark starts to bleed these "They" creatures come out of the closet and the dark and bring the kids back to there world (Hell I guess). Don;t see it.

      Good call. You know the author of that book, Chuck Palahniuk, had another one of his books optioned for a movie. It was called survivor and had a part in it where the main character hi-jacks a plane. He makes everyone get off, but he steals the plane. Movie executives pulled the plug on any possible movie after 9-11, simply for the deemed "sensitive material" which is a shame, because I think it would have made a great movie.. much like Fight Club.

      Hey has anyone else seen Chicago yet? Let me tell you it rocks. Not because of the costuming, the actors, or the fact that it's a musical. But because it stayed so true to from it's adapted broadway musical- I had seen the play in a few years ago in Toronto. In the film, they used some of the late great Bob Fosse's amazing choreography style. The only aspect of the movie being different from the play as in the movie they wear a whole lot more. In the play they walk around- the entire play- in black lingerie. In the movie- they wear normal clothes as if it's the 1930's except for the "Cell Block Tango" scene where the ladies wore the black lingerie as they told how they killed their husbands/boyfriends. It's the best scene in the film. It's beautifully done the use of the red scarves and the lighting was perfect.   Contrary to what the Golden Globes thought I didn't like Renee Z. in her role. She was Renee the whole time, never for a second did I beleive she was Roxie, I don't think she had the voice to carry it off such a demanding lead role. Now Katherine Zeta... I thought she kicked ass, I knew she was a dancer but I didn't know she could also sing. The role of Velma is much more exciting anyway. Also- she had her baby just 6 weeks before she started filming. Queen Latifa as Mama Morton- excellent choice she was perfect. Richard Gere as Billy it was good to see him in something totally different, but I didn't like his voice, to character and comical for the role. The role requires a "leading-man" voice. This, Richard doesn't have. The guy who played Amos- naive, innocent, dumb, and perfect, Mary Sunshine- perfect.  Ok, enough about it, just go see it.

From the costumes, to the camera work, ...I am no film student, but this movie was obviously painstakingly involved...  I'll have to say I thought it was beautiful...  My only complaint about the film is that I think the actors/actresses should remain more secretive about their "real" lives... I think it adds to the mystery and "reality" of the film when they deny the interviews on TV, etc..

The first film got nominated for the big movies ones.  The director got noticed, one of the more distinguished actors got noticed, but ultimately they only won best visual effects.  Part 2 and 3 only got noms for visual effects.  But I think that it's cool that Two Towers recieved a Best Picture nomination.

      Sara, I don't know how much detail you were looking for in Mullholland Drive but here goes.  I don't remember characters so I'll use Blond and Brunette to describe the two girls.  The majority if the film is the blonde's masturbatory fantasy.  The brunette was a real hollywood star.  She hooked up with the blonde and got here a few roles but she wasn't  very good.  The brunette decided to move on but the blonde didn't want to.  The brunutette left and the blonde went nuts.  The entire masturbatory fantasy encompases the film from the beginning to the scene at the opera.  SHe fantasises about being a freshed faced innocent young girl who comes to Hollywood to be an actress.  She's really sweet, kind, and innocent, yet she abosultely nails her audition.  There's also alot of mysterious intrigue about Hollywood in her fantasy.  Mysterious powerful men influence movies on whims.  This was to explain to herself why someone like her didn't get a role in real life, they were alwys going to less diserving actresses because they were connected.  Or so she thought in her delusion.  This intrigue is what brings the fantasy brunette into her life.  And they start a very tender romantic relationship, the kind that she wished they would have had.  Everything from the beginning of the film to the opera is her fantasy she's having while masturbating.  The scene's at the party and the scene on set in the car, is her remembering what a bitch the brunette had been to her.  The little old people comming out of the homeless guys bag and comming over to her place was just her going completely nuts.  Then she shot herself.  Any specific questions?  Post 'em.

      I went to see "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" with my roommate this past weekend and let me tell you, I have never laughed out loud so hard in a theater.  The movie is not only funny, it has eye candy for both sexes - dreamy Texan Matthew McConnaughey and sultry Kate Hudson.  I hate the term "chick flicks" and to those who may think this falls into that stereotypical genre, you would be wrong.  The film isn't mushy - it's quirky and interesting.  As I said, I was actually slapping my knee at some humorous parts.  There was a guy in the theater who was laughing so hard at one point he was wheezing!  Kate Hudson is great at playing a psycho girlfriend who does everything she can to lose McConnaughey in 10 days as she has to write a column on the subject for the magazine she works for.  McConnaughey is trying to win a bet to show he can make a girl fall in love with him in 10 days...which of course explains why he puts up with Hudson's antics of calling his penis "Princess Sophia" among other hilarious things.  But again, it's not just a comedy, it's a ROMANTIC comedy and it really is quite adorable and a great date movie. It's one of those films girls will want to buy and watch over and over again with their friends....I know I will at least.

It was more than just a comedy it had like mystery and drama.. not really but almost. It kept u goin thinking what was happening, but only near the end. I got right out of my seat at some 'NO WAY' expressions I had goin on. I was like pacing, it was funny.  Plus theres a hilarious cameo of a famous actor playing a famous actor who is researching a cop role. So the cops in the investigation let him do the questioning and hilarity ensues, let me just tell you.   Mystery, Murder, Numbness...a thriller with wit.  It's a good ride, check it out.

It lagged a little bit at the end, I would have cut it a little quicker in the mid section, but alas. I had heard the script was horrible, but I only noticed it in a couple spots.. yea it was slightly cheesy but still well done..
