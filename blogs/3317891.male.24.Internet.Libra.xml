      //stoppress-> urlLink photos  now posted After almost 24 hrs I feel an need to update. After getting up at 7am this morning I have had a great time ever since. After a long journey that felt like we could get lost at any moment wwe finally arrived at what looked like ground zero, well random field zero.. Laura's first words went something along the lines of   this is the end of our friendship  Everyone looked ready to kill me, including the other players. However after a briefing it all looked good and after game one everyone was into it a bit, a few more and we were hooked. Far too much happened to list but the best bits in no particular order are:    Storming with covering fire the village   Being in the tank! (kind of)   Running out of ammo and having everyone even random strangers offer bullets instantly   Seeing everyone love it    Everyone agreed it hurt a little but was more than worth it. A brillian day and didn't cost that much really....   Next up was the curry nearly everyone came (keith had to work). Ate drank and was merry (bargain booze run was largest ever) Was really cool and so glad everyone came. Turns out I cant do champagne (video coming soon from Willy) Then some of us went to Revolution!  In there we all danced like crazy (remembered why love Laura, she'll try anythin, I was so proud of her today, she is great). Had like huge circle dancing with people taking turns, almost entire dance floor joined in. Few drinks back at Laura's then me and Willy came back to watch battle Royale. AND I STAYED UP LONGER! FOR THE FIRST TIME!  Have to mention everyone who made it a cool 20hrs   Laura   Lenny   Kath   Graham   Willy   Jo   Andy   Mary   Emma   Keith     Oh and some of my favorite quotes:    Laura: If this was real I'd be alive - after not being shot for 5 games   Lenny: As soon as I'd done it I realised how entirley inappropriate it was - after farting   Laura: Can we leave if we don't like it, Marshal: No - During Briefing     I'm sure I shall be reminded about more things as we progress... Everyone have a look and comment please

      This is a few days late, call it recovery time. Anyway last week I met up with Laura and two of her teacher friends for a quiet drink. A few shooters later and it was just that, a lot later. We popped in to see Keith DJing and he gave me what turned out to be a god send. The Mistletoe headband!.  After fending of seriously fat female chav who decided I should give her the head band as it made me look queer. I started the challenge for the night, a kiss from 5 women. It took a while to get 5 but this turned out to be a kind of warm up, don't want to pull my pulling muscles...I couldn't think of a better sentence. Anyway from there came ten then 20 and at 28 I was running out of girls in the lounge who hadn't kissed me or at least come up with a good reason why not. Laura went home, she had a posh do the next night but Matthew and Natalie where good company.  Eventually I found my penultimate and then final girl, Elliah. Always finish witha a flourish and Elliah was amazing. If I had more presence of mind (alochol didn't help) then I would have got her to write her number after her name (It was loud).

      I've finally found time to have a bite to eat and whilst scoffing my LUSU Khobez bread mozzarella sandwich I have moved the site to www.bardsleys.co.uk for maximum goodage. Better to be on a server I own especially if I want to use language like "mibple" et al.  It's taken me a good 20 mins to move it and I don't have enough time to give proper detail but I shall soon be writing up "the night of 30". Imaginative title huh!

      Going well so far. After the launch Party last week it was decided that every tuesday the "mysterious tie tuesday" club dresses smartly for work. Me and Keith have both done well but Matthew and Jon failed totally. It's mysterious because we had a psychic at the launch but tonight I guess we'll have to come up with something else....

      Had a great time in Manchester this weekend. Sunta was hosting the face of Manchester 2004 so myself, Ben, Fran and Dom went down. The bar wasn't as free as I'd been led to believe but that's not the point. It was a pretty cool show and I got to meet some very pretty girls. In fact I met the female face of manchester herself. Had my photo taken with her and was getting on quite well till I realised she was far too young, 16 years old!   So since pulling was out of the question and Sunta was knackered I did the only sensible thing. I bought a bottle of champagne. Hey it's her first fashion show (she won't be getting one at the next) It was such a nice bottle and picked everyone up I bought another. Total bar tab £100. What a cool night.  The next day we went and did the guardiann tour of manchester's best architecture. That was cool and it's been so great to see Ben and Sunta again. Can't wait to see the photos oh and on the off chance I apologise to anyone in public library when I broke wind. I was quite hungover.

      Just been to juicy, very good night. Cut short but plan to make the next one big. Very weird though, kinda thinking about assumptions normally I assume everyone (well not everyone) is straight but there the situation was reversed and I get the chance to see how the other side live (by observation and being the 'odd one out')  Really enjoyed it though and can't wait for the next one, it really was attitude free.

      Well all mine have been. I just spent ... well look at the post times, getting this working. First I tried on my eclipse webspace but had no luck with that then after a load of attempts I had to move to my own server via sftp (which I now realise works, which is cool!). Admittedly it wasnt bloggers fault and Nessen did crash the server half way through (4 months of uptime!!). Well we're here now, time to try playing with the design ;)

      Just helped Laura move to her new home for the next six weeks with her Dad, Will and Ben. It's a great place with a cool dwarf cupboard and my very own snoring room. Plus it's nearer which is nice and apart from a few hitches (window,remote control and car flat tyre) it all went without a hitch. All I need now is to have a shower and it's off to Claire's for a loverly meal.

      Well I really wasn't up for a night out. LKast night I clearly prep'd foir defining the edge of my head. Everything outside was normal and inside was p[ain. However After a few drinks and some really nice food I felt ready for the sugarhouse. Got a lil drunk, did great backdrops, was filmed by safrina who is going bacdk to italy on monday and I wsih her all the best (only met her tongiht but she seemed really cool) Also met some of Dom's friends PJ and Something they seemed cool as well. Alex has photos of me I need. Then went to Lauras nbew flat which is v ery cool she needs to be careful or we may end up flast mates. Few  ore noodle and a chat with bonsay and then home to write the start of my song...  I have a dream and I dream of it often and in this dream I can change the world and somehow make it soften but its not real not reality and I can make it better but in this dream I can change the world and somehow make it soften somehow make it soften  just a start.

      Well they were fun :) Had a really good night actually, went to grizedale, furness and county. County was good had a chat with various drunk SCR members (you know who you are) and jumped mainly between there and furness where Ben was DJing. That is until he had to leave when the outdoor PA packed in. Ben was not happy, it took a lot of alcohol and such to calm him down and when we finally went home he password out wrecked. Haven't spoken to him since so I hope he's alright. Warren and I had a bit of a wander and got some  urlLink photos  and a  urlLink video .

       Friday  It didn't seem like a good idea but I couldn't let Claire down for gradball or my Dad for an other year running on the ride. So I've been in the strictest training, well smoked a bit less and actually tried at the gym a bit more. Going down on the friday sooo tired after grad ball felt like this was the biggest mistake I'd ever made but whenm I finally got there I'd woken up a bit. Unfortunetely this was because I'd changed my sleep patterns and now couldn't get back into waking early, still a few days to sort that yet.  saturday  Well as I said beore sleep patterns shot to hell, didnt wake until 1ish and we had to leave for london at 3, so I went to buy some shoes and pedals, gotta have those serious clip in pedals if I'm going to make 55 miles, it's psycological. This truned into a bit of a saga with me only finding shoes that were too big on paper but not quite big enough on my feet and having to buy new socks to find this out (who goes to buyy shoes with no socks on? me). But I got a god £25 quid off so I thought   "they'll stretch over time  So we had the shoe strecthers on overnight with so random strecthing stuff my mum has. Got to Kinbgston in record time thanks to my map reading. First time we haven't got lost, I'm a natural. Had a really nice thai meel in Kingston whilst staying with Claire in London. Bed by 12ish, going well...  Sunday  Until you factor in we get up the next day at 6am. when we get to the drop of point I'm feeling quite nervoius and I've left the pack at home, but it's ok because we tookj everything I needed and put it on the bike. Found the rest of the pub team and got to the front of the huge queue.  Dad: You wont need the race number just make sure you have the stamp card   steward: You need the race number...  So we queued again at the other tent and then jumped back into the queue feeling rude but ready with a "we've already fucked this up ocne" response. And then after only 2 and a half hours we're off....5 miles in I have to  buy some cigarettes and flap jacks (essential for long distance riding) and catching up with the rest of the team when the roads are this full is actually quite hard. Eventually I regainbed bits of the group and after a very close call when I dropped my bottle. Think corssing a motorway but with bicycles. We were about 15 miles in and we hit the first serious hill, and EVERYONE starts walking, either because they're unable to ride or because they can't get through the walkers! I just about manage to ride most of it but with a few feet down and the occasional pause. So we keep going and I get seperated and finally reach the first meeting point, the dog and duck. And no-ones there! I wait and then I phone and then I see Danny! I was first there. good start. The next break was preceded by another huge hill but once again walkers blocking the way meant it was a few metres and then stop all the way buit at the top was our first pub stop. A burger and a pint later and it starts raining :/ still no p;oint whining so where off again. The only really difficult bits from here where passing a serious accident, hope she's ok and then ditchling beacon which is rpeceded by the 1 in 5 mile long climb, ditchling hill. But I made it in fact I half sprinted and man did I feel good at the top. I kept thinking about how bad I'd feel if I didn't make it after all the training. Then afcter waiting at the top in the awful rain (started again) we set off down some very long fast hills. I could easily get addicted to speed then we regrouped for the finish crossing the line all as one. Total time riding: 5hr30, Total Time: 8hrs It was really cool. Some champagne and pres shots later and one "I mad it" badge and its time to warm down with a kentucky fried chicken and a sleep, then off to the pub for a final pint. What a great day. Thanks to everyone who txt'd to wish me luck. It really helped.

      Wow what a long day/night, started at 10 getting a train to blackpool and then ended 20 hrs later at 6am the next morning. During the day I got mistaken for someone famous five times and was asked for two foot rubs? bizarre. I think this one went excellently, I really enjoyed it strangely I think I could get into organising events I like to try and sort problems and pushing it to the ends where everything gets bit hazy is fun. It's that moment when youre so tired you're buzzing and you need to just keep moving. running on empty.  London 2 Brighton  2 days to go and feeling nervous but ready. Im gonna make that hill at the end. Got my team shirt. This kind of stuff doesn't half make me laugh sometimes. Think I might go to japan

      Well mtoday was another launch. This time for a new gay infor short film., produced by Lenny's group. And it was excellent, really made me think. Afterwards had a few drinks and crashed a finance and accoutning party (when we danced to love foolopshy weveryone watched). Came back and chatted to Anthony about all sorts. Realised Im looking for that one idea that will be my enlightenment. Everything else is just helping to eliminate that which isn't.

      It's been a really nice weekend. I've had literally no money, still managed to go out. Saw Brooke who I haven't seen for at least a year. It's really amazing how many people I keep bumping into (we chatted for ages didn't get home till 5:30!) Great to chat and just I don't know see different people.  This has been happening a lot recently I'm starting to feel some kind of zen "past come back" style fate thing. Gav was there as well and I haven't spoken to him for probably 4 years!  I think I might go on a finding my past mission just as soon as I finish this damn course work (cant believe Im 24 and still doping corusework!)

      Is there anything worse than a server failure? Not this server but the mac one I administer at work. Mac's are very sexy no-one can deny and I love the UNIX architecture and sometime (hopefully soon) apple will work out how to do it properly and add anopther mouse button. At that point I'll be buying one.   However I am no longer as stressed as I was the last two days, I got angry for the first time (not frustrated or annoyhed, angry!) in 2 years. It's not good for me and not having any money probably isn't helping the situation. I'll get some money that will help things.

      Sorry I do appear to be obsessed with numbers at the moment. However I have just spent 13 hrs at work on a sunday doing this project for my management diploma. On the good side it's done, on the bad side I've just seen how big the  PDP  is actually a bit more than a few relfections and my CV :/ but hey.

      This is probably the worst I have felt in ages. I have (checks pockets) £5.80 and a broken lighter left to last me ten days. I owe three people mony (jo £30, Lenny £40 and Ben £20) and last night I went out with only £10 despite having coursework in for a weeks time. But hell it was worth it :)  More dancing lessons from Gemma, Saw Kate Edwards whom I thought had dropped off the planet, she seemed really well and was out after 12 o'clock ;) Also met a load of randoms and woke up on the sofa cricking my neck worse than ever. ANyway must get on with that coursework and get round to posting the last weekend club photos Willy sent me (cheers Willy)

      I just watched Bruce almighty. Wasn't bad wasn't thaqt great. Light entertainment and Carrey was quite funny in his wacky way. However it had two great little bits.  The first was when Bruce says to god  Can I ask you about free will?  to which God replies Yes you can, that's the beauty of it . Brilliant and when Morgan Freeman says it I can almost give it credibility.  The second was a message about changing things yourself. Everyone having the power to do miracles, and by miracles I don't mean magic. Bruce learnt he could make a difference without the powers and later on Anthony spotted some chavs letting down tyres across the road, so I did something.  Nothing big or special, just went over and as I crossed the road they did in the other direction so I followed back and confronted them.   Are you two letting down tyres?   No   Are you sure?   Yes honest.   Are you sure?   Yes, We weren't I promise!   Right   And I left... and they walked off but didn't do it again. Liek I said nothing big but it felt good. Neighbourhood watch here I come :) It's easy not to do things like that and I think I've realised I don't do things I should. That's gonna change.

       urlLink Shaun Inmans  rather spiffy  urlLink shortstats  has always looked nice to me but until lately I coudln't run it as I don't use MySQL. So I hacked it and with Shaun's permission here is a guide how.   configuration.php  One small change ass  $SI_db['con'] = 0;  to the database section to provide a connection resource for all your PostgreSQL actions.  _install.php     Change the checking line to use  $SI_db['con']  and  pg_query  so the code reads   if (@ pg_query($SI_db['con'],"SELECT * FROM $SI_tables[stats]") && @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],"SELECT * FROM $SI_tables[searchterms]"))    Change the two queries that add the database to the following   $query = "CREATE TABLE ".$SI_tables['stats']." ( 	  id SERIAL, 	  remote_ip varchar(15) NOT NULL, 	  country varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  domain varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  referer varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  resource varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  user_agent varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  platform varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  browser varchar(50) NOT NULL, 	  version varchar(15) NOT NULL, 	  dt int4 NOT NULL default '0', 	  PRIMARY KEY (\"id\") 	  )"; $query_search = "CREATE TABLE $SI_tables[searchterms] ( 	  id SERIAL, 	  searchterms varchar(255) NOT NULL, 	  count int4 NOT NULL default '0', 	  PRIMARY KEY  (id) 	  )";       Take the query execution out of the if statment at the end as so:   	$r1 = @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query); 	$r2 = @ pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query_search); 	 	if ($r1 && $r2)        inc.stats.php  One small change, the query at the end should be  pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query);  using our database connection and PostgreSQL.  functions.php  Again three changes here    The connection function  SI_pconnect()  needs a PostreSQL connection string like  $SI_db['con'] =@ pg_connect("host=".$SI_db['server']." user=".$SI_db['username']." password=".$SI_db['password']." dbname=".$SI_db['database']);  and you can replace the logic after with  if ($SI_db['con'] = 0)	die($horribly);     Every single function needs to be scoured for  mysql_query($query);  calls and have them replaced with  pg_query($SI_db['con'],$query);  as well as adding  global $SI_db;  at the start of every single function.   last but not least a to get referers working we need a small change to the SQL in  SI_getDomains()    SELECT      domain,      referer,      COUNT(*) AS total,     MAX(dt) as last_access   FROM      $SI_tables[stats]   WHERE      domain !='".     SI_trimReferer($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'])."'    AND      domain!=''    GROUP BY      domain,referer   ORDER BY      total DESC,      last_access DESC        And then your done  Follow the README provided and everything should work fine. If not feel free to email me and if I have time I'll offer help or even send a copy of my working abeit  urlLink old version of shortstats
