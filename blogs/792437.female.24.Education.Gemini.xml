       Real Vs. Fake   Sun Jan 14 20:14:11 2001         With society these days...you can't ever know if what you see is really what is the truth or what's really there. People can become fake or look very different with make-up, others can get plastic surgery, some can even make sure that their children are going to look pretty or whatever even before they are born. Also, some can even choose the sex of their child before the child is born. The question for me about these matters is whether this is right or wrong..Some out there think it's right, because it holds the key to staying young, or it holds the key to getting what you want, but then again, it's also a form of playing with nature..playing with the real "truth"--the real you, or the real thing.           I know that scientists out there have figured out anti-aging drugs, and others have found the perfect way to do plastic surgery w/o leaving any traces of it being done behind. But then again, I never can understand why that can appeal to anyone. I mean, does it really make sense to see a woman or a man look 20 when you are 2 years old and still have that man look 20 when you are 57 years old? Though that 20 year old might be thinking, "ohh, I'm having so much fun looking 20" you may be getting sick of it! (or maybe not..and I only believe that to be true?)            I guess the bottom line here is this..In our society being young is considered the "In thing"..you have to look 20 or anything less than 30 something to be considered "cool", good-looking whatever (I don't know the words!)..But because of this society held view, we have so many people depressed with their image, and some because of it, go out and seek surgery or some other type of medicine to keep them looking young. It only disrupts nature and gives us something totally out of this world to look at. From my personal perspective, I'd much rather have my grandma looking like she is old, with her wrinkles and her slightly obstructed posture--but I like the person she is, she's wise..and she's a great woman. And I'm glad that as I have aged this past few years with her, she's aged with me. If I was the only one aging while she still looked 50 or something when I was born, then it would only make me second guess what's going on, and it just wouldn't seem right. It's like feeding an athelete steroids to get him/her to perform better than normal--which really isn't the true or the real thing! Nature, the true you should be cherished and loved, and things that make you become more unnatural should just be kept for sci-fi movies.            Another issue these days, which is quite new I've heard about is the fact that these days, parents can choose the sex of their child. While for some people who may want a boy or girl and have never had one after repeatedly trying, it may seem like a good thing to do..I feel that it's also another way of playing with nature. I believe that we should let nature take its course. I know that some people out there who may be reading this may think that I'm against any type of breakthrough to help people have children..but quite the contrary, I believe the opposite. I have to point out that, the only time I believe that science should fiddle with nature is when a couple cannot have a child and scientific methods are required for fertilization. Or else...I believe that, if a couple has had 5 daughters and then suddenly they want a son and they run to the doctor so that they can scientifically guarantee the parents a son, I believe that to be wrong.            Also, though I may seem to be very strictly against plastic surgery because I deem it to be "fake", I must point out that I only consider this type of surgery or medicine bad under one condition. That condition being when the person getting the surgery only gets it done because he/she is fed up with how they look like after repeatedly watching or listening to the media (which may have caused them to get a bad self image)...if the person who has been exposed to a lot of media (well it's hard to avoid I guess!), and then realizes that they don't like themselves because they compare themselves to some twig, or Britney Spears on t.v., then no!, the person should NOT get surgery! Because here the person is only getting surgery to look like others and they "think" that they may gain "acceptance" which to me is the WRong way of getting "acceptance". BUT, if someone out there just doesn't like the way they look because they think wrinkles on their face look funny, and they only want surgery because they want it, and not because that's what our society believes to be good..then I believe that the person should be able to get surgery. Though, I highly doubt that someone would consider wrinkles to be bad if they hadn't been exposed to the media!           Lastly..some out there might argue, that sometimes surgery such as liposuction or stomach stapling is good for the patient, because sometimes overweight people cannot live anymore, because a small heart cannot support a large massive body, and other possible health reasons. Here, I DO believe that surgery is okay, but it's ONLY okay becuase it's for a health purposes--to save a life....it should never be done for a cosmetic reason.           Overall..I believe in truth...the true person, the real you. I do not like "fake" people, or make-up filled, crusty people, or people with augmented whichever bodypart. If only in this world people could understand that the real person is always better than what the fake person may ever be!

       To meet alone or know ahead of time..?   Tue Nov 28 08:09:45 2000   New topic..I guess this is sort of a pet peeve of mine. I hate it when people will get to know who I am or what I do before they meet me or even say a word to me. I know it sounds a bit stuck up, but I feel that whenever someone finds out about me through someone else, it's never clear or precise to the way I am. The people who get to know me through someone else's words always have a false assumption about how I should be like, totally..though most of the time they aren't off by much, but I just feel it's better to meet the person yourself and have them realize how you are rather than have someone else tell you. IT's like when you write a paper. YOu want to get the best sources about everything, and not get information from a third party which may not know anything about the source.  The only problem I have is when I have to meet a person who already knows about me "through someone else"..when the time comes to meet, this person has this prejudgement about me. And sometimes in the conversation you hear from the person "I never knew you were like that"...well if they would have met me by themselve without having met me through another person, then they wouldn't have those assumptions about me in their head! Also...or lastly...think about it..if you were to meet someone on your own..and not get to know them through someone else, maybe there would be less prejudice in this world..or should I stay less stereotyping..because then you'd be learning of the source (first hand), rather than through a third person..that should make a difference, right?

       Money takers and stupid people..   Thu Nov 16 12:51:29 2000   So here's the deal. First off I am not writing this to defend anyone here..but I feel the need to voice my opinion on the following issue-though I'm sure there are others out there that totally disagree with me. But hey..if this is my opinion's page, I will say whatever, and all of you can write me back and say whatever you want in response. So the deal is this. This guy (as I found out) was recently found guilty of fraud, becuase he promised others that he would find them their lost lovers, predict the winning lottery numbers or remove hexes on people. And due to that he's being sent to jail. Okay..here's what I don't get...why is it his fault?? Can't there be stupid people out there, people stupid enough to believe anything. I mean, if you are over 18, you should be considered as a person who can make rational decisions (well in this society)--so then if people lets say over 18 called this man for the winning lottery number--heck they probably did it because they were making a rational decision--and if not..it's the people who called, it is their fault! I just think that if in this society we grant people so much freedom after the age of 18, then if those same people make mistakes and get cheated of their money...then it's that person's fault..not the man cheating thems'--fault.  We all do things to get extra cash or save some. And if this guy wanted to cheat people of their money because that's what he thought was a good idea, then heck he has a great imagination..and he should be allowed to get the money from other people. But people should be SMaRt enough to NOT believe him! Sure that man cheating on others to me (is NOT rational), but if that's the way he thinks of it, and he thinks it's rational, then I think it should be allowed!!!!!

       confidence..or egotistical?   Thu Nov 2 14:22:40 2000   So here's the new thing I have been noticing. If you are confident in what you do, people think that you have an ego (about yourself). I don't really get that though because, well what's wrong with being confident and liking the way you dress, act (in situations)...they can be good things, most of the time they are good things. But people in our society will point the finger at the man or woman who walks with his/her head up saying "look at that snob"...I'm sure that it's hard not to assume that, since it is somewhat rare to see confident people these days. But then again, we shouldn't welcome confident people by calling them "snobbish" or "egotistical"..rather we should think of them as role models..people we all should follow. If one can get him/herself to stand up for what he or she believes to be right and isn't afraid to show his/her opinion towards things, then who are we to judge them? I'm sure that the ones out there that do judge only do it because they are jealous of the other 'confident' individual--why else would they comment.  This brings me to another point. Mostly if not all comments made to a person or about a person, are made because the other person is jealous of him/her (being made fun of)..well that's a duh because everyone knows that... As always....I'd like to say..if you are confident and love expressing yourself...hey..I love you for it! But if you're going to stick around and hide from society because you are scared of others..then I suggest you rethink about yourself..because you know..you only get ONE life to live..live it to it's fullest..and heck be Confident (if you feel) for yourself! Forget what others may think of you for it! :)

       Friend or a suck up??   Fri Oct 13 20:38:52 2000       Hmm..I could talk about people on here, but I feel that this posting is not about pinpointing one person, but rather making a general statement. I guess I've thought about this issue forever, or well ever since I met my mom's friend (I'm NOT mentioning her name!). The thing is whether I could even call her a "friend" or a "suck up" or a "stranger" or an "aquaintance". She's just the type of person, who doesn't fit any of the definitions above.      Here's the thing. This women...I feel that she has a hard time making friends, whenever I've seen her, she's the one no one wants to talk to, and I guess it makes her feel bad, but what she does to get friends, is actually really annoying. Her way is to go up to the person she wants to be friends with and just start complimenting them...I mean sure we all love compliments but we only like to hear a FEW of them..not a trillion at once (usually if you aren't dumb you realize that this person is sucking up to you). But the thing is that this women feels that this is the only way she can make friends, and I guess I find that a "sad" way of making friends. I'm sure there are a lot of good stuff about her, but she either doesn't know how to express it or is just a shy person; but I fear the latter is not true, because if she was shy, she wouldn't be giving a trillion compliments/second!       So this leads me to wonder as to whether she is even a friend of my mom's? I mean she sucks up..that doesn't mean they are friends...friends do not suck up (not always or 24/7!)..I feel that I could label her as a stranger but she and my mom do speak sometimes..I guess the only thing she could be is an aquaintance (sp), but I always think of aquaintances as good things, she well I sure KNOW that what she does is NOT good!       I guess my main point here is that if you want to make friends, why not do it by showing others how you really are? Rather than maybe sucking up to them...(like my mom's no-name friend...) I feel that if you just let the other person understand you the way you are, you'll become much much Better friends then being friends based on compliments (which not to mention could be "Untrue" compliments")..I feel that sometimes these people who suck up, compliment for friendship, they don't give a crap about what they are saying! That's all..

       Impressions can become deceptions..don't fall for them!   Wed Sep 20 14:35:47 2000       I'm not one to brag about anything, but here's the thing. I guess it's been happening to me a lot this school year, than it has ever happened before! School started for me on August 28, 2000. The First week of classes, rather first day of classes, I met up with the people I had spoken with last year, and the thing that came out of their mind was "I thought you had graduated already!" Okay, okay, I wish I DID have graduated and I wish that I was in graduate school by now, but I'm NOT, nor have I graduated. I got this response from about 5 people during the first week, and I'm still getting it even now!     Now today..it's gotten to a point that I had to write about it. Earlier today I had two tests, one in Chemistry the other in Physics. Before I went to take the tests, everyone is like, hey you're "SMart" you'll do good don't worry. Hmm..how do they know I'm smart? I mean, they've never known me well enough to know my GPA, but rather they just assume that. Then just now, I was talking to another person, and he said "you're smart", I guess it made me want to talk about this issue on my msg board because it has gotten way out of hand. But in response to this, this person I spoke to asked me if I'd like it if everyone called me "dumb"...well of course I wouldn't! But why should one be called "dumb" or "smart" isn't there such a thing as being "normal"..being a person, not having to be identified by a characteristic...why not just a name?     I guess the worst part of all of this is that, I know way too many of the teachers on campus, I know them personally enough to talk to them, kind of more like a friendship thing sometimes, though not as deep as a real friendship. But the thing is this, now that I'm taking my classes this year, all 5 of my teachers this semester know me. One I had a class with during my freshmen year, the other I had a class with last year, and have anther class this year with him, another I had a class with last year and this year, another is my dad is friend, and the last one is the one I worked for in the biology dept. But the thing which bugs me is that ALL of these teachers (well 3 of them for sure!), have this image in their mind of me being "extremely smart"..I'm sure all of you out there are saying "Wow, congrats, you're lucky to have teachers think of you like that" but umm..actuallly No I'm not happy. Put yourself in the position once then tell me. Since my teacher think I'm smart, they think that I should know the answer to anything they ask in class..they look at me everytime they ask..they even call on me (who likes that??)! I thought I came to the class to learn..how the heck would I know the answers if I'm still learning just like the other students? Then there's the thing about when my teachers need help for something, hmm...they put me in charge for doing it in the class, it only makes the other students think that I'm a brown noser, which I am NOT! Then when you do bad on a test, this teacher wonders what happened to you..they call you into their office and ask you to talk it over with them! Well if they would have known from the start that I wasn't that good at the subject and had judged me as a "normal" student, then they would have understood my score. Then there's the thing about doing something in class, you're assigned a hard task, and you know what happens...everyone comes running to you...asking you to be their partner, because hey you could pop out those answers faster than them...but not always!      I guess sometimes, it's not too bad to be considered smart, but there is a limit to it. It's not fun being told that you are smart all the time..neither is it fun being told that you are the dumbest kid alive. All of us need to be judged as real people, and not supernatural genius's! If my teachers would just judge me from day one, on who I am..and not the way I dress (I admit, sometimes I do dress a bit like a smartass--but that's just taste in clothing!), then they wouldn't end up breaking the image they get of me later on. I guess all I can say is that it has gotten to a point, in which I go to my class right ON time because I hate being early to class, because then the teacher just talks to you, and asks you about this and that. It has also gotten to a point in which, when I see a teacher walking down the hall my way, I take the longer way to go wherever just to avoid my teacher. Don't get me wrong, I'm not Anti-social, but I'm just sick of all these impressions people start making of me even before knowing me well enough.      So briefly...for all of you out there judging others by their impression..do this--talk to them...see how they are. And if you need to comment, comment on something other than the person you're talking to being smart, because you never know if that person you're talking to might just be annoyed just like me. Btw...or lastly, don't ever make an impression of someone on the first day, and if you do please don't stick to it! It only makes you think more and it makes the person you spoke to, feel bad if they don't match up to what you thought they were/are! Note: You know who you are...I'm not making fun of you. I just took what you said and made a msg for my msg board out of it. Thanks though..1st :)

       Sticky Friends--No Thanks!    Mon Sep 4 21:08:07 2000   This message of mine deals with friendship. First of all, I'll define what a Friend is-though I feel that I probably cannot define it properly because there are too many ways/definitions to describe a friend. But I'll give it a shot anyways. Friends are people who are  there for you, when you feel down, people who understand you, people you can do things with without having to go overboard to  impress, and lastly they are/can be as close as family members if not closer.     The point of this message it to talk about those people out there who may come across as friends, but are rather, to me, defined as  "sticky" people. They are sticky because solely for the reason that they are not independent--they always stick to their friends for everything. Don't get me wrong, but I have friends (sometimes too many of them), but yet most of my friends are the ones who aren't sticky! They (my friends) are independent, they do not lean on me for everything.  I find that there is a certain distinction between a true friend and a "sticky friend" or a "user". Here's the thing, I talk to some of my friends on campus in college, and they'll be like "hey check out that guy over there walking by himself, he looks like he really needs  someone to walk with"...hmm to them "it just seems that way" but to me, I feel that the guy is independent enough to walk on his own, he is independent enough to get his things done rather than wasting him time on friends every second of the day. I mean sure there are times you should spend with your friends, but if one decides to revolve their whole life around "a friend" or a "group of friends" they'll never ever get anything done. Sometimes independence is better; think of how much stuff you get done when you aren't distracted from something, how you feel you have so much time for everything, and even after finishing everything, you still feel like you have time for other things...isn't that what all of us want? Hmm..now lets say that after spending our "extra" time on getting  whatever we needed to, and getting it done, we realize that we still have time left over..now to me, this is time to do something with a friend, or something of the sort. I'm not saying that one should forget friends, but that one should realize that there are other priorities  in ones' life other than friends...And though yes, friendship is a priority as well, but you need to prioritize everything, including "a friend". And for what I mean by a "user" and a "sticky" friend..hmm, well a friend that sticks with you for whatever you do, hmm..he/she is kinda using you for "Company"..who knows he/she could just hate you, but only sticks to you, because he/she is afraid to face the real world (there are people like that! they cannot walk alone by themselves!!!).     Anyhow..what else did I have to say..A repition--To me, a person is a good person if they do anything and everything independently. And if a friend comes along with this independent person, he/she treats the friend as a friend, and doesn't start taking orders from their friend. A person who lives his/her life under the control of a friend or stuck (sticky) to a friend is not an independent person. Say  that friend dies, then what happens?? I always wonder..sure that person will move on, but heck, they'll find another person to stick to. And yes, sometimes you should compromise with a friend as well--I'm NOT denying that! Here's the thing. I'm not jealous of people who have the bestest of friends, or whatever; I've got enough friends. But the fact of the matter is this, friends should be given time, and not given 24/7 of someone's life! Just like one takes time to do homework, one  should make time for friends. And one can still be good friends with someone even if they do not spend each minute with that person! I've been best friends with about 4 people now for the last 11 years, and well I don't spend each minute of my life with them and I guess they are fine with that, and they actually love me for it! They admire me for who I am...And I guess I feel independent enough,  that I can make time for my friends, and I can also do other things at the same time.      Independence is something I talk about on this message board a lot..and I just feel that everyone needs to live their life their own  way..forget society..forget that "image" thing..you're only messing your head up!

       Abortion Hypocracy!   Thu Aug 17 20:43:58 2000   In this message, I will post my views on abortion as once I did before and ended up losing the message due to my message board being deleted.  Before I go on to talk about my views on abortion, I'll explain what the topic of this posting "Aborting Hypocracy" means.  Well I called this posting that title due to the reason being that some (not all!) pro-life people are in one stance "for life" but yet at other times they are "for death."  Allow me to explain myself.  Well most pro-lifers say that you cannot equate life to anything, it's a gift granted to us and we cannot play God, but on the otherhand these pro-lifers go out and bomb abortion clinics and KILL abortion doctors!  Now how can life be so important in one situation, but not mean anything in another? These pro-lifers, (the ones that bomb clinics and kill abortion doctors) are hypocrites to me, solely on the fact that they don't stick to one thing!  Their views contradict! Now onto another thing about abortion.  When discussing this touchy issue, I meet pro-lifers and pro-choice people and while they have good reason to be whatever they choose--I feel there is a problem discussing the matter.  The problem is that both sides do NOT talk at the same level and I don't mean intellectual level.  I mean it as this, pro-lifers are for life, for the gift of life granted to us by God; Pro-choice people are for the right to choose.  But more so, pro-choice people think that a government cannot make our choice for us, and that only a woman should be able to make her own decision concerning her body.  Now while one side (pro-life) talks about the fundamental fact of life, the other side (pro-choice) talks about the laws of the government.  In order to debate on something both sides must have opposing views, and though a bit of the abortion debate is on opposing views NOT all of it is!! The argument of pro-life vs. pro-choice is somewhat like the argument of Darrow vs. The Board of Education argument.  This argument was based on the fact of allowing either evolution to be taught by one teacher in school (1 side) or to pass a law to never have evolution be taught in school (2 school).  While one was on one specific case, the other dealt with everything as a whole.  I guess I find that in order to debate an argument one has to set limits as well as levels to which the topic fits and thats the ONLY time that such a thing can be discussed.  But with abortion it's an endless battle--one is for law,the other for life. If they had one "for life" the other "against life" that would make sense!!! At times I feel that pro-choice people do believe like pro-lifers in the fact that one choice is life-but yet pro-choice people are only pro-choice due to the fact that someone cannot tell us what to do--that someone being the government.   Now onto my views about abortion.  Well I'm pro-life.  I , too, simply cannot think that a child could be taken out of a mother only because the child wasn't needed. I feel that life is granted for a reason, only God chooses who gets life and who doesn't-and I feel that we, in the outside world can Never play God!! Some may say that mothers cannot afford to raise the child, well God gave the child life, God will help the child--and there will always be couples out there willing to adopt the child! A life is a miracle, only granted to us, and that miracle is put on Earth for a reason, and there is going to be a way for that child to survive..again we cannot play God and know Exactly how that child will last in this world, if God put it on Earth, God has a plan!  Abortion to me is like murder, in essence we are murdering a child and getting away with it.  Why is it that when a child is born and say the mother kills it after birth it's considered muder, but if the child is killed in the womb, it's okay?? To me both situations are the same, a life has been killed!   Though I do believe in life, I also believe that our government cannot tell us what to do. Now to some that may mean I'm pro-choice--but I'm not! I simply cannot think that someone could kill a child and get away with it.  I'm stuck in the middle, I hate government control, yet I feel as if life is the most important thing.  I guess the reason for me feeling like this, being in the middle of this argument is because of there being NO limits to this debate! It's not defined and it leaves people in the middle!  Again, I'm for Life all the way, but yet I feel our government cannot make our choice for us.  And though I could be pro-choice, I feel I cannot do that because I'll be agreeing on allowing children to die-hence then I'll be a hypocrite as well-which is something I'm extremely against! Lastly, just had to say to all of you, I'm not one who would go out and bomb abortion clinics or abortion doctors.  I feel that will get us no where, there will always be doctors performing abortions and as immoral as abortion doctors may be-some just do it to earn a living--though it's an extremely BAD choice of profession.  Also, bombing clinics or killing doctors both are to KILL, which again, is something I'm against!!!!  Briefly--I'm pro-life, yet I feel that government cannot tell us what to do! Life cannot be equated to anything!  And I am against bombing abortion clinics, or killing doctors--because both are for killing people--when I'm for LIFE!

       Nature Vs. Nurture Argument..   Sun Jul 30 21:05:11 2000   The argument of Nature Vs. Nurture is used on almost everything these days, relating from sociology, psychology, to biology, etc. And for me to talk about all those issues at once would take me years, and it would make this posting extremely long. So to shorten the posting, I'm specifically going to talk about how sexuality is a mixture of nature and nurture.  Being the sociologist that I am (i.e. believing that we're influenced mostly by our society--environment), I used to think that a gay person or a lesbian person only chose to live that lifestyle because they were exposed to it. But now, I've changed my mind on that. I guess you can't specifically designate "nature" to one issue and "nurture" to the other. It's not as simple as people think it is, as I had thought of it to be as well.  The reason for me changing my mind is because I heard of that John/Joan case the other day on t.v. The case was about twins boys who were born, and while one of them was getting circumsized, the doctor accidently screwed up and there was no way to keep that twin boy a "boy". Doctors at Johns Hopkins decided to make that little boy a girl..and so started the life of this baby boy who was now surgically becoming a girl. Well as the story goes..the parents of this boy (now girl) raised him as a girl, and never told this girl that she was originally born a boy. But the weird part about this is that, all throughout the life of this girl (originally a boy), she always felt like a boy, she hated wearing dresses, she didn't understand why she had to take medicine all the time, while her twin brother didn't. So there came a time during this girls life when one day, the parents eventually told the girl she was actually born a boy, and that's when everything started to make sense for her. She started to understand why she loved to play with toy trucks and not dolls, why she hated wearing dresses, etc. Luckily, this former boy turned girl, finally became a boy again. But now he is given testosterone to make him look more masculine, since his body lacks the hormone (he was castrated). I guess this case proved to me that somehow we are born as a girl and a boy and we know it, and not everything is based on what our society tells us to be. You can put pink clothing on a baby boy, and hey maybe that boy will still act "boyish" because somehow they are wired to act that way..it's not that by putting pink clothing on a boy you can make them "feminine"! (personally I find that blue for boys, pink for girls thing to be stupid--society screws us from the start!). I guess both nature and nurture makes us what we are....And that's what makes all this (Sociobiology) interesting!

       A lie or a set of lies??   Sun Jul 30 20:59:40 2000   Hmm..something I noticed recently. The fact that when one person tells a lie, they don't just tell *one* lie, but rather tell many Lies..Here's the story, I won't name anyone, but I'll say that I've got friends who'll tell me something, and hey I know it's not true...So then two months later, I hear them telling someone else the same story, except the story is a bit changed and in essence my friend is trying to cover up her previous lie to me, with  another lie--hence she lies.  I guess the point of this posting is to say that one should never lie in the first place, it'll save them all the trouble they'd get into..and also, they wouldn't have to keep lying to cover up their previous lies..

       Killing in the name of God??   Sat Jul 15 22:21:46 2000   This'll be a short one, but I've realized the following for way too long, that I thought it'd be about time, that I mention it on my msg board! The issue deals with how people in different parts of the world are killed due to them being in a different religion (or believing differently), as compared to someone else. For example, there are cases where one muslim will kill another because he/she thinks that the other muslim believes one specific aspect of Islam to be different from what the other person believes to be true. The thing which bothers me is that in Islam, there is the fundamental rule of not hurting anyone, or not 'causing harm to anyone'. Well if that's the case, then why do muslims kill one another, because one muslim disagrees with the other about an issue??? It makes me question whether they are muslims or not? Talk about hypocrites! The only thing I know is that, the only true muslims out there are the ones that 'do NOT hurt anyone' and actually tolerate others on their beliefs; I mean after all  that's what Islam is based on--Tolerance!     By the way, this same case can be applied to Christians, and to Jewish people as well. Until everyone, in this world can learn to realize there are differences (between all of us), I will think of society as a whole to be ignorant, and self-centered.

       Euthanasia...   Thu Jul 13 22:45:37 2000   I've always questioned my beliefs on this issue. And sometimes I'll go with saying "oh the only person in control of our life is God", than at other times I think "well if the pain is that bad, then we should be to end our life". Yet now a days, I've started to believe the latter, and the following will be the reasons why. First of all, for those of you who read my posting on capitol punishment and then read this one, you'll probably think "hey she believes we shouldn't kill people, but here she thinks we have control over killing ourself--she's a hypocrite". Well, actually Not. See, I think that if there is anyone who has control over us, that person is ourself or god. I am strictly against the death penalty because it's not harsh enough, and also because NO one can decide on putting us to death, except, yes, us and god. But in the case of murder, then that stupid perpetrator put the victim to death, and it wasn't that, there, the victim had a choice. I mean, these days, *most* victims want to live a life, and occasionally you see victims who really did want to die. Now as to reason for why I'm for Euthanasia or also known as "Assisted Suicide". I think that if someone is in extreme pain, and he/she wants to end their life, he/she should be allowed to do so. Sometimes in these cases, the family members also agree on the assisted suicide but it never follows through because of governmental rules (isn't it our life??). Also, I just know that if I was in pain and felt pain everytime I walked, and just laid in bed all day, I'd rather die than to live that life with pain. That's got to be the worst torture out there (hence my reason for having murderers face life in prison!--except in prison they live a life full of guilt).  As always, most of my arguments relate with the self, and if *one* believes that he/she cannot live his/her life because they are in such extreme pain, then, hey I say, go for it. Now most of you out there will think, hah, she's telling other people to shoot themselves in the head, if they are extremely depressed--well NO. I guess I never defined that "extreme pain" I was talking about..well  the pain I'm talking about is the pain one suffers from some illness, or from being soo sick that they  cannot move and when there is nothing else out there to fix them into some 'good condition'. I DONT mean depression, sure it's pain, but I know that there are drugs out there to treat depression and with help, one can overcome depression. No I'm not cold, but there is a line between treatable things vs. non-treatable things such as cancer.  Also, while I'm at it..and since what I'm going to say does relate to the topic here..I wanted to talk about our government and why it does not allow any of us to freely smoke, drink, do pot, follow through in assisted suicide, ect. Why is that?? It is OUR life, it isn't the stupid government's life, why don't they allow us to do whatever?? There are some things which are just pretty damn stupid! Anyhow to end this and to re-iterate my point, I believe in 'assisted suicide' only because I believe that a person who is worthy of making decision for him/herself should be allowed to choose the choice between life and death.

       Magazines!!!   Tue Jun 27 17:36:38 2000   Magazines can be good; like the ones that talk about health issues, or the ones that deal with the news. But yet, despite all these magazines, there are magazines that are about fashion, make-up, etc. Now the only type of magazines that I have ever read and can write about are teen magazines-since I used to read them when I was younger (I was messed up).     I find teen magazines to be very annoying. All teen magazines ever encourage is for people (young girls) to become one specific type of person--a dying skinny, make-up filled, no clothing women/young adult. The only good part about those magazines is when they give helpful advice about things girls face. Or else these magazines are only good when they talk about  health issues.      But when these magazines talk about-whats in and whats not, how something should be worn, or how to wear make-up--that's when these magazines get annoying. All these suggestions ever do is form/make a Uniform style that each type of women/girl should follow. All throughout high school, I remember going to school and seeing how each year after summer vacation, each girl would come to school with that bob hairdo, or those capri pants, and that skinny "strip of cloth" called a tank top, etc. It was sometimes hard to distinguish one girl from the other-they all looked the same!! It was as if they weren't "unique" but instead were of a society made of a single uniform type of people!       My suggestion for these people is to follow/do what they believe, what they like, NOT what people in those magazines say is "in". The only way we can all be appreciated as "unique people" is when we start acting like those "unique people." And to be unique, one MUST follow what He/She believes to be "fashionable"!!      The only reason those magazines ever promote those capri pants or those Doc Martens is because those companies of those products are paying the magazine. And by having these people (us) buy those products, we actually are helping these magazines gain/win money! So in a way, when we pay to get a yearly subscription, these magazines probably get three times as much money back through US! Talk about being cheated! Why should anyone ever waste money when they don't gain anything??        Uniqueness comes with being yourself, and not copying whatever everyone else is doing. And that also involves not copying or listening to what magazines may tell you! sure if they give you advice on how to fix "dry hair" or something, then sure, go for their suggestion, but don't just copy the magazine page by page. I used to have a friend in high school, who'd copy every page of the magazine YM...each day she'd be wearing a different type of nail polish because it was 'said' to be 'in', or else she'd have her shirt flarred out because it was said to be 'in'! It annoyed the  crap out of me!      Also, another reason why magazines are bad is because magazines cause girls and also men to actually hate themselves. Just because the reader of the magazine doesn't fit with the model in the magazine, we as the reader sometimes, start having bad feelings about ourselves, we lose our self esteem, which leads to depression and sometimes in extreme cases it can lead to suicide. It's almost as if, it's better NOT to read those magazines!!       As always most of my topics on this msg board have dealth with individuality..but that's just what I believe in! Also, I just wanted to note here, that I am NOT jealous of anything! Some readers who may be reading this msg of mine and may think that I'm somebody who cannot do that or this, cannot afford that, or look like that, and hence that's the reason for me writing this msg.But truthfully, it's not. I could do all the things in those magazines, but I simply choose not to, because I'd rather be a'unique' person in this society who sticks out for being 'myself' without having to follow stuff out of a magazine, and I'd rather not walk with the heard of humankind who follows.

       Capital Punishment   Wed Jun 7 23:37:26 2000    My view on this subject has changed with time. At times I see a case on t.v. and think that the best form of punishment for the offender is the death penalty, yet at other times I think that he/she should be put in prison for life. But lately I've come to one point and only one point, which I keep sticking to over and over again. That being that I believe against the dealth penalty.       The reason I believe against the dealth penalty is as follows. First of all; now days they try to make the 'forms' of death a bit less painful than before, and it's no where near as painful as how much pain the victim of the crime probably went through. The pain the victim probably felt, was the pain of not being able to say goodbye to his/her relatives, the pain of the actual hurt caused by the perpetrator of the crime, the pain of being killed and taken away  by someone the victim did not know, the pain of seeing an unknown person as the last face the victim saw when he/she died. Now all that pain does not account to 'some' pain that the perpetrator would feel during a letal injection or an electricution (sp). Due to this, I believe that the only form of punishment for murderers is to let them have life in prison.       I believe that if a person is put in prison for life, he/she thinks about what he/she did wrong. Sure a lot of people out there think that life in prison isn't bad because at least you get to live. But who wants to live in a prison, with no windows, the only contact you have is with other offenders, the thoughts that (I can only predict) run through the heads of those offenders of living their life in the same place forever. I believe the better punishment is when the perpetrator sits around in his/her cell for the rest of his/her life and each night before he/she goes to bed, he/she has to think of what he/she did wrong. I know for a fact that when I do things wrong, and get punished for it or even not punished for it, I lay in bed at night and think about what I did wrong, and if I wouldn't have done it, I would be a happier person than I am today. But the things I have done are only 'small' kiddy things, no where near as bad as 'killing' others!!       If I had commited a crime, I would much rather have me sent to death than to live a life in pain thinking about the crime I had committed. Thinking about something you've done wrong is the worst kind of torture one can ever get (from my perspective). Though I'm sure there are others out there who probably believe totally differently from me I'm sure.       Please note also; yes I know that the cost of an inmate is high. Yes I know that our tax dollars go out to those inmates who are getting the best they can get for killing someone. And for that I must add as well, that I believe in actually cutting down on that cost..we do NOT need to supply inmates with t.v's, with stereo's, weight room's etc. What we need to give them is a room and a toilet..and some food. That is the only way they'll actually feel the torture of living a life filled with guilt!!!!

       Corporal Punishment..   Tue Jun 6 00:10:49 2000   I've written too many speeches on this issue and I've written too many papers on this issue, and I've also spoken of it too much with my friends, that I thought it's about time I mentioned it on here. The topic is of Corporal Punishment. Now that's NOT capitol punishment (some people confuse the two). Here's the thing, Corporal punishment simply put means "spanking a child". Capitol Punishment deals with the death penalty. Now that, that's out of the way I'll talk about my views towards corporal punishment. From my perspective, a parent shouldn't spank a child. The only thing spanking ever does is that it makes the child more aggressive and makes the child feel rejected and disliked, and stubborn. Studies have shown that parents who spanked their children severly had their children grow up to be adults with low-self esteem. Now this cannot be guaranteed, but it can happen. That's the same with most cases that deal with Behavioral psychology (you can't guarantee something, but you can say that it will be likely!).  Most people think that if you don't spank a child at all, he or she will be a spoiled brat. Well that could be true..but that's not what I believe. In fact, what I'm promoting is that, we *should* spank a child ONLY when it is really really needed. The times when spanking is really really needed is when a child does something that puts the child in danger. Say for example, if the child sticks his/her hand in the electric outlet, or on a hot stove; here spanking could save the child's life. But only here should spanking be used. Otherwise, other situations can be dealth with, without spanking a child. Also, it has been shown through studies, that if a parent does not spank a child, the child grows up to be a less agressive adult. A study done a few years ago by Eda Leshan, proved this. She studied Indian Tribes and some countries in which spanking is against the law. She found that also in these tribes and countries, the crime rate was really low.  Now, to talk about alternate forms of punishment instead of spanking. For one, the parent can send the child to his/her room, they can take away the child's allowance, or they can take away the child's privileges to watch t.v, etc. Now, I know most of you out there are thinking..Huh, so what if I send the child to his/her room...They'll just sit in their room for a bit, and then be done with the punishment (with no harm done!). But another thing I meant to mention is that, in order for this alternate form of punishment to work, the parent MUST talk to the child afterwards, the parent must ask the child why he/she was sent to the room, the parents must ask the child if he/she comprehended as to why they were punished. And if the child understands that, then does this form of punishment work.  Now onto another thing. Even when a parent "must" spank a child, the parent should still give a reasoning as to why the child was spanked afterwards. This reasoning and explanation should follow after the spanking as well, and should also include the child comprehending the reason for the punishment. Here too, will this type of punishment work. Lastly...I'm not one who believes in totally no punishment, nor do I belive that we need to whip a child everytime he/she makes a mistake. I believe in between a bit...and sometimes that's what can make a child a great adult.  By spanking, I don't mean "whipping" a child to death, but rather I mean it as a parent simply slapping a child on the butt, etc.

       social acceptance through children??   Sun May 21 22:51:15 2000   Hmm..well I've seen it happen too much..and this posting of mine is more of an "annoyance" as compared to my other postings, but nonetheless it's still a "thought" of mine :) So here goes. The story is like this; A parent tells his or her child to do well in school, or on his/her team (the child's) for Basketball (example!). So then when this child does extremely well, I mean, so well that the child is considered the best in the region, state, country, whatever--the parent starts to use this for their advantage. And the story goes from being a child's accomplishment to a parents way of 'showing off' to get attention within their (the parents) group of friends. I really don't like this situation, and never have. Now, I'm NOT saying that parents should never tell their children to do well in school--I'm saying that they should, but I'm saying that when the child does do well, the parent should leave it as an accomplishment on the child's part..an accomplisment in the child's life, and NOT make an accomplishment for themselves (the parent). The parent simply informed, the rest was on the child's part. The child could have either taken the advice thrown it away, or used it..and for those children that use the advice..it does not mean that it's all uh 'because' of the parent, but rather that it IS because of the child. I can be told to eat garbage for a year from my parent, and I'd say no to it..but till the day I realize that I DO want to eat garbage, I won't do it! Now, in this situation I did follow what I believed...the parent wasn't involved that much to be considered fully responsible for my action--I WAS! Also..I find that a lot of conversations these days between parents are of--my child did this, and my other one did that--come on, don't parents have anything better to talk about? I Know they are proud of their children..but should they announce it to the whole world?? Doesn't the paper in their town do that...I mean if the child does well, the child's name does come in the paper... Lastly..I DO believe that a parent should tell others about their child's accomplishment only when asked to do so! NOT, whenever there is nothing better to talk about in a conversation between parents!! If someone asks "how is your child doing" then say "hey, he's doing well..he got this blah blah blah"..but what I hate is when the first thing out of a parent is Hello (obviously), followed by "well ya know, my Johnny keeps winning everything"...HELLO did anyone ask??  To sum up..some parents use their childrens accomplishment to get attention...to gain superiority...to gain social acceptance...why can't those parents do it elsewise?? I always wonder? That's it...I hope I stated my point clearly..  Note: to all who read..I'm not jealous of anything..I love it when kids do well in school and make their parents proud..I love children who walk the right path..I just HATE parents who don't know how to praise their child's accomplishment in the right manner....

       Intelligent...or just a hard worker??   Wed May 3 06:27:14 2000   Every now and then I'll hear at school "oh you're soo smart" and it makes you wonder about whether the person it was referred to was actually smart or whether he/she is just a hard worker and naturally not that intelligent. Like lately, in my Organic Chemistry class, we had a test, someone did well in it and one of the girls said to the person "oh you're so intelligent" and it made me wonder, because recently in organic lab this person had been whining about how they had been studying for this test for a week and half or so. Now I believe that if anyone studied that much, everyone could get an A, even on an Organic Chemistry test! I don't believe that, that is intelligence, that's truely hard work!! (And NO, I'm not jealous that, that person got an A on the test, and that's not my reason for posting this message!!) The only distinction I can make between an intelligent person and a hard worker is that, an intelligent person doesn't study too much, but understands the material quickly, the intelligent person gets done with the test fast while the hard worker might take longer (because he/she isn't too intelligent), etc. I believe that there are probably more hard workers out there than intelligent students..I may be wrong..but that's what I perceive...

       Elian Gonzalez..come on!   Thu Apr 27 21:20:12 2000   Okay so lately in the news there have been stuff with Elian Gonzalez. Well I have one view on it and only one. And that is that I don't understand how people can actually equate relatives at the same level as a parent?? Come on..The only one that has the rights to this child was his mother or his father and that's it!  If the person who had come to get Elian in the US had been his mother (if she hadn't died, and her dad was the one who had died bringing Elian)--then NO one would question whether Elian should be with his mother or not...because that's his MoTher, and in this society they give more rights to the mother..sure she was a caretaker..but so was the father, they both are at the same level! People need to go past their typical stereotype and stop thinking that this father cannot raise a child or something..and to QUit thinking that those relatives of Elian can!! It's just plain old stupid..

       old argument mentioned once again...   Wed Apr 5 21:24:43 2000   Alright, I've mentioned this before, but I had to talk about it today again, because of what I read. It's about how people will go out and try to blame the tobacco industry because they became smokers and got addicted. Well, my position on this is as follows. First of all, in the united states, everyone wants to have their own rights to do whatever, we can't wait to be 21, so we can drink, we can't wait to be 18 to buy cigarettes. So I guess when we turn 18, it should be considered good or exciting that we are finally considered "adults" and are allowed to do whatever. And the age of 18 marks the age of becoming independent. Well if that is granted to us, and if we have become independent by the age of 18, then we should be able to make the right decisions (right?)--of course the law thinks so. So then why is that these stupid people out there blame the tobacco industry? They are the ones who made the decision of smoking and became addicted..it's their fault, not the tobacco industry's!! I seriously don't understand it! I mean every company out there wants to make money by selling their products, and now it's the consumers job to know what to use and what not to use!  Sure I guess if someone started smoking at a younger age than 18, maybe the above could be wrong. But then, still that person should be at fault..he/she is the one causing harm to himself/herself..not the company! Why is it that we don't sue companies that make coffee or Mountain dew, or alcohol? Aren't all those addictive as well?? I think that if someone is trying to sue the tobacco industry, they should seriously think of sueing other companies..ones that make alcohol..because alcohol does cause death too! But, STILL, we are the ones who want to be free and be able to do whatever we can do, but when we are granted the right of doing "whatever", we, ourselves Abuse it, and then try blaming others for it! This case with the tobacco industry is purely the smokers fault...I have no remorse for smokers!  note: I am not a smoker..nor would I become one. I did make the right decision, and used my privilege granted to me properly. Others probably do the same, but then when somethin bad happens they think they can blame the tobacco companies..

       Racism...   Sun Mar 19 23:58:01 2000   My views on racism are pretty basic. And after taking a few classes in biology, I wonder as to how stupid people could have been and still are, to judge others simply by the color of one's skin. It's as if we can help it, if our body produces more melanin, carotene, or hemoglobins (the stuff that color ones' skin)! If we could control the production of those three colorants, then maybe one should be racist or judge us by the color of our skin, but when you have no control over our color what so ever, why the hell do people out there sit around and judge others simply by the "darkness" of ones' skin? It's so damn stupid, and it really does piss me off! To think that there are ignorant people out there who really believe that the inside of a "darker" person looks different than a "white" person? How stupid! If that idiot, whoever said that would have read at least one biology book or even took one biology class, he/she wouldn't be saying stuff like that! I guess that racism isn't only based on skin color. The majority of it is based on jealousness. When one type of race realizes that another race or ethnicity is better than them, that group of people starts to hate that other race..they try to find characteristics of them to hate, wheter it be skin color, religion, looks you name it (it's like what Hitler did). And to think that people are still stuck at that childish level of thinking simply angers me! All I can say is that I wish all of you out there would sit down and simply think about what you say or do towards others before you open your mouth and say something which you wish you had never meant... Racism is something that needs to be stopped..something that should start to decrease during this century, rather than increase....

       Selfish Society..or isn't it?   Wed Dec 29 19:20:39 1999   Now that I am off and out of school for at least 4 weeks, I've had the time to sit around and deeply think about issues (or well I think I have!). Something I've been thinking about, and by no means am I the only one to think about it, because I've heard others write up on it, is the fact that most if not all of us are selfish. Sure, most of us will go out and do things in the community or do things for others (even I do that!), and think we've done a great deed, but no matter how hard we try to help others, there is usually another motive involved behind our actions. I used to think that I did everything because, sure I wanted to help everyone, and I did, but if I really really thought about it, 1 in the 5 times I've helped someone within a week or so, I've done it to benefit me. Of course there is nothing wrong in doing that, or at least I don't think so now (since I do it too!).  Before I didn't believe in what I stated above..I used to think that there were weirdos out there who made up stuff like that claiming that everyone was/is "selfish", but it took me a lot of time to sit down and really think about it, and realize that sure, sometimes we are selfish. I suppose that god made us to help ourselves get where we want to be first, and on our way to success, it is considered okay to help others. Those of you out there who might think that what I say is just a bunch of b.s., I would like you to sit down and really consider what I've said....Just think that I was in the same position you were a while back and it took me a while to realize that everyone is a bit selfish, and maybe you'll realize it too.  Ever wonder why we have kids? Sure some people say that 'making kids is fun' but the real reason is that we want our "genes" to be passed onto another living being so that we don't end somewhere..or something. That in itself is selfish..yes we want "us" through our "genes" to stay alive through our grandchildren, or even great grandchildren, even after we are dead. It's like saying, "sure we can't live that long, but we can hope that someone can at least carry our genetic info into the next millenium or even later on..". Note: yes I do realize that there are philosophers out there who've come up with this exact same reasoning before..and in no way am I steeling what they've said..I'm only saying that I'm actually beginning to learn now as to what they meant by it..

       Child Rearing...who should do it?   Tue Dec 28 21:55:33 1999   Recently I went to my friend's house and I had a few hours to sit down and chat with my friend's mother. I've got to admit that my friend's mom is one interesting person! She talked to me about, how people in this society take children for granted. There are people out there who cannot have children...people who would love to give a child the perfect home..the home that some parents who 'can' have children don't give much about. She talked about how, once in your life you have the chance to mold something into the way you want it to be like, almost like the way you mold clay when you make pottery. It really made me think about how people let others' raise their children, through day-care...by letting ones' children be raised through daycare, the parents are only letting their children learn that the values that should matter to the child should come from what the daycare provider seems to find most fit. Now is that what most parents want? I personally wouldn't think so. As much as I am for woman working and all when a child is born or even a father working when a child is born (well the father one is a given)..I still believe that when a child is born, one parent should stay home and raise that child, so that the child grows up having the same values that the parent finds to be good/moral. If that is done, and parents do raise their children themselves rather than having a day care provider do it..I'm sure that we'll see less problems between parents and children. I believe that sometimes the misunderstandings between children and parents are based on what the child has been taught or has learned, whether it be from his/her friends, or more so from a day care provider. I believe that this problem could simply be solved if a parent would spend more time with the child when it is born and stop fussing over making enough money to support the family. Note..though it is true that there are single parents out there, and raising a child can be hard, when the parent also needs to work, etc. Yes, I understand the situation, but I believe that, even that situation can be fixed or something. I mean sure, most of us don't start out thinking that they want to have a child and raise it themselve (though some might)..But if one is the only person raising the child and has to rely on day care while he/she works to make money for the house..what he/she can do is he/she can at least talk to the child or do something like read them a book before they put that child to bed each night. Granted the mother/father might be tired, but hey, I guess that's just one thing that comes with a child. No mother/father has said that raising a child is easy, and no mother/father has ever said that hey, they weren't tired when their child cried, or needed attention. I guess it's a price the parent must pay. (I don't want to sound mean or anything, but most parents do experience what I've stated above..no I'm not a parent, and I may be wrong, but I've heard the above enough to think it's correct).

       Perception.....is it a deception?   Sun Dec 19 22:32:46 1999   So I got my nose pierced earlier this year, before school started..not because I wanted to come across as a rebel or anything, but because I had wanted to get my nose pierced for the longest time. But the only thing a lot of people say to me is that I did it because I'm rebellious. I personally don't care that people would say that to me, but I think that what people say is pretty stupid too. Yes again, I may sound repetitive, since most of my postings are on this issue, but people need to stop juding others by what others look like. So what if I have my nose pierced..that does not make me rebellious! It's the perception or stigma of it that's attached to nose piercings in the US that causes others to think that I did it to be a rebel. But in reality if people knew me, they'd know I'm no where near a rebel... I know that the first impression is usually done by one's appearance, when he/she meets someone. While most will stop at that, and sometimes judge others by just that (bad bad thing to do), what people should do is go beyond that. Yes it does take more time to actually have a person open up, and yes it takes time to see what a person is from the inside but in the long run it's a better 'impression' of the person based on who they are, rather than what he/she looks like.  Sure in this society you do give others an impression of who you are by the way you are (how you dress, look like, etc), but that, from my perspective, is pretty stupid...People should dress the way they want to, I don't mean, dressing naked-sure it might be someone's way, but I'm strictly talking about clothing here, since clothing is a norm, and not dressing at all is against the norms in society. I'm not promoting rebellion, but just saying that people should just start doing things their way which are in the norm of society, but yet are not soo restricted, that the person whose doing whatever is only doing it to please others..BE Yourself, not what others want you to be LIKE! :)   *I hope I made sense there!

       What you do..and who you are..   Fri Dec 17 08:19:26 1999   Okay..I was talking to my friends the other day. We started talking about our favorite singers, and I said that mine was Bryan Adams..And some of them said that they used to like Bryan Adams, but they don't anymore, ever since they found out he's racist! WELL I really don't get this. I'm not racist or anything, but I like Bryan Adams..I like him because he sings well, I don't want to think of him as somebody I'd look up to anything (I'm way beyond on that age!).  But it's pretty weird, that people could hate someone solely on the fact that he/she was racist or did actions that made them not acceptable..I, personally don't believe in that kinda stuff. It's like my previous posting about smoking...My friends smoke and I still talk to them, smoking doesn't make a person, it's the personality that makes a person! People need to stop judging others by what that other person does..everyone has a fault...people need to quit picking on it. I'll never hate someone because they are racist (well singers, because I only like them because of their music)..but then again it can be a different story if I choose to associate with this person and be friends with him/her.

       annoyance   Wed Nov 10 14:41:16 1999   I always wonder if people put on 'acts' when they are around others or are they really that way? I know a friend of mine, and she acts as if she's interested in people (certain persons) but in reality I know she's not! I know the type of person she is, and I know her background and I know that no matter what or how she tries to act..she's really not that interested in them!! The people who put on those acts are pretty stupid, because not only are they being rude to the person they are talking to, but they are also hurting themselves by giving others a 'impression' of them which isn't even correct. I guess it seems odd to me now days to see stuff like this..I wish people would just stick to their normal selves...it'd make everything a lot better, and it would also clear up some misunderstandings.

       Beliefs..   Wed Oct 13 13:50:23 1999   It really amazes me on the fact that people will not choose to associate with someone if he/she believes differently than them....it's really quite annoying. I mean, I may think that one's beliefs may be wrong, but that does not make me stop talking to them or rather not talk to them in the first place.  People who try to find others like them who only share their beliefs are making a mistake....Our world is made up of different, unique people, and that's what makes society interesting. If we were to only talk to people who are exactly like ourselves, then we are only boring ourselves (from my perspective). I know that some people out there might love talking to people just like them and I guess that's fine..but I don't do that. :)

       from my perspective..   Mon Sep 27 23:49:14 1999   Just something to add today..about what I think/believe.. From my perspective, I believe that everything anyone ever does, or should I say that anything that the majority of the population does, is usually if not always based on the fact that the person is doing it to fit in with society. People commit crimes to get rid of people making fun of them (who cause them to too look like outcasts). People dress like stars so that they look cool. People talk in a certain way to fit in. People follow norms only because if you don't then others' will look at you and be amazed... While I guess most peope would say that, that's what makes a civilized person and one for society..I believe differently. I guess that if everyone was to follow just about everything the way I said above, then we'd be having a zillion copies of one type of something. And that would really suck because it'd only make it annoying, and non-unique. I guess our society probably likes people who are non-unique or something. Well enough about my thoughts..they are just for today..tomorrow I'll probably read this, and wish I had revised it! As always I believe in individuality, or independence...always do what you believe is right, not what others tell you as being correct or good!! With that I'll end this.... -Anostica

       Evolution!   Tue Sep 7 13:46:36 1999   So I'm taking Genetics in college, and took introductory Biology last year in college for Biology Majors (I'm a Human Biology Major). Odd thing I've noticed is that people in my genetics class, are all biology majors, but when my teacher mentions the subject of "Evolution", almost half of the class shakes their head in disbelief! I really dont' understand why! I find it pretty stupid that people mix religious beliefs with scientific findings! I would personally still believe in evolution even if my religion thougth evolution was wrong! I think that people are just ignorant! And to think that people who are majoring in biology could still believe that we as humans haven't evolved, even if a little! I guess the only reason I see, which might cause people to not care about evolution is the following. I guess when you are told over and over to believe that something didn't happen, most 'uneducated people' take whatever they are told at face value and don't bother to investigate it themselves.! And when this happens we get people all over believing in the same thing, and when you ask them why they may believe in it, their only answer is because that's what their religion says! I guess if one is ignorant, he/she doesn't really want to know what the other side sees, only because that one person is stubborn enough to not care..and that's what causes resistance and stupidness! If only people were more open and listened to what others had to say, maybe today I'd be seeing more people in my Biology courses who truely knew what evolution was, instead of sticking to what their religion had told them about it!  We cannot have a religion teach us about science, it does not work! Nor can science teach us about religion..they are two seperate things..and should be kept seperate!

       Wasting time on education? huh!   Wed Aug 25 22:23:17 1999    Okay..so my major in college is Human Biology and my minor is Chemistry for pre-medicine. Though I know I'm going for pre-med and am very much so excited about it, I know that I might someday decide (or have decided) to rather go into the graduate school of medicine and much rather go into research which would still be dealing with the health field! Now, my third plan is that if neither of those work, I'd love to become a professor of one of the behavioral sciences out there (psychology, Sociology, Antropology), or a professor of biology! Now, the thing which annoys are people who ask, "hmm..what's your major" and so I tell them, then their eyes open and they are like "damn you know how long you'll be in school for that?" I mean come on...damn right I knew/know how long I'll be in school for my professions, but I'm not gonna give up just because it'll take me around 11 years or after high school!! People in our society are way too impatient or stupid and people who say crap to me like "wow, what are you getting yourself into" are stupid! I mean, yes there are tons of people out there who are doctors, or professor (my dad is one of Electrial Engineering at my University!)...but hey, they made it that far and they weren't impatient and didn't give up! Why should I..and well that's really not the point, the point is that I want to do what I'm doing!  The only way I'll ever be happy is if I become a doctor or a professor, but that is my goal in life! And that's like my one goal which I really really want to achieve, so why should I give it up! And if god granted me life, why don't I live it to the fullest and become something to help humanity or become something I've always wanted to be! I mean others can get to where they want to be by going to college for 4 years, even others can get to where they want to get by not going to college at all, but I want to go where I've dreamed of and it'll just take me around 11 years (or less)...I should be entitled to fulfill my dream as well..that's all!  Note: yes education is very important to me..but yes I know, that one should also not indulge themselves in only education as well...education is just one thing which is a part of someone's life...and in this argument I was 'only' talking about 'education'..yet there are 'other' things!

       perfume..    Mon Aug 9 22:33:58 1999   I'm 19 years old and have been going to school almost my whole life..without a year off, etc. I guess it amazes me about how "school" has become a place to show off your materialistic things rather than a place to learn and study. It is also a place to meet friends... I guess one thing which drives me crazy is how women and men (many times females), who wear really really strong perfume! I'm sure all you know what I'm talking about, when I say that the perfume reaks soo bad that it makes the whole room stink...etc. I guess if that's the person's preference, then let it be that. But I guess it's just that, it makes me wonder if school is made as a place to show off yourself? I mean I would never want to get attention of others by wearing such strong perfume that it reaks up the place. I know that some (not all) do wear perfume/cologne only to have others turn around and see whose wearing the "stuff." That's pretty stupid, because why should one try to get anothers attention by his/her smell? Okay, it may be good to smell nice..but should that be the first thing?? I mean shouldn't one be meeting someone by how the person's personality is like...or what the person's views are like..rather than their smell or clothing?  I personally am against getting attention by clothing, or smelly perfumes..and that's why I tend to wear very light perfume..I just like to meet people by their views and their personality, rather than their smell..I guess after I get to know the person better, than it's okay to realize the person may smell good, but that shouldn't be the first thing!! Though I do realize that naturally, smell and looks are the first thing people notice when you meet someone. But what is bad is that our society judges people solely on those things...and my view on that..is that it shouldn't be like that. People should go beyond someone's looks, clothing, and how he/she smells, and people should look at what the person has to offer from the inside because that's what truely shows what a person is like! Many people in society may not be able to afford great "materialistic things" but should that make them excluded from others because people are ignorant enough to not talk to them...?? I've seen it happen in some situations to many people..and after seeing it happen for soo long..there comes a time when you just get sick of it!!

       Cliques...   I talk with many people from time to time! People from different cliques, etc. Usually what I notice is that, once there is a newcomer to one of the cliques..he/she is usually in the process of transforming him/herself to be just like the rest in the clique! Even if that person doesn't like what the other people are into, he/she just tags along!!  That personally drives me crazy! As when I was younger, and didn't know much (yah there was time like that, perhaps I'm still in it!), I remember I used to tag along with people too, in a clique! Then I realized that to be in a clique really really sucked, because then you are only making yourself be a weirdo..and following what others are doing etc. Cliques only brainwash you into thinking a certain way and nothing else..and the reason being for them is that everyone else in the group is doing it too! Though I still do stuff with my friends, from different cliques..I always stick to what I like and think is right, and not just what others perceive to be great and correct! I never fall for something because others fell for it too..unless I too thought it was good.  If you gotta live life, you gotta live it your way..not the way others want you to live it! So don't let others control your tastes, personality, whatever..be YOU!

       To be (yourself) or not to be (yourself)   Okay, so I have this craze for the color yellowin fact it's starting to get out of hand. It seems that everything I ever chose to buy has to be yellow and if not yellow, it has to be burgundy/brown. Lately, I've been telling my friends and my family about the color of car I want to buy (when I get enough money!)that color being Yellow. My family and some of my friends think I'm setting myself up to be a taxi driver. I find that quite absurd because there is nothing wrong with the color yellow, and to be associated with as taxi driver isn't bad either (just not my choice of profession). It's pretty stupid that society attaches things/names to colors. I mean some meanings to colors are fine in some context (say traffic lights), but to say that yellow cars can only be taxi cars is stupid. I'm not going to change my mind about buying a yellow car just because of what others may think of it as. Now onto another case, which may be somewhat related if not totally. This case applies to other things in society say for example, the view that man cannot have/grow long hair because our society (shamely) may perceive them differently! What the heck does long hair on men have to do with anything? Will that long hair make them stupid or something? Many people in the world, think that long hair is only for girls/womanwell I beg to differ on that opinion.  There is a limit to how long hair can grow. Say for example, a woman growing out her hair, she may realize that her hair once it reaches a certain length, it stops growing. That length can depend on many things, such as nutrition or heredity, etc. I have long hair and I have realized that that once my hair reaches down to my waist it stops growing. Well if this same thing is looked at upon men, one realizes that men also can grow their hair however long (in early age, until they start losing hair, it might be harder to grow it then) too, and many men do (which is good). But the fact is that if men can grow their hair just as long as women, then when god made a man/woman, god didn't care to bother with which sex would have the long hair, and why should we have to bother with that? Why should we stick names to men with long hair and sometimes (now) women with extremely short hair? One good thing about our society is that it is made up of people with different tastes. But when we see others practicing those tastes (such as men growing out their hair) we start judging them, because of it! Now that to me is obviously very stupid. Why is it that people in our society sayI love/like a person who is just him/her, or who is unique. Well isn't a man growing out his hair himselfor even unique? Or is that considered as something stupid or out of this world? In many ways our society practices doublethink (holding two contradictory views at the same time). This only shows how ignorant, and hippocratic our society really is.  Another thing is that many people follow the latest fashion only because our society conditions us into thinking it looks good through the media, etc. But I do know that there are many people out there who only follow fashion because everyone else is doing it, and not because he/she likes it. For example, a friend of mine, he wanted to get sandals only because everyone had themI asked him, if he liked them, and he said that it wasn't a matter of liking them, they were just in! That's just one example of how people in our society do things only because others perceive it as good and they themselves may not see it as good/cool. They follow the trend to be accepted, rather than not follow and be criticized; shamefully, that's the truth in some instances. By talking about fashion, I do not mean that one should not follow it at all or hate it; I'm just saying that one should only follow it because he/she DOES like it. If you like the latest fashion and then follow it, it's fine, but please don't follow it only because others like it and not you. You have control over yourself, not others! You don't ask others about when you can take a shower, you simply take it when you feel like it (to look good, feel better), so do what you want to do and be unique for yourself, while our society may sit there and consider it differently!  Many of you have probably realized my views on these things by now, and they may not fit with the same views the majority of our society may hold. But I'm not going to sit here and change my views, only to make them fit in. I guess that should make me a unique person (considering I am myself)or um shouldn't it?  Note: I do not say that one should be going against everything even if he/she believes it to be wrong him/herself, that is not my intention. My intention is to say that one should only do what he/she feels like doing just as long as he/she is the one that likes it and not because others like it.

       My Life...Your Life..   Many of my friends smoke, but I don'tyet that does not stop me from talking to my friends who smoke. Some people I know, say that smokers are bad people (how can smoking make people bad?) and that associating with them is stupid. I really don't understand that statement. I mean, my view on life is that one should do what he/she feels to do, and that having others tell you what to do is stupid (say to stop smoking). Most of my smoker friends know the dangers of smoking and I have told them about those dangers too, but if that doesn't stop them, then I have no right to not talk to them or judge them by their actions. [I am not resisting or trying to avoid my friend's personal matters by not dealing with them (as if I don't care about my friends), but I simply feel that I have no right to be the one telling them about what is right or wrong either.] Their actions (such as smoking) does not make them bad people, in fact I've been friends with some of them for the last 12 years now and they haven't influenced me. If they know all about smoking and still do it, then let them be the way they are, it is their own life not mine!  Lately, some laws have been passed raising the price of cigarettes, in hopes of stopping people from smoking. I know that the law was passed to stop underage smoking but other people who were affected were people over the age of 18! I talked to a few friends of mine (who smoke and are 18+ ) about this price increase, and they said that the only thing that the law had made them (my friends and other smokers) do was become more stubborn. They said that a little price increase would not help stop their addiction, and that no matter what, they'd still smoke. And why should it stop anything? It is the smokers life, not ours, let them live it the way he/she wants to, not the way we expect them to!  Now onto another case. Some people believe that athletes who beat their wives are bad athletes! But again, I don't get that! How can beating one's wife, make you a bad athlete? It might make you a bad person (morally) but how could that influence one's performance? I mean if someone looks up to the athlete (say a young child), then the person (athlete) may be considered bad, but to say that the athlete sucks (in performance) because he beat his wife is dumb! This case also applies to actors who are good actors or actresses who act well, but yet their personal life may hold many addictions. We as the audience need to judge those athletes and actors/actresses solely on their performance and not on their personal life! As in the case of Hugh Grant being judged on his fling with a prostitutewell what he did was morally wrong (considering he had a girlfriend), but did that affect his acting? Absolutely NOT! He still acted the same. He might have been immoral in his personal life, but that should be none of our business, since he still fulfilled his job of being an entertainer to the public! In conclusion, we need to realize everyone has a personal life which needs to be kept private, or which needs to be handled individually! And it is none of our business to interfere with it, since everyone is entitled to their own personal privacy and is entitled to make their own decisions! Note: I realize that with friends, that personal/private life thing is sometimes brokenonly because that's what friendship is sometimes about (sharing your experiences, etc).

       Hello Everyone! I finally have my message board set up and running again! I will repost what I used to have on here, and then from time to time I will add more stuff as they come to me! It's funny but I started this message board thing when I was  19 years old, and a sophomore in college, but now I'm 22 years old and a graduate student, and I *still* have things to add and talk about :) Hope you enjoy....

       Materialistic World...       Ahh..it's time for school once again, as I start tomorrow morning! I not only will be a grad student but will also be a grad assistant teaching a biology lab class! yahh :)    Hmm, onto the topic of this msg board..yes, the materialistic world..Well that's a no brainer, because lots of people these days are materialistic. But hey, it's still pretty stupid and annoying.  I don't know, but this issue really made me mad in the last few weeks, when my friends have been telling me this or that..and then all they EVER talk about is...well that cost me this much, and geez I need that to look so rich and look so cool. Hmm...it's so weird though, because sometimes I'll sit there and agree with them, but inside me I'm thinking, God, why dont' you realize it's not what you wear or show that makes you, it's what you ARE..Of course, I cannot tell these people what I think, because honestly, I believe in letting someone do whatever they want, and if I tell them what to do, then I'm ruining their sense of individuality.....Most of you might think, hah, not even tell your friends?? Well.....I have told them..but you only tell a friend once, they are old enough to know what's cool, right, and what not...So I leave it up to them...and in the mean time, I look at those fools with everything, who've wasted all their summer savings on looking trendy, thinking they'll get that attention, only to realize how much of a sore loser they are, not only financially, but also in real life! :(

       Messed up people..   November 11, 02  Hmm..been a while since I last wrote on here..but this new message will be long. It's more of a complaint more than anything. I've been complaining about it since last october, but it's about time I write it all down, cause it's stupid to recite it to everyone over and over again, but never to write it down on the net.    well it relates to people, or maybe a person. I guess it's stupid how people when they've only known you for a few months will start thinking you are their best friend, and then go out of their way to tell everyone that you and them are the bestest of friends in the world..only because you might have spent some time together, or shared a few thoughts here and there. Honestly, to me a "best friend" is a friend who has been your friend for ages..everyone else in my mind is and will be an "acquaintance"..but how do you tell this person that? Well you can't...all you can do is a be a good friend to them.   And so the story goes. When you have this friend..you try to make them feel good, and will at times put yourself down so much, make yourself look so stupid by saying that they are better than you here and there, so that people will talk to them, and forget you. But still in the end, it never turns out that way, or it might sometimes, but in the end the person you were trying to impress, comes back to you at another time and tells you "your friend despite you making him/her look good" didn't do me any good, cause honeslty I saw the real smart person... What do you do then?    Then there's the fact that there are friends out there, who think that they have to be by you EVERY single minute of the day! Isn't there a such thing as independence?? Yes I call these people "leeches".....It's okay if friends hang out, but it's not okay when that friend thinks that everything you do, he/she should do with you. It's not okay, that the minute you get out of class, this person calls you up, and wants to know exactly where you are..it's not okay when this person will skip class only to waste time with you...what the heck is education for then?? Being an independent person, that I am...it's simply not my nature to be put down, or bogged down with someone..I simply cannot do that. And when it comes time for school starting and other activities in my life, you have to make sacrifices, and how do you decide which comes first? Well you bring it down to one thing, what are you at college for? An education right? So you go for the education.....   And when this "leech" actually leaves you....and you realize, God, how much I am enjoying life more now! How much more time you have, for doing just about anything you need....how much time you have to study...how much time you have to just enjoy life..and how much time you have, to just figure out what you want to do with life....and figure out how you want to spend your every minute of the day. It's an unbelievable experience..one you only really realize to appreciate when you lose it, and are given it back again..    And when you are independent..this leech is gone..you start hearing things..your previous friends who had given up talking to you cause you were always with this leech come up to you to tell you about how much this leech annoyed them..how much they though this person wasn't really my type...how much this person put me down to make himself/herself look good..how much this person was selfish...It's sad to hear that out of your other friends mouth..when you thought this previous leechy friend was still maybe a friend...but then later on, rethinking you realize what had caused you to be brainwashed...Worst of all, it's when people come up to you and tell you, yah this person was really a show off...and say I am glad I can talk to you now..and how much they appreciate inviting you to visit them w/o my other "half" (as assumed before) from coming along....   Lastly..it's the worst when people wonder if this person/former friend of yours ever had his/her own friends? When it's the fact that the only thing that unites you and him/her are your very OWN friends, who are now his/her friends too....You wonder if this person could have had it all this big..you wonder...but people come to reaffirm it...and at times, you still stick up for this person..and people debate with you..and tell you that you are wrong..and that this person was really what you had figured he/she was....honestly he/she was just a wrong turn in ones' life......

       Annoying girls...    Yes I am back again, and back again with another complaint. Gosh, it seems to me like I can't get over it. It's weird, you get done with one friend, and think God, I'm finally never going to have to talk to her, and have to hear her cries for men...and then you run into another girl like her again!! I don't know, and I don't get it. Why do girls try soo hard to get a males' attention?????? My friend, previous/very annoying, thank god I'm not friends with her friend, yes her...I had to put up with her constant nagging for geez almost a year about how she always wanted someone and they did not notice her in that way!!! She would always get mad...she was always frustrated..and even a smile to her was a huge huge thing....I wish I could have told her, dammit get over it..everyone smiles at everyone, it does NOT mean a thing!!!  So finally, I'm over this last leachin type friend..   So next friend...SAME thing! geez, what is this world made up of?? Desperate girls or what?? This new one isn't that bad, she doesn't waste all her time on men..she does get straight A's..she knows the limit..but what am I? A complain booth?? Geez, I get all these phonecalls from her (like I got from the previous leech)...and the phonecalls are all about...Oh god, it didn't work out..oh god I think it was a smile..oh god why does he not see that way?? Mmm.....yah, I've memorized her number, it's quite fun just ignoring her number coming up on my cell phone.....    It's not that I think girls are totally messed up..but I think they need to set their priorities straight!! I mean, it's one thing to make time, and go about it, but another to waste all your time about such frivileous (sp!) things! And it's very annoying when some of these girls take their study group time as an opportunity to get someones' attention..how crazy is that???     Priorities should be in life...not everything is about finding a match.....People need to find a time and place for everything...uggh, it just gets me.that's all!! Everyone has their own priorities I know, but there should be specific times for each priority....give or take a few!!

       Education--private or publically announced??   Just a thought which has come up in my mind..as I have found out that it is practiced in way too many areas. The thing is whether education should be considered private or a public thing. What I mean is this..when someone does well in school, should he/she be happy about it, or should it be written in papers everywhere announcing how well they did?? Or should their scores even be written comparing his/her final score to others, so that those who did worse can feel bad (even though they passed)..and the ones that did extremely well can have the biggest ego ever just because they did so well?? why is that....   I don't know...when you get an education..is it for yourself? Do you get those grades because you want to? Do you do well because you want to accomplish something in life? Or do you do all that ONLy to publically announce it to the whole world..so that everyone knows that you're a genius....Personally, to me, my accomplishments..I achieved those because I wanted to gain something in life..I wanted to learn. My accomplishments are not something I feel the need to show off about, nor are they something I'd slam in someones' face to make them feel worse of how they did. When it comes to classmates, and the whole publication system of grades, I feel it doesn't teach people much but only put the person who got 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 15th place down...they only realize that though they may have passed, they still sucked..because someone still beat them....somewhat like, a bittersweet ending..you can't even enjoy that happiness because it's still bitter in the end.....

       Feigning Interest       Yah, another one of my complaints again. But this one is valid and a good one. Yes because I find it weird that I run into people like this all too often, and only wish they would grow up and become the college students that they should be.  I agree age is just a number, but by the time you hit a certain time of your life, possibly when you are a sophomore in college or something, you should start acting and thinking a bit more maturly, and making wise decisions.  Possibly, this would mean becoming less absorbed in your stuff and actively showing interest when you talk to others.  Well here's what I see these days.  I know too many people in college, they all want to talk to you,so you start talking (this isn't specifically talking about me--as I observe it a lot!), but yah they want to talk to you and ask you all these questions, yet at the same time their mind is off somewhere else. How do I know this? Well whatever I tell them, they'll ask me about it 2 minutes later! Hmm..where was their mind when I told them?    I see this problem as two-fold. One, that these people are just very immature, and really dont care about what you have to say, or Two, that these people just used you so that they could rattle their problems in front of you once you babbled your mind out and spoke of all the stuff bugging you.  Now, if number two is the truth behind all this, then we have an even worse problem, because there isn't really much communication going on hence making the communicators even worse off than just being a bit less mature.      I don't know, but I see people talking, going "yah" "yah" "oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah" and then they ask you stuff that you already told them! Hmm....could it only be because I talk boring, or because this world is just becoming too bland!!   Hmm...I know I am a bit all over the place...really shows the state of my mind these days....

       Stuff currently    Yes yes, I have not written on here forever :( I miss it! Honestly, I"ve had a lot to say, but I've become too annoyed of finding time to write it all down! Believe me, I have a list of ideas I want to write about, but it'll be a while before I jot them all down on here. Time goes by fast. It seems to me that I started this post in the summer of 97 or 98, and now it's the summer of 2003. Time goes by fast. I started it when I was going to be a first year college undergraduate student, and now I'm sitting with one year of my graduate studies done, and in one more year I'll be done with my masters.    I plan to keep this updated all that time. Now that school is over and I'm just here and there either studying on my own or doing some research..My ideas of postings will change..and might be more focused on ideas pertaining not to human behavior. I guess time will tell as to what I post, and when I post. Till then, you all have a good one.. :)

       What's goin on with moi  Hey All. Yah this sounds like a selfish post--haha, what is going on with me. Well, not like I"m gonna boast about myself or anything. I'm just going to put down what I know simply, without being too ostentatious or even making stuff up. So here goes. Mmmm..well it's still summer here. Yes, about two months of summer still to go. I have been busy nonstop. Been doing research for my masters since March. I won't mention much of what it's on, because honestly it's unpublished data, and heck what if I lose my idea. Yah I think all of you reading this are stealers...okay maybe not, but just googling what I'm doing research on will give my blog as a place to visit, and ya see what I'm doin, and here ya go, great idea. And with the technology my uni has, heck whoever reads the idea will have it done way before I even get my hands onto to writing or publishing a data. Haha, call me selfish, but I'm not. My advisor honestly warns me not to be too open about my research as we both plan to publish it very soon, and heck you all know what I mean!!   Ahhh, what else. Well, when I'm not doing research, I'm busy teaching a class. Yes teaching again, I feel that's all I ever do. I'm teaching or acck TAing is more like it, I'm TAing Microbiology again. I do love it way more than teaching general biology which absolutely was too much for me, as I'm no expert on the whole of biology, but only in Microbiology or so as I like to think. Well maybe not, as my superior who helped me out, he could outwit me anyday!    Mmmm...I've been busy studying, as if I'm not doing enough stuff. Yah, studying for entrance exams for doctoral programs, I shall be applying this fall to at least 8 schools. I think I have a pretty good chance of getting into a lot of them, or so I'm thinking optimistically right now, but again, time will tell.      I just can't wait to be done with this fall semester, when my research will most likely be complete, my admissions papers to most programs will be in, and my hard hard fall semester classes will be done! Then in the spring, I'll be at ease taking easy classes and only only writing my masters' thesis. Anyhow enough about me, I do sound selfish now, I'm talking all about ME!!!!Okay, no more.   Next post will honestly be back to the normal posts about what bugs me! hahaha...but had to explain why I have not pasted online in such a long long long time!! later later y'all....

       Quick Blurb on animal rights    I was just thinking this the other day. You hear of all those healthy people living and talking about animal rights, and OH I think it's so bad to hurt animals! Yet, I wonder, or maybe I should ask if they wonder or realize this. But were they ever immunized??? Gosh, I am sure probably 90% of the old ones were, and heck if they didn't know, the stupid vaccines they were inoculated with were made in EGGS! And heck studies were doing exposing those vaccines to mice to make sure the vaccines were good enough for those animal right busters! Mmm...seems to me like a hypocracy. I'm sure all those animal rights peeps out there now, probably won't get their kids immunized. Yah, they say maybe a teeny % get sick from vaccination, and these animal lovers wanna love their animals, just not their kids. Watch when those kids get sick..then what?     Mmm...There are ways to test things w/o hurting animals brutally as they claim (is the only way!). I did research, and I'll tell you, there is too much of ethics involved in it!! I mean I had to redo this or that, and delay this or that, because I forgot the paperwork. ANd I had to state explicitely about what I did to the animals! So heck, I know when I put those mice under, they were getting state of the art treatment that I would have got when I was put under for wisdom teeth extraction!

It's about time I took the stupid test and got it over with. Been studying for that test since, Oh I can't even remember. Yes let me think, I think it was more like 2 or 3 months ago! I know I know. We'll see the score then know if the studying was worth it. All of you who read this, please please please pray for me and my success on the exam :)

       One again I start school!    And yes once again, I'm back at school. I think it's becoming more of a profession for me. Heck I think it is one by now! Yah, I started school at the age of 5, and well now I"ve been in school for too long! Considering I'm in the second year of doing my masters :) Yahhh!!!! Hope to be done ASAP!   As for other things, I teach these days. I TA the most wonderful class on the planet, known as microbiology. It is AMAZING. And if anyone out there finds microbiology to be boring, I tell you, if you had me as a TA, I'd make the lab fun for you! I love this class, teaching it, or even being a student in it! It is by far oohh so beautiful and so mysterious! Come on, I'm clean there is no bacteria on me! hahhahahah   Yah, I've slacked on my research these days. My advisor is starting to get mad at me. She'd like me to keep working on it, but with my class load I have rarely anytime for it. But I appreciate research, just that the first 2 weeks of school takes time to just get used to your schedule and all. Acck, I think I'll be back at it tomorrow. So wohoo for me! :)   I just did some very annoying homework. I didn't like it at all, but I suppose that's life.   Well I'm just ranting. To all you out there. May your life be wonderful, and I shall have some wisdomfilled words online soon..or acck maybe some annoying stuff :)

       Quote    &nbsp; I found a quote, well I've known it for a while, but I just have been thinking about it. The quote is "Well behaved woman rarely make history" by J. Ulrich. This gets me thinking, because does a woman have to do something that is out of the ordinary to make history...why? Have men had to do that? I've heard of behaved men making it far, but why do woman have to do something beyond the norm to do just the same as their counterparts? hmmm....what a society..

       Studying too much    &nbsp; Acck, so I have a test on monday, and basically have spent most of my day today, saturday, on studying. You think you learn a lot, and you think WOW, this field of Immunology is amazing and I know oh so much! But...but you don't! Gosh, the world of science. I asked my advisor, also my teacher for this course about this class, and she's like, Oh we'll go over lots, but there's a lot you'll still need to know! Oh well, it's all about continuous learning I suppose. No one ever knows everything they need to know about something. If that was the case, we'd all be ignorant...right right right?   Guess I better hit the books again :)

       Most Frustrating!    &nbsp; I'm so mad today, uggh it' annoying me. Thursdays are my good days. I get done with the class I attend very early, then after an hour break I teach for two hours. After that I'm free fo the rest of the day to do research. So...knowing all this, I set up some bacteria to use for my research. I set it up yesterday, only today I came in to do research, and it didn't even grow. I am soo mad! I feel as if I could have spent all this time doing something worthwhile but now I sit here writing this! Acck, I'll do homework now...borrrinnnng...

       Nastiest Experience!!!!!!!    &nbsp; Considering I TA for the Microbiology class on campus I had to set up some cultures of bacteria today with the other TA that I work with. I had to set up some cultures of meat, some of soil, and some of yah, nasty nasty nasty doggie poo. Well doing the soil was great, doing the meat wasn't too bad, but I didn't do the doggie one till after my night class. I held off on it, and it was a bad mistake!!! Oops.   I went into the lab late..and was setting it up, and just getting the doggie poo, icck icck, cut up with a spoon and into a bottle was the WORST part. I must have gagged about 30 times in about 7 minutes! I was near puking! I had tears in my eyes my nose was watery and my stomch was killing me! I got it done finally!  The only thing I know is that though it sucked setting up these cultures, the best part is actually checking out what is in this dog..haha, as if most of dont' know! but just knowing that it exists and its' out there, is the mysteriousness of it! ohhhhh...fun fun! but NAaaaaaaaaasty!

       Hard Homework!    &nbsp; Isn't it funny that the first time you learn something, it is soo hard, but then when you get it, you sit there wondering how the heck you thought it was hard in the first place? It fascinates me. And to think that all this is stored up in your head, and the way it's stored. Amazing amazing amazing...

       The wonders of food..    &nbsp; I find it interesting that even the most evil of enemies can sit down and be so happy and cheery when they both have food in front of them. Why do you forget hate, forget whatever, and just start playing oh so nice, when you would never be like that when you were hungry?Could the food be enticing people to act that way? And if that's the case, maybe I should use food to get many things....I'll jot that down...There's more to the story, but I'm too lazy to write it..

       Productive time!    &nbsp; Mmm....everyone has their time of day in which they find they work really well. I suppose mine is late at night, as I learn a whole lot more at midnight or 1 a.m. rather than at 6 o'clock in the evening. Yep yep..it's about 3 a.m. here and I'm here working on a paper. But yet at the same time, I only like morning tests...the best time being 9 o'clock...weird...and the most sleep I like getting...5.5-6 hours max..any more than that, and I'm tirrrreeed..

I study study study...acck, nothing but study. I had a biochemistry test friday, now monday is an immunology test...do I get time for a break?? nah...Oh well..I'm just complaining...figures that if I didn't study, I'd be wishing I had something to do....I suppose I'll get back to my studying..

       Lunch today..    &nbsp; I had the honor of being invited to a lunch today with a speaker at my university that the college of science and engineering had sponsored. AT the lunch, there was another grad student, and an undergraduate who had been chosen to eat with him. Also there was the chair of the bio dept, the Dean of the college of science and engineering, and a few other professors. It was weird to be asked to go to this lunch, knowing that I was told someone had recommended me to go to it...I wonder who? A professor for sure...but wonder which one...  The lunch was okay. They served nasty ugly looking bloody steak. I looked at it, and lost my apetite, and never touched it! I just ate the blob of mashed potatoes by it, while listening to the speaker talk while he eats. Then I left early as I had a class...but later I found out they served cheese cake and I missed out!!! :( Greeeeaaaat!!!!!   Mmmm...I am studying for a test on friday; another biochemistry test. I have a firm grade in the class to not have to take the test, since our lowest test score is dropped. i could have this one dropped, but I'm studying anyways, just to see what i'd get...weird I figure, but heck it'll make my studying for the final a whole lot easier! Okay back to work...

       NEver listen to others....    &nbsp; So I am taking biochemistry class this fall as well as the biochem lab this fall. EVERYONE told me that, that class was hard, and so much work, and that biochem is just totally weird, and hard to comprehend. I come into the class thinking, my God, the least grade I'll get in this class if I study will be a B-...mmm, I donno, I am doing well..almost too well. More than I could wish for, I guess. I don't wanna jinx myself, so I will say no more. But this class has turned out to the easiest chemistry class, and the most fascinating one I took! mmmmmmmm...I like it ;)   I suppose, maybe the reason I'm doing well is because others freaked me out, so I study a lot, but I study less for this class than I do for my immunology class!!!!!!   Mmm..that'd be it! I'm on my way to finishing my masters and getting outta this teeny university hopefully into a bigger better one for my phd..wohoo!!

       Borrowed things--ARE really Borrowed!!!    &nbsp; Mmm...I cannot name people, but I know I can talk indirectly about things as I will today on here as it has been bugging me for a while. So here goes. At my university, a certain someone called Mrs.Bit is borrowing something from another someone named Ms.Shh. Anyhow Mr. Bit has decided to tell everyone that whatever she borrowed is totally hers, and that she knows how to take care of this thing, and she takes care of this thing she borrowed like its's HERS. Even when Ms.Shh's students use the thing Mrs.Bit comes in the room to check up on the thing to make sure it is being used right. Ms.Shh has not seen this thing for a few years now, and Ms. Shh is totally quiet about it, and she never speaks up about it though it bugs her, but she hates causing commotions.   I only wonder about this situation. As I see it is one thing to borrow, and to state you are borrowing it, and to acknowledge to whom it belongs to, but it is ANOTHER thing to solely call whatever you borrown your own, and NEVER mention who owns it, and never even acknowledge who it is..and the worst is to not even let the initial owner of the thing to use it..that's CRAZY...  I wonder if people out there are just not raised well..I would never take something borrowed and make it mine..NEVER..that's wrong!!!

       Back from P-Land!    &nbsp; Hello to All!!yes I am back from Pakistan!! I arrived late last night around 8ish! Mmm...I had ignored quite a lot of stuff in Pakistan, including checking my e-mail, mainly becuase I did not want to be reminded of stuff about school or pertaining to it. So today I did the the duty of checking and getting things up to date. I am happy happyhappy...as all my work paid OFF!!!! My grades last semester were wonderful! I got all A's in all four of my classes. These classes were probably the hardest ones I ever took, and also very important for my area of interest!Also, doctoral programs have started to love me as they have been e-mailing me left and right, letting me know that I'm a higly good candidate for their programs! I already have had one request for an all paid interview! I'm soo happy!!!!!!!!  My trip in Pakistan was amazingly the best! Words could never describe how enjoyable it was! I loved it a lot, and loved having a long break away from school!!!!! I would describe the vacation, but I don't think I'd ever stop writing then!!! mmm..it was great!  well that's all..and I'm out!

       Oh it just sounds so good...    &nbsp; On my trip to Pakistan this year, or well two weeks ago it ended--I had my cousins go out and get me some CD of singers from Pakistan. Mmm...the Cd's they got me were great. I listen to them all the time. And the more the singer sings in Punjabi, the better. For those who dont' know, I come from the province of Punjab in Pakistan. In punjab, one of the languages spoken is punjabi. I find it to be a beautiful language; it just sounds soo good!! I mean I can understand it mostly, speak it a bit, but love it overall. So listening to these songs just feels and sounds sooo good! I guess it's something twangy in the way they sing that just sounds great....Oh I've been writing a lot on here...I'm out to get stuff done now I guess...like study for my biochemistry test which is on friday :((((((((

       waiting..  I'm waiting for quite a few things. Like a few letters from universities that have not told me if I have an interview with them. But these other universities said they'd let me know by mid feb or early march, so I shouldn't freak out about them yet. Oh...I did get yet another interview to Univ. of Iowa...mmm, I like the research there, but I'm not too fond of IOWA..though I said that the other day and one of the Graduate students who is from Iowa heard it...oops, I was trying to fix up the situation then...heh heh heh...  oh..back to other things I'm waiting for....well one thing for sure...which is a stupid Coat I ordered from Victoria's Secrets..it's a lovely coat. I sound so materialistic being stuck on it..but I just want that coat..I have been wanting to get it since the end of november...I had ordered it back then, but it's shipping date had coincided with me not being here in the states as my family was going to pakistan...so I had to cancel the order. Now when I came back I ordered it again..only they said I'd get it by the 28th..so more wait :(((( Mmmm....when I order, I want it soon..not LATE....  Other things to wait for...well if I order this one..I wanna get a laptop..I have it configured..my brother did it..just can't get the guts to just order it. I keep wondering if I should get it now, or later..as in before I leave for a doctoral program this coming summer..mmmmmm...not sure! maybe I'll get it now.....yah I'll change my mind back in 5 mins..I can't decide!

       Anti-Social days..    &nbsp; I get too much on my mind and I become too absorbed with things that I don't notice others around me, and I become critical and bitter. Gosh! I'm feeling like that these days. heh..AT times I walk around on campus and walk past friends, and though they say HI I don't notice..till they either yell my name..or tell me later on that I ignored me...it's more like I"m walking around..but my mind is off somewhere else..yes right now my mind is on my thesis...  Also...today in one of my classes, the teacher said we HAD to ask a question in class since a presentor was presenting his research. Acck just hearing that made me all weak and nervous! I mean, it's weird I teach 4 times a week, and end up giving a 45 min lecture per day, but that NEVER makes me nervous, but this DId!!!! It was weird! Well I did write a question to ask, but we ran outta time in our class and I was saved by the bell....thank GOD! aaaaah....it was great...  I guess when I teach I'm not nervous because I teach what i know..but in asking that question today..I was asking on something I had just heard..I'm a weanie who was afraid I'd ask something stupid..hahaha..dumb....

       Slug    &nbsp; Slug--a word my high school history teacher loved to use. I suppose I'm starting to understand the meaning of it now. He would say it to students who were lazy and didn't do much. Mmmm..I feel that way for the past few days..maybe I'm getting my schedule back to normal from my one month hiatus in a different country. Or maybe I just don't want to be in school anymorel. Acck though! I have to be writing my thesis and I can't imagine doing it anymore....On top of it I have to still study for a biochem II class :(

       Anger Management...hmmm...just a thought..    &nbsp; Just something I NOTICED. Haha, finally something I "noticed" to add to this msg board. While usually what I add is my normal day stuff..oops. Anyway, back to the subject about something I noticed. It's about anger. I suppose I shouldn't even toot a horn and talk about this subject as I have my own times of getting pretty mad, but what I may explain is for sure something I would NEVER do! I find it outrageous and stupid actually, but I'll tell about it anyways.  So here goes. I've seen it many times, and it just amazes me that when people get mad they take their anger out on an object near them. I mean they might throw something across the room, or they might break something, better yet, they might slam things shut. It amazes me I guess, cause I really don't see what people get out of it. Some say, oh it takes my anger away..and well fine it does, but dammit it sounds so uncivilized! I think there are much better ways to control ones anger rather than slamming things or breaking things. For the most part, when I see someone get outta control with anger, I seriously think they do it as a show to show others. I only wish that person with the anger was the audience and could see how stupid he/she looks when they are mad...ewwwwwwwwweeeeeeeee!   Mmm..won't write anymore..I think I wrote enough...I'm out and about, and back to writing my thesis...

       Just when you thought it was over...    &nbsp; So I'm back, and thank goodness that I am not sick as I was the last time I came back from Pakistan! But since I didn't get much of any stomach illness, I suppose my immune department had to do something to annoy me. So heck with it, I did have a cold twice this time in Pakistan. and just when I thought it was over, I come back and I start coughing and have a sore throat. I took some pain killers to make the throat ache go away and it did. Mmm....I think I got happy too soon, since two days after that third stupid cold like whatever went away, I have now contracted something else..yes yes Cold #4!! this one sucks..as some stupid muscle or something is inflamed in my mouth..down to my throat and it hurts!!! Yes, I'm on more pain killers..to get over it! I called the nurses hotline and they said that I indeed have contracted yet another viral infection and that I should just wait another two weeks (max) to get over it..wopee..JUST what I needed....I almost want to say I wish I'd rather be puking...but I won't..cause those suck just as much..if not more! K..I rattled enough..  On a brighter note...nah I mean dimmer note cause this ain't any brighter.....I'm working on my thesis these days....a very tedious and boring process I must admit. I have to read too much and written very little....Just wish I finish this thinger and graduate soon enough.......

       Cruel Joke...    &nbsp; A friend played a cruel joke on me. I did fall for it for a few mins, and felt so scared..but then got over it...but still cruel jokes suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And then on the brighter note....I have finalized two of my interviews, just need to send in my itineraries to the schools so that they can reimburse me for the travel and food or whatever money. It should be a lot of fun.

       COLD day!    &nbsp; Ayee, Minnesota is back to what I knew it was like many many years ago. Back in 1996 or was it 1997, we used to get cold cold cold windchills as the ones we have today. THOUGH, back then our windchills peaked at -70 degrees Fahrenheit, though today I heard during the day they should be a -16, but during the nights at -40...not cold enough as it was before. Ayee, back then I was a lil tinky high school student...Times have changed...mmmmmmmm...I wonder if I have changed? hmmmmmmmmmmmm  On a more boring note..I'm on campus EARLY in the morning. Yah, more like 8 a.m. Doing what...yes, I'm doing research. I'm doing it so early, that my eyes are actually hurting from not getting enough sleep. But some things need to get done I suppose. K...I'm rattlin...so I'm out...

       Too many names..    &nbsp; I'm not stuck up. But I try never to forget people once I meet them. I still know friends of mine since I was 8 years old, and I keep in touch with them regularly. I even know the names of people in my sister and brothers' class from way back when. Yah, maybe I'm weird, but once I see a face and a name..they are glued in my head and I'll never forget.  So now that I'm a teaching assistant for microbiology, though I have taught a semester of Biology 100 (wopee) too. I started teaching in fall 2002, and by now I have gone through around 200 students excluding this semester..but including this semester I'm sitting at 250 students. It's odd how I got to know all these students and I made it a point to memorize their names, their majors and their interests. But it's weird how I remembered their names one semester and then forget them the next semester, or now. So now I see these previous students of mine on campus and they are like "Mansoora do you remember me?", I see the familiar face so it's a "yes"..but then my mind gets pissed at itself for not remembering their names...my whole day then goes into remembering their names! I suppose I should just stick to memorizing my friends...heh heh..

       The Great Cold    &nbsp; No it's not the flu nor does it pertain to me being sick. But rather to the lovely weather of minnesota. Hahaha, yah sounds sorta weird as if most people would think I'm crazy liking the minnesota weather, but I do. Maybe not the cold cold windchills, but maybe the SNOW. Yes the snow. I like it a lot. As I write it is snowing outside and it looks beautiful outside, almost as good as it looks in those little desktop things you can get, which when you shake them, the fake snow flakes move in there. Yes like that. Oh it's so nice.  We've finally been getting a lot of snow these days. I had not seen snow for so long, that I actually went outside and shoveled the driveway...it was so fun! Only, I still can feel the pain of shoveling :( Acck, when it came to me applying to doctoral programs, I applied to all midwest school...only cause of the snow here and the great weather. I figure it'll make me study and keep me up and on track...  People wonder why I like snow considering I come from such a warm climate and have lived in a warm climate for 8 years of my life before moving here. I don't know, I suppose it just gives me more time to spend getting things done which I probably wouldn't do if the weather was nice....

       Be the 1% in the world...    &nbsp; My thoughts on a doctoral program. Hmmm..I've had to think of this, and quite honestly I'm too excited to go to school and get my doctorate. The one aspect I'm looking forward to is learning a whole lot more, and also doing research on some totally awesome pathogenic bacteria or possibly even a virus. But but but..I was talking to another graduate student the other day and he brought up something which I can't stop thinking about. This grad student said that why should I be so looking forward to a phd program, when what I'll do and research in will be something only 1% of the population will know about or care about.. He got me wondering. But heck I guess it doesnt' matter who knows what, but it matters more that I''m going into something I like. Lastly, whatever I do will be applied to other areas so it might turn out be a 100% efficient and applicable!!!!

       Call me old fashioned..    &nbsp; Maybe I'm weird, but I cannot ever ever ever study with my legs hanging off a chair. Yah, weird as it is...I must study sitting down on the ground or on a bed. My whole life I have studied on the ground, but now days I study on my bed..I must have my legs scrounched (huh?) underneath me, or well I must be sitting the indian style way of sitting. That is the ONLY way I can study or do anything,and be able to pay attention. I could however study I suppose on a chair, but it never feels good,and I lose my concentration. Maybe my feet get cold who knows...I'm not sure..  Even when it comes to writing papers on a computer I usually sit indian style on a computer chair...otherwise now days, since I have my laptop, I sit on my bed writing with my legs scrounched under me...hahaha..it's just me....  I suppose I am old fashioned considering that I also like to sleep on the ground, more than I do on a bed. Same goes for sitting around, I'd much rather sit on the ground than a chair....

       All set ready to go..    &nbsp; So I've made my reservations for flying out to see a university in Indiana, to which I was invited for, for an interview. I'm excited, and wonder why the heck some university would spend so much money on having me over to visit them at their expense. I guess I'm a bit excited, but I'm not much of a person who enjoys traveling on my own. I suppose this will be one good experience for me, as I will end up learning a lot from this.   So now I sit here trying to figure out faculty whom I'd like to meet with. Funny thing is that you cannot get much out of the faculty from looking at their pictures online or through reading their little blurb on the web about their research. I'm gonna have to look deeper and I'm going to have to do it myself! dang! Then then then...on top of all this, what if these faculty people are some weirdos and ask me some stupid questions..and I'm like..hey, I don't this. What if they test my knowledge?? what if they figure out that i'm stupid...haha, hopefully i'm not..but still Creepy.............

       Side kicks or suck-up..    &nbsp; Another annoyance this just bugs me so much. I cannot stand people who cannot speak their OWN mind (Oh scary scary scary), but rather they like to tag along with someone else. I mean, they hear someone say something and being the dorks they are, they are dumb to not realize anything. But about a few mins or so later, they realize oops I should be talking so then they just TAG along with the other person without using their own darn MIND! Oh my God...as if GOD put that brain in ones' head for a reason?? Or did he? I doubt it as most people STILL would rather TAG along than to use their own darn head!!! ugggh.....If I see yet another sidekick I'm gonna explode!  I've faced sidekicks all my life...I've seen them everywhere..I just get shocked that even when we get older, there are people out there who never get outta that stupid "follower" stage...Gawd...will people please be independant and do what they want to do and not what others tell them to do.........................

       To have it sugar-coated or be told the darn truth!    &nbsp; I see things around me everyday, and notice people in school amongst my friends say things. I notice that the majority of the time what is said is sugar coated--yes people are darn afraid to say the truth, and would rather make it look oh so lovely then to spit the hard truth into someones' face! I mean come on, tell the truth and make people realize that what you're saying is really it, and that they need to work their whole hard time off to fix it, rather than sugar coating it and making them think that their STUPID mistake is OH NOT SO BAD!!   I mean..it's like this. Lets say since I"m a teaching assistant and I want my students to do well on a quiz or test in a class. I find that a student of mine did okay and got like a 76/100 which most consider average. I being the teacher and expecting the students to do well, would rather tell them to study hard and work for that 93/100 rather than saying, you know you did bad, but look on the bright side it's still Average. I mean, the only thing the student hears is...OH OH OH, my teacher thinks I'm still average and she said "bright" side...oh oh, I'm okay...who cares I won't try! I'd much rather just spit in their face and say, hey hey look I know you can do better than a 76/100, so go home and study some more...your next test should show results.  &nbsp;I don't know but to me, this sugar coating crap is LYING..I cannot stand it, and it in ways leads to so many problems...Tell the truth ya'll..quit being wusses (chicken) hiding back what you really mean to say....and save the listener some trouble...or well some unneeded happiness....

       A smack in the face...and I'm still waiting!!!!!!    &nbsp; Mm..first for the waiting! Yes, I'm STILL waiting for my coat that I ordered from Victoria's secret. It has been a month now...and I'm so excited about the dang coat, that I cannot imagine cancelling the stupid order. Also I was told it has been shipped a WEEK ago, so now it's somewhere in the US traveling to my house. I think that once I get it, I will realize that it does not fit me, as I am thinking it doesnt..and if that is the case, I plan on sendin the dumb coat back..and complaining about the stupid shipment policy to vic. secrets!  What else am I waiting for? Oh yes...I hate asking to see if I got mail everday! I hate it hate it hate it..seems to me that, that is the first thing I do when I get home. I ask with a bit of reservation...not really wanting to know what I got. As I am still waiting for two other graduate schools to contact me..Sorta looking forward to seeing if they took me in or not, but a bit reserved about asking as what if they did not take me in?? What if it's a rejection letter??  K..and the smack in the face. So I wrote some of my lit. review for my thesis. My advisor looked it up, and told me stuff about how it's crazy, and all over the place..and how she was bombarded with info in the paper. ACCK..then she says, I donno if its even good enough for the REVIEW yet!!! ohhhhh GREAT...considering that I basically used reviews to write this thing and now she tells me it's not good enough..when it could just as well be a reviews' copY?!!? Huh..I guess I'm frustrated...I'm still writing right now...wondering why as what if whatever I'm writing is totally off track..yah it's probably a waste of time....ayeeeeeeeeeeeee

       Just a thought......    &nbsp; I was having lunch today with a fellow grad student and we got onto the topic about marriage. I was telling this grad studentthat in Islam, we are told to marry as God wants us to procreate. Hence the reason God created a man and a woman, so that they can marry and have children and make our species live for a loong time. There are other factors which come into play here, but which I did not particularly feel too enthaustic to go into.  Anyhow, this grad student decided that I was wrong, and that I should look into Islam and make sure that God does mean that, and this grad student though I was totally saying something which probably is not correct. I guess it might have been a shock to him, actually it was a shock to him, as he is a catholic and catholics have priests who don't marry. So he was thiking that this thing about marriage could not be true as the noble big people cannot marry. Wrong. That's what catholics believe I suppose. I had to explain to him that even the big people in Islam are NORMAL, and yes they are married and they have kids. It simply did not make sense to me at all to think that a religion could and does believe in the fact that someone should not marry. That is probably the worst torture and I cannot imagine why God would wanna do that to anyone. HECK...I know this system which the catholics believe in is a bit crazy, considering that too many of the anti-marriage priests of this religion have ALL abused children and devastated families. If this order that catholics believe in was truely the true word from God, then God would make it in such a way to not hurt others (those others God has created)..heck this order is strictly not helping, BuT hurting. I know, as I can see from the evidence which I see, that this type of torture is wrong, and it did NOT come from God, but rather from people--people who were too stuck on some stupid scenarios and took things and twisted them into other things.  &nbsp;As it stands, and and as I see it in the news..I am ashamed to see that so many of these priest have hurt others. These so called noble or whatever priets are people too. Just like anyone else and have normal feelings. Being told to never marry was torture to them or became torture, and they let out by hurting others such as little kids (boys and girls--thinking they'd never get caught. The only thing the Roman catholics can come up with now is that somehow these priests that were trained were originally males with problems sexually or something. Interesting, as I see most people have to find an excuse for everything these days..

       A change of mind..or different way of thinking..    &nbsp; Being an undergraduate student and now a graduate student, I have learned a lot. I remember back during my last year as an undergraduate. I remember the last few months of my undergraduate career. I mean it was sort of like I was flying in the wind, I mean, I was this bird, and the wind kept on blowing and no matter what I would eventually fly through the finish line as time went by. I mean, the ONLY thing which I ever had to worry about was taking my tests on time, and hoping that I'd pass my classes, which I knew I would, as I've never had to worry about them before.  Fast forward two years later. I am in my last semester of my graduate studies. And there is NO wind pushing me around, I'm like a dead stagnant bird. I can sit here for YEARS if I please, and no one will come to check up on me or budge me around. It's all up to me if I wanna pass that finish line..The wind is GONE, and I'm in some dessert surrounded by nothing. No one is saying hey hey, you need to get this done....I mean I'm writing my thesis, but what's keeping me going is my motivation to get it done. If I don't care about it, heck my advisor wont' either. People take Years to finish their masters only because of this..but yuck, I wanna have it done now, and I hope to finish even if I am a dead bird.   Its sort of like pulling weight that won't move. I mean I have motivation to move, but heck it's all up to ME. Either I keep up with what I do or I don't. Either way, I'll get my masters someday or get it this spring. But by the look of it, It might as well be this spring for me..as I dont' think I want to spend time writing my masters while at some doctoral program....  Speaking of which..I have one of my doctoral program interviews next week. Not too eager about the whole thing anymore..it's more so that I wan't to get done with them....

       To be observed..    &nbsp; Ahhh..I suppose it's nerve wrecking but people think it's a good thing too. I was told a while back by my advisor that we would be having program reviewers come into the biology department to review how the department is run. She said that during the time I teach, one of them was going to come observe me :( Not only is this reviewer supposed to observe me, but also my advisor will be with him or her...gee thanks ...as I am not nervous enough with one person around! I guess I don't know what to be nervous about...I mean I know what I'm teaching...I suppose it's just the thought of teaching it in front of people who know more than me....considering my advisor..  I teach in about 2 hours..and this 2 hour wait is certainly not one of the best times I've ever experienced! can't wait to have it over with...

       Anostica&nbsp;is IN!! yehaa!!   ALL those posts I've put on here...GOSH! Ever since this past summer, all about me getting ready to apply, and waiting for responses, and then an interview...well two of them. Only one of which I have attended. It was at Purdue University..and I'm happy to announce that I have been admitted to Purdue University!!!! Yehaaa!!! Yes, and they have offered me a full-ride with all my tuition paid as well as a stipend or money for me to live with!! I'm happy :))))) I guess I"ll see how the other school is when I visit it in a few weeks..

       Back from one interview..    &nbsp; Yes Yes yes...I'm back from one of my doctoral program interviews!! I was sooo scared to go to it, as I had to take an airplane to the place all by myself, and then be interviewed by 6 faculty members. My interviews were last friday, and I have to admit that the interviews were better than I thought they would be. I had prepared for the interviews by reading up on the research that the professors do, and was able to talk intelligently with them...and they were happy to know that I knew something of what they did. I find out next monday if I got into the school or not....depending on how my interviews went...If in, those 6 faculty are 6 of the 30 faculty I have a chance of working with to fulfill my phd thesis :) I'm SOO Excited..words cannot describe how I feel..  I found out about the research that these professors do, and gosh...just how they explained to me what they did totally had my mouth watering..okay come on that sounds a bit sick..but gosh it had me too excited!!! I mean the research I am interested in is microbial pathogensis...either of bacteria or viruses..both areas are amazing! But I will have to choose either bacteria or a virus upon starting my research for a phd program..it's gonna be hard, as I love viruses and bacteria :( Must I have to limit myself??? I may end up limiting myself by looking into the research which incorporates in the most immunology, microbiolgy and biochemistry...the one which is strictly basic bacteriology or virology may not be the one I stick to. I would like to go into something cross-disciplinary..such as incorporating in, Cell biology with microbiology, or virology with engineering..something of the sort. That sorta stuff is WAY more FUN! I suppose all these already go hand in hand..but I would like to work with ongoing research with these types of incorporations...  Mmm..my next interview is in about 3 weeks..and then again, I'm STILL waiting for 2 other schools to get a hold of me...when will they EVER let me know ??? :(

       "I hate science for the sake of science itself"    &nbsp; The topic of this is a quote I heard a few weeks ago, from a graduate student. It's interesting, but it made me agree with the quote. I mean, I don't hate science as a subject, because it's fun and interesting, but I hate it on another aspect. That aspect deals with the application of science. I guess I am sick of hearing people say, OH I did this and found a 0.01% level of this protein being excreted, and oh yes, it's so nice to see that a rat aorta secretes it. Well thank you for that boring talk, but heck if one wants to talk like an idiot and impress others of what they are doing, they not only have to tell what the protein IS, but also as to how it is APPLICABLE to our normal day life. I mean, isn't the main point of science to discover things, so that you can fix things up?? Or at least know how they work to combat a problem? So what good does it do knowing that some protein is involved in the rat aorta..but yet you have no clue how this research is applicable??

       Who really cares about my thesis!!    &nbsp; I'm sick of it..I'm really sick of it! I have been working nonstop on this stupid thesis! Staying up till 2 in the morning each night writing this stupid thing is not fun! I have about 40 pages written only for my literature review so far :( I hate it..hate it..hate it!Who really cares about..I mean...I get it done, they give me my masters and I walk off...that's it..maybe 10 years down the road someone will look at it..and go OH, this girl here actually wrote this 10 years ago..wow....gee I wonder where she is..and how old she is...? hmmm...wopeee...I have nothing to talk about...I'm out..

       I'm In!    &nbsp; Second Interview for Carver College of Medicine's department of microbiology was great. I was notified today by email that I got in. Now I need to decide which school I go to. Either it's Purdue University or Carver college of med. Both have good sides and bad sides. I spoke to my teachers as I can't make up my mind and they said Purdue. But but, I can't give up Carver, that school is awesome too. Just that it's a one road university. Okay, Iowa literally has nothing, and if there is anything it's on one road.   Mmm..the last day to notify the committee is on the 15th of April. That date is nearing......

       Another Interview..    &nbsp; I had yet another interview for a doctoral position at the department of microbiology through a medical school. This school is ranked 24th in the nation. The research at the school is amazing! I really enjoyed it, and would love to go there. Heck, I am still stuck on Purdue....what if I like this school better? Do I turn down Purdue University?? I can't decide anymore!  Admissions decision for this school be made by at least tomorrow or wednesday...I think that my chances of getting in are 99.9% :)

And I will be a graduate student at Purdue University this fall! They gave me a 40K scholarship...with quite a bit of that money for a stipend to live on. What more can you ask for?? Gosh, the decision is DONE..and I can move on with my life!!! yehahhh...Purdue it is..as if I didn't know all this all along?? I've been saying the name Purdue since I was 16 years old!!!!

I feel as if there are people who just need to know what the hell I'm up to, and just wanna treat me as their fish. I only wish, me, as the fish--I could jump out of this bowl. People need to learn that fishes (me) have lifes, and we need our damn privacy. It's getting to a point that I just wanna yell it all out. I mean my office is even like that, till my officemate wrote "please dont' feed the TA's on the window...mmm....as if that doesn't lure people away..

       April 15th came and WENT    &nbsp; YES YES YES! April 15th, that dreaded day I have been so worried came yesterday and is already over with! I'm soo happy! April 15th was the day I had to decide on what school I was planning on attending. Though I had said I was going to Purdue, I had till april 15th to back down from that and still choose Carver college of med..but now the decision is set and final.   Now days, two faculty at my university, both from Purdue university are being very helpful to me. They offer me advice on anything I have questions about. Today they told me about housing, and I'm going to look into it....Ohhhh...what a relief!

       Do you know what you are getting yourself into??? HUH    &nbsp; Okay okay, so now that I'm into this phd program thing. I've told some people about it, and then they ask the question...how long will it take. So I tell them that the national average for completing a phd in the biological sciences is 5.5 years. Yah, and then everyone is like, are you sure?? HELLO, did I just apply for a phd not knowing how frikkin long it would take me?? Of COURSE I know it would take me that long. And OF COURSE I'm going to do it! It's not really about how long it is, but rather that I WANT to do it..and that's all that should count! The fact that I'm interested and am willing to complete such a degree.....

       Wusses that can't fess up!    &nbsp; Yes the title says wusses that can't fess up. mmm...basically what I'm trying to say by this, or am trying to describe people by this include those people that just can't tell someone something directly but would rather talk about whatever it is behind the person's back to another person. And have that other person talk to whoever it is they are back biting. It's odd though, I see this happen from many people; people of all ages. Why are people such big wusses/chickens? Why can't they speak to whoever they want to? Why do they need a third party??uggh..I hate it!

       Stupid Show-offs!    &nbsp; I have realized one thing in this world, or at least in graduate school! That is that you should never tell others anything, and just nod to what others say! Hence I never ever tell anyone about what I'm doing with school, and just listen to others.  But but but..it's getting to be really annoying. As most graduate students I know, for some reason, have some competition or something with me. Or do I just think it? They are constantly showing off that they are doing this or that, and blasting what they are doing in my classes to my teachers for no reason! uggggh...must people say stuff about what they are doing to prove themselves worthy??? To whom? If you cannot think you are worthy enough for yourself, and must have to tell others about it, errr one is messed up and should re-evaluate themselves!!! I'm sick of it all!!!

       Do we care?    &nbsp; I had to hear quite a few speeches tonight, and though I enjoyed most of them, there were some that rattled on. So it made me wonder...am I the only one? As I looked around the room there were quite a few in the same position, hoping that speech would end soon. Then I wondered..I too had given a speech, did people think the same of me?? Heck, then why do I spend time doing or writing a speech if most just sit there and nod so I can get it over with?? hmmm.....

It only makes me wonder about the ever so many people I know or have known. I cannot and will not name any names, but gee, the ones that talk a lot (when it comes to school and classes), hmmm...what does that say about them?? Gosh, it's odd but I totally AGREE!

       something Other Than SchOOL!    &nbsp; I guess it's the end of the semester or so it is for most undergraduates and I suppose--even myself. As today marked the last day of the semester for me...I am DONE! Yes, very very done. I will graduate tomorrow with my masters. I suppose I still have a bit to do, as I will be teaching General Microbiology again this summer.  Mmm...what else to talk about. Yes the survivor episode sucked last night. I hope Rupert or Jenna win...I seriously hope Rob dies or LOSES...and Amber that playing girl loses as well....

       To think you are very smart or to think you are normal and not smart enough...bling bling..    &nbsp; Okay so the topic's ending with the bling bling was totally something I've been saying in my head lately. Sounds somewhat like the TADA you hear when someone has done something. I guess I put it there because it sounds nice. I read it off somewhere the other day and just thought that the "bling bling" just sounded ever so good!  Onto the topic of this discussion. I wonder if I have covered this previously before in my message board, and I am sure that I have, but I feel as I should just write it now--for the heck of it. So I wonder I guess, or state I suppose--as I met some girl the other day and upon talking to her for a little bit, she asked me what I'm up to. I told her I was graduating with a masters' and then she asked what I would do with it, and I said I'm going on into a doctoral program in Microbial Pathogenesis or Structural biology. SO, the thing that came out of her mouth was, you are VERY smart...and at your age to be doing that is amazing. Well..It sort of made me question why I had told her what I was doing in the first place..as that was not the reaction I wanted to hear from anyone. I went on to tell her that I don't think I'm smart, but rather just a normal person who wasn't smart enough.. I know this for a fact as I work and study a LOT to get where I am. Anyhow, she didn't understand what I meant by it. So I explained to her that there are two types of people in life, those who say they are smart, and think that the whole world is jealous of them for being smart....when in reality these people may have achieved some ONE thing in life, and after that, they just sat around. This happens as when one thinks they are high and mighty they have this trophy achievement, and then they sit there showing off the trophy.  Then....there are the people who think they are normal and not smart enough. They study all the time, and are what you call hard workers. To them they can do whatever, and they never have a trophy accomplishment as they never ever think that what they do is good enough. They keep working to do better, and achieve more. I suppose these type of people put a lot of pressure on themselves.   It seems to me that either you can live your life and have a trophy accomplishment and quit right there....OR you can live life and keep accomplishing as you think you have yet to achieve that trophy...To me the latter is a better stance..but yet, I know way TOO many people who believe the former to be true. I see it in a lot of my friends, who I cannot stand after some time, as they start to annoy me and never achieve anything, but have this trophy accomplishment to show off. Then there's me, who literally has nothing to show, as I just study a lot.   On another note..I still wonder about when the day will come, when I will take a class which will challenge me so much, that I will sit there in confusion for days. It's odd, but I want to be in a class like that. I want to do something which is challenging. I thought that taking Biochemistry or Immunology or Microbial Physiology would have done that for me. But Biochemistry turned out to be EASY, Immunology was a bit more studying, but still easy...and Microbial Physiology I cannot judge, though I do know it overlaps with Biochemistry a lot.   Ohh..I'm rattlin on....To conclude, if you think you aren't at your trophy, you are always striving for more in life and will make it somewhere as nothing is good enough for you. Or you have the trophy and you sit there showing it off, because that's ALL you have and you have literally ended your life right there....that's it :)

       Taking Credit for something one didn't do!    &nbsp; So yes another complaint. I'm sick of it now, but I feel the need to talk about it. I guess it stems from people, a few who I see daily who claim that things happen because it was them that caused the "good things" to happen or turn out that way. Yes but it annoys me. I guess I mean, there are times that people will say yes, he's doing great now, cause it was me who put them on the right track. I CALL that trying to get attention and trying to show off that you are WORTHY of something when in reality you are NOT. See, the ONE person that should be given credit for allowing the person for doing "great" would be the person itself! I can honestly attest to this.....anyone can say anything to you..but till the day YOU believe that, that is the thing you want to do...then you'll do well. People can crack your back, and talk to you all the time, and you will still do bad, or not up to par...but the day you realize, yes that's what I want...HAH, see WHO can STOP you then...cause the odds are for you, and you are driving your own damn train of life, and not allowing someone else to steer it!!! Believe in yourself, and just be confident you can do it, and I KNOW God will be there to help you if you believe in something 99.9%...On the other hand if you don't care about it, and are doing it for someone else...GOD will show you it isn't you, and you will not achieve it.!! As long as you've got a heart and it's in what you want you'll get it...  People can sit there and take credit for stuff you did...but in the end the person who is achieving is YOU...and it's YOU who caused it and NO ONE else!

       Other stuff on my mind!!!    &nbsp; Ayee...so School is finally done and I have about 2 weeks to myself (well now 1 week left), before I start teaching again. In these 2 weeks I have been calling places left and right in West Lafayette, trying to find a place to stay for fall. I have found some areas, but obviously not enough to warrant a drive over there to check them out. I just need to have a place, and it's bugging me up the wall!!!!!! I can't imagine not having a place :((  Then there's the issue about having a car. I have been looking for cars forever!!!! I have the money, just need to sit down and really just find the one I want and then I need someone to go with me to buy the car! I hope to get this car issue resolved in the next 2 weeks so I have a car to drive with...to school!!!   And finding the roommate..would be my first priority..and I sure hope it works out! Please pray for me!!!!!!!!!!! :(

       Jealousy...can there be such a thing??    &nbsp; Back at it, here to write, as I'm not sleepy enough to sleep yet, and it's 2:15 a.m. Yes, the topic is about jealousy. What a bad bad bad thing..yet so many people experience it. Ever wonder if people stopped being jealous and started appreciating everyone for who they were and what they did rather than be jealous about it..wouldn't the world just be one amazing place??!? I think so!  I try not to think that there are people like that out there. In fact I wonder if I act it sometimes too, and I think I have (yet I'm one to realize I do it, and have *tried* to work on it). Anyways, things I've heard, and seen in life and people have told me, yes they are acting jealous and I try not to believe it...but my God why?? Why do people put so much energy in all this jealousy stuff?? Why?? what good does it do them?? It makes me wonder!

       Forms of Communication..    &nbsp; I wonder...that now with these diff forms of communication these days. Which form is best to use and when? I mean does it make sense to send a condolescence (sp) card to someone over the net, as an e-card? Then there are matters that should be discussed rather than written up. Then there are people who don't just tell you something, but rather tell someone else..what good does that do??  I find that these days people really have to understand the form of communication and then figure out how to go from there. I suppose, I must admit I have probably committed this fault myself, but I work hard at trying not to do it. icck, it's late at night and I should head to bed. wonder if I make sense...

       Survivor    &nbsp; so I suppose that if it is not about school, it will be about Survivor, the show. Well the finale was today and it was annoying! It turned out that Rupert and Jenna totally were kicked off..and then I was mad. But to choose the lesser of the two evils, I chose Rob..but who won was Amber, the backstabbing girl who cannot play a game! She's a cheater....I guess the show was predictable as I knew Rob and Amber would be engaged..and ohhh...yah, I think CBS realized that their viewers probably didn't like who won..so now they are having the viewers chose another winner...yes I know that one will be Rupert for sure..or it should be!! Because Rupert rules..

       Is it too much to ask??    &nbsp; I guess I can be a demanding person from my friends and others. But I have a few expectations..but yet I put them off on the side..should I do that? Is that right? I mean, is that changing myself to fit the personality of others? There are some things or more than some I expect, but yet I choose to ignore them...does that mean I'm lying to myself and not being the true me? Or am I just becoming more accomodating to others??hmmm..I'm confused..

       A break from it all...the norm...    &nbsp; I guess I write a lot on this msg board and as far as I know, only the few people I know well read this, but yet at times I wonder if there are things I want to share on here for everyone to read. I mean, I feel that being anonymous and writing something is much better than writing it with my name stamped on it. As far as we all may say we don't judge, we DO! and it's solely on a persons' name. I figure that's the reason I will start yet another msg board to share a few things. I guess that way people can write to my anonymous address.

Acck, the clock is ticking and time is running out, yet I can't find the energy to get things done :( Guess I realized one thing today....I listen to a lot of music when I have too much on my mind...

       ALL That work...guess it paid off!    &nbsp; I was thinking this on my way up to the Twin Cities today. I had been working on this grad school admissions stuff nonstop since the April of last year. In april of last year I started studying extensively for the GRE. At the same time, I had started research and worked nonstop with research throughout the summer, while at the same time studying each night of the summer. Yet I also taught for one summer session last year. THEN, on top of it all, I took lots of hard hard classes last fall, all together at once, mainly because I had wanted to graduate, but also to show graduate schools that I could handle hard classes. Then I worked sooooo hard to earn good grades in all those, at the same I taught, and was applying to the graduate schools! There were times I wondered if I could handle it any longer, but I kept going. I was always praying that my hard work would pay off and it did. I even told myself towards the end of november and beginning of december that once all was done, I could treat myself to going on a trip to Pakistan. Well the trip was awesome. And Ahhhhh, my work DID pay off. NOT to toot my own horn, but I was realizing this today, as gosh, I was up to my neck with stuff last year around this time...and my main reason for ALL of it was so that I could apply to graduate schools and get into a good one with good financial aid. I guess I did it; maybe I should pat my back now. But heck this is just the BEGINNING, I still have 5 more years to go, before I can say AHHH, and pat my back and be happy about it ALL.So I guess one type of stress ends, but yet another begins....

       One of those "not so talkative days"    &nbsp; Hmm. I was thinking I have my "not so talkative days". I guess today was one of them, and I imagine that tomorrow will be yet another one. I wonder why though. I just get to be like that on certain days and it just comes. I've been thinking about it, and I think it stems from me being extremely stressed. At the moment, the stress level is up there, probably sitting at a 8.5/10 mainly because of stuff I need to figure out for graduate school this fall. Other things are bugging me as well pertaining to people, and things I get myself involved with--too deeply.  I&nbsp;suppose that since my not so talkative day will be tomorrow, I may be able to get a lot of work done I hope. Need to meet with the other TA I work with. She and I need to figure out things for teaching next week.   Arrgh, I wait for that ONE day in my life when all things will be handled and I will sit stress free! Will I ever see a day?? Till then I'll have my not so talkative days when I am too stressed to talk, and when the sight of people annoys me. I suppose keeping quiet helps me get things done.

       One done and onto the next one..    &nbsp; Talking to my parents I told them that now that I have bought my car, my next investment will most likely be a house. Heh, they both told me to hold off. Haha,as if I'm going to conquer the world! Mmm, though buying a house sounds cool. Just gotta keep setting your goals a bit higher. Though I wonder if this one is too high? I mean, yah the car, but that's a huge leap to a house! mmmmmmmm but what else could it be though??

       Early mornings..    &nbsp; I guess now that I taught today at 7:30(!) in the morning, I realized and learned a lot. When I came to school this morning I saw people out and about at the time of the day when my head is still in bed. Even now, this is generally the time I am about to get up, heh. Interesting though; I suppose it's a different world.  I've been sorting things in my head. And have made some final decisions on a few things and have really put away other things, hopefully to never open them up again (like a Pandora's box). And then there are things I've sorted out that I need to figure out right now. I guess there are only two (thank Goodness) priorities for me right now. One is to find a place at Purdue University, and the other is to finish up some last bits of research stuff. But that is it. Other than that, I'm teaching and all happy happy...I think...finally. I wonder if it's a front I pull off saying I'm happy but then I'm not..but I think I am :)

Oooops. Time goes by fast, and my mind is completey fried cause it's late at night!  Anyways...guess I can only say one thing and that is that I'll be teaching starting this monday. Every day of the week from early in the morning till mid afternoon. Yikes, guess it'll be harsh, but it'll be good money and enjoyable. Unlike other things not so enjoyable...like err my advisor.  Wish ya'll the best..

       To top it all off..    &nbsp; Suppose I really did it. Suppose it's a bit late to be online at this time, as it's 3:34 a.m! Yikes! Just been a nice day for me I guess. Didn't do much but go on a walk, eat, talk, shop, and clean (haha, as I ever do that) but I cleaned a car.  I bought a car this past friday. Amazingly nice. Got the best deal for it, and it is a 2003 Honda Civic EX. The color of it is called NightHawk Black. But I guess it looks black to me. It has anything I could possibly ask for in a car. The best part of the car, is the thing I saw when I actually drove it myself. It has amazingly cool blue chrome dials, which light up. Kind of a sporty look to the car, but at the same time it adds spice.  So now I wonder, as the topic of this message says "to top it all off." I've had ambitions of doing and buying things myself. I started out small, and my goal was to keep building. I went from small things to a laptop, to now a car. What's next? I was thinking, and I think it'll be a house. I suppose I'll probably buy the house at least 4-5 years down the road, but we'll see how that goes once I get to Purdue University.

       Atheist..    &nbsp; Just thinking, and realizing stuff because I spoke to a friend of mine. She has a few friends who are atheist. I know some. I guess it's hard for me to understand how people can be atheist. It simply does not make sense how people can believe that there is no God, that everything which happens just happens out of no where. That there is no higher power. I guess being a biologist and taking so many biology classes only confirmed my belief in God; because when you learn the system of life and how everything is so detailed and how everything fits so PERFECTLY, and how everything is there for a reason...you cannot think anything but believe there is a God. NO ONE or NO randomness could EVER make something so intricate, so beautiful, so filled with details as God can! Amazing!

       Sad News :(    I cannot name any names here, as I believe this person did not want anyone to know. But I remember knowing a graduate student back when I first was a freshmen in college. She was from India, and we never really spoke till 2 years later when my friends introduced me to her. She was an older student and was working on a masters. Two years later, when I started my masters degree, she was finishing up on a second masters. I had still kept in touch with her and would say hi to her from time to time. Except during this time, she was telling me that she was thinking of going home as she had not seen her family. My other friends told me that she had a terrible tootache as well and was getting second opinions on the toothache from others. She had decided to go home to get her tooth pulled..home being India. I never understood that, as I thought a ticket over to India would cost a lot more than just getting her tooth pulled here. So a year or so passed, and I spoke to a friend of mine about this grad student and they said, well she's probably still with her family and who knows what is going on--she was done with her education here, so what's the point of coming back. I never knew till today when I ran into a friend of mine, this friend told me that the Indian girl I knew (she was in her upper 30's), had died on May 14th. I felt like all the blood had gone outta my head and felt light headed. It was in complete disbelief, and I never knew it was coming! :(( It turns out that this graduate student had contacted doctors here when she had a tootache, and they had told her it wasn't only a tootache. She had cancer and that it had spread to her bones and most of her body. She hid the news from everyone except one person..and she went home. Now a year and a half later I find out she died. I never got to say bye to her. I never knew anything! She was an amazing girl...she will be missed.......

       I could never be a businesswoman!!    &nbsp; I know an Ebay Junkie..and this person sells stuff on there all the time! I mean this person makes everything look good, even though it may have some scrathes here and there. And this person sells everything at exactly the cost they bought it at! I find it even hard to LIE to someone and to sell something to them, let alone lie about it! Geez...those businessmen and woman..they must have no morals! Car salesmen included!Acck..I remember when my friend took a computer class and then I took it a semester later. She told me I could buy her books from her and save on cash. I remember seeing that her books were new and at the bookstore the books were being sold for 120 dollars. She was offering to sell them to me for 40 dollars. I couldn't believe her, and I remember writing her a check for 85 dollars. She was in disbelief and didn't believe why I had paid her much. As far as I know, there is a lot less hassle, if the material is bought at the price it should be at. If however, I had bought the books for so much cheaper ($40), I can imagine my friend would have always wondered...gee, I wish I could have made more.....

       In the storm literally....    &nbsp; This weekend my family went to West Lafayette..and also to Chicago to just buy a lot of stuff. My mom bought a lot, as she's the shopaholic...We went to look for a place for me to live in when I attend graduate school this fall.  Err, the whole time we were there it rained..well actually on the way back it rained. My friend had told me that I was in the storm while my friend was the one looking from outside the storm. I never got it till today. I was in the storm and practically drove about 4 hours in it (I drove a bit-in chicago to middle of Wisconsin)...I guess getting out of the storm was like me learning from it. Interesting...

       Tomorrow is da game!!!    &nbsp; Just thinking...I never keep up with basketball anymore. I sorta lost interest when the Bulls went down, after stupid Michael Quit! Anyways, suppose it's sorta cool now. It's the Lakers against the Timberwolves..suppose I'll cheer my home team! Maybe Shaq will shoot something other than a 1 pointer....as if!   Ohhh...if I only I could see the Gophers go to the finals again, and have them go against Arizona.....that was greeeatt...wow that was years ago!

       To have trees or no trees..    &nbsp; Went out on a walk today with my brother. It's been a while since I did that. Just was thinking as I've thought this up before too. It pertains to trees, odd I know. My parents were looking for a house and wanted to know what mattera to me about a house...ack I guess my answer was sorta weird though my mom agreed with me on it. My question was: Does the house have trees around it? I don't know but having trees creates TONS of beauty, lots of privacy and shows that the place is established. Who the heck wants to live on a land that was hit by a Tornado?? Trees just look cool.  On my way to Indiana last week and in Indiana..I realized one thing and that was that the place had relatively less trees than Minnesota. Guess my opinion may be biased as my main intention on visiting Indiana was not to check to the Tree population. Suppose maybe I just saw wrong areas..

       To get a big head!    &nbsp; I hope I never become this, but if I ever do, I surely hope someone stops me. Well this post is about people that I know all too well who get a big head, when they get somewhere or get some type of an accomplishment. I mean their head gets soo big that they make "mountains out of small things!" (yah I changed it). I suppose, getting an accomplishment is rewarding and I agree, yes one should cheer and share it, but it by NO means, means that you should put down others or act as if you are better because you are there at that one big place. I've seen some friends who upon doing so well, figure that hell, my life rules, I don't need those losers I was with before..and these friends walk off into their big headed world. I just sit there wondering, if they ever look back and realize what they've done. It's good they made it far, and I'm sure they did it all on their own, or was there some support from their friends helping them along the way? Even if there wasn't, should people just get a big head and join the rest of the big headed population of America, let alone the world.  I guess I got into a phd program. I suppose it's an accomplishment. I finished my masters, and I guess I could say it's an accomplishment. But rarely do I sit there and get this HUGE head about it. I just figure it's a normal part of life. There are TON of other people doing the same thing as me, so why should I think what I do is soooo much better than others?? ANd who says a phd or a masters is huge? It's what is commonly believed. But what if that's just a way of brainwashing. What if the true smart people are the ones who are more handy in real life and have more common sense, and aren't the book worms? Just something to think about I guess. I guess I literally tell myself everyday to never blow my accomplishments out of proportions. I know that when I get my phD, it'll be in only ONE subject and a minute part of it, that in NO way would make me get a big head as it does not mean I know everything. I will never forget people who helped me get where I am no matter what! I will never get a big head. I keep reminding myself all this. Even these days I am friends with my friends from high school who did not pursue an education but rather went straight to working for McDonald's. It does not mean they are less than me and that does not warrant me to get a big head about it. It just means each of us play a part in life differently, what God put in one person's head is different than what he put in mine. Just need to appreciate it all, and learn from it.

       Da Pistons rule    &nbsp; Haha, farewell Kobe and Shaquille! The pistons won! wohoo. Alright alright, I didn't see the game totally, as I was busy working on other stuff (which I really didn't want to do anyways!). But Pistons won! I never really had a liking towards either team, I just wanted someone to beat the Lakers!I long for the days of the Bulls. Stupid Coach Jackson! If he had only not lied and said he was NOT retiring..we'd still have Michael playing for the Bulls! :( I'm stuck on Jordon!

       When will I know it all???    &nbsp; It's hard to think, but I have to defend my thesis as well! Icck. Everyone keeps telling me that I'll do great because I know all there is to know about my project. But...I feel more confused than ever. I mean, I don't know enough! I only spent the last few months writing the thesis, and it's not enough! The research was just research...wopdeedoo..People claim that once you have a masters' you know so much! But I feel the same! I mean, I now have more questions than I did before. Why why why!! I simply cannot imagine the fact that I'll have to defend a thesis in front of a ton of phds :( Professors know more than me...I'm simply a nobody.  I yearn for the day I learn a lot and can talk like I know a lot. Till then I'll walk around only hoping for it all...I have a huge feeling that even after getting my phd, I'll think that I don't know enough. I guess it makes you keep learning then...or does it just make you get mad at yourself? hmmm

       Do I really have that many shoes?!!?    &nbsp; Uggh, we've had maintainence (sp!) men galore at my house. We've had people cleaning up our house and putting stuff in, mainly in MY room!! Why mine!! K...so while I'm at school TAing, they decide to go through my closet and put everything out in the hallway out of my room. And they ruined my total awesome setting on my dressing table too. Yep I had to fix that one up last night...not too happy, as I cannot stand change!!   Anyways, I walked home to a huge pile of shoe boxes which really looked familiar. Then did I realize that the shoes were ALL MINE! MY God! THere were shoes everywhere!! In the living room, my sister's room, the hallway and in the corner of my room (out of the closet of course!). There must have been at least 40 pairs of shoes!!! I never knew I had so many shoes till someone stuck them out in the open! I have always just hid them in the closet..now I guess I realize I may have enough shoes..but still..ya never can have ENOUGH shoes, can you? NOOOOOOO

       Sunshine rules..    &nbsp; Ahh, the relief and happiness sunshine brings. Something about it, it just makes you feel good! I'm currently sitting outside on my laptop in the beautiful sunshine. It feels so good! Guess the picture doesn't really cut it, as a laptop in the wilderness (is it?) doesn't fit. I mean a laptop in this beautiful scenery doesn't go! oh well! I needed sunshine. We've had way too much rain in such a loooong time, that I was starting to wonder when that nice yellow light from the sky would peak in!

       Am I an advisor?? Or a counselor?    I was busy working on some stuff today and one of my students stopped by. This student needed help on some school issues and thought I was the best person to talk to, about that. Then later a friend of mine stopped by just to tell me about how crappy her weekend had been. Again I listened. Now today, I decided to meet yet another complete new stranger. Nice stranger indeed. This stranger got to know me better, found out that I got into a doctoral program and wanted advice on it. It's interesting, but we ran into each other like 3 times in one day! What a cool thing!   I just find it odd that people throw their worries on me. I guess I take it sometimes, but then there are other times, I'm not so tuned to listen in on them. My sister's friend was like that too..she always had to deal with the listening. I guess I don't mind it most days...Makes me wonder if I should have gone into counseling!

       Must we control our lives???    &nbsp; I guess I find it odd, well I shouldn't say odd as I've done it before too. But I sit and notice things around me, mostly of what people do and what they tell me. I mean each and every person I know, wants to do something to influence something so that its' in their favor. But I wonder, would that do any good. The one person who holds the answer to everything is Allah. Why should we be the ones trying to influence things in our lives, when what will happen, will be the word of Allah. If things should happen, they will happen. If things shouldn't happen, they won't and we may think we have control over them, but we don't.  We are all a part of this huge playground in which God is the creator watching his creatures get at it. God watches to see what we're up to. If we screw up, he knows. If we do good things he knows. I am sure God laughs sitting there thinking, hahaha, you think you influence some instance and make it your way when I know it's gonna be my (God's) way no matter what!  I guess it's stupid. Why waste so much time on thinking up stuff and trying to influence or push things. We cannot control anything. I figure we should just live life and live it fully.

       The cutest kid!    &nbsp; As I was walking on campus today, enjoying the beautiful sunshine..I saw a cute little boy in the distance, and I thought to myself, what a cute little kid! I didn't think I'd have the guts to walk up to the kid and shake his hand, but...I've been feeling different. I walked up to the place where the kid was, he was standing next to his mom. After talking to her a bit, I shook his hand and spoke to him! OH my God..never seen such a cute kid before! But the odd thing is that I think that about a lot of other kids, as well as my cousin's children. We are all beautiful in our own little way...

       Why do I get sleepy from it all?? Great talk..    &nbsp; This weekend my family had some people over, and I just sat there and listened to people talk! I mean I liked what they said but I literally had nothing to comment on. And for some ODD reason, I was as tired as ever just listening. I mean I enjoyed talking to them (err listening), but why must I get sleepy from stuff like this?? It happens ALL the time!!!! I feel the same when I meet up with my friends...I get soo tired that I come home and sleep for a looong time, and my sleepyness does not end even that day..I have to sleep even more the next day to sleep off my sleepyness. Why why why? I've always had this problem! Ayee...I remember I spoke to my friend Sandy last year and she said she felt the same. She thinks we were both a bit introverted though we act extroverted. Maybe I try so hard to act "extroverted" that I get tired from it..what an idea? hmm...

       Old Friends revisited..    &nbsp; I ran into an old friend of mine...a very old one. From my first days of my freshmen year. This friend and I had pre-calc and calculus together and we used to see who could do better on the tests. Of course I beat this friend on every test. I just knew math a bit better than this friend. So....the other day, I walked out of my office and there this friend was! WoW! LONG time no see I guess. It was old times revisited. We spoke for a long time. Caught up on what we had been up to...but sadly I must admit, this friend wanted to keep in touch with me. We exchanged numbers, though being the way I am, I did not give mine. I think this friend took it in a bad way, as I could see it on their face :( Ooops. I did get the e-mail. I donno, while I may be deleting some phone numbers out of my address book in the next few weeks, I am not sure if I am ready to add in news ones..or to get some new ring a dings from people.

So those maintenance men came to our house last week or so was it, and they totally screwed up my closet and took out all my shoes! Now I cannot find my favorite pair of black shoes! I wonder who took them, and what will I do? I need to wear them tomorrow and don't know where they are!! :( There's no need to buy a new pair..or is there? NO. I'm gonna go find those shoes!!!

       Sleeping in Public Places    &nbsp; I am getting sick of the people on my college campus thinking that the buildings are their bedrooms! I cannot stand watching people falling asleep on the couches everywhere! It shocks me that people would do that, as do they ever wonder who the heck was on the couch before them? And what was that other person doing on the couch? What if that other person had broken wind? Or What if that other person had a fungal infection or a nontreatable bacterial infection! ewweee..  And how do people fall asleep in classes? Never got that either. I can't fall asleep in class. I've done it ONCE, and it was completely out of my control the day it happened! Otherwise, I never just fall asleep on my own (in a class that is).

       Must Resign My Reign as the Microbiology TA    &nbsp; Today I gave my last lab practical I will give at my university. Well today was the last lab practical I gave to a class load of students. Technically tomorrow will be the last day I ever give a lab practical--since I have one student left. I guess they say you should miss it, and I thought I would, but I DONT. I had quite a few students come up to me before leaving just thanking me for being a great TA. I guess if I had stopped teaching last year, I would have missed it. But stopping now is more like I'm moving on. I am actually looking forward to a change now (odd as it seems as I hate change!). But I now have a sense of my future at Purdue university, and I'm excited. I'm excited to meet a new group of motivated graduate students and to see new faces. I'm excited to be taking brain-killing graduate classes. I'm excited about teaching at Purdue, and maybe teaching Microbiology to students who aren't just nursing students, but students who are as crazy of bacteria and viruses as I am!   I am just about done grading all of my lab practicals from my students. I corrected quickly and can't wait to get them out of my hands. I cleaned out my office and gave away the teaching notes to another TA. The time has arrived, and I feel as if I'm more than ready to leave, as I simply cannot imagine being back again next year! I know I'll miss the people here, or the comfortable setting, but who can sit around like that forever. You learn from new things..and now is my time that I learn. I guess **

       You know you're in the right place...    &nbsp; Been thinking lately, and realized a few things said to me at my Purdue and Carver college of Medicine Interviews--which totally told me I was in the right place.   First off--at Purdue. I was there and we were being greeted by the department chair. And he said, you know you are in the right place, or actually he said we all have something in common and I want you to either agree or disagree with me on this one. He said, "We all are the ones who at parties would rather sit in a corner or be on the outside than be the talkers in the center." Heh, interesting, never knew people could define how I felt, and never knew there were other dorks like me! haha.. Okay not dorks, but well get me talking about bacteria, and I can talk FOREVER! hehehe  Second--At Carver college of Medicine. We were asked what is our favorite thing, and the consensus from the class was "bacteria!"hahahaah! I even heard some say they love bacteria! I donno if anyone went as far as saying "I'd love to lick that bacteria--heh like me"..but there were quite a few geeky nerds stuck on bacteria like me at the Interview.   Another note..I was grading my students streak plates the other day. Okay for those of you who don't know, a streak plate is a way of isolating bacteria from the masses (basically). One of my students had Staphylococcus aureus as the organism she streak plated. I rather than grading her, wrote "beautiful" on her plate. Heh, she probably thought I was stupid because I remember her coming up to me and asking "what did I get on this assignment?" hahaha. If anyone has seen pure white yummy droplet looking colonies of S. aureus on blood agar, you'd know what I mean! The TA I work with thinks..I'm crazy! hahahah. Oh, while I'm at it...other bacteria which look beautiful include Micrococcus luteus with it's awesome colonies and beautiful yellow color. Klebsiella pneumoniae is just as gorgeous! Same goes for Serratia and Pseudomonas species!!

       Liars and Hypocrites, Oh MY!    &nbsp; The one quality I hate in people or should I say something which annoys me...mmm I am annoyed by hypocrisy, or more specifically I am annoyed by hypocrites. I find it a hypocrisy to say something one time and then to change your mind about it later..that kinda cuts it in between hypocrisy, falsehood, and lying. I am not sure which one it should be, but overall it's just BAD. I guess I am the type who likes to hear whatever it is the way it is, and not have it sugarcoated to make it sound nice. Sorta like if my clothes look bad, someone should just say I look hideous rather than say, oh no you look GREAT today. That's a hypocrite! Or acck a liar? Associating with hypocrites, or liars, makes one pick up on such bad qualities.

       The Growing Season of MinneSnOwTa Sucks!    &nbsp; So I enjoy gardening and have planted tons of stuff in my garden for this spring and summer. Little did I know that MinneSNOWTA would be the way it has been! I mean whatever I planted in April basically died, so I bought more stuff to plant! And whatever I did plant beginning of May is growing soo SLOW :( And whatever had survived from April is not strong enough to grow to a point in which it can prosper and give fruit! So icck! I'm just getting mad!   The ONLY thing which has been doing alright in this crazy weather has been my strawberries! Thank God! I planted those thingies about 2 years ago, and finally this year, I see fruit on them. Beautiful Beautiful, how the fruit grows on plants. I just find it amazing! But that is it.   Flower wise, the roses are doing great, no foliage but some blooms! The bulbs always do alright. However, the tomatoes are gone :( Oh well...I guess I should enjoy as much of the garden as I can considering that I will be leaving for Purdue very soon and will never be able to have a garden again for some time :(

       Another Project!    &nbsp; So I'm done teaching and am done with school for at least a month. I figured that to keep myself busy I should start a new project. So I went out and bought a pattern and am now on my way to sewing an awesome Brown Coat! I got the cloth for it for very cheap, it was on clearance, wopee! I sewed quite a bit of it yesterday, and then sewed some today, and realized I had to get some interfacing and stuff. So I was back at the fabric store buying the interfacing. Got that part done, now I only need to attach the collar and the arms to the coat..and volaa (sp!) a new great coat made solely by me!!! Mmm...only problem is that I decided to make the coat a bit lose so I chose the pattern for two sizes bigger than mine..now it's HUGE! :( I now sit redoing a lot of what I would have never had to do, if I had only chosen the right sizE!

       Will a higher price make people quit?   I went on a trip recently with my famiy and on our way we stayed overnight in Michigan. On the nightly news in Michigan they were saying that Michigan will have the highest price for cigarettes in the nation. It sort of made me wonder. Do people really think that by increasing the cigarette price..people will stop smoking? I highly highly doubt it. I've had friends who were smokers and I asked them if the higher prices would make them quit...their answer was a simple "NOPE"

       Back at it..but HERE   I took a year hiatus from this msg board and started a new one..only to come back to this one. I figure that with time I will delete the other one. I need to figure out a way, however to get all the posts from that msg board onto here. Those posts were from the year of 2003-2004, well the academic school year.  I'm starting back here again for the academic year of 2004-2005 and onwards. I like this msg board just a heck of a lot better.

       Some Songs NEVER Get Old...    &nbsp; I am a devoted fan of Richard Marx. I love all his songs well most of them. I had the opportunity to listen to Richard Marx's song "Take this heart" in my car, in which I boomed it up really loud. I've loved this song since I was 13 years old..and even now, I love it the same. You'd think that hearing some songs so many times, makes ya get sick of them..but NOT this one!  Same goes..for songs by Bryan Adams! One song being "Summer of 69"..I've been listening to him since I was 13..and I'm still crazy about his music!!!  Oh and there are a few country songs which I'm still stuck on since I first got stuck on them when I was about 14 or 15 years old. Songs by singers such as George Strait, Tim McGraw, John Michael Montgomery....

       I Love Post-Its!!!!!!    &nbsp; Maybe my memory is going insane, but I love Post-its! Yes Yes I admit it, I do love them! I constantly am writing down lists of "things to do" and I KNOW I will forget if I do not write down what needs to be done...and well Post-Its have become my best friend because of this habit! Every day I must go through at least 4 Post-Its on which I write down what I need to do!!! All I know is that these wonderful sticky pieces of papers totally help me get the job done!

       Different Cultures or different Races?? Hmmm....    &nbsp; So I was reading some stuff up on the net the other day. I came across Angelina Jolie's comment about how she is looking to adopt more kids. She said something of the sort "I'd like to have kids from all over the world under one roof, in which these kids would represent different cultures". Well I never take what celebrities take seriously anyways, but lets think of this one for a moment. How can having children from&nbsp; different countries entail different  cultures??  Think about it. Aren't cultures learned. I have never heard of a child be born on which his head says, please raise in the western culture, or well please raise child following customs of Thailand! The most this ever so smart celebrity could have said was that she wanted different  races  under one roof! What weirdo...

      Is any place quiet enough?  I'm sittin in the library on the stupid computers..only because I HAVE to, and not because I want to. I'm sitting on a stupid Mac...I had to move because some idiot girl was at the IBM computers being such an idiot. You'd think that when you come to the library, you can get some peace and quiet right?? NOO...not this time. This girl decides that she must eat an apple while she works on the computer..so every few seconds I'd hear, "sccrrrrunnnnchhh" as she bit the damn apple...and then the chewing would start! Before her stupid chewing was over..she'd be biting again! I looked around at her 3 times, but she just kept eating away...I was so annoyed, I walked off disgusted! So heck, I'm now here working on the stupid Mac's.. :(

       Can a planned life be too planned?    &nbsp; I'm stuck on using a planner. I've been using planners since I was about 18 years old and started my freshmen year in college.&nbsp; In the planner I generally write down what needs to be done daily..in which I made&nbsp;a "to do list" per day.&nbsp; Most days I finish the list, and some days things get transferred to the following day...but it does help to get everything done which I could possibly imagine doing.  But...I wonder..is being so planned a good thing? I get to a point sometimes that I wish I didn't have that "to do list" and sometimes it becomes a chore!! I get sick of it, and really don't want to follow through on it, but only do it because it has to be done.&nbsp; I know of friends who don't have planners or these so called "to do lists", and they dont' forget things...so would I remember things if I didn't have a planner?? I should just try..but can't seem to find the guts to do it! Maybe some day...I'll do it...We'll see :) Till then I'll keep checking off on my to-do list....and yes writing this post today was on the list! ;)

       Another Reality Show I might just like....hmmm..     I dont' watch much t.v...and when I do, it's usually reality shows or something. But lately I've been free from school and have had the chance to watch a lot of t.v. I'm stuck on watching 20/20, Dateline, etc...but those shows I've always watched before in the past too.  And I never have ever forgotten to watch the show survivor. But now..I've found that the show "Extreme Makeovers: Home edition" is awesome! But what I really am starting to like is the show "Amish in the City"...it might just be the next show I get glued to! Ohh..how great.  Other shows I have always enjoyed in the past have been the show "This old House" on PBS..I love watching people make things, and learning how to make things. Bob Villa (is that him) does a good job of showing how to do things on that show...  Ohh..I wonder that when I'm off to graduate school...will I have the luxury of time to watch such shows. I suppose so..or maybe I"ll make time..
