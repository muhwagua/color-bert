Rushed in to town and am now Â£200 lighter.     &nbsp;   Had a nice email and that cheered me up now end, here are some of the pictures from the mail   &nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Just goes to show there is always something to cheer you up on a bad day.     &nbsp;   My blog is now hosted by my brothers network, so thanks to Steve for setting it all up for me.

         I have been keenly reading my brothers blogs for the last week or so and have decided to give it a try as well.&nbsp; I have always found writing very hard being a dyslexic (why is it dyslexic people&nbsp;can spell dyslexic with no problems!) but I have decided to put that behind me and see where this takes me.      &nbsp;   Well it is a little before 5 am and I am having my usual sleepless night thanks to a cat who thinks it is great fun to jump on her mum when she is trying to sleep! grrr     &nbsp;   I came across this on my PC earlier, I forgot&nbsp;I had it but&nbsp;I think its worth a thought or two     &nbsp;        I wonder how many of us would find a recently repaired wall in our own basement,&nbsp; were we to look...........  &nbsp;  Two travelling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansion's guest room. Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied, "Things aren't always what they seem."  &nbsp;The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable farmer and his wife.  After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears.&nbsp; Their only cow, whose milk had been their sole income, lay dead in the field.  The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel how could you have let this happen? The first man had everything, yet you helped him, she accused. The second family had little but was willing to share everything, and you let the cow die.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"Things aren't always what they seem," the older angel replied. "When we stayed in the basement of the mansion, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune, I sealed the wall so he wouldnâ€™t find it."  &nbsp;  "Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I gave him the cow instead. Things aren't always what they seem.Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things don't turn out the way they should. If you have faith, you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage. You might not know it until some time later...      &nbsp;   Certainly makes you think.

      holiday is going well so far.  weather isn't great but we were expecting that. went to a nice country park yesterday and hired some bikes for an hour. kira thought the trail-a-bike was great.  got attacked by midges in the woods and have about a dozen bites over my head, legs and arms.  don't know whether it's me but I'm finding people so rude and impatient round here. from some daft old biddy huffing and puffing at the cash mashine to some prat in a range rover trying to overtake on a blind corner and then tailgating. i'm really tempted to just jam my brakes on and let him explain it to his insurers.  on more than one occasion i've had to take a deep breath and count to 10 before i've shouted at someone.

       We've got nothing ready for camping on Friday. I don't know how we manage to completely fill the back of a Ford Galaxy AND roof box when there's just the 4 of us going for a week. Still it should be good fun, even if it will be a little damp.  I've got to get my car taxed before we go and I'm out of the office at some boring IT Compliance seminar tomorrow morning. The only upside is that I may get to have a quick look around the Williams F1 Visitors Centre if I get a few moments afterwards. I'm not sure I will as I have to get back to the office to make sure I can hand everything over before my holiday.   I'm much more comfortable leaving the office now as I know full well that there's nothing that the guys in the office can't deal with. It was about this time last year that my panic attacks started growing because I was never sharing any information about what I was doing and consequently I was forever worrying that I was the only one who would be able to fix any problems. This led me to keep asking what if I couldn't fix it.   Hopefully if the guys ever read this they may see how much I appreciate working with such a good team. If it wasn't for them just getting on with it when I was signed off for 3 weeks last year then I'd be a complete wreck by now. As it is I'm just a partial wreck ;-)

       It's strange how I can wake up in a pretty good mood and then something very minor makes the mood swing right over to the other end of the spectrum.  Kira (youngest) plays around with her breakfast most mornings and is soooo slooow at eating it. This morning she'd been eating it for 20 minutes and had barely touched the surface of her cereal. She was putting the weetos in one at a time. Katie had told her to hurry up and so had I. Now I'm not known for having much patience so I did no more than took her cereal away and threw it in the bin. Told her the same would happen tomorrow if she didn't eat it quickly.  Everyone in the house then goes quiet because Dad's in a bad mood. How do you explain to a 4 year old that taking that long to eat a bowl of cereal is too long. Does she even understand?  I've now got to try really hard not to carry this into work where everyone would then think I'm just a moody git without knowing what else goes on before I make it to the office.

       I've just had a really really good spinning class. Had loads of energy and managed to burn over 1300 calories in 50 minutes. It probably had something to do with the instructor today, a relatively new guy at the gym called Pete, who happens to be 6' 10" tall and a bigger build than me. That meant he tailored the class to what was comfortable for him which meant less speed and more power. My legs were screaming at points duirng the class but it felt good afterwards knowing how hard I'd worked. Hopefully that'll make up for me going over my weightwatchers points yesterday :-o

       Security is one of those things that as the guy in charge of IT you know is important and yet there's just so many aspects of it you don't know where to start.  I think we've got patch scanning sorted out using a great product called  urlLink HFNetChkPro . Just need some better reporting so we know when a new patch comes out and can push it to all machines.  My other concerns are general system vulnerabilities. Hopefully by keeping machines patched with MS patches we can reduce most of these but we use a lot of other apps that I'm pretty sure are well out of date.  I going to try an open source scanner called  urlLink NESSUS  later on as that scans right across the board.  Other areas I need to make sure are 100% covered are AntiVirus, Users and I'm sure there are more but can't think of them at the moment.

       Got to sort out our software licencing at work as we've managed to slip behind somewhat. Our nice friends at  urlLink DABS.COM  have convinced me the Microsoft OSL is a good way to go. I finally got the quote yesterday - ouch! It might be a good way to go if you're already using the Pro version of all M$ products but we're not. Back to the drawing board then :-(

       After what seems like ages, I've finally lost a decent amount of weight again this week (yes, even after having curry and beers on Friday night).  Weighed myself this morning and am now 20st 5.25lbs, thats over 4lbs lost since last Monday! - Still got a long way to go and I'm still massively overweight, even for my height. I'll get there, this is just what I needed to get the motivation going again. I wonder if it has something to do with me NOT doing any gym this weekend.  Didn't manage to do any spinning yesterday. I turned up, only to be told the spinning instructor has gone home sick. Nice of them to phone me and let me know. Thought I may as well do a workout while I was there. Did 10 minutes on a rowing machine, got fed up and went home. Funny how sometimes I'm really motivated and sometimes I'm not.  Managed to get the garage cleared out yesterday. Hurrah! There was rubbish in there that's been lying dormant for years. Took a carload down the dump and then had a massive tidy up. There's loads of space now :-) I should have no problems getting all the camping gear out on Thursday for our holiday.

       Twice this weekend I've been faced with remembering Katies miscarriage in 1998. It affected me quite badly at the time and every now and then something comes up that jogs my memory.   On Friday evening the conversation came round to kids and why we're so paranoid. When Katie was pregnant with Kira after the miscarriage I refused to make any plans whatsoever for fear of a repeat of what happened. I didn't want to choose names or prepare in any way. Because Kira was quite poorly when she was a baby I was scared that everything was a serious problem. So this was the first time.  And then last night we were watching the latest episode of ER on E4 and John Carter and his girlfriend Kem had a stillbirth and that was really painful to watch, not just because it was a good bit of drama but because I remember going through the trauma, the devastation and the self doubt. That was probably the start of a very low point in my life.  Happily, Kira is a little cracker now, her asthma is all but gone and I'm much more relaxed with the children.  Every now and then I still wonder - What if........

       Had a great time on friday evening. Went out with a couple of friends for some beers and a curry and it was like old times. No kids, very relaxed. We need to do it much more often. Was up nice and early yesterday with no signs of a hangover whatsoever :-)  Managed to make some headway in sorting out the study. Replaced 3 multiway adapters with one 10 way adapter and ending up using 5 sockets less when all the cables were removed :-0  Today I've got to make a start on the garage. I need to be able to dig out all the camping gear for our holiday next weekend. We've decided that although it is sunny today it's too chilly to take the boat out and we've got too much other stuff to do.  Got spinning in a little while and need to make sure to burn off as many calories as possible to undo the damage done by the beers and curry. Still on target to lose a couple of lbs this weekend.

        Hooray, I'm a year older! :-S  Well I got my main birthday present 2 months ago, A nice shiny new PC Upgrade. I'm running an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ on an Asus A7N8X-E Deluxe Motherboard with 1GB of RAM. It also has a GeForce FX5900XT 128mb Video Card and 280GB of HD space. All wrapped up in a shiny ThermalTake XASER III Aluminium case.  Plus the new Karcher pressure washer and a lovely new England water bottle (amazing what you can pick up in Sainsburys) for my trips to the gym.  Not really sure I appreciated Katies card - it said "Will I still love you when your old and grey" and the punchline - "Of course I do!" - cheeky git :-P  I've now got a quandry: I've had a really good week with my diet so far. Do I stay on the wagon and have soup before I go to the pub and have diet coke when I get there. Do I opt for nice lower fat choices for the curry tonight? Or do I say sod it, it's my birthday! hmmmmm.....

       I  heard the funniest story on the Radio 1 News at 07:30 this morning. In my bleary  state I had to listen really hard as I couldn't quite believe it. I had to check  it wasn't April 1st.  Apparently, details have emerged of a plan by the RAF during the 2nd  World War to use pigeons for bombing runs over hostile territory. They were to  be trained to have incendiary devices attached to their legs and then fly to&nbsp;a specific destiantion to deliver them. I wonder why that never got off  the ground (pardon the pun!) - Could it be something to do with a pigeons natural homing tendencies! Last thing you want is for the little blighter to  bring the thing right back to you. Find the full story here  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3732755.stm   Another story during the same bulletin got me quite excited too. The  prospect of a London F1 GP, ala Monaco style. That would be  great.

       Another weekend is nearly here,  I'm going to the pub tomorrow for lunch and then out for a curry tomorrow  evening. I've got so many things I need to do this weekend and I know I'm  never going to get it all done. I've got to finish building my server (or at  least put the sides on it) and tidy up the study. Got too many devices  plugged into to few 4-way mains leads :-o.  Got to find time to install a  copy of Nero Burning ROM for katies Dad so that he can burn some CD's. I've  already kept him waiting for a month. I've got to tidy the garage, inflate  the boat, put the roofbars on the car. Then next weekend we're going camping  so I've got all that lot to sort out too. Phew!

        You know you're living in 2004 when...   1. You  accidentally enter your password on the microwave. 2. You haven't played solitaire with real cards in  years. 3. You have a list of 15 phone  numbers to reach your family of 3. 4. You  e-mail the person who works at the desk next to you. 5. Your reason for not staying in touch with friends  is that they don't have e-mail addresses. 6. When you go home after a long  day at work you still answer the phone in a  business manner. 7. When you  make phone calls from home, you accidentally dial "9" get an outside line. 8. You've sat at the same desk for four years and  worked for three different companies. 10. You learn about your redundancy on the  11 o'clock news. 11. Your boss  doesn't have the ability to do your job. 12. Contractors outnumber permanent staff and are more  likely to get long-service awards.   AND THE REAL CLINCHERS ARE...  13. You read this entire list, and kept  nodding and smiling. 14. As you  read this list, you think about forwarding it to your 15. You got this email from a  friend that never talks to you anymore, except to send you jokes from the  net. 16. You are too busy  to notice there was no #9 17. You  actually scrolled back up to check that there wasn't a #9 18. AND NOW YOU ARE LAUGHING at yourself

       You  know you're getting old when you don't get invited to "lads" parties anymore.    I'm  34 tomorrow - whoosh - where did my life go. It's a shame we spend most of our  lives trying to earn the money just to keep a roof over our heads. I'd love to  have the balls to sell up, move abroad and have a much less costly standard of  living. I hate uncertainty though. Probably why I never really pursued the IT  contracting market. I may give it another cursory glance soon just to see what's  up.  After reading  urlLink Garans Blog   I have to agree with him. Is this  all we have to look forward to for the rest of our working lives. It has it's  plus points and yes I do still enjoy working with computers but it can be so  stressful sometimes. There has to be another option. I'd be happy to earn a  lower salary if our cost of living was lower too.  It's  definitely time to stop spending money just because we can and start saving it  up. It's nice to be able to enjoy it here and now but with some savings under  our belt we'd be in a much more commanding position with regards to the  direction we want to take.  I'm  not suggesting we go to the other extreme but with some careful budgeting I  think we could soon tuck £400-£500 a month into savings. At that rate it won't  be long before it mounts up and we can move or extend the house, or even sell up  and get the hell out of here.  My  mate Lee is doing just that at the end of the year and moving out to Thailand to  work as an English (or should that be Engrish) teacher. I have to say I'm  a little jealous but good on him. He has no ties here so it's a lot easier. I  guess all you need is the right level of motivation and confidence in  yourself.  My  biggest problem is fear of failure and then not being able to provide for Katie  and the girls. I've gone through my last few years in IT thinking this can't be  right. How can I possibly earn this much money doing what I do and then worrying  that sooner or later I'd be found out.  Well  that hasn't happened and I'm obviously good at what I do or I wouldn't have got  the promotion to CTO last year. I wouldn't have got this job at all if I hadn't  succeeded in my previous jobs.  Writing this it seems as though my biggest issue is confidence in myself  and my abilities. Fear of the unknown comes into it too.

        urlLink www.xboxmediacenter.com   Wow,  what can I say. I've had some time to play with this now and I'm impressed. On  the wireless lan I can manage viewing digital photos and playing mp3s, albeit a  little slowly. Once I plug in a wired ethernet cable it absolutely flies. I  wouldn't have known about it if it wasn't for this review at  urlLink Toms Hardware    I  was watching a couple of DivX and Xvid video clips on it last night and was  blown away. Seems to be some compatibility issues with 3vid codecs but that's  not too much of a problem.  What  really suprised me was the BBC news headlines on the front page and the instant  audio and video track lookups.  Just  need to permanently wire an ethernet cable round the room somehow. I not sure  katie will let me keep the current one I've dragged across the middle of the  living room :-o

       Another gorgeous day today, I'm pretty certain it's in the high 20s  outside. Just to make things even more fun a water main has burst down the road  cutting off all water for the office. People ask really stupid questions at  times like this too. "I can't flush the toilet, why not" - "didn't you read the  email that was just sent" - "oh - yes"  Well  if the weather holds, we're going to take the boat down to the coast this weekend for a potter around. I think I'll get it all inflated beforehand to  check for any leaks and such and then transport it down on the roof of the car.  It should go a bit faster now that I've lost some weight.  :-)

       Swapped the pressure  washer at Argos today for a more expensive Karcher model. It's a 1000x  better than the Argos own brand one. No cutouts, quieter and much much more  powerful :-). Gave Katies car the once over and then proceeded to clean some  of the pathways. I then discovered one of the disadvantages of having a  powerful pressure washer - I got absolutely soaked and caked in gunk. Still  good fun.   Cable Modem Woes   Well considering there was no known local  outage, my cablemodem magically came back on at about 3pm this afternoon,  albeit running at about 56k speeds. I didn't have the patience to call the  unhelpful support line this evening, I'll give them 24 hrs and then put my  compensation claim in for loss of service. I'm thinking it's probably worth  looking at external hosting for SMTP and WEB sites. Katie could actually be  losing business because of this outage.   Bloody Blogger   Still can't get their FTP upload working with  my FTP server. And on top of that, I've noticed that the templates are  faulty and my postings get narrower as you scroll down the sceen.

       Finally some sunshine shone in Farnham this weekend. Sadly the grass had  to be cut before we could spend anytime in the garden without fear of losing the  children. My Dad stayed with us until Sunday lunchtime.  Got  2 visits to the gym this weekend including 1 spinning session. Diet was going  really well until we decided to have a barbecue on Sunday evening and invite  some friend round. Doh!. Weighed myself this morning and I've put 1lb back on  since last week. I think I'll give the meeting a miss as I don't need to spend  £5 to be told I've put on.   I  think I'll manage WW fine just using the online service. That'll save me £20 a  month.   New Toys   With a combination of Reward Vouchers and some money from my Dad for my birthday  (21st if you're interested ;-) ) I bought a pressure washer from Argos. Wanted  to clean the pathways and my car. I also wanted one with a detergent dispenser  and a rotary brush for less than Â£100. Found one for £69.99 which was their own brand. Decided that even though everyone I know recommends Karcher, I'll go for  the Argos one.  Wrong move! - It worked fine while cleaning the car as it was on and off  in regular bursts albeit noisy ones. But as soon as I moved onto the pathways it  cut out after 5 minutes of constant use through overheating. You then have to  leave it for 5 minutes and try again. I did this twice before it got  boring.  Needless to say it's going back to Argos today to be exchanged for a  Karcher model.

       No  Internet access all weekend! Damn ntl and their cablemodems, and since when did  their customer dis-service line only operate during office  hours.  Finally got through to someone this morning (after 5 minutes of recorded  messages telling me to reboot my cable modem and PC) only to be told I have to  reboot everything in a certain order - hogwash! Usual fob off reserved for nomal  broadband users who believe everything they're told. And then told they can't  help me unless I'm at home.  I'll  humour them and call from home later on and do what they say and then say TOLD  YOU SO!. Found this number after a lot of searching on their web pages for Broadband Support 0845 650 0121  Watch this space.

       Got  the jabber server fully working with User Directory and conferencing - hurrah.  Even got the startup scripts working. Now just need a tool for piping messages to jabber users.  Now  got a problem with my server at home in that I cannot connect to my FTP server with anything other than  urlLink SmartFTP . I've tried 3 or 4 different FTP servers at home and they all have the same problem, it's not routing PASV traffic properly!. Shame really as I was getting ready to host this blog there on  http://stevedavis.me.uk , I'll  have another look later on.  Got my Dad coming down to stay with us for the weekend, this usually means the diet goes out the window, need to make sure that doesn't happen  :-)

       I'm  currently trying to get a Jabber server running under RedHat 9. I can get the  basic server running fine but I'm buggered if I can get the conferencing side  working at all. Too many text files to edit for me. Give me a nice gui any day  :-)

       Metaphorically speaking of course. The diet has slowed in recent weeks  and I'm going to make a concerted effort to start losing the pounds again. Spinning again tonight, that's bloody hard work. I always feel like I don't want  to go before hand then am always really pleased that I did go afterwards. I tend  to burn between 1000-1200 calories per spinning session. If that's not  motivating then nothing is.  Fitted into a pair of jeans this morning that I've not worn for at least  3 years. Also a good sign. I'm off on holiday for the spring bank holiday week  and I'd like to be as close to 3 stone lost as possible. According to the scales  this morning that's another 7 3/4 lbs to go.

        I'm suffering with too much to do at the moment, both at work and at home. This invariably ends up with me trying to do everything at once and getting nothing finished.  At work, I'm trying to improve our monitoring and alerting. We use  urlLink Servers Alive  for monitoring which is very flexible. I just need to make sure all events are monitored. We currently have about 80 checks and we're still missing lots. I then need to write some nice we templates to put up on our monitoring screens. I've just got  urlLink MRTG  running on most of our servers and gateways which is nice. Graphs always go down well.  At home, my server is running out of steam. Which isn't surprising considering it's a PIII with 300MB of RAM running Win2003 Server, WWW, FTP, DAB Radio, SSH,  urlLink SlimServer  and Mail. I actually host Katies website and mail on this so it is important that I keep it running with plenty of puff. I've decided to re-use my old motherboard and RAM instead of selling them. This will work out cheaper in the long run than paying for hosting charges. I'm going to use the onboard RAID controller with 2 60GB drives in RAID 0 to see if that improves the performance.

       So, here's a quick catchup on what's been happening  with me recently. Some of you know I've been dieting since the beginning of the  year. Well so far I've lost 2 and a half stone. I've done this by following  weightwatchers and going to the gym. The weight loss has slowed right down since  easter but a lot of that is down to me losing my incentive. I'm still on target  to lose 4 stone by the end of the year.  I'm still working for the email  marketing company in Basingstoke as the CTO and am really anjoying it. I went  through a period last summer where I was letting it get to me and started suffering from really bad anxiety attacks. This led to being signed off from  work for 3 weeks. I still get the attacks but they are becoming less frequent  and less severe.  I need to keep reminding my self  about what I can and can't control. There's no point in worrying about stuff  that's out of my hands.  Katie has started her own face  painting business ( http://www.paintme.biz )  and really enjoys it. It's not earning any real money yet but who know's where  it will go. Still, the money she does earn comes in handy.  Better get back to work now.

      Another weekend's flown by far too quickly. But at least we got out as a family on Sunday and took the boat down to the river hamble. It was a spur of the moment thing. We haven't inflated the boat or anything this year so we checked the boat and engine out before we left and took the boat down on the roof of the car. We put the boat in at the mouth of the Hamble in Warsash.  This was much easier than spending 30 minutes inflating it on the slipway. We even remembered to make a note of the wind speeds before we went so we knew what to expect. If only the engine had started a little easier! even though I did start it at home first and it started straight away.  The girls love it on the boat and were pestering me to go faster so that they get bounced around. We decided to go upstream as it was windy in the solent and this was nice and peaceful. On one particularly quiet stretch of river I opened the throttle up and was surprised how quickly the boat got onto the plane. I guess I shouldn't be surprised as between Katie and Me we've lost nearly 5 stone. We managed to get up to 13 knots which is plenty fast enough for a small inflatable boat.  We ventured briefly into the Solent at the end of the trip and got well and truly soaked as we were heading into the wind and it was very choppy. The girls were giggling so much it was great. I took them round one more time as we were having such a laugh.  Finished off with a quick drink in the pub on the slipway. I'm really looking forward to camping in Dartmouth in August as we're taking the boat with us as well.   Car insurance   Had the annual battle with car insurers today, while trying to get the cheapest possible quote. I'm amazed how much it varies between companies. Got turned down for insurance from a couple of places, including Sainsbury's because Katie has an SP30 speeding fine on her licence. This also put the price up on the places that did quote me as well. Most expensive quote today was &pound;690 but ended up getting it for &pound;406 which isn't too bad. They even do interest free credit as well.   It's time...   .....to start coming off the Seroxat. Spoke with my Dr yesterday and she thinks it's the right thing to do as well and has told me to take it slowly. I'm going to take one tablet every other day for a month and then every 3rd day for at least a month after that. I think last year I was naiively expecting the anxiety to disappear but in reality it doesn't. I then just reacted badly when the axiety re-appeared. Hopefully I'm better equipped to deal with it now. Only time will tell.

      Has got to be my  urlLink Tivo box . I'd be completely lost without it and it's one of the few gadgets that even Katie appreciates. It's just a shame that due to a stroke of marketing incompetence you can no longer currently buy them in the UK unless you're willing to pay over the odds on  urlLink eBay , and even then the options are drying up.  This device if you don't know is a personal video recorder that was around before Sky+ and originally marketed by Sky. It is superior to sky+ in many ways, especially the Season Passes (pretty much every single program has one), unlike sky+ where only the popular channels have season passes. I understand this is getting better. I upgraded mine to a 120GB hard drive last year and have never run out of space since then. I still have some programs on there from last October than I need to offload onto DVD when I get a chance.  It came into it's own last night when the Portugal v England match was on. I was at a spinning class so missed the first 10 minutes of the match. What happens in minute 3? a goal, to England, by Michael Owen. The Tivo allowed me to rewind the live TV and watch the goal and then pause live TV when I went to cook tea.  However when Portugal equalised in the 80th minute I had to go and watch something else as I just knew it would end in penalties and I couldn't take the strain.  I ended up watching last weekends British Touring Car Championship from Mondello Park in Ireland. That racing is much more exciting than the current F1 season. The TiVo kindly recorded this even though it's not on every week and is usually on at different times.   On the subject of great TV   I've just finished watching season 3 of  urlLink The Shield . If you've never seen this, do yourself a favour and get it on DVD. It is a gritty US cop drama (oh no! not another one) but it doesn't pull any punches and focuses on the corruption and natsy side of police work. The lead character is a hero one minute and a crook the next. Excellent viewing.  I can also recommend The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Nip/Tuck and Season 3 of 24 is getting better and better. Notice how there aren't any UK programs there? Bring back Cracker, or Spooks I say.

      Think I've finally got the better of the spyware. Thanks to a friend of mine pointing me in the right direction, I downloaded a program called  urlLink BHODemon  which looks at all the programs your copy of IE is trying to load and allows to to just disable them.  I expect the spyware is still there but it's not loading anymore! woo hoo.

      I've no idea where the weekend went. Built the new trailer on Saturday, then had to ferry the girls around to party, park, swimming while Katie was facepainting again. Was bad with the diet this weekend with a Pizza, a chinese AND a BK. But still managed to lose over 2lbs this week. I'm also back into the swing of things with spinning now and had another good session last night at the gym.  Saw the colour photo of Rhian in the paper, very nice, I'll put it up here in a day or so.  Took a trip down to Southampton and Portsmouth on Sunday to look at a camping/trailer shop which was disappointing and then onto the new Outlet Shopping centre "Gunwharf Keys" in Portsmouth. Not sure I'll attempt to use the main car park again as it took over 1/2 hr to get in. The shops were all very nice but no one seemed to have anything in an XL or XXL so it was no good for me whatsoever.   quack quack   Saw the psychologist yesterday afternoon about coming off my tablets and he agreed it was the right thing to do. He really just re-affirmed what I already knew in that I shouldn't try to avoid anxiety but use what I know to deal with it instead. It's all very easy to say in the cold light of day but we'll see. I see my doctor on Monday to actually start the process and see how long she things I should take to come off them.   damn spyware   Yep, it's still there. Tried the most recent version of SpySweeper as well as AdAware and Spybot and yet the popups keep re-appearing. The users of the PCs are being very patient (one is the MD!) yet I think it's starting to grate a little. I think a rebuild is my only option at the moment.

      We've got 2 pc's at work that have been taken over by some sort of ad trojan and keeps popping up unwanted adverts. It's very sneaky because it keeps replicating itself after we remove it's files and registry keys. I will not let it beat me - grr. I've tried cleaning it with AdAware and SpyBot and yet there it is, keeps on rearings it's ugly head.   Very clever though.

      Kira (youngest) has been signed off by the speech therapist as she's gone from having speech that's about 6 months behind to having  better speech than the average five year old (she's only just 4). The speech therapist was really pleased with her progress. So are we - Well Done Kira!   Aching today   Played an hour of badminton last night and my leg are really aching today. I gave it everything I had but still lost 2 games to 1 but had a good laugh. It was sooooo hot in the sports hall last night I must have sweated off a few pounds too.   Diet   I've been fairly good with the diet so far this week and I weighed myself this morning and am about 2 pounds down from mondays weight. I've stuck to my points for all but one day but I've made that up already. I find it much easier to manage if I can keep more than 18 points for the evening.

      Went to the Drs this morning and she's said the lump on my head is nothing to worry about but it will need to be removed as it's growing so fast. She said it was a bit "warty" (in a heavy scottish accent). She's going to make an appointment for me at the skin clinic. That's a relief.   A Tale of 2 Trailers   I've now managed to end up with 2 trailers. Found a very cheap wooden one locally that just needed some paint and varnish and knocked the guy from &pound;40 down to &pound;30. He then proceeded to tell me that he'd bought a new one from Halfords that was &pound;100 off! until the end of the week. This was a massive trailer and exactly what I need, 5'x3' galvanised steel. And just &pound;299.   I did no more than to pop to Halfords and pick one up (not literally as it's extremely heavy and flat packed!). I've now put the first trailer on ebay starting at &pound;40. It's had over 40 views already and there are 3 people watching it :-)   A good nights sleep...   ..makes the world of difference (and taking the right tablets). I feel so much better today.

       Not quite sure why, but I'm feeling a bit down today. I'm pretty sure it's due to my hayfever which has been bad for a few days and always makes me feel a bit low. There's nothing worse than itchy eyes and constantly runny nose and absolutely nothing will stop them. I'm dosed up on my hayfever tablets but forgot to take the nose spray and eye drops this morning.  I'm also feeling a bit despondant about my diet. I just cannot get back the motivation I had previously and keep snacking in the evenings like a naughtly little boy.  I've lost 1 1/4 lbs since last week but I know I can lose much more than that if I stick to the diet. I don't know how I can give myself the required kick to get back into shape.  I'm back spinning tomorrow night and need to book a badminton court for wednesday night so that might start the ball rolling. I really had no inclination to go to the gym at all this weekend.   Ready to tow   Thanks to help from  urlLink Garan  we managed to get the towbar fitted to my Galaxy this weekend. It was a little tricker than anticipated and I'd never have managed it on my own. Got it all wired up yesterday and just need a trailer to test it out. Went and had a look at one locally that was a right state, the chassis was all rusted, so were the wheels and the body was all rotten and flaky with screws sticking through the inside. Definately not worth &pound;95 and I wouldn't have had the time or the inclination to do it up as a project.   Wasting the weekend   Katie had 2 lucrative face painting jobs this weekend which meant I was looking after the girls for quite a while. This wasn't really fair on them as I really just felt like lounging around and not doing much as it was so hot. They played nicely together for a little while and then started getting bored and winding each other up and then I started getting ratty with them. Thinking back, I've really wasted a nice weekend. We don't get many of them and I should be more considerate to what the girls need.

       Well I've just got back from a nice night out on a company do at  urlLink Spitbank Fort  just off the south coast in Portsmouth. It's an old defence fort dating back to the 1800s.  Short ferry ride across (a little choppy!) and we were there. Facinating building, lots of history good food, friendly staff (both ours and theirs). Unusually for a works do, everyone seemed to be well behaved and I didn't see anyone getting too drunk even though there was a free bar. I even did a little dancing (even if it was like you cliche'd wedding disco).  Managed to bang my forehead on a cast-iron hook sticking out from one of the walls which came up in a nice lump. There's also a 400ft passageway around the perimiter of the fort that is pitch black and is quite creepy when using candles.

       Had a comment on my blog from an old friend of mine who I haven't spoken to in a while. He moved out to the US from the UK a good few years back. It was good to hear from him and read some of his comments.   Very tired   For some reason I didn't sleep well last night. Was up at 2am eating a bowl of cereal (oops!). I think subconsciously I am worrying more about this thing on my head than I really admitted to myself. I might pop to the local pharmacist later on and see if there's any advice they can give to alleviate the worrying.   Day of meetings   Got one of those days today with so much to do and yet a lot of the day is booked with meetings. Still this is one of the few companies I've worked at where the meetings are usually quite productive and rarely interfered with by red-tape.  My other main project for the day is to produce a data storage audit to ensure we're backing up the right data at the right time and can get the data back quick enough. Our overnight backups take far too long now we're backing up 100gb a night!

       Only a little bit stiff today. Booked my appointment with the Drs for next Tuesday about the lump on the side of my head, I'm sure it'll be nothing (fingers crossed).  Told my boss today about the psychologists appointments and he was very supportive, just as he was last year when I had the attacks. I just need to make sure I don't take too much time off with appointments, a fine balancing act indeed.  Going to get back into the badminton next wednesday with my mate Martin and booked my spinning for next Tuesday. That reminds me, I need to see if there are any spaces left for this Sunday too.   Tow What?   My new tow bar turned up today so that's my work cut out for the weekend :-S - shouldn't need to cut or drill anything but I will need to remove the bumper to get it installed. Removing bits of car bodywork makes me nervous. Strange how I'm happy working with thousands of pounds worth of complex computer systems yet if my car goes wrong I can do nothing about it. I'll lift the bonnet to check the engines not dropped out but that's as far as my expertise goes.  Got more car expense this friday when it goes in for it's MOT and a new ABS sensor and Master Brake Cylinder - hopefully that will fix the godawful squeaking that they introduced by changing all the pads last month!

       Had some mild anxiety this evening, first time for ages. I think this is down to a couple of things:  Firstly, I've got my referral through for my appointment with the clinical psychologist. I want to come off the anti-depressants that I've been on since last July but am very wary of doing so without some help. It was when I came off them last year that I took a turn for the worst with the anxiety attacks. I got referred to the psychologist then but it was too late as I was already back on the anti-depressants by then and feeling fine by the time I got to see him. I think it took 3 months last time. I'm very surprised as it's only taken about a month this time. This time I need to be able to understand why I have the responses I do to certain situations at the time I'm having them. I guess I could just stay on anti-depressants for ever but I feel that I shouldn't need to rely on drugs just to exist. It feels like being a failure having to rely on drugs  Secondly, I'm a little worried about a small mole like lump that seems to be growing on the side of my head. It seems to have doubled in size in a few weeks and feels quite hard, almost like a scab. I'm trying not to have ANTs as they're called in anxiety circles (automatic negative thoughts) but it's now worrying me enough to make a GPs appointment tomorrow to see what's what.

       Back feels a lot better in that it doesn't hurn when I'm sitting still anymore. It still hurts when I move though. That meant no spinning for me tonight.  I'm also trying to be  really  good with my weightwatchers points today. I've started slipping into the habit of snacking in the evenings and this is the reason for my weight loss stalling recently. I just need to be honest with myself. I did really well at the start of this diet and just need to get it going again. It seemed to snowball at the start in that the more I lost, the better I felt and the easier it was to stick to the diet. I'm going to raise the stake though and see if I can hit my 4st weight loss  before  I go on holiday in August - we'll see.

       My back is agony today. Even just sitting still I can feel it. It's amazing that pretty much all movement uses your lower back on someway and boy don't I know it. I'm heavily dosed up on ibuprofen and I'm hoping it will kick in soon. The sad thing is I nearly had to ask for help this morning just to put my shoes on :-(.  Last time it was this bad I ended up with half a dozen visits to a chiropractor, that was when I had medical insurance.   Garan's a git :-)   He found the picture of me as a werewolf on Katies facepainting site and told the world about it on his blog. I'm not going to link it you can go find it yourself

       Put on 4lbs while away on holiday. Could have been much worse considering during the week we had a Burger King, a Chinese, an Indian and Fish & Chips and a few pub meals :-S. I've managed to strain my back again today so I hope that I haven't ruined my chance of getting back to my spinning class tomorrow evening. That's a major problem being so tall, your back is the weak point. It acts like a hinge between two long levers and it's easy to over stress it. I did my back originally about 8 years ago lifting a photocopier and every now and then I do something silly to strain it. Today, it was lifting 3 LCD screens in boxes at once. Stupid.

       1st day back after the holiday is always tiring. Had a few hundred emails to wade through but nothing major. Holiday was great, very relaxing, weather turned out nice after all, even got a little colour. Really looking forward to our 2 weeks camping in August when we'll take the boat with us. Downside is that I've got to see about buying a trailer of some description now as there's no way we'll fit the boat and the engine in as well. Saw a nice one today but the joker wanted &pound;700 for it!!  I'm gutted as I sold a trailer a few years ago for less than &pound;100 without really knowing it was worth much more than that.

        Since I dropped my tablets down to every other day. I'm going to give it another 2 weeks and then drop to 1 every 3 days for another month.     Been feeling fine up until today when I had the first twinges of a panic attack. Managed to distance myself from it so I could think rationally and that seemed to squash it straight away. When a panic attack starts to take hold they are self propagating in that the more you think about and acknowledge the attack the worse it gets.     I'm not even sure what triggered it today. I think it may have been the amount of work I've got on at the moment and yet due to holidays and people being off I've not had chance to do anything useful all week.

        I cannot publish this blog to my webserver at the moment (now 5 days and not working) and have had to resort to going back to the old address of  urlLink http://vladsplace.blogspot.com . I may have to look for an alternative to blogger because I've not had any response from their support team over this and there's nothing on their status pages.      Didn't make it      Weigh in on Monday was 20st 3lbs which was demoralising as I was so good all last week. Had a night off the diet last night with a pizza while Katie and the girls were out. I just don't understand why my weight yo-yo's so much.     I  AM  going to be 20st exactly before we go on holiday.

        Had a great weekend but am completely knackered now.     Went to the  urlLink airshow  on Saturday with Katie and the girls as well as  urlLink Garan . He hadn't been to an airshow for a long time so was quite taken aback by just what was on display. The usual highlights were the Red Arrows, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Harrier GR7. I have to admit at being very shocked when I saw the Apache Longbox Helicopter do it's display. Helicopters shouldn't be able to loop the loop and do barrel rolls!!     Gorgeous weather, loads of suntan lotion, plenty to drink. A good day.     Yesterday we took the boat down to the Hamble again and put it in at Warsash. Got quite a shock when I saw a car driving past us in the middle of the Hamble, it was a  urlLink Gibbs Aquada . Certainly a head turner. Got a nice couple of hours on the river, let Rhian drive for a little while then took them for the obligatory speed along the solent :-0 - The Solent was quite choppy again so we spent as much time airborne as we did in the water. We also got well and truly soaked. Had to do an emergcy rescue for a hat overboard as the wind stole Rhians cap while we were bombing along.     Katie's taking the girls camping tonight so I have some time to myself. Now, what should I do...?

      We're all off to the airshow tomorrow which should be really good. Katie's coming for the first time in a few years, along with both the girls, as is  urlLink Garan .  Looking at the flying display planned for the weekend there are some usual goodies plus some other slightly unusual ones. Apparently there's going to be a 747 displaying, as well as the F117A Stealth Fighter and a monster B52 bomber.  This  urlLink article  is quite scary. How on earth can a B52 bomber that can fly for thousands of miles fly over the WRONG airfield!  Kira is a little worried that it will be too loud so we've got her some ear defenders, I'm sure she'll love it.

        That's the decision I'm currently faced with at my Gym in Farnham. I'm getting really fed up at the state of the spinning bikes in the class&nbsp;I go to a couple of times a week and the spinning bikes keep getting moved around the gym. You always feel like you don't belong when the whole gym sound system is taken over during a spinning class. The spinnings has always been an after thought.     The bikes aren't maintained properly and pedals and cranks have snapped, tension adjusters don't work (not all for me!).&nbsp;I actually wrote a letter of complaint earlier in the year when they got to a similar state and they were all fixed and had the promise of a proper maintenance contract.     Now I've seen the light! I had a look around the gym in Farnborough last night and it's a different world! The gym is 3 times the size of farnham, better equipped with air conditioning that works AND they've got a separate spinning studio. Farnham has a total of 6 bikes. Farnborough has at least 15. Apparently the lights go down, there's wind machines, disco lights and it's a really motivating class.     The downside is the cost. We currently pay &pound;69 a month at Farnham for a family membership. For that we get unlimited use of the gym, the pools, sauna, the fitness classes and the girls swimming lessons.     Farnborough costs &pound;76 per month for family membership but that excludes swimming lessons for the girls. You do however get the gym, the farnborough pool, fitness classes, sauna, steam room, kids play areas, aldershot Lido, the spinning studio ( Cyclone! ).     I'm not prepared to sacrifice the girls swimming lessons just because I've got a downer with Farnham gym at the moment so basically am I prepared to pay and extra &pound;40 a month for decent spinning classes .... hmmm. I'm looking at one more gym tonight to see what they have to offer.      watch this space

        I've just rolled out MS Outlook 2003 to 55 pcs with virtually no swearing or tantrums. I decided to investigate the automatic software deployment options that come with active directory and MS Windows Server 2000.     It took me about an hour to setup the silent and pre-configured installation script and then a few test machines to test the rollout. Made it all active last night and by 10am this morning all but a handful had the package already installed - cool!     Had a few teething problems that I'm sure I can sort out but it's definately the way to go.

      Weight this morning is  20st 5lbs  - my target for tomorrow mornings weigh in is 20st 6lbs. And thats after having an absolutely gorgeous "house burger" at a pub yesterday lunchtime. Strangely the chicken salad just didn't appeal to me.  Just got back from the cinema after taking Katie and the girls to see Shrek 2 - great film. Just as funny as the first with the gags on many levels including ones that luckily the kids don't get ;-). Stunning CGI again that pushes the bar even higher. Also saw a trailer for the next big CGI flik - "A Sharks Tale" which also looks pretty good.

      My hard drive that died last week is out of it's warranty. I'll have to wait before I replace that as we're trying to tighten the belts at the moment and could do without the extra expense.   Blow out the cobwebs   Seeing a friend of mine on Thursday evening to give them some advice on expanding their office network, I spent a little while last night planning what they'd need and how long it would take and it would be good to get my hands dirty again (all out of hours of course!  hello boss ) - I gave up doing this sort of thing in the past as it always ended up with phone calls while you're doing your day job. Thankfully with the advent of broadband and some pretty nifty remote control tools these issues become less and less of, well, an issue.

      Weigh day today, managed a slight recovery but still up on last week. 20st 8 1/4 lbs, up 1 1/4lbs since last week. Could have been much worse though.  I've had a good day today and will definately stick to my points every day this week. Target next week is 20st 6lbs.   And if it wasn't hard enough to motivate myself to exercise I've found out that one of the places I play badminton has put their prices up! it's now &pound;8.05 for an hours court hire. Rip Off Britain at it's finest.   Roger, Roger    urlLink Farnborough Air show  starts next monday which means there's lots of free displays all this week while they practice. We're quite lucky that we live far enough away from Farnborough to not be too bothered by traffic yet close enough to see a lot of the flying.

      Had a real shock when I weighed myself last night before bed - 20st 13 3/4lbs!! ouch. Where's that come from? I shouldn't be too surprised though, curry on Friday and then a Pizza yesterday.  I'm going to do everything I possibly can to ensure I hit 20st by the time we go on holiday in the middle of August. One of these things will be to open myself up to ridicule by putting my weight on here daily. I've got to do something, I just wish I had more willpower and had the ability to refuse a pizza or a curry.   This mornings weight: 20st 10 1/4lbs (3 1/2 lbs off overnight!) . Spookily, I had a note through the post from the local WeightWatchers meeting organiser asking if I'd like to come back and not pay any penalties for the time missed. I think I might although I can't help thinking I'm not getting much value for money. &pound;4.75 a week to get weighed, no meetings or anything and the women who take the money aren't the friendliest of people.  I'm also going to drop my daily points from 36 to 34. So far today I've had 7 points, that leaves 29 (out of 36) so if I can kick start this and just use 20 for the rest of the day I'll be happy. I also need to get back down the gym at the weekends for spinning and a workout on Saturdays and Sundays.

Had a few beers in the Hop Blossom and I can thoroughly recommend their "Summer Ale" and finished up with a very good curry in the Balti Hut.  Not quite sure how I managed it but during the usual rounds of bad jokes I ended up telling exactly the same joke as one of the other guys had only 5 minutes previous. I didn't remember him saying it so I must have either been at the bar or in the loo (well it's either that or the alzheimers has kicked in already!)   Well done McLaren!!   After a really bad start to the F1 season, McLaren have managed to get Kimi Raikkonen on pole position for tomorrows British Grand Prix - nice one!

      Huh?  Apparently this is going to be the next big thing to hit the racketsports arena. I love playing badminton and this caught my eye after reading about Maria Sharapova winning Wimbledon this year. Apprently she plays it too.   What is Speedminton?  Speedminton is a high-energy racquet sport combining the best dimensions of tennis, badminton and racquetball.  Speedminton can be played indoors, outdoors, even at night. It can be played following competitive rules, or simply as a volley game, both providing an excellent aerobic workout. The Speedminton racquet is generously oversized with string tension set to maximize the acceleration of the speeder off of the racquet face. The patented "speeders", much like a badminton shuttlecock, are where the magic of the game lies. Material innovations and the advanced aerodynamic shape create the rhythm and flow of the exchange. Volleys between players are low and fast. In Competitive Play, opponents position themselves in "speedcourts", boxes that are eighteen feet square and positioned forty-two feet apart. A tennis court can also be easily modified for competitive play. Players must demonstrate a consistency of skill and effort to maintain the pace of volleys.   Easy play can take place on the beach, in a park and event at night. A casual volley is easy to learn and not as difficult to master as the more competitive play, which is ultimately what makes the sport addictive. The learning curve is tight, so players see immediate results from their practice and quickly move from recreational players to extreme Speedminton enthusiasts.   Night play is the element that takes this activity into a whole new realm. There are three different speeder models available for the different methods of play; Fun Speeder, Match Speeder and Night Speeder. The Night Speeder comes with a glow stick that can be inserted into the Speeder cap. Nighttime play differentiates Speedminton from other racquet sports as well as almost all other sports and activities.    So it's a combination of all the best bits of Badminton, Tennis, Squash and Racquetball. I fancy having a go but can't find any one in the UK who stocks the sets. The cheapest place I've found is  urlLink here  but that's still quite steep.  Looks like a lot of fun. Read a bit more about it  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

My parents have now divorced and reached a settlement that seems to keep everyone happy. I've spoken to my Mum and both my sisters in the last few days for the first time in months and they all sound really well which is good. Both my Mum and Dad have met someone else that makes them happy and that's all that's important to me.  One of my sisters has now met someone and is also happy and the other one is much happier than she was a few months ago.

      We had a really good day yesterday for our 11th wedding anniversary.  Katies parents had the girls for the day (and night) and picked them up at about 10.30. The show didn't start until 2.30pm but Katie and I decided to make a day of it and got up to London with a few hours to spare.  The Northern line reminded me why a hate the London Underground with a passion. We were crammed in like sardines and decided to come off a stop early at Picadilly Circus and meander up to the Dominion Theatre at Tottenham Court Road.  We wandered through Chinatown and Soho and had an absolutely gorgeous sandwich at Pret-a-Manger and then did a quick mooch up and down Oxford Street (taking advantage of a rather good sale in HMV) and then up and down Tottenham Court Rd (and avoided spending any money).  Took our seats at about 2pm for the 2.30 showing of We Will Rock You and was completely mesmerised for the length of the show. Was a little disappointed that the audience didn't really hot up until after the interval but there was copious cheering and hand clapping most of the way through.  Nearly all of the main cast had amazing voices and really did justice to the array of Queen hits they were singing. There is a review of yesterdays show  urlLink here:    A couple of times the music rose to such a crecendo that it literally sent goosebumps down my back. I definately would go and see it again given the chance.  When we came out of the theatre we avoided all the rickshaw's waiting to ripoff an unsespecting tourist and headed for the Virgin Megastore as I wanted to pick up a copy of the Queen at Wembley '86 DVD for a bit of nostalgia.  After the earlier experience with the tube we decided to take a slow walk back to Waterloo and wandered through Leicester Sqaure, Trafalgar Square, Soho Square, Chinatown (again), Russell Square, Horseguards Parade and then across the Thames to Waterloo. It took a little longer than it probably should have as we didn't always know exactly where we were.  We said how sad it was that we didn't know our capital city very well.  As the queues were very short we decided to take advantage of the clear evening and take a "flight" in the  urlLink London Eye.  This really has to be experienced. The 30 minutes it takes to complete 1 revolutions goes so quickly as the scenery and sights are amazing.  After a pleasant train journey back (and a quick doze) we finished the evening off with a meal out at our local curry house, The Gulshan. Excellent food as usual rounded off an excellent day.  I just need to fast today for my weigh in tomorrow - oops.

      I must be due for some by now. I've been married for 11 years tomorrow, I should at least be entitled to parole.  Seriously, I don't regret a single minute of it. Katie's great, we balance each other perfectly. She picks me up when I'm down and vice versa (although she's so bubbly that's not very often). Sure we argue, who doesn't but we always put it behind us and move on. I'm really lucky to have found someone that would have me. It's strange but as we're getting older I find Katie more and more  annoying , no appealing :-) and attractive. We seem to be getting closer.  We've got 2 great kids and I don't regret starting a family early at all. Given the chance, I may have done some things differently but I have no regrets whatsoever. It's been bloody hard work though. Raising children is harder than anything you've done before but it is also the most satisfying feeling knowing that you've done your best by them.  We've got a great circle of friends who we've know for as long as we've been together. I can't help feeling that Katie's scared off some of my older friends but hey ho! We have our share of problems but deal with them as best we can. Katie was a great help and support to me last year during my anxiety attacks and I'm not sure she really knows how much I appreciate her and her support and care.  Katie, Happy Anniversary, I Love You Tons (I know I don't say it enough) and here's to another 11 years. xxx   We Will We Will Rock You!!   We're going up to London tomorrow to see  urlLink We Will Rock You  at the Dominion Theatre. Should be good, I'm really looking forward to it as Queen are my favourite band and I know all the music really well. There's nothing quite like being in an audience when Radio Ga Ga is being pumped out. We were lucky enough to go to the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992 (got tickets #80 & 81 out of 70,000+ that sold out in 30 minutes or so!)

      Weather has been great this weekend and I've been sticking to my diet really well. Weight yesterday morning was 19st 13lbs and todays was 19st 12 3/4lbs. Went on a nice bike ride yesterday evening. Ended up cycling further than planned. I cycled to Hook along the main road and then came back along the Basingstoke canal. The way there was 10 miles and the way back was 18 miles. Still, I managed to burn off 2700 calories in the process.  We need a rain shower or thunderstorm as it's really muggy at the moment.

      Had a couple of anxiety "twinges" today worrying about work needlessly. I'm not sure why I still do this because I know they guys in the technical department can look after things. A few deep breaths each time seemed to push it away again. Was planning on switching the tablets to every 3 days this week but may put that off until after the holiday. There's no point making myself needlessly worry while I'm on holiday.   It's so easy to screw up an email   I was a bit harsh with an email I wrote before I left work on Wednesday due to a minor annoyance and was really out of order in what I put. I should know by now if something has made you angry, the email can wait for 24 hours so you can write something less emotional or better still discuss it face to face.

      Went to  urlLink Marwell Zoo  today and I think the weather forecasters got the days mixed up. Pretty much wall to wall sunshine.  I haven't been there since about 1998 when Rhian couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 and had forgotten just how large and spread out the zoo is. We must have walked a good few miles today. Had a really good day and the girls absolutely loved it. It puts everything into perspective when you see the huge smile on their faces when they're seeing something they don't normally see and knowing that you've done that for them.  I feel like the last 2 days have been really well spent and not wasted as is the normal temptation during days off.

      I think I was quite lucky following my slip in the bathroom on Sunday. I feel fine now apart from a dull ache in my lower back still. It's much better than it was on Monday.  Weight this morning was 20st 1lb. Good job I'd lost some weight as I wouldn't have been able to go on any of the flumes at the aquadrome today as they had a weight limit of 21st. That's of course if they hadn't of shut it :-) I'm also quite pleased that as well as losing nearly 3 stones so far, my waist size has come down by 4 inches as well. Katie bought me some shorts today that were a 40" waist. I was a bit sceptical at first but am pleased to say they fitted fine.

      Well you know the rest.  Had the day off today and took Rhian and Kira to  urlLink West Wittering Beach . Weather forecast was supposed to be 26 degrees and wall to wall sunshine according to yesterdays BBC weather site. No sign of the sun this morning, however it was very warm and very muggy. Got down there at about 9.30am and it was nice and quiet. Had a great couple of hours, we all went swimming, girls made sandcastles, I even got chance to catch a few rays. It's great now that they're that little bit older and you don't have to watch them every second. They also play really well together. One thing I was really pleased to see there were free  urlLink Child Safe  wrist bands. I think it's a great idea. You write your mobile number on the band and then fasten it around the childs wrist and if they get lost or wander off there's no frantic searching of the beach. It looks like you can actually join and register your family information and get given an ID number so they have all of your details.   The marvels of the Basingstoke Power supply   I've never known a town to have as many power cuts as they do in Basingstoke, where I work. We took the girls to the new  urlLink Aquadrome  this afternoon and got there at about 4.30pm. We'd been in the water for about 10 minutes playing in to river rapids when the power went out. They had no backup power and had no choice but to shut the pool. Girls were very disappointed but took it very well, we were given free passes to all go back another day.  Went to Pizza Piazza in Farnham for dinner instead.

      Spent the day working from home today in an effort to not aggrevate my back any more than necessary. Did my stretching every 30 minutes or so to stop it seizing up completely.  Went spinning again this evening which helps and partway through I had a stabbing pain in my back and then nothing. I think the nerve must no longer be trapped, if that's possible. It feels much free-er now and is just a bit stiff. Feels like I've been thumped in the back but nowhere near as bad as it was.

      Just got back home from a wonderful afternoon spent at the local A&E centre. My back was getting progressivly worse as the morning went on and I decided to play it safe and get it checked out to confirm I hadn't done any serious damage.  The outcome after many hours waiting was that I've trapped a nerve and am getting muscle spasms up the middle of my back. Lots of painkillers and plenty of movement required.Going to go spinning tonight as an extra session and see if I can loosen it up at all. The last thing I want next week when we go on holiday is to be hobbling around like an 80 year old.

        Must have had complete brain fade yesterday as I munched my way through barbecue leftovers without even thinking of my diet. Paid for it this morning with a weigh in of 20st 4 1/2 lbs. How stupid can you get especially when I was sooo close yesterday morning. That gives me exactly 1 week to lose that 4 1/2lbs. I'm not going to do this with diet alone so a few more trips to gym are in order.      Bit more damage than I first thought      As the day went on yesterday I started to ache all over from my slip in the bathroom (which Katie thought was hilarious by the way). My right elbow is very sore and I pulled something in my left calf. Worst of all my back is killing me, it's really sore all the way up to my shoulder blades. Hopefully it's just banged and bruised but I may have to get it looked at if it keeps getting worse.

      Had my Mum and Sisters over for a barbecue yesterday afternoon. We wanted to get them all together as it was one of my sisters birthday last sunday and it was my niece's birthday recently as well. I was a little apprehensive as there was apparently tension between my Mum and my younger sister following an eventful week in Menorca recently.  All things considered I think it went very well. We had glorious weather and plenty of food.  There was one thing that bugged me, and that was the tension between my Mum and the younger of my 2 sisters. I think the biggest problem members of my family have is not saying what's on their mind for fear of upsetting someone. This in turn just builds resentment that bubbles under the surface waiting for a catalyst to let it out in a big row. That's one thing I try to do now is say what I'm thinking. It may upset someone but at least I'm being honest with them. People can then deal with what I have to say and then move on, Keeping quiet is not an option as I've seen the damage that can do long term.

      For the first time in a  very  long time I stepped on the scales and clocked a very respectable 19st 13 3/4lbs. Admittedly this was right after this mornings spinning class and its the weigh in tomorrow that counts but I'm pleased.  Had a bit of a shock just now. We've got a nice powerful thermostatic shower but it has a very narrow temperature range and normally gets adjusted in the winter to boost the hot water and adjusted in the summer to allow for slightly cooler showers. I hopped out of the shower just now to go to the airing cupboard to reduce the hot water feed in the shower pump and as I went back into the bathroom I was reminded why vinyl flooring and wet feet are a very bad mix.  Next thing I knew I was on the floor. I lay there for about 10 seconds just getting my bearings and checking I hadn't hit or damaged anything. My head was about an inch from the door frame. Luckily all I did was bang my elbow which is still tingling a bit now. Good job I didn't do anything serious as Katie is at a party with the girls facepainting.
