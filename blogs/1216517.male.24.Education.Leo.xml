      Apparently i've got a sportswriting job at the  urlLink antelope valley press .  It should start within 2 weeks.  For now I'm reading  urlLink White Noise  by Don DeLillo.  It's always good to sooth the soul with a little postmodernism while you're unemployed.  i don't really know what i think about the world getting ready to be blown up.  it's cool i guess.  i've been playing bocce ball in my yard quite a bit, keeps my mind off nuclear attacks.  i like microwaves.

      i've worked 3 days so far.  cool.  it's extremely laidback in there.  it's a 9-man staff and i'm number 9 in the  urlLink avpress  sports dept power rankings.  that's cool though.   Friday I have my first writing assignment.  word.  i want to go to thailand.  i read  urlLink the beach   and it made me want to globe hop again.  i miss europe.  southeast asia is next on my list.  i still have the travelling bug.  probably always will.  i'm hungry.  i want a pizza.  we just rented a baseball video game.  so we're occupied for a while.  i'm thinking about moving up to the "av".  that's antelope valley for those of you not in the know.  it's about an hour and a half drive each way.  i can almost deal with that.  There's no traffic really, but its an 80 mile trip each way and considering that  urlLink gas  is $2.15 a gallon at best, it's about $15 bucks a day.  boo.  rained hard yesterday.  my car was hyro-planeing it on the 5.  woo hoo.  elliot smith soothed my soul during the commute.  as did the wonderful  urlLink bob dylan , who's music is currently featured in a victoria secret commercial.  funny.  i'm hungry.    urlLink tigers  will be 2003 world series champs.

      WHEN I'M 64  I knew I had something important to say a minute ago, but now it's just dust in the wind, dude.  Oh, I'm thinking again about joining the  urlLink Peace Corps   sometime.  I'm into that.  I know it's a bit caught-up-in-the-moment, but I'm interested in helping out the people of Iraq.  We'll see what becomes of all this.  I took this  urlLink Political Compass Test .  It's pretty interesting.  I guess I'm fairly economically liberal and a moderate ideogically.  Which I guess would place me as a centrist republican or possibly moderate democrat.  Although i don't respect many democrats outside of Lieberman.  My numbers for the test were Eco: -5.25;  Auth/Lib: -0.87, if anybody actually cares.  I saw "The Pianist" today.  I recommend to everybody.  Pretty intense.  Interesting the omission of any sort of religious themes though.  While on the topic, I think it's about time Palestine became an independant state.  No, need to elaborate.  Count the death toll.    Anyway, ever wonder what you'll look like when you're old?  Like, really old.  Wrinkly and stuff.  I know it's a gradual think, but i have the feeling I'll wake up one day an look really old.  You hear those stories of 85-year olds that run marathons and swim for miles.  I think I'll be lucky if I can wipe myself at 85.  Anyway, back to the wrinkles.  Some people try to fight it.  Example A) Elizabeth Taylor.  As much as I don't really want to be old, People that are old and can't accept it are about as bad as it gets.  5 million plastic surgeries.  Welcome to L.A.  Actually, I wouldn't mind being the old man on the porch smoking my pipe, shouting as passersby.  Ha.  Well, maybe for just a day that'd be cool.  But think about it.  Senior Discounts anyone?  Free Coffee?  Um...Shuffleboard.  Bingo.  Prune Juice.  Viagra.  Hey, being old isn't so bad afterall.  Well, I'll deal with all this later.  Right now I'm in such prime form it's ridiculous.  I'm a stallion.  I make myself weep sometimes.  and that leads me to the next topic, pest control.  I saw a rat one time.  It smiled at me and I didn't rally know what to do.  So i left the room and drank a coke.  I'll never forget that rat.

      DON'T DRINK THE WATER I guess   urlLink Christina Aguilera  was at  urlLink the guys  show last night.  That's pretty fun.  Mike wanted to make out with her.  Good thing I wasn't at the show, cuz she'd have been all over me, and then the  urlLink Secret Service  who have gotten involved and that would have been a big mess.  I just want things to go smoothly for the guy.  The last thing they want it me making a big disturbance at one of their shows.  It's hard though, because I'm in the business of disturbance.  The recent events in the world remind me of an incident in particular:  I was in   urlLink Amman, Jordan  in '95 with  urlLink TMI .  We had just been in the West Bank.  While there we filled up water bottles with water from the Jordan River to take home.  In Amman, we were all hanging out in a room on the 7th floor of this hotel.  I was thirsty and took a sip of water from what i thought was a bottle of fresh sping water.  It wasn't.  It was from the muddy Jordan.  Me , being the jokester I am, ran to the window stuck my head out, and made a gagging noise.  Well, there was some kind of street vendor down that apparently thought i was gagging at him.  He shouted something back at me in Arabic.  I thought that was really funny so i gagged at him again, then i gathered everybody in the room to watch and I gagged at him a 3rd time.   Well, now looking back on the situation 8 years later, I can honestly say that there are worse things that Americans can do to Arabs than gag at them, but i can't think of any right now. Oh, the aftermath of the story is that I am THE major impediment for US-Arab relations for the past decade.  I claim responsibility.  I won't deny it.  But it doesn't bother me.  You would have done the same thing if you drank the water.

      RABBITS AND THE AV  I was gonna try and get a map of where i'm going to live and put it here, but i'm not smart enought to do that.  Just look up lancaster, ca on  urlLink mapquest .  I think I'm fairly close to Sequoia National Park.  I'll have to check that out. Moving again...it's such an ordeal.  It's hard to think of anything i hate more.  and yet, there's this excitement that comes along with it.  Anything new has that expectant thill of the unknown, for a little while at least.  My big thing used to be pets.  I ran through 'em by the dozens when i was younger.  And even more recently with a rabbit named sanchez.  The story of sanchez begins as thus: I asked  urlLink matt maust   to catch a few pints with me.  Afterwards we headed over to the mall to walk off our beverages andit was then that i thought it would be a good idea to purchase a rabbit.  For a while, sanchez was all the rage.  Then, a detriation began.  First, i let her hop the yard freely.  Then she ran away.  And that's the story of sanchez.  Keith, in particular, objected to my treatment of sanchez.  He said that a rabbit needs food and water.  Now that's neither here nor there so i won't debate such a petty arguement.  But i will admit there was a steep decline in pure rabbit affection from the moment i purchased sanchez.  There was the inital excitement, then the waning emotion, then neglect, and eventually the release.  Whoa.  Hold on.  Am i talking about a rabbit or my female relationship trends?  And i will be the first to answer:  that is neither here nor there and i am in fact discussing a hare.  So to rapidly transition to a less abrasive subject and to get back to the task at hand...Yes, i am excited and dreading this move to the valley where the antelope roam freely and the lion lies with the lamb.  Although...if that's what it's like, it can't be half bad, hey?

      THE LAST 10 MONTHS AND ALL IS WELL...  well, what do you know.  it's 10 months, to the day, since I graduated.  how did that that much time pass?  let's recap.  >JUNE, JULY, 1st 1/2 of AUGUST-- worked at  urlLink Mcmaster-Hell  with billy >2nd 1/2 of AUGUST--Trevor's wedding.  Michigan visit. >SEPT & OCT-- Europa con william >1st 1/2 of NOV--Mich visit >2nd half of NOV--Fun california >DEC--unemployed california >JAN--temp job at  urlLink Grainger  (a mcmaster-hell rip-off) >FEB & 1st 1/2 of MARCH--unemployed cali part duex >2nd 1/2 of MARCH--sportswriter darren  and that's the past 10 months.  i guess that's how i got here.  i think i have this fear that time is gonna pass me by.  that someday i'll looke back and say, "today it's been exactly 10 years since i graduated from college.  Now how did i get here?  hmm... let's see...2007?  huh?  what the hell did i do that year?"  see that's my fear.  i think my dream job right now is to be a freelance reporter.  too much war coverage i guess, but i'll give a nod to the email i just recieved from billy.  i need some travel, man.  it's killing me staying in one place.  the funny think is that i just went to  urlLink baja  less than a month ago.  but i've got this bug that's driving me to keep moving.  i love it.  i see these journalists.  and i think, "yeah!  i wanna do THAT."  'course i've gotta take it all with a grain of preverbial salt because i've wanted to be many a thing in my day.  speaking of... i just found out that my job is an  urlLink oxymoron .  funny.  this furthers my desire to get out to the battlefield among the whizzing bullets.

      well, sometimes the drive is long and the stars start to speak to me, none too easily, mind you.  whether it's the night, or the mood, or a stillness, or a breeze in the all-too-california trees, there's someting that reminds me of a place i've been before.  i don't know if it's down the road or next door, but it's a comfortable place that is a needed break from this hurricane mind storm that's been hanging around.  i try not to venture downtown among whoknowswhat and the shops and stores and nooks and crannies frequented by freaks and someone's grandma.  and it's dirty down there.  when i walk in, everybody stares and me like i got something to say.  "why me?!"  i shout.  "what did i do to deserve all this attention?"  i didn't even ask for it....well, i did.  when i was six.  i made a promise to God and He won't let me give it up, even though i've forgotten what it is.   but i've got a hint.  it's like the lyrics to an all-too-familiar song, where you've forgotten all the words and the name of the band, but you still know that if you heard it on the radio, you'd get emotional.  that's the rand mcnally of my life right now.  that's the rest area in topeka that i'm stuck at, my friends.  there are too many familiar faces among the truckers that could be you or you or me.  but i don't drive a truck down a lonesome road.  or i suppose maybe i do.  it's slow.  and it gets me nowhere.  and the faster i drive the slower i go.  so maybe someday ill give up driving altogether.  i'll just park it on the side of the road, walk out in a field and wait for stormy weather.  because when that lightning lights up the sky, i know where it came from.  no, fortunatly wasn't from my bedroom, but you're not too far off.

      i've been consumed by this war.  it's all pretty overwhelming.  i strongly support the liberation of the iraqi people.   today was a pretty sad day for the U.S.  Something like 10 soldiers taken as P.O.W.'s.  There are some pretty gruesome pictures of abuse to them. Through it all though, I wish I was over there fighting.  I'd be proud to serve and protect my country and take down Sadaam. none of the anti-war arguements seem valid to me.  sure, death and casulities are never good, but to see the images or iraqi's cheering and ripping down Sadaam's picture...that gives me goosebumps.  oh, and if you want and interesting view on current events, check out the  urlLink drudge report  if you haven't already.  it's got stuff like this...  "F—k Saddam. We’re taking him out," said President George W. Bush in March 2002, after poking his head into the office of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, TIME reports.  funny.

      LOSE WEIGHT.  TAKE A NAP.  I worked out today.  I don't recommend it.  It takes too much effort.  I'd rather eat fried chicken than run on a dumb treadmill.  I haven't worked out in quite a while.  My apartment complex has a workout room so I thought I'd give it a try.  I threw up.  Working out is pretty dumb.  There's gotta be an easier way to get in shape.  Just a sec, i'll check....  ...Yep.  Here ya go...I love the Internet.  urlLink The 30 Easiest Ways to Burn More Calories    Here are a few of my favorites:  3. Do something inspiring. A cheap incentive is sticking a picture of a dress you'd really love to wear where it will motivate you. For those with a wild side, get your belly button pierced.   5. Sleep for weight loss. Getting enough sleep does more than keep you from eating for energy. The University of Chicago recently found that metabolism rises 40% when you get enough sleep.   10. Snack right. A hard candy is only about 20 calories and can last up to twenty minutes. A 400-calorie ice cream cone never lasts more than ten minutes. Try these tasty treats that are less than 150 calories: two Oreo cookies, a McDonald's Ice Cream Cone, a half cup of Italian Ice, a Starbucks Frappuccino Ice Cream Bar, Jell-o with whipped cream, angel food cake with strawberries, a Fudgsicle.  11. Listen to feel-good music when you have the urge to binge. Researchers have found that it activates the same feel-good center of the brain that eating your favorite foods does.   15. Get out. Try to spend twenty minutes a day sitting outside or taking a walk or, at the very least, sit by a sunny window. Sunlight helps to control food cravings.   17. Get minty fresh. Brush your teeth and tongue with the best-tasting toothpaste you can find. Use mouthwash and breath mints to trick your taste buds.   21. Take the stairs instead of the elevator.   22. Dance in your car. While you're stuck in traffic, work your abs. Concentrate on your rib cage -- pretend you're an exotic dancer and swirl around. Not only will you see your waist whittle and your abs harden, you'll release lower back tension.   24. Work your butt. When you're in the car or standing in line, contract your buttocks for fifteen second intervals. Tighten your muscles as you breathe in and then breathe out and release. It not only firms your butt, but relieves stress.   25. Act goofy. Even if you're too busy for the gym, you can still do cardio. Put on a pair of socks and slide around the house like a skater. You'll burn 150 calories in just ten minutes.   27. Take two steps at a time when you climb stairs. Skipping a step will force your leg and buttocks muscles to extend and work harder. Plus, this movement releases endorphins that will make you feel great!   Who knew that snacking, sleeping, brushing your teeth, a being dumb helps you loose weight.  Incredible.     And  urlLink this ?  This is just funny.    Tigers Somehow 0-8 Before Season Even Starts  Through a bizzare set of circumstances, the Detroit Tigers have somehow managed to reach Opening Day with a losing record, even though no games have been played. The 0-8 Tigers begin the 2003 season 8 games out of first place, trailing the Royals, Twins, White Sox, and Indians, who all share 0-0 records.  "I have no idea how this happened," said new manager Alan Trammell, who is taking over a team that finished 55-106 last season. "I thought it would take at least a week for us to lose 8 games."  Theories suggest that this year's Tigers are so horrible that even the laws of science couldn't hide their ineptitude.  "Usually, a team can't lose games that haven't been played," said Michigan State University physicist Dr. Liam Johannson. "But I believe that somehow, the Tigers' total lack of baseball skill has managed to create what I call a 'Vortex of Sh*ttiness' in the time-space continuum, and they're drawing these losses from a pocket dimension. It's also possible that some of last year's losses carried over into this season via a subspace wormhole. But while we continue our pursuit of the answers, one fact remains undeniable -- their on-field bungling somehow transcends physics, mathematics, and the rest of the known universe."  Some believe the reality-defying losses are the results of front office mismanagement, an accusation that team officials deny.  "I'm utterly shocked at these accusations," said team president/excessive drooler Dave Dombrowski. "We made some great moves last year, getting rid of talentless hacks like Mark Redman, Jeff Weaver, and Juan Acevedo, and bringing in...well, nobody in particular...but still, addition by subtraction, right?  "And we've brought up some good youngsters," added Dombrowski. "There are some great kids on the roster, like...whats-his-name...and...the other one. Did I mention that we have a nice, fairly-new stadium?"  Regardless of the reasons behind the team's 0-8 pre-start, Dombrowski has vowed to take up the issue with MLB. "Okay, maybe we're not a top contender this year, but still, can't they somehow fix this? I mean, there's no way we're as bad as the Devil Rays."   When reminded that the Tigers and Devil Rays finished with identical records last season, and that the Devil Rays have taken several steps to improve their ballclub this year, Dombrowski produced a revolver and proceeded to shoot himself in the foot.   However, despite Dombrowski's protests, the commissioner's office stated there will be no investigation. "I'm sorry, but those losses are on the record," said commissioner/made man Bud Selig. "This is an unfortunate occurrence, to be sure. If this happened to the Yankees, or the Phillies, or even the Marlins, we would take the necessary steps to correct the problem. But come on, it's the friggin' Tigers. No one really gives a rat's *ss about them anyway, so let's just move on."  Tigers fans were busy looking forward to the 2007 season and were unavailable for comment.

      So I'm living in Antelope Valley now.  It's not too bad.  Dollar theaters.  Target.  Wal-mart.  What else do you need?   I've eaten chili dogs the past few days and my  urlLink insides  don't approve.  Bad dining decisions on my part.  Not as bad as eating water buffalo testicles when I was in Thailand, but it's bad nonetheless.

      DON'T WORRY MA, I'M ONLY IN LAKE BLED  I ate at  urlLink Sizzler  today.  For the first time ever.  If you've never eaten there before, let me tell you, you are missing out.  Steak?  Savory.  Salad Bar?  All-you-can-eat.  Need I say more?  The steak was damn good too mind you.  Excellent herb and spices along with a great baked potato.  Yum.  I could just throw it up and eat it all over again. Well, all this steak talk brings me back to the Great Slovenia Ass Steak I enjoyed in  urlLink Lake Bled   this past October.  You can even consult William on this one if you're so inclined.  Now, the proper name for the meal was "Rump Steak," but we prefered "ass steak" amongst ourselves.  It was a humongous serving of meat.  Filled up the plate.  I had 3 of them during my stay there.  So good.  So savory.  Also in this wonderful place I drank the  urlLink best beer in the world .  The Original Budweiser from the Czech Republic.  Very very good.   Overall, one of the best meals I've ever had.  If anybody has any good meal stories, send them my way.  I'm always in the market for the low down on good food. The Bled experience as a whole was great.  We stumbled upon the  urlLink World Bartending Championship .  Hiked through this incredibly beautiful gorge.  I stayed in Bled of 5 days, that's the longest I stayed at any one single place in Europe.  Hung out with Australians and Brits along with whoever else cruised by.  I was beginning to get in the rythem of things and at the end it was very diffcult to leave.  It was a great place.  It treated me good.

      THE DESERT OWNS US ALL I was supposed to cover this high school all-star soccer game yesterday, but I ended up in the desert, way out in the middle of nowhere.  I got there about half and hour late, but it was all good.  Here's the result of it all...  um, nevermind,  it's not on the website.  maybe tomorrow.  Anyhow, I get lost all the time.  I think It's a chronic problem for me. I eventually get to where I'm going, but it takes a while.  No matter what, I can usually be counted on to get lost at some point in any journey I take.  I thought  urlLink this  might help.  But then I came across the website  urlLink Dealing with Dementia: Help for Relatives, Friends and Caregivers .  Here's what it says:  Symptoms of Dementia  *	Marked Loss of Memory for Recent Events -Losing items -Getting Lost in ‘familiar’ Places -Missing Appointments  *	Loss of Ability For Abstract Thought, Planning And Doing Complex Tasks -Trouble with Cooking, Paying Bills, Driving -Can’t Understand Books, Movies or News Items  *	Difficulty Finding Common Words And Names -Substitution of Approximate Phrases ("Where is the thing for sweeping?" for ‘broom’) -Misidentifying People (Confusing sister with [deceased] mother) -Use of "Empty Phrases" ("You know", "That thing")  *	Difficulty Inhibiting Behavior -Impulsivity, ‘Thoughtless’ Comments, Socially Inappropriate Behaviors  I'd say that's pretty much me to a "T".  Well, at least that's one mystery solved.

      LIBERATE THIS  It's really moving to see the pictures from Iraq.  Mosaics of Saddam set on fire, statues toppled, posters ripped.  It's like the Berlin Wall falling.  It's really a historic event.  But there's actually another reason I'm interested in the events in Iraq.  Take a look at this article.  It's very intriguing...    urlLink Untapped potential in Iraq?    I saw some liberated Iraqi's happily bludgeoning Saddam posters and statues with sticks and other blunt objects. These guys looked like they had better swings than the players currently starting for Detroit. Many teams have tapped into talent in the Dominican Republic, Japan, etc. Detroit should be the first to scout talent in post-Saddam Iraq. These guys have heart.  Looters showed foot speed that would rank them right up there with Alex Sanchez, Luis Castillo and Ichiro Suzuki in stolen bases. Shiites will be willing to play through minor injuries, since they are accustomed to everyday torture by the minions of the former Saddam Hussein regime. Playing through a torn ACL will be nothing compared to being dipped in chemical baths or flogged with chains.  The only way to rebuild this franchise is to cut ties with overpaid flunkies like Craig Paquette, Dean Palmer and Bobby Higginson and fill these holes with cheap, young talent. Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Umm Qasr are overflowing with youngsters willing to play for $200,000 a year while laying in all on the line. A new lineup stocked with Iraqi's would appeal to the large Middle Eastern population residing in Detroit and viewership of Tigers' games around the world would skyrocket. Maybe Tiger management could even coerce Al Jazeera to broadcast the games live.  Every year Pakistan manages to put together one of the best cricket teams in the world, so I think it would be easy to "discover" some diamonds in the rough in other Middle Eastern countries like Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The tiny country of Qatar is a hotbed for pitching talent. Just ask Mike Maroth - he'll tell you Doha is where he developed his best pitch, the cutter!

      Here's my 4th article   urlLink Bulldogs maul Eagles with 24-run output  This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Thursday, April 10, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - Before Lancaster baseball fans had time to sit down at Wednesday's game, Highland had already put the game out of reach.  The quick-start Bulldogs put 13 consecutive men on base to begin the game. They went on to trounce the Eagles 24-9 in a game shortened to five innings by the 10-run rule.  Highland scored 11 runs before Lancaster recorded the first out of the ball game.  "I've never seen something like that in my life," said Lancaster head coach Doug Martin. "They hit everything we threw up there. They hit it hard and to the right spots. They did exactly what they needed to do."  Everyone in the Bulldogs starting lineup had at least one hit.  "This was the first game where the entire lineup produced," said Highland head coach Todd Zucker. "It's a confidence boost."  Tom Sneden, Casey Hefler, and Ryan Cowen each drove in four runs for the Bulldogs in the first inning. Cowen had a home run in the inning.  Highland pitcher John Chavez helped his own cause with a perfect day at the plate with four hits in four at bats.  In the fifth inning, the Bulldogs walked six Eagles batters.  Lancaster's Josh White made them pay with a monster grand slam to center field, although it was not nearly enough for the Eagles.  Despite the convincing win, Zucker looks ahead.  "We're not going to score 20 runs every game," said Zucker. "We're not this kind of team. Everything has been close for us this year. We have a big game coming up with Quartz Hill. We're trying to gear up for that."   Things got tense in the fourth when Highland, ahead 16-0, pulled a double-steal on Lancaster.  "It's unwritten baseball protocol that you don't steal when you're up by that much. It was frustrating," Martin said. "[Zucker and I] are friends off the field so that kind of surprised me. But once you step on the field, it's a whole different thing."  Apparently, Zucker was repaying a debt from last season.  "Lancaster destroyed us last year," said Zucker. "Now we're even."  After the Highland pulled the double-steal, Lancaster pitcher James Truitt drilled Highland batter Luke Organ with his next pitch.   Truitt was promptly taken out of the game. The umpire warned both benches.  "Lancaster has very intense coaches. They're very competitive," said Zucker. "Lancaster is going to come out angry next time we play them. We have to be ready."   Highland 24, Lancaster 9   Highland (15)01 53 - 24 23 1  Lancaster (0)02 07 - 9 4 3  Phipps, Truitt, and Lane. Chavez, Velasco, Elam, Tepper, and Rico. WP- Chavez.

I liked it when the pitcher drilled the batter after the double steal.  I can sympathize when a team is getting beaten that badly.  It reminds me of my days as a ballplayer at good old Burr Oak High.  We were bad.  Something like 1-33 one season and 3-32 the next.  It was terrible.  We would just get murdered.  22-3, 19-7, 26-5, were all common scores in my baseball career.  So I know what these guys are going though.   And that's why I like the Detroit Tigers.  They remind me of my childhood.

      I haven't quite figured out the AV.  It's filled with Yuppies from LA that moved out there because it's cheaper.  You've got the rednecks.  And the people that hate it here and want to leave.  It's  nice mix.  There's one thing they all have in common:  They're all terrible drivers.   They poke the noses of their cars out in traffic, drive 10 mph below the limit, swerve.  It's good times.  The Tigers need to win.  They are 0-7.    I used to think Jim Rome was cool.   urlLink Now  I hate him.  He is number one on my worse person ever list.  Well above Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Hitler, Stalin, Saddam and all female "commedians."  Anyone that likes Rome is dumb.

      STUPID CONSUMER  I'm a sucker for good advertisement.  For instance, Jack-in-the-box is the king of funny commerials so whatever they're pushing, I'm buying.  I just got around to trying the Fish and Big Chips ("what you blokes call 'fish'  HA!) and the  urlLink Philly Cheesesteak  ('Yo, Jackie!  I soaked up Philly like a sponge' HA HA!)  both were yum.  I highly recommend both.   They're high quality for the fast food world.  And, i know i'm slacking, but i haven't savored the sweetness of the  urlLink Chipopitelote  yet.  It's next on my list. Yeah, what's up?  Jack-in-the-box is good, so is In N Out.  But McDonald, McDonald's is the best...  urlLink FOR ME TO POOP ON!!! .  Anyways, it goes back to the commercials.  I love a good commercial.  The commercials are my favorite part of the superbowl.  This past game we wrote down the ones we liked, so we could buy the product.  Bud Light was checked 4 or 5 times, too bad it sucks.  I think my favorite was the  urlLink  one where the naked dude ran all over the soccer field .  Now that was funny!   If it's funny, I'll buy it.   The guy working at Jack-in-the-Box was funny.  My meal was $5.32 and he said, "that will be five-hundred and thirty two."  then he said, "Here art thou cup.  That's Shakespeare.  I learned that when I was at Juliard."  He was a big Dip Cheese. I loved it.

      WEATHER IN THE A.V.   Here's my 3rd article.    urlLink Desert 11, AVC 2   This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Saturday, April 5, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - The sophomores on the Antelope Valley College softball team played their last home game on Friday. Despite the cold and the rain, it was supposed to be a fond farewell.   College of the Desert had a different idea.  The Roadrunners dominated the Marauders, raining down 11 runs on nine base hits, for an 11-2 win cut to six innings due to the mercy rule.  This loss drops the Marauders to 8-3 in Foothill Conference action and 14-24 overall, while the win improves the first-place Roadrunners to 11-0 in conference and 32-2 overall.  AVC is still in second place in the Foothill, but their hopes of overtaking the first-place Roadrunners are all but dashed.   The Marauders need a second-place finish in the conference to earn a spot to the Southern California regional playoffs.   "We need to focus on what's ahead," AVC co-coach Becky MacQuarrie said. "We need to put this game behind us and stay on track. Right now our goal is second place to make it to regionals."  College of the Desert first baseman Vanessa Martinez led the Roadrunner attack with three doubles, driving in three runs. She shone defensively as well.   In the bottom of the fifth inning, she made an over-the-shoulder diving catch on a pop fly to shallow right field.  College of the Desert pitcher Vanessa Rodriguez, shut out the Marauders through five innings.   AVC scored two runs in the bottom of the sixth on a run-scoring single by Liz Brandt, but the comeback came too late. The Roadrunners had driven five runs across the plate in the top of the sixth. The game was ended by the mercy rule.  "We really expected better hitting and better fielding coming into this game," said AVC coach Becky MacQuarrie.  "You've got to give them credit," said AVC co-coach Cindy Vargas. "They've got a great pitcher. She has those kind of stats for a reason."   Desert 11, AVC 2   Desert	203015 - 2 7 5  AVC	000002 - 11 9 1  Ricker, McDonald, and Culotta. Rodriguez. WPú-Rodriguez(D). LP-Ricker(AVC). 3B-Damico (D). Oakley (D). Rodriguez (D). 2B-Martinez 3 (D).

Here's the forcast for AV:  urlLink Remainder of this afternoon and tonight:	Mostly clear. Breezy. lows in the 30s. West winds 20 to 30 mph  I couldn't feel my hands after sitting in the chilling rain for 2 hours with only a thin sweatshirt.  I could barely take notes when I interviewed the coachs because my hand couldn't grip the pen.  It sucked.  I couldn't feel my face either.  i've been spoiled by L.A weather, man.  Antelope Valley is incredibly windy too.  Nonstop.  I don't get it.

That being said, here are some highlights from Mom's packages in the past: -Wal-Mart volleyball -Inflatable chair -Gummi worms, frogs, rats, spiders -Ashtray -Rotten banana -Empty Ben and Jerry's pint with the candy cows liked off and put in a ziploc -Every kind of candy ever. -Styrofoam Christian bird glider -Oakleys -Record player -Mucho Detroit Tigers merchandise -Faygo pop -Calendars -Sandals -Visors -and numerous other things  this package contained: -ostrich, alligator, and kangaroo jerky -hotwheels car -microwave pork rinds -bunny stickers  i like packages from mom.

      THE BEST  Well, it's almost time for me to quit my job an become a screenwriter, so here's my story:  A pro sports team gets wind of this amazing mascot at some podunk school in the South.  They send a scout.  He finds people going absolutely bonkers for this mascot.  He could be, dare I say, the best mascot in the world. The Scout brings the guy in the mascot suit (a college student) to the big city.  He impresses the brass and they sign him to a multi-million dollar contract.  Thus begins hype-central.  Mascot Dude gets on all the talk shows, magazine covers.  He is truly hyped to be the best mascot ever. The season begins and the mascot dude lives up to the hype, he is the best.  People go to games just to see him.  The team makes it to the championship.  It's the Biggest game of the season, of the dude's career.  He comes out pumped.  The crowd waits.  But he freezes.  Then comes to and runs out.  The team loses.  All kinds of critizism is thrown at dude. Next season he tries but he can't do anything funny.  His dances  fall flat, his somesaults, pranks.  He's released by the team.  He bounces around the minor leagues,  urlLink canadian leagues , european leagues.  No go. He walks off from the team in Budapest.  He heads to  urlLink Slovakia .  He wanders the country side, he hikes in the  urlLink mountains .  While mountain climbing, he finds an old box that contains a secret elixir with a note in Slovakian.  He discovers that it is a magic potion of Slovakian legend that when drank, makes the drinker "the best."  The best of what, no one knows.  No one has ever drank it before. Some of the Slovakian government and the Mafia find out about the discovery and try to steal it, but the dude leaves the country after joining up with a band of friendly gypsies.   He returns home and tells his friends about "the best" juice.  The dude desides to drink it.  Nothing happens.  The potion becomes a joke.  They sip it at parties sometimes.  Then one by one, he's friends discover they have developed odd amazing talents.  One guy is the best car parker ever.  another isthe best fingernail clipper, another is the best orange smoothie maker, another is the best  urlLink lawnmower .  and then,  well. I don't know really.  Let me think about it.  Sometime I'll post synopsises for "Sasquatch" and "The Crime of the Century" here too.  Until then, I'm going to work on my short shory from the perspective of a quarter.

      There was a movie on TV the other day:  urlLink Two Ninas .  It's funny because the main character has the same job as I do.  He's an Agate Clerk in the sports deptartment of a newspaper.  Of course he worked at the New York Post and I work at the Valley Press.  But that's neither here nor there. The main character is based on the life of the writer and director of the movie, who was actually an agate clerk in real life.  He stared at box scores all day like me.  He became disillusioned with his job after 17 months and quit it to go make a movie.  I won't comment on the similarities between myself and the main character (although one of the ninas is pretty close to my dream girl).  I'll just say that someday I'm planning to take some time off of work as well.  I think a decade off sounds about right to me.

      IS THERE A LIBRARY ON EASTER ISLAND?  I got a library card today.  I'm pretty excited.  I can read now.  In case you're in  urlLink New York ...  oh, here's some  urlLink pictures  of where I live.  The middle ones, not the cool ones.  I saw a special on the Discovery Channel about  urlLink Easter Island  the other day.  It was really interesting.  For those of you they don't know, Easter Island is the most remote populated island in the world.  It has hundreds of these giant statues everywhere.  It's pretty spooky.  Supposedly they're idols that watch over the island.  They're pretty impressive.  Some say Aliens made them, kinda like the Pyramid theory.  Anyways, they're really cool looking and interesting.  If you know what's good for you, you'll check out the website.  It's incredibly informative.  I don't know if the have libraries there though.

      The war in Iraq has kept me glued to the TV, but not for the reason you way think. I am riveted by a women known as  urlLink Ms. Shock and Awe , Jennifer Eccleston, reporter for Fox News, or as I like to call her, Jen Ecc. 	  The Wall Street Journal had this to say:   Among other new faces, Jennifer Eccleston, dubbed "Miss Shock and Awe" by a fan on an Internet Web log, joined Fox News as a contributor this past January and has been filing reports for the network from the Iraq-Jordan border. Before joining Fox, Ms. Eccleston free-lanced out of London for CNN and covered Slobodan Milosevic's arrest and the foot-and-mouth-disease crisis in the U.K. She also worked as a reporter for CNN in Atlanta.   From the Miami Herald: • JENNIFER ECCLESTON, Fox News: One of the few women reporting from the war zone, her striking mane of blond hair is an asset on camera and a debit when she has to report increasingly violent anti-American protests in Jordan: ``I have to make sure it's covered -- it definitely marks me as an, um, non-local.''

      GOLF AND THE GRAVEYARD    urlLink This  quote is great.   "Antelope Valley can be surreal, alien and bleak, making it the ideal location for horror and science-fiction stories," said Harry Medved, author of the upcoming St. Martin's Press travel guide, "American Backlot."  I don't know what to say.  It's true.  I was assalted by potted plants today.  i was behind a semi as was driving to work.  The backdoor of the trailer was open and potted plants were spilling out.  I had to swerve to miss hitting some.  We came to a stop light and a guy jumped out of this truck, picked up some plants, and threw them in the back of his pickup.  Good times.   I wrote a story on Friday, but it isn't on the website.  Here it is though...  Highland is team to beat in GL golf  By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer  CALIFORNIA CITY—To no one’s surprise, Highland won another Golden League match on Thursday at par-72 Tierra Del Sol.  Highland shot a 390, 28 shots better than second place Quartz Hill. Erik Jarvey led the field with a 77. Teammates Eugene Park, Pat Londono, and Ryan Kahl and Quartz Hill’s Nate Anchete tied for second with a 78. Highland has won all of the Golden League matches this year. Thursday was the fifth league match of the season. There are three remaining.   “Highland is running away with it, “ Lancaster coach Steve Radford said. Quartz Hill coach Dale Carson is pleased with his team’s play this season, but the way Highland has been playing the best they can hope for is a distant second. “I tell the guys to have a good time.  Don’t worry about chasing anybody,” Carson said. But second place is not bad considering the top two teams in the league qualify for the postseason. For now, the rest of the Golden League is looking up at Highland.  “We hope in the next year to two years to really start competing,” Radford said.  The Golden League coaches would probably agree. Most teams are going through growing pains because their best golfers are underclassmen.  Nate Ancheta and Brian Barcelona of Quartz Hill and Sergio Hinojosa of Lancaster, all underclassmen who finished in the top five Thursday, offer their teams hope for the future. As teams look to the future, Highland dominates the present. They routinely place four players in the top five at Golden League matches. Thursday, the wind was a major factor. “This has been pretty rough,” said Radford, who’s team hosted Thursday’s Golden League match.  “The wind is usually 15-20 miles per hour, sometimes a little worse.” A little worse is right.  The National Weather Service routinely lists gusts of 20-30 m.p.h. in the Valley. “In these conditions, you have to play your ball differently, but it’s part of the game.  You just have to know how to handle it,” said Carson.   The wind has been a challenge for Golden League golfers all year. Sometimes, the wind is so strong that it doesn’t simply affect a golfer’s play, it wrecks havoc with it.  In fact, a match was cancelled at Tierra del Sol a few weeks ago because of the wind. “The wind was so bad that day, you’d swear the trees were bending over,” said Jerry Riedmiller, who works in the pro shop at Tierra del Sol. “The wind must have been 50 miles an hour.” But no matter what the conditions, Highland storms on, while the the rest look to next year.  TEAM RESULTS—Highland 390, Quartz Hill 418, Palmdale 456, Lancaster 457, Antelope Valley 501, Littlerock DQ. MEDALISTS—1. Eric Jarvey (H) 77; 2. Eugene Park (H) 78, Pat Londono (H) 78, Ryan Kahl (H) 78, Nate Ancheta (QH) 78; 3. Brandon Olsson (H) 79; 4. Sergio Hinojosa (L) 80; 5. Jacob Smith (P) 81, Brian Barcelona (QH) 81.   Side note on all this...Friday was a very interesting day for me.  First off,  urlLink California City , where the tournament was held, was freaking no man's land.  It's over an hour north of Lancaster.  i drove from LA to get there, so I was driving for about 2 and a half hours.  Mojave is the last town before you get to California City and as I was leaving it, I saw signs for Las Vegas and Yosemite.  I was in Egypt, man.  But after seeing these signs, I looked out across the desert and saw and bunch of airplanes.  i had to blink, because I thought I was seeing things, but no, there were literally hundred of airplanes int he middle of the desert.  Not little planes, mind you.  They were 747's, jumbo jets kind of planes.  I'm serious.  I couldn't believe it myself.  I stop my car and got out to count.  I couldn't see them well, they were in the distance a bitand a building obstructed a bit of my view, but I counted 104 from what i saw, and then as I drove on I saw even more.  Mojave's a town a about three thousand.  The whole thing didn't make sense.  I was pretty tripped out.  I thought I was either in an alternate universe, or in the midst of a giant government conspirary.  I though I might be able to nab a pulitzer from it, or at least a congressional metal of honor.  but sadly, my  urlLink mystery  has been solved though. And finally, the  urlLink deathblow  for my bizzaro day was when I stumbled upon the facts.  You've got to check out those pictures.  They're pretty crazy.    I got to the golf course and they let me use a cart to zip around and find the coaches.  All I could think about was the movie, "jackass."  It was a great experience.  I almost drove into a sandtrap.  There also had this bridge across the freeway.  It was dope.  I should have jumped it.  The Highland golf team is undefeated, but I couldn't find the coach.  Rumor is he was sleeping in a van in the parking lot.  I was driving back and a blew through a stop sign.  I looked the mirror and there was a cop a ways behind me.  I took a quick right and went around the block and ducked into a gas station.  I still have Michigan plate after being in California 5 years, so I really didn't feel like dealing with that pig.  I picked up some tropical skittles and an RC Cola and headed back.  I didn't see the cop again.

      3RD PLACE  I'm looking for my third place.  That's Starbucks lingo.  They market themselves as a "third place."  There's home, there's work, then there's the third place. Antelope Valley has a serious lack of third places.  Here's my top three: Starbucks w/drive thru, Library, and Barnes and Noble Starbucks. The Drive-thru Starbucks has the most atmosphere, for what its worth.   But come on, it's got a drive thru and that just puts all the workers on edge and makes me feel like I'm chilling in a McDonald's.  The Library is cool.  It's got books, ya know.  But it's also filled with crazied children and all of AV's derelicts including me. For now, my money's on the Barnes and Noble Starbucks, you can read the books there, ya got coffee, it's a combo.  It also feed my habit and provides me with up-to-date   travel guides  so I can dream about my around the world trip which is closer by the day.    I haven't really met anybody here.  I feel like the new kid in school.  I mean, what do I do go up to people and say, "Hi.  I'm Darren.  I'm new here."  Actually, that's not a bad idea.  I think I'll try it.  I've been using the make-myself-visable technique, hence the third place, but I might try that new kid thing now.  Speaking of hemroids, I was thinking about safety belts today.  When you think about it the whole thing is pretty weird.  We get in these metal machines and have to buckle ourselves down.  That's pretty odd.  We strap ourselves to chairs.  We do this everyday.  Am I the only one that finds this peculiar?  What ever happened to walking?  Remember that?  Or horses, they worked too.  No, now we must haress ourselves to fake leather to get where we want to go.  Thank God for progress.   urlLink Here's  what it's all about.

      MEATLOAF and CRAZY MIKE  I worked my first Jethawks game.  They are the Arizona Diamondbacks' High A minor league team.  It was cool.  I got free pizza the first night and free meatloaf the second.  John, my editor said the stories were solid, so I guess i'll be doing more in the future.  This Friday to be exact. There were two other guys there to cover the game.  One guy from the L.A. Daily News.  He had a pretty bad stuttering problem.  He was a nice guy.  I don't remember his name, but he was covering the game for Gideon, the normal beat writer.  The second guy, Mike, was from the Daily Press in Victorville.  Victorville is even worse than Lancaster.  It's nowhere from nowhere.  He was covering the High Desert Mavericks, the Brewers farm club.  They're almost as bad as the Tigers.  The Mavs had lost 28 of theri past 29 road games and it was getting to Mike. we all had drinks after the game.  Gideon showed up.  His nickname for Mike was "Crazy Mike."  It fit.  Mike was pretty much a nerotic.  Think George Costanza from Seinfeld.  He went to Syracuse, which is a major journalism school.  he and his friends interned at places like the Rocky Mountain News, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Newark Star-Ledger, N.Y. Times, Washington Post.  What that means is that those are big papers.  And an internship is a very good hook up.  One of Mike's friends wrote for NHL.com when he was 16.  Other friends won all these awards soon after graduating.  So Mike was stress and depressed to be working in VictorVille, while his friends were at big papers.  It depressed me and made me not want to be in the bussiness.  So competative.  Like everything I just.  But after hearing Mike emote, I wanted to hop a plane to Bali.  Interviewing players was cool. I went into the clubhouse after the game.  neat. This was my first time writing on a deadline, and to say so myself, I did a damn good job.  The first game ended at 9:45 and sent my story at 10:30 p.m.  The second game ended at 10:30 and I sent the story at 10:35.  Boo-yah, huh?   urlLink JetHawks game 1   Thiessen plays part in Jethawks win  This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Thursday, May 1, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - Everyone expected Mike Thiessen to be a little rusty. That's what happens when you're playing in your first game since 2001.  Even so, Thiessen played a big part in Lancaster's 8-4 victory over High Desert on Wednesday by scoring two runs with a walk and a base hit.  Thiessen, a former 42nd round draft pick, missed all of last season, serving as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.  He was in the starting lineup for the JetHawks on Wednesday after joining the club from extended spring training the same day.  "My swing's not perfect, but it's nice to be in a game situation, with the crowd," Thiessen said. "I feel very comfortable. I know a lot of these guys. It's a good environment."  Thiessen and the rest of the team provided more than enough offense for Scott Barber, who pitched eight strong innings.  "He got more confidence as the game went on," Manager Mike Aldrete said.  Barber struck out two batters in both the sixth and seventh innings.  "I made the point to bear down in those innings and keep the ball down," Barber said.  The JetHawks capitalized on a couple High Desert errors in the fourth inning. Sergio Santos singled then advanced to second on a fielding error.   Mike Thiessen singled and Dan Uggla followed with a double to left to score Santos.   Thiessen scored later in the inning on catcher Kade Johnson's throwing error.  Barber was cruising until he ran into the heart of the Mavericks' lineup in the fifth.  Barber walked Daryl Clark, the Cal League home run leader. Then Kade Johnson, second in the league in home runs, atoned for his error in the top of the inning by smacking a towering opposite field home run off the maintenance shed beyond the right field fence to tie the game at two.  The JetHawks blew the game open in bottom of the inning, scoring five runs on five hits. Kroeger, Santana, and Richar doubled.  Lancaster catcher Mike DiRosa hit a home run in the eighth to put the game at 8-2.  High Desert threatened in the ninth, scoring twice, but it wasn't nearly enough.  The defense came up big for the JetHawks, who turned three double plays.  Notes: The JetHawks made several roster moves Wednesday. Jay Garthwaite was placed on the disabled list (shoulder) and sent to Tucson for rehab. He was tied for fourth in the Cal League with five home runs. Infielder Bryan Johnson was promoted from South Bend of the Midwest League and Thiessen joined the team. To make room on the roster, first baseman Jeff Stanek was sent down to South Bend and catcher Eric Servais was released.    urlLink JetHawks game 2   Cormier gets hit hard This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Friday, May 2, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - Lance Cormier has been on cruise control for the JetHawks this season.  That was, until Thursday's game, when he ran smack into a brick wall. Cormier (3-3) surrendered eight earned runs on nine hits in an ugly 11-9 loss to High Desert.  The game started off promising enough for the JetHawks. In the first inning, third baseman Dan Uggla continued his hot hitting by slamming a ball off the base off the center field wall, right next to the 410 foot marker.  On that hit, Marland Williams scored on a close sliding play at the plate in which he collided with High Desert catcher Kade Johnson. Johnson was forced to leave the game with a knee injury.  Later in the inning, Josh Kroeger and Jaime Jones each hit soft shots that squeaked through the infield to drive in a run a piece and give the JetHawks a 3-0 lead.  It was a lead that should have been enough for Cormier, who entered the game with a 1.64 earned run average, second best in the California League. He had issued only four walks in his professional career, two this season. But he started off Thursday's game by walking two of the first three batters he faced. Luckily, the defense produced a double play to end the inning with no harm done.  However, Cormier was not as fortunate in the third inning. Six Mavericks reached base before the JetHawks could record an out. The normally reliable Cormier surrendered a bases-loaded walk to force in a run. But the big blow came off the bat of Brian Foster, who was in to replace cleanup hitter Kade Johnson at catcher. Foster hit a bases-clearing double down the left-field line en route to High Desert scoring six runs in the inning.  Foster struck again for Mavericks in the fifth with a two-run homer. It was part of a five-run inning for High Desert, who strung together six consecutive base hits in the inning chasing Cormier in the process.  Kroeger drove in runs in the third and fifth to try and chip away at the Mavericks lead.  Sloppy play by the Mavericks allowed the JetHawks get back into the game in the sixth inning. Lancaster capitalized on a couple High Desert errors to score four runs on three hits.  Lancaster threatened again with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, putting two runners on base, but failed to score a run.  Chris Saenz (2-2) picked up the win for High Desert. Saenz struck out a career-high nine batters in the game.  Kroeger and Marland Williams each had three hits in the losing cause. Williams scored four runs. Kroeger had three runs batted in.  The JetHawks fell to 15-11, while the Mavericks improved to 9-18.   Notes: High Desert snapped an eight game losing streak and eleven game road losing streak. They had dropped 28 of their past 29 road games, dating back to last year, before Thursday's win. ... JetHawk manager Mike Aldrete had a good workout in Thursday's game. He raced out of the dugout three times to argue calls with the umpire.

Funny how "Hunter" is near the top in North Dakota and Montana.  and this.   	 AP - Feature Stories Typing Monkeys Don't Write Shakespeare  2 hours, 33 minutes ago  By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer   LONDON - Give an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, the theory goes, and they will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare.   Give six monkeys one computer for a month, and they will make a mess.   Researchers at Plymouth University in England reported this week that primates left alone with a computer attacked the machine and failed to produce a single word.   "They pressed a lot of S's," researcher Mike Phillips said Friday. "Obviously, English isn't their first language."   In a project intended more as performance art than scientific experiment, faculty and students in the university's media program left a computer in the monkey enclosure at Paignton Zoo in southwest England, home to six Sulawesi crested macaques.   Then, they waited.   At first, said Phillips, "the lead male got a stone and started bashing the hell out of it.   "Another thing they were interested in was in defecating and urinating all over the keyboard," added Phillips, who runs the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technologies.   Eventually, monkeys Elmo, Gum, Heather, Holly, Mistletoe and Rowan produced five pages of text, composed primarily of the letter S. Later, the letters A, J, L and M crept in.   The notion that monkeys typing at random will eventually produce literature is often attributed to Thomas Huxley, a 19th-century scientist who supported Charles Darwin's theories of evolution. Mathematicians have also used it to illustrate concepts of chance.   The Plymouth experiment was funded by England's Arts Council and part of the Vivaria Project, which plans to install computers in zoos across Europe to study differences between animal and artificial life.   Phillips said the results showed that monkeys "are not random generators. They're more complex than that.   "They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there."

       urlLink Bulldogs golf team could be area's best ever   This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Sunday, May 4, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Highland golf coach Lyn Boop has inadvertently started a part-time catering business this year.  Anytime "anything significant happens" for Highland, Boop buys the golfer a dinner.  At a Golden League match on April 28 at Tierra Del Sol in California City, Highland set a new course, school, and league record by shooting 368 as a team.  "That match cost me six dinners," said Boop.  The way Highland has been playing this year, Boop might want to reexamine his definition of the word "significant".  Highland has won every Golden League match dating back to May of 2001. The Bulldogs are 35-0 in league play after going 40-0 last year.  The six golfers on the Highland golf team- seniors Brandon Olsson and Pat Londono, juniors Eugene Park and Ryan Kahl, sophomore Erik Jarvey, and freshman John Park, brother of Eugene - claim six of the seven lowest averages in the league.  The Lyn Boop catering service has been working overtime.  Boop downplays his role in Highland's success this year.  After the record-breaking win in California City, one of the Highland parents congratulated Boop on the victory.  "What did I do?" Boop said.   "I just steer the ship and drive the van."  And buy the dinners.  "All these guys can kick my butt. Honestly, the only guy I can compete with is our alternate (James Jang)," said Boop. "Olsson and Londono have only been golfing for a few years. I've been playing my whole life and I'll never be as good as they are."  A large part of Highland's success comes from the players' work ethic.  "These kids, they're out every day. Cold, windy, hot, whatever, working hard," said Boop.  The team lives on the golf course.  Kahl, the Park brothers, and Olsson live just off the course at Antelope Valley Country Club. Jarvey, Jang, and Londono are junior members there.  Most of them compete in tournaments on the weekends, some as far away as Phoenix and Sacramento.  With that kind of dedication, it was never a question of whether or not they where going to win the Golden League.  "We knew we were going to be good," said Boop. "We want to go on (in the playoffs). We want to be one of those two teams at regionals."  For all the success Highland has had this year, there's one goal the team is still stalking.  "No Highland team has gotten out of the first round of the playoffs," said Boop.  There are 22 teams in the first round of the CIF playoffs. Only two go on to regionals.  Boop knows what it is like to taste post-season success. He began his coaching career at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, where the team went to the state finals in his first season as coach.  He has tried to instill that same drive into the Highland players.  "Deep down there's this fire burning inside them," Boop said. "They said, 'Let's do something we've never done before.'"  Highland has reason to be hopeful, Golden League success aside. Earlier in the season, Highland beat highly-ranked Hart High School. It gave them confidence that they can compete with teams outside the Valley.  "This might be the best team to come out of the Valley. Ever," Boop said.  And if that translates into post-season success, a celebration is in order. Food courtesy of Coach Boop.

      Softball.  I covered another softball playoff game.  I tried to Hunter S. Thompson this one.  Phrases that got cut from my article include "She was half Kelly Osbourne, half Eric Gagne" and "McPherson castrated the Rebel offense. Few balls left the infield."  I thought the last one was especially funny.  One of the nightly exersizes is thinking of a headline.  It has to be witty and functional at the same time.  For instance, when the Angels forced the Giants into a game 7 in last years world series, the headline was "Tied and Gone to Seven." Last night's involved the Ducks losing the first game of the Stanley Cup finals to the New Jersey Devils.  I first suggested "Ducks go to Hell." but that didn't fly.  I tried to think of what Devils do, what ducks to, how to describe the Ducks getting stomped.  Then I remembered Norm Mcdonald on the Dennis Miller show.  We was talking about the painting "piss Christ' which depicted a crucifix in a jar of urine.  McDonald when on to say what he thought the Devil would to do that "artist" when he got to hell. I echoed McDonald's sentiments in the form of a head line for the Sports section, but my editor didn't think it would work at a family newspaper.  oh well.   http://www.avpress.com/n/westy16.htsRebels ousted This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Wednesday, May 28, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ QUARTZ HILL - On a sweltering Antelope Valley afternoon, Quartz Hill's hitting was drier than the desert air. Royal shut out Quartz Hill 6-0 on Tuesday in the second round of the CIF-Southern Section Division I playoffs. The story of the game was Highlander pitcher Jordan McPherson. She was an imposing presence, leaping off the mound and grunting fiercely after every pitch. "The intimidation was the speed of the pitches coming in," Quartz Hill coach Coy Ray said. After a strikeout, she performed a secret handshake with the infield. At one point in the game, she burst into laughter on the mound. "I joke around a lot," McPherson said. "I just felt really relaxed out there." Quartz Hill's bats were relaxed as well. A little too relaxed for a team that entered the game with a .314 batting average. McPherson, who has allowed only one earned run all year, stymied the Rebels offense, allowing just a few balls past the infield. Nicole Means and Kelsie Blankenmeyer, who each hit a home run in the Rebels 10-4 opening round victory over Bishop Amat on Friday, were a combined 0-for-7. "I was scared (of Quartz Hill's offense) coming into the game, "McPherson said. "But we were prepared. (Jennifer) Curtier had those hits off me, but my defense really backed me up." Curtier had a perfect day at the plate as the rest of Quartz Hill struggled. She accounted for three of the Rebel's five hits in the game. The turning point was the third inning. Quartz Hill pitcher Brieann Huling had set down the first seven batters she had faced in the game. But with one out in the third, Royal's Jenessa Allen smashed a line shot off Huling's leg. Allen reached base safely and advanced to second on Tori Dario's bunt single. The Rebels looked as if they were safe as they retired Nicole Hartfield for the second out. But the next batter, Heather Erickson, drilled the ball into centerfield.  Nicole Means fielded the ball and fired it to catcher Rachel Green for a play at the plate. The ball was there in time, but Royal's Allen was charging home and collided with Green, who fumbled the ball allowing a run to score. The Highlanders went on to score six runs on eight hits in the inning, all with two outs, all off Huling. "Huling didn't do that bad, "said Coy, "just a little hit here and there. Everything that could go bad for us did in that inning. Their hits just fell in." Huling gave up five consecutive run-scoring singles. "If we get one of those plays, it's a whole different ball game," Coy said, "but if you keep giving them chances, they make you pay." Royal will face Rosary on Thursday, Rosary defeated El Toro, 11-0.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Royal 6, Quartz Hill 0 Royal 006 000 - 6 11 2 Quartz Hill 000 000 - 0 5 1 Huling (3), Ricker and Green; McPherson and L.

It was on the friday of memorial weekend and i was in the middle of traffic.  it took 4 hours to get there.  it wasn't pleasant.  i arrived in the 5th inning and had to BS most of the story. i was gonna post it on here, but i can't find it. oh, here's one of the stories.  i had about 19 % of information i needed to write an actually story.  So I just  urlLink "Jayson Blair-ed"   the parts of it i was a bit iffy on.   Boron 7, Kern Valley 2 BORON—Boron defeated Kern Valley 7-2 on Friday to advance to the second round of the CIF Southern Section Division V playoffs. The big blow for Boron came off the bat of Livingston Timsuren, whose three-run home run in the fifth inning sealed the victory for the Bobcats. Bradley Kostopoulous had a run-scoring base hit for Boron in a three-run second inning. “We were aggressive on the basepaths,” said Boron coach Ronnie Toy, “We did what we need to do to win.” Boron pitcher James Smith had six strikeouts in the game. Boron improved their record to 15-4.  Kern Valley ends the season at 16-7. Boron faces a strong Vasquez (18-3) team on Tuesday in the next round of the playoffs.  Vasquez defeated Sage Hill on Friday. Boron has not played Vasquez this season. “I guess we should be shaking in our boots,” Toy said. “We plan to do the same stuff we’ve been doing all year.” A coin flip today will determine where the game will be played.

      Part one of my adventures  I've always like traveling.  Whether it was riding in the station wagon to the grocery store or a spring break trip to Florida.  I loved being on the go.  It was the otherness of it all.  Knowing that I was not at home.  How did the Europe trip begin?  It began in my mind.  The Legend of Backpacking in Europe.  It's up there with Working on a Fishing Boat in Alaska.  It is the ultimate lure for an idealistic young man on the verge of having to face reality.  I decided that after I graduated, I was going to Europe.  Alone, if none of my friends wanted to join me.  But I was going.  The actual formation of the trip began in Billy's massive bedroom.  His room was so big that you could fit the 12 Days of Christmas in there with room to spare for an extra partridge. But this time is was just me, Billy, Dan, and Jesse.    After a few beers I told them of my Europe plans and next thing I know there is a map sprawled on the carpet and we were picking out cities to visit.  That's how The Legend is.  One word of it and it speads like wildfire.  Eventually, Dan and Jesse dropped out (It was not  unexpected from Jesse, who also elected not to attend Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, but that's another story altogether).  It was Billy and I.  A modern-day Lewis and Clark off to explore the undiscovered European continent.  Hopefully, we thought, it is big enough to contain us.  But first, we had to negotiate the wilderness of McMaster-Carr

      PART TWO  I've never been a fan of working...or...jobs.  But you've got to make money somehow.  After Billy and I decided to go to Europe, we knew we had to get jobs to pay for the whole thing.  That's when we heard about the McMaster-Carr gig.  12 dollars an hour.  I was amazed.  I didn't know a person could make that much money.  Mc-Master-Carr is a supply company.  It's like Home Depot on steroids.  A warehouse with rows and rows and shelves and shelves of...stuff.  I liked to go to bathroom and get lost on the way.  I found a vending machine once that had strawberry ice cream.  But i could never find it again.  Our job? We had many, but the "best" was Inventory. For example, we were given a sheet of paper that said a box had 2,553 screws in it.  We seached for the box and counted the screws one by one.  I was glad to be putting my college degree to work.    Let me tell you, it was a long two months.  Billy and I got through it by uttering "Madrid" or "Prague" to each other as we counted.  Oh, and we worked from 4-1:30.  Both of them.  For part of the summer work started at 4 am, another, 4 p.m.  They liked to switch it up sometimes from week to week.  When we lot off of work late, Billy and I would head back to the Manor in Whitter and smoke and drink for a awhile.  When we got off in the afternoon, we'd go to Seal Beach lie in the sun then hit up happy hour at Taco Surf for a few Dos Equis.  We tried to make the best of it.  It was good to have the adversity together that summer.  It helped prepare us fo Europe.  The weird hours messed up my sleeping schedule though.  I was always tired at work.  I'd go to the bathroom and fall asleep on the toilet every day at work.  it was good for a 20-30 minute nap.  Another once of our jobs was moving stuff ("transportation") in cardboard boxes ("containers").  I'm amazed by the lingo.  This guy Rick ran the forklift to move the boxes from level to level of the warehouse.  I was on Transportation crew.  Which meant I wore a lanyard (a belt tied to a railing) so i wouldn't fall to my death and talked baseball with Rick for a few hours.  Rick was cool.  He snuck us cookies and a radio to listen to ball games.  The cafeteria there was amazing.  I feasted everyday.  pancakes, breakfast burritos, french toast, eggs, potatoes.  YUM!  The crappiest part about the whole thing was pushing the "containers."  They were on pallets with broken wheels and weighed 10 million pounds.  The warehouse was always about 190 degrees too.  My favorite job was something that had to do with boxes.  I don't really remember what I did, but I stood in front of an industrial-sized fan the whole time.  The important thing is that we made moolah for Europe.  And throught it all, we were there before we knew it.

      hi.  i'm crazy.  i was driving back from godforsaken san bernadino (215 to the 15 to the 138 to the 14 to k st to 15 st w ((where i live by the way, in racketclubapartments))) in even more godforsaken lancaster. i threw on a wilco cd and zoned out as i climbed up and up and up 3000 ft, 4000 ft.  i missed my exit.  drove 5 miles then missed the next exit because a damn semi was in my way.  (damn semis drive so slow.)   i drove 5 more miles then and took the 3rd exit. it was somewhere south of victorville about 200 miles from vegas and approx. 150 from l.a.  it was a nice lonely intersection i'd come to.  but a 24 hour truck stop there was packed, must be having a trucker party or something. there was a seedy looking place called 'phil's outpost' that i despriately wanted to dine at.  but i was tired and need to get back to the sweet a.v. i didn't want to back track, so i took the 395 over towards adelanto.  it sounded familiar.  the stars were out and seemed to be having a bigger party than the truckers. after a while i cut off on some road toward phelan.  it sounded no really familiar at all, but what the hell, it's not like i'm going anywhere anyways. i was cruising for a while till the wilco ran out.  it was then i noticed i was below 'E' on the gas meter and was smack in the middle of b.f.egypt. i kept on motoring and came upon the great metropolis of Phelan.  i passed a few run down buildings until i noticed a darkened gas station. i pulled in, hoping the pumps would be on, and, they, weren't. i didn't have much hope that i would find gas anywhere soon, my phone was getting zero reception, and none of the buildings had lights on. i decided to try and make it to something for what it was worth. but my car wouldn't start.  i got out and sat leaned against my car and looked up at the stars. the big dipper was there.  he was just chillin'. after a few minutes i saw a truck approaching.  it pulled up to the 4-way stop.  "Here we go," I thought," It's a crazed band of drunked Rednecks on a rampage.  I'm dead." The truck slowly approached and pulled into the station.  It was beat to hell. There was a dog yapping wildly in the passenger's seat. a very large, fat man with a mullet got out. he was wearing a Dale Earnhart t-shirt and was holding a beer can. I thought, "oh great. this is too classic. where's the shotgun? how many shots will it take him to finish me?" He waddled over real slowly and looked at me for a minute. "you lookin for drugs?" he asked me. "no, I ran out of gas," i said very scared.  Drugs?  what does that mean.  I figured this guy ran a meth lab or something.  Great. "well shit, I got a can in the back of my truck," he said.  Praise good for this hopped up redneck angel. He put a few gallons in. "That should get ya to Littlerock," he said. "Sure ya dont' want any drugs?" I declined, tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take any.  I thanked him started to get in my car. "What you doing out here from Michigan?" he asked seeing my license plate. I explained that i went to college in LA, moved up here to work at the paper. "Shit man, they got some good racin in Michigan.  Good huntin too.  my cousin shot a 12-point buck up there, shoulda seen the rack on that thing." He kept talking.  A LONG TIME.  I nodded. Damn it.  I said I had to leave about 5 times.  I was getting tired.  The man was obviously drunk. Finally i said.  "well, gotta go thanks alot man." I closed my car door and quickly took off.

      i thought this (http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html) was neat.  i like books.  i want to read them all.  alas there is not enought time in the day.  It is 6:33 in the morning.  I have not slept at all.  i tried.  Nothing.  Nada.  Finally I said screw it.  I'm not gonna lie here like an ass.  I'll get up an type.  I'm gonna head down to Starbucks soon and pump some sweet caffeine into my veins and try to write a story. I'm going to be famous one way or another.  I haven't decided how yet though.  EUROPE PART 3  Billy and I met in the Philadelphia Airport on September 3rd.  I from Michigan, he from Minnesota.  I don't know where the hell he found me, but we ended up going to a bar and having the most expensive beers in the universe.  I swear mine was over eight dollars. Funny thing is, we parted ways the same way, drinking beers, when the trip was over.  I guess it isn't all that weird since we drank a lot of beer on the trip.  Anyways, the bar we drank at when we returned from Europe had a faux 50's decor.  It was Holloween and the waitresses scared me.  By this time, Billy had quit smoking for the 5th time. (A quote from a bar in Brugges, Belgium: "This is my last pack.  If it isn't, there's something wrong with me.")  So when we get into the bar he asks me "What are you gonna think If I ask for a cigarrette?"  Then, he bums one off a guy that just got off from being stationed in Germany. Anyway, I thought it was funny.  My travel account isn't designed to rip on Billy, (although later you will be introduced to a little Swedish mishap which can't help but be told), I will bear my fair share of ridicule along the way as well.  So buckle up. We landed in Amsterdam in the early morning. It was a "We're not in Kansas anymore" experience.  I remember being struck by and odd paralysis.  I just stood there thinking, "What's that?  I haven't seen that before.  What's that say?  Wow, she's hot.  What's that?  I haven't seen that before..."  The newness was startling. Holland was also filled with legions of beautiful women. I have never seen such an awesome collection of stunning females in my life, counting Southern California.  They were stunning, had incredible bodies and they all rode bikes.  Well, everybody rode bikes, but it made the women more alluring.  I was excited.  I was in a land swarming with lusious babes on bikes.  Could it get any better?  All this to say, I never talked to any of them, but they were pretty remarkable nonetheless. In addition to the infestation of bikes, Amsterdam was plagued with trams.  I was scared as hell of getting hit by one of them.  and I never was, so NYAH!!! you stupid tram! Up Yours! When you talk about Amsterdam, all anybody wants to know about is the drugs and the sex.  Yeah, it's there.  I saw it.  Here's a side note, i don't know how related it is to the topic at hand, but here goes: Finding a room in Amsterdam blows.  It blows bigtime.  at least it did for us.  We tried 3 or 4 or 5 different places.  And because we were retarded, we walked everywhere.  We were excited, in a different country, and complete asses.  I had it bad, but Billy.  Oh man, his backpack (if you could call it that) was two of him.  It dwarfed mine.  It was so big, it looked clownish in comparison to other travelers packs.  He was dying as we wandered around the streets, guidebookless, looking for a hostel .  I had no sympathy, I didn't tell him to pack his own personal maid, massuse, concubine, and pediatrician.  We did switch packs for a while though and his pack felt like giving a piggyback ride to rosanne barr in her third tri-mester. We finally found a place to stay in the early afternoon.  It was a Christian youth hostel in a decent part of town with cool looking buildings.  We went out drinking that night.  As we walked back to our hostel, we noticed we were passing a buch of windows lit by red lights.  Ok, whatever.  We turned down the road to our hostel and the windows became more frequent, however it was what was inside the windows that was peculier — Half-naked women blowing kisses at us.  Ah, the famed Red-Light District and our hostel was smack dab in the middle of it.

      The heat out here in the Antelope Valley is unreal.  It feels like a dream.  I can't believe that it is actual life.  It's like a Budapest sauna room.  EURO DELUXE  From Paris we went to Madrid.  It was quite a little train ride, it was.  An overnight ordeal.  Espana.  bonita.  In Spain, my lingustic skills were in full effect.  In France, I was lost.  I understood not a word., but in Spain, in Spain I was a king.

      MORE EURO TRASH  Paris is a big place and very white.  oh, but before I get there, I must say that Billy threw up in the Amsterdam train station bathroom.  and he had to pay to do it no less. More Dutch memories... The Heineken Brewery: There is actually a ride where it similates the life of a beer. Everybody speaks English in Holland.  Mayo on fries is good.  Snickers bars are really good.  Paris.  Yeah, it's big.  I think in Paris we walked around more than any other city.  Just walked and walked and walked.  Out hostel was outside of the city a ways in Clichy.  Oh, getting a room in Paris is a bitch too.  and expensive. Anyway, I was enthralled with the Notre Dame.  I thought it was the coolest thing.  I could feel the Hemmingway aura.  This could be a cool place to live.  There were big arches and old things.  My favorite thing about france though were the ubiquitous cafe/bars.  A cafe in the morning and a bar in the afternoon/evening.  Splendid.  I want to start on here in the states. The highlight of Paris was probably going up the effiel tower in the afternoon and then watching the stars come out.  I put the mack down on this chick that was scoping me out up there....Well, actually how the story goes is that I wanted to make out with a babe at the top of the tower so I stalked this girl around the observation deck and never said a word to her.  I'm smooth.  That was the story of the trip for me, um, until the end when i visited the brew fairy. I didn't really want to eat much in Paris.  Every thing cost too much.  We ate lots of bread and cheese.  Which was fine by me. Not much in France stands out.  It was probably the least exciting time on the trip.  Looking at stuff was cool.  We ran through the Louvre.  Which is kind of like taking a quick tour of the Pentegon.  That place is huge.  We were still in our museum phase.  All that gets old quickly though. We ate at McDonald's in Paris.  I had a Royale with Cheese and Le Big Mac (we ate there twice). The whore situation was worse in Paris than in Amsterdam.  There's this whole section of town full of them, all over the place.  We stayed in Paris three or four days.  I didn't meet Amelie.  Too bad.  We would have made out.  I remember that the beer at our hostel was hella cheap.  It made me not want to go out.  The hostel lifestyle is grand.  You meet cool people, learn cool things.  Or in Billy's case, frighten lonely travelers. Billy and I and some other guy traveling by himself from Florida were sharing a room.  We invited our roommate to come down and drink but he said he had to write in his journal.  That's the kind of person we're dealing with here.  This guy also snored like none other.  In the middle of the night Billy shook the guy.  The guy freaked out.  Billy said "Hey, man. You're snoring."  We went back to bed.  The guy was gone in the morning.  Must have been scared to death.  That'll teach him not to snore. Many times the rooms are mixed male/female.  This makes for interesting times.  Um, all I'll say is that I slept clothed, other people did not. At the end of our 4 days we were ready to leave.

      Nevermind, the Tigers suck.  I spoke too soon.  MADRID  We switched trains in San Sebastian, Spain right over the border from France.  If we had more time, we would have stayed there a day or two.  It was supposed to be a cool place, a backpackers haven.  Oh well.  Next time. Something I noticed right off the bat was how cheap Spain was compaired to the rest of Europe.  It was amazing.  We got some really crappy Spainish Duchatos cigarrettes  for a buck-fifty.  Wonderful. Madrid was big and not very appealing to me at first.  We stayed in a hotel right down from Plaza del Sol, the Times Square of Madrid.  It was actually used in the opening scene of the original 'Vanilla Sky" instead of Times Square. I was in heaven once we discovered this old cervezaria off the Plaza de Santa Ana.  It was frequented by Hemingway.  We splurged a bit with the food.  I ate some shrimp and oysters to go along with white and red wine.  All this to say, we splurged food-wise everywhere we went.  I don't think I've ever eaten as well as I did those two months in Europe. The cervezeria was in a section of town called Huertas.  It was supposedly the hip part of Madrid.  There were a bunch of clubs there.  Let me say this, the Spanish people never sleep.  The clubs are still packed at 4 a.m. on weekdays.  People stay till 6 in the morning.  It's crazy.  I like the late dinners though.  People don't think about eating dinner in Spain before 9 p.m. So we were in Huertas in some club.  I can't recall the name of it they all blur together. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the clubs.  But they're fun every once in a while.  Billy met this gal, Silvia, that worked at the airport.  She had a friend, but nobody to get excited about.  I attempted to make conversation with her, but her English was terrible.  Reminds me of the time I was working as a peanut Hawker at Anaheim Stadium.  A co-worker I hardly knew asked me to get some drinks with him.  He ends up take a girl back to his place and I'm somehow left to take her unattractive non-english speaking brazilian roommote home.  well, the madrid situation actually wasn't like that at all, but i wanted to slip in that story. One night, Billy wanted to stay really late with Silvia at this club.  it was 3 or 4 in the morning.  I decided to head back to the room.  Now, mind you, the room was a decent walk from where the club was, and after a few sangaria and cervezas, it was even farther.  It was raining and I began walking in the opposite direction of everything.  I eventually made it to the hotel under muttered cursings and oaths. I do remember that the gal behind the counter at the hotel was a babe.  i know she was into me.  I could tell.

      EXTRA EFFORT By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer LANCASTER — Kyle Nichols’ bloop single in the bottom of the 12th inning gave the JetHawks an 11-10 victory over the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes on Thursday at the Hangar. The JetHawks blew an 8-1 lead in a game that was wild from the start.  In the first inning, Dan Uggla slammed a 400-foot solo home run to left center. It was his 21st of the season to tie teammate Kyle Nichols for the Cal League lead. In the third, Jones dropped a single into right field. Then, not to be outdone by Uggla, Kyle Nichols lined a shot down the right-field line that barely cleared the top of the fence to reclaim the Cal League home run lead. Jay Garthwaite doubled, Edgar Varela singled and Danny Richar’s squeeze bunt scored Garthwaite. Mike DiRosa plunked a single into left to score Varela and make it 5-0. In the fourth, Rancho Cucamonga cleanup hitter and Anaheim Angels prospect Dallas McPherson lined a double to center field driving in Jeff Mathis making it 5-1.  The heavy hitters provided power early, but the most impressive JetHawk display came from an unlikely source. In the fifth inning, Mike DiRosa smashed a 420-foot, three-run blast over the centerfield fence. It was only his third home run of the season and first since April. It gave the JetHawks a seemingly solid 8-1 lead entering the sixth inning. In the sixth, McPherson, who is hitting .530 (26-49) with 11 homers in his last 17 games, launched a massive shot over the the right-field scoreboard. The two-run shot brought the Quakes within 8-4. Jaime Jones got into the act by knocking a solo home run, his 12th, in the bottom of the sixth to increase the lead to 9-4. After getting two quick outs in the seventh, JetHawks pitcher Reuben Kerbs walked four consecutive batters. His walk of McPherson scored a run, making it 9-5. Reliever Billy Biggs was brought in to face Nick Gorneault. Gorneault has feasted on JetHawk pitching this series, crushing three home runs and driving in 14 runs. Biggs’ first pitch to Nick Gorneault was sent sailing over Garthwaite’s leap in left field for a grand slam. It was Gorneault’s 14th home run of the season and it tied the game at 9-9. JetHawks reliever Pete Sikaras tamed the heart of the Quakes’ batting order in the top of the ninth, striking out Mathis, McPherson, and Gorneault. In the 10th, Sikaras kept overwhelming batters, striking out two more Quakes. Unfortunately for the JetHawks, Sikaras couldn’t pitch forever. Cliff McMachen was brought in for the 11th. And with two outs, Jason Aspito knocked a home run to right- center field to give the Quakes a 10-9 lead. In the bottom of the 11th, JetHawks got a leadoff double from Jamie Jones. Rancho got two quick outs. Then Edgar Varela got a hit to right field. Jones sprinted home. Right fielder Aspito fired the ball to catcher Jeff Mathis. But the throw was off line and Jones scored on a collison with Mathis at the plate, tying the game at 10. Next up, Jason Gorman singled and Varela advanced to third. But Danny Richar flied out to the shortstop to end the JetHawks threat. In the bottom of the 12th, DiRosa wild throw. Then Marland Williams laid down a bunt. Both men were safe. With runners on first and second, Uggla laid down a sacrifice bunt and moved the runners over. The Quakes intentionally walked Jones to load the bases for a try at a double play. But Nichols stepped to the plate and blooped a pitch into shallow left center for a JetHawk victory.

      one of the coolest things about madrid was this sheesha place we found.  it was incredible.   Sheesha is this flavored tabacco that you smoke through a big water pipe.  It's this arabic thing.  I first experienced it in Anaheim at this cafe we discovered while going to Biola.  It was called "Al Basha" and was next to a strip club.  It was always filled with old arabic men constantly sucking on these pipes exhaling smike that filled the room.  we'd have mint tea and play dominos.  it's a great place.   They're always playing Al Jazzera Tv or some sweet middle eastern music. Well, this place in Madrid added a cool element to the Shessha.  They mixed whisky into the water.  it was splendid.

      Hangar plays host to hoops   By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer On Saturday, the parking lot of The Hangar, home of the JetHawks, was filled with hundreds of people of all ages playing ball. But not the kind of ball that is usually played at The Hangar. Continuing today, The Hangar plays host to the Hoop World Tournament and Festival. Sixteen basketball courts are set up, active throughout the day.  In addition to the hoops, there are also dozens of vending booths and live music. “All people are invited to participate, from ages 7-107,” said Larry Thornhill, general manager of Clear Channel, the event’s sponsor. “We wanted to bring a big basketball tournament to the Antelope Valley and provide fun for the entire family.” The tournament is made up of ten brackets covering all age groups. The winners of each bracket are invited to the national championship in Hawaii. “Whoever is sponsoring this event is doing a good job,” said 1st Sgt. Porter Jefferson from Edwards Air Force Base, who volunteered his time to referee at the event. “Look around. What don’t you see here?  There’s no beer. They could have made a lot of money with that, but this is a real athletic event. “It’s a good family atmosphere,” said Jefferson. One of the fathers in attendance was Berrell Eveland. He was cheering on his daughter Brittany, 10, who was the only girl playing in the 10-and-under boys division. “The kids are having fun. Everybody has been really friendly. It’s a real family event,” Eveland said. When asked what she thought about being the only girl in the division, Brittany grinned and said, “It feels cool.” There was only one major complaint about the tournament. “It’s been fun,” said Alberta Nora, who was part of a group of parents that had been at the tournament all day. “But I wish they had it at a different time of the year.” The high turnout despite the heat seemed to give the tournament a lasting appeal. “Everybody officiating wants to be here,” Jefferson said, “All these people out here in this heat?  It’s going to grow.” Oddly enough, with all the basketball going on the biggest crowd of the day was not for the hoops.  It was for a cheer exhibition put on by Supreme Cheer. Children off all ages performed cheer routines set to music. “This area has always been left out,” said Jefferson, “It deserves something like this. This area is growing. I’ll support this every year.” A portion of the proceeds generated by the tournament go to benefit the Antelope Valley College football program and the Antelope Valley Athletic Club.

      from sunday  District 51 Big League ready to roll  By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer  For most Little Leaguers, the season has already come to a close, but for the girls who play Big League softball, the postseason is just beginning. On Sunday and running through Wednesday, the Antelope Valley All-Star Big League Girls softball team will host the Western Regional Championships at Dominic Massari Park in Palmdale. The team is made up of 16- to 18-year-old girls representing a number of area high schools: Desert, Desert Christian, Highland, Littlerock, Palmdale, Paraclete, and Quartz Hill. The team provides an opportunity to hone their skills in the prep offseason and showcase their talents to a number of college scouts. The big showcase comes to the winner of the Regionals. That team will advance to the Big League World Series in Kalamazoo, Mich. Last year, the AV All-Stars finished third there. “You get a lot of exposure there,” said Vanessa Marroquin, a three-year member of the Big League squad and recent Desert High graduate, “A lot of schools contacted me just because they saw me play there.” The World Championships involves ten teams, each from a different world region, six from the United States and one from Canada, the Far East, Latin America, and Europe. The AV All-Stars won the World Championship in 1996 and have been to the Championships each of the past three years. “It’s just a fun thing,” said Paraclete’s Tayler Wilson, who was part of the team’s third-place finish at the World Championships last year. “It’s real different to be playing against people from all over the world. It’s a great experience.” Besides being loaded with all-star talent from around the Valley, the team is blessed with a wealth of experience on the beach. The team’s manager Walt Pattison has more than 20 years of experience with youth softball. He guided the Park View Junior softball team to a World Championship in 1997. He is also the varsity softball coach at Highland. Assistant coach Ray Beltrami led the Big League softball team to the World Championship in 1996 and Scott Rutledge, the other assistant, has 15 years experience in youth baseball. “I feel very confident about the girls,” said Pattison, “We have more hitting and good speed this year. We’ll be ready for Sunday.” The team’s first game of the tournament will be against a team from Portland, Ore. at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday night and the players are confident in their abilities as well. “We have just as much skill this year (as last year),” Wilson said. Even with the great success of past teams, this year’s group of girls may have even more potential. “We’re a good hitting team one through nine. Maybe better than past years,” said Beltrami. But the true test will be when they take the field on Sunday. “The experience is there,” said Rutledge. “They just have to put it all together.”

      Garthwaite has luck on his side This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press on Monday, August 4, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - Jay Garthwaite is a lucky man.  According to him, he's been lucky exactly 18 times this year. The latest instance occuring when he cast the decisive blow in Sunday night's game, blasting his 18th home run of the season and driving in five runs including the go-ahead run in Lancaster's 8-4 victory over the High Desert Mavericks at The Hangar.  "I just got lucky," said Garthwaite.  If that's the case, with the season Garthwaite is having, it would not be surprising to find his locker stuffed with four-leaf clovers and rabbit's feet.  Garthwaite has turned the Cal League home run leaderboard into a three Hawk race.  Lancaster's Kyle Nichols heads the list with 24 homers, followed by teammates Dan Uggla, 21, and Garthwaite.  "I have no chance of catching these guys," Garthwaite said.   He will if he continues on his current tear, smacking a homer in each of the past two games.  "I just got lucky," Garthwaite repeated.  His teammates laughed after hearing the comment.  "That's not luck," one teammate yelled from across the lockerroom.  If anybody could have used some luck on Sunday, it was High Desert pitcher Chad Petty, who entered the game leading the entire minor leagues in losses with 12.  The Mavericks took an early lead. Chris Morris walked to lead off the game, then scored on a stolen base, a sacrifice bunt and Scott Candelaria's ground ball.  In the second inning, Johnny Raburn scored on an infield single by Ozzie Chavez giving the Mavericks a 2-0 lead  Petty set the first six JetHawks down in order but in the third, after Mike DiRosa doubled, Petty got two quick outs, before walking three consecutive batters. Garthwaite's bases-loaded walk forced in DiRosa making it 2-1. Petty struck out Steve Neal with the bases-loaded to escape further trouble.  The Mavericks got two more runs after Danny Richar booted Frolian Villanueva's ground ball and Raburn tripled him. Raburn scored on Jeremy Frost's groundout increasing their lead to 4-1.  In the fourth, the Mavericks got a scare in the when Kyle Nichols lined a shot off Petty's right leg. Petty fell to the ground, but got up and stayed in the game.  After walking the bases-loaded, then allowing a run to score on Richar's fielder's choice, Petty was lifted from the game.  High Desert reliever Danny Stout retired Dan Uggla to end the inning and the JetHawks stranded three runners for the second consecutive inning, but cut the lead to 4-2  Garthwaite hit his three-run homer in the sixth. It was his seventh home run against High Desert.  The home run was part of a four-run sixth inning for the JetHawks, which included a triple by Jason Gorman and a run-scoring triple by Richar. When it was done, the JetHawks led 6-4.  Lancaster added two runs in the eighth as Garthwaite and Steve Neal singled in runs.  Petty was not saddled with the loss, avoiding his 13th of the season for a Mavericks squad that has fallen to 10-33 in the second half of the season.  The JetHawks improve to 20-24 inthe second half, 59-55 overall, four games behind Lake Elsinore in the wild-card hunt.  Notes:  Jaime Jones was held out of Sunday's game for the second game in a row. Jones suffered a concussion in Friday's game versus High Desert. He is expected to play on Tuesday. ...Charlie Griffen was placed on the DL with an unspecified injury.   This was cut from the story.  it was my favorite part.  A half an hour before the start of Sunday's game at The Hangar, the stadium fire alarm went off. Flashing lights and a beeping alarm threatened to delay the evening's contest. The fire detection system identified that an incident had occurred in the visitor's clubhouse.

      i don't know what category to put this in.  so.  yeah.  Me and my roommate decide to go clubbing.  yeah, i know what you're thinking.  i'm not into that scene at all, but i though it's be fun to check out the subculture and to make an ass out of myself in the process. I dressed in my leisure suit.  we  pay $15 and get into this club on Sunset after crazy traffic and waiting in line forever. i order a Long Island Ice Tea.  I'm already disillusioned at this whole place and on top of it all, the drink was another freaking fifteen bucks!  As i'm fuming about how much I paid for the stupid drink, cursing to myself, and not watching where i'm going, i bump into THIS woman:   http://www.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&group=0831-hig&photo=Events/0831-hig/wagnerna.tas&path=pgallery&path_key=Gregson%20Wagner,%20Natasha  ...and spill my drink all over her.  You may remember her for High Fidelity.  I sure did.  She's the one I had a crush on.  She's most perfect woman in the world.  Ok. I know it's just a movie, but i couldn't help myself. I just stood there staring at her, unable to say anything.  She had this shocked expression on her face, obviously. I began to apologize and kind of hyper-ventilate.  And then, she burst into laughter.  I took that as a good sign. "Your face is ALL red," she said. "That's what happens when I make a complete ass out of myself in front of a beautiful woman." "Now I'm the now blushing," she said. "You're cute." Stop.  Yes.  She said 'You're cute.' Yep. I apologized a hundred more times, then sensing that some sort of ice had been broken, I stuck my hand and introduced myself. "I'm Tasha," she said. "Is that your real name, or just the name you give to guys in leisure suits that pour their Long Island Ice teas all over you?"  yeah.  huh?  smooth?  i'm da man. She laughed. "it's my real name." Since things were rolling along, I tried to test the waters. "So, Yeah, I mean, you're boyfriend is probably going to beat me up when he sees this, huh?." good one, huh?  yeah, I thought so. She smiled a little and said, "I don't have a boyfriend." "Well, I'll be your sugardaddy then," I said.  No.  I did not say that.  that's would be retarded. I was pretty mystified to actually be talking to this incredably hot woman. This is when i realized that in addition to my leisure suit, i was wearing a bright orange shirt unbuttoned to show a healthy dose of my chest hair, yes.  she was still talking to me.  this woman is amazing. Then to my own amazement, i said, "hey, let me buy you a drink." "you're not going to throw it on me are you?" oh, man, she's amazing  i gotta go.  to be continued

While in Budapest I hooked up with a touring circus company. For about a year, I trained bears to ride bicycles and juggle. Upon returning to the U.S., I became fasinated with the hobo culture. I rode the rails for a few months studing their habits. I am in the works of a documentary on my adventures for the Discovery Channel.

      i went to seattle. it was a jayna present. it was fun adventure to the max. we scared trevor with stomps and music. i played basketball. i climbed up a mountain. i ate gizzards (almost). i showed a long island ice tea who was boss. it is not alive anymore.    i wish i had a karate fish. i dream he is my friend . cause if i had a karate fish. your life would hit the end.  karate fish know how to fight. they chop your face to death. they kung fu your fu man chu and sodomize your breath.  beware mere mortals of the ninja life that lives in water and carries knives that num-chucks your mama to the dirty trees and hijacks your bunghole with a hive of bees.  that inflicts your life with metaphysical pain and proves plato's grand myth of the cave.  because.  karate fish will whip you with chains then you won't be feeling so brave.  eh, wise guy?  huh?  what do you think about that?  not so funny now once the ninja fish shows you the kar-ah-tay, huh?  he is the master of the chop to your face.   KARATE CHOP!!!

      A poem by me 2002  the grand easter day hunt for music to identify with, to fry eggs with, to ride down sunset drive with.  listening for that perfect tune that plucks the string of the inner ukalaele and makes it sing more sweetly than any hawaiian ever could--that including don ho, hawaii 5-0, and magnum p.i. too (hawaii.  hawaii.  visions of mini scooters rented for dollars a day, buzzed down streets, and zipped around turns.  images of hikes up volcano cliffs christmas day. a call to mom.  a call to dad.  sorry disconnected before the call was made.  dreams of a colorful tent next to a palm and a bush and wet water splashing all night.  thoughts of that waterfall and that magnificently-shaped texan and the mango we shared [reminding me of a seductive blonde wal-mart girl.  softball player, cigarette breath. a few years my senior.  that night on the boat.  on the road.  in the water.  the sheepdog-sans the sheep-saved the day.  how much did it save when i always want that moment back, recalling in my mind, fighting for a chance not to be the next contestant on 'the waiting game.'  a few hours after, a call to confess and a chance to rest and thank God that He's still there.  however, i voided it all in the preceeding weeks with another summer fling, gave away my ring, filled my hole with helium and it rose to the top.  one down, more to go, an attempt to believe one's better than the other when i'm the one that needs to go {one and then another and then something else.  it was a tiny italian, cocoa shirley temple locks, the best laugh i've ever heard from a female, and she was my type.  God, she was, if there ever was one.  Her smile.  her eyes, that seductive glance without even trying.  we talked of india and united airlines visits to philadelphia.  (i still want to see the liberty bell and the 'rocky' stairs) and...my first kiss.  i stole it in the aisle of an airport souvenir shop.  miami.  we had cuban coffee and laid on the roof of a hotel and dreamed big dreams in front of the atlantic ocean.  that day my favorite ballplayer got traded.  that day i was in love with a tiny italian with cocoa shirley temple locks.  she had that smile too.  that smile.  she was wearing combat boots. and my heart  }]). still the continued search for the perfect song to medicate emotions.  after you feel a little bit of your past in every nice skirt you see.  and the sun goes down and the eyelids go up and dreams disappear and the light turns on and the covers come off and the clothes come on and on and on.  a temporary remedy: a well-placed song.   Spring 2002 It’s fairly simple to toss truth out the window when you feel it doesn’t apply.  But that’s like stargazing at the sun or mooning a planet or visa versa.  Objectively, you realize there’s no need to notice the bluebirds flying when they don’t notice you.  And you know what else?  You can’t see the sky.  That’s why reality TV is such a lie.  We know it’s not real, but choose to believe.  Needing that feeling even if being a fool is the price we pay, permitting ourselves to be transfixed by the pendulum swing of that ubiquitous stopwatch.  Getting sleeeepy.  Sleeeeepy.  Until next thing we know, we dream we’re surrounded by cats and mushrooms and police and one of them is dancing, but we’re afraid to find the function of each.  Or are we the dancing ones?  If so, who gave us lessons?  And why did they want to teach us?  Trying to single out a memory like that from the dark recesses is like a midnight ride on an inbound train from Berlin to Barcelona with a nice little smoke break in between in good ole’ Pair-ee with their so-called idealism and dainty little arch and eyesore phallic art.  One shall be stumped for many moons about whether or not they realize their gall, or if it’s all just an act.  Act?  Pah!  It doesn’t matter.  The constant click of the train on the track is an obvious reaction from the friction it creates, or endures, or is pleased to feel like a dirty little deed afterwork for an overweight, middle-age businessman from the suburbs; tired with his wife, rather, didn’t give her a chance; turned off to her the faucet of his affection and dried his hands on his pants.  And what does he think about when he comes home and tucks his kids in at night?  And can you blame him?  Or feel the same as him?  He’s not the only one.  He’s only one.  Among one, among one, taking the desert drive from a dirty city to a dirty dive and the one’s that know they’ve lost are the one’s who stay alive to travel back to the dirty little city from the dirty little dive.  Spring 2002 we took an oceanside drive, parked under a tree, and snuck out on the beach with a  bottle of bacardi, case of sapporo, and a 2-liter coke.  on the way down to the water, they were terrified by a couple skunks we encountered playing on a well-lit picnic table.  (“they can spray up to twenty feet.”)  we continued down the trail.  the ocean ahead was a mural of darkness.  (“what if a sea monster came out and ate us?)  we stopped to check our supplies at a bench before a bend that went downwards to the left.  i hid in a cave and pretended to be a bear.  we descended, crossed the tracks, and invaded the empty beach.  a train went by too quickly, but i remembered to place a coin for next time.  after a while on the sand, we relocated to the rocks and talked of struggles,  expression, regret and depression.  we commented on the female anatomy.  i learned how to inhale a cigarette.  i made two flattened pennies and a quarter.  as the alcohol was slowly sipped (the styrofoam cups taken from beneath the soda fountain worked just fine), things became more interesting.  we were all intrigued by the indian trick of putting one’s ear to the rail to feel the oncoming train.  it never worked.  one time it took more than flashing lights to peel his head from the steel.  i yelled and called him a dumb ______ ______.  the suggested moments of solitude were an excellent segue to leaving.  after throwing cans in the trash, we noticed a paper under the wiper.  it was a forty-four dollar ticket that i agreed to pay a third of.  Spring 2002 i shouldn’t care it she got her hat in cuba, or how she does her hair, or if she looks good in those pants, or whether or not i like her just because she reminds me of sarah.  is it human to throw down the phone when you think you’ve dialed her home number?  or see her face in place of those of foreign actresses?  or to repeatedly sing a beatles tune just because her name is there?  is it odd that i play out scenarios in my head but dread ever actually talking to her, let alone marrying her?  is she ideal or just set up as a strawwoman (beautifully clothed, tight bodied, but a strawwoman nonetheless), set to collapse the moment i approach/get near.  that’s my real fear; that she isn’t perfect.  the answer is clear but i have hypnotized my mind to believe a lie i’ve implanted deep to avoid the truth i don’t want to hear so i can delay the inevitable death of the perfect girl in my life.  Spring 2002  I heard a song today  that didn’t remind me of anything, but still made me cry.  i sat in my car, leaning across the seats, listening to it on repeat.  i fell asleep. then woke up three hours later  with the tears dried in the corners of my eyes  and the song not quite over.  3-24-02  Over Halfway (for Trevor)  a roof with well-placed spirits and smoke is all friends need to grieve the fragmented past.

      About 275 words				Darren M. Harbaugh 13013 Edwards Road La Mirada, CA  90638 562/***-**** darren.m.harbaugh@bubbs.biola.edu  Buy Me Some Peanuts and Crackerjack  The lights come on in Edison Field, I’ve suited up, and from inside the tunnel I hear the crowd chanting.  The fans are out there waiting for me.  I straighten my cap, take a breath and put on my game face.   I never set foot on the field, but I am as much a part of baseball as the starting pitcher. I hawk peanuts.  Home Field Advantage Senior hawkers (many have worked the stadium for decades) get first choice of territory and product.  Hawkers get a commission on the dollar amount of product they move, so it’s better to hawk ice cream or peanuts than licorice ropes or bottled water.  Senior hawkers usually opt for field level, where more affluent fans sit.  But on sell-out nights, the view section offers the highest hawker-to-fan ratio.  Wander into a senior hawker’s section with your tray of lemonade, and prepare for ejection.  The Call Each hawker’s call must be loud and clear, yet entertaining.  I have adopted a Brooklyn accent— my small tribute to baseball’s golden age, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants ruled the field.   As for volume, I can hear my voice echo off the far side of the stadium.     The Pitch Ice cream and cotton candy are best pitched to children.  I dangle cotton candy close to kids, encouraging them to whine.  If kids ask for ice cream, I’ll hand it over and hope they take a bite before their parents notice.  Peanuts, better directed to middle-aged men, require a more sophisticated approach.  When The Wave circles the stadium, I time it perfectly and yell “Everybody who wants peanuts stand up!”  This ploy never fails.

Howdy.  Things are well.  I'm at work.  I have this job where I basically look up baseball stats on the internet.  That's not what I'm supposed to do, but that's usually what happens.  It's at in the financial department of WW Grainger, big supply company.  Basically, it's like being back at McMaster(****I make a pretty funny joke here, but had to delete it****)-Carr but working in the office.  I fax and stuff.  Tomorrow, I have a big interview at the Antelope Vally Press for an editorial assistant position in the sports department.  It'll be a hell of a commute, over an hour each way, but it'd be a job I like at least.  The Red West has left for their tour.  Word is you'll be meeting up with them.  Dope central.  Jesse went to the Sundance Film Festival and *** *****.  He's doing production assistant work for commercial and he's writing alot.  He's also working at the House of Blues with kids for this educational tour guide thing.  Kooter's doing that too.  Brent's working at Butterfield and Butterfield Auctioneers.  He brings home cool stuff-chairs, tables.  He loads and unloads shipments, like Elvis's guitar and stuff.  Sycz applied to work at a chiropractic school.  and cooks lots of steaks.  Maust brought part of a restaurant booth home with him.  Its in our living room.  I went to good old Seal Beach the other day and passed by that damn poem carved in the cement walking to the beach.  That dumb one about the bugs and the bees and the birds and the worms.  I remember reading that after a few Dos Equis and fish tacos this summer and cursing at it.  I think I talked a lot about ***** ***** that afternoon as well.  well.  have a good one.  enjoy the snow.  I think I'll go to the beach again this weekend and scope all the hot california babes.  cheers.  dmh  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harbaugh 6301 Washington Ave. Whittier, CA  90601 Kalinecobb@yahoo.com Abigail Seymour Editor Attaché Magazine Pace Communications 1301 Carolina St. Greensboro, NC  27401 AttacheAir@aol.com   Dear Ms. Seymour,  Baseball is America’s favorite pastime.  However, this doesn’t mean a thing to bartenders in Berlin, even when Game Four of the World Series is on.  During my backpacking trip to Europe, I discovered that the “World” Series isn’t as universal as its name implies.  It took seven tries until I finally found a bar that was showing the Series and stayed open late to accommodate the 2AM starting time.  After my exhausting cross-town adventure, it didn’t bother me that the broadcast was in German.  In fact, I let the bartender play her techno music.  I didn’t mind explaining the intricacies of the game to the only other guy in the bar, even at four in the morning.  I didn’t correct him when he referred to base hits as “smashes.”  I was watching the World Series, finally, and that’s all that mattered.   “World Series: European Style” is a 2,000-word article.  Photos are available.  I can send clippings of my work at your request.   I have been published in Orange Coast Magazine and have also written numerous articles for The Chimes, a newspaper based in La Mirada, California.   Thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely,   Darren M. Harbaugh

      PAST FROM THE PAST  Date:	Sun, 16 Jun 2002 14:46:11 -0700 (PDT) From:	"darren harbaugh"   | This is spam | Add to Address Book Subject:	to dad To:	nparsons@remc12.k12.mi.us CC:	nparson@remc12.k12.mi.us  Happy Fathers Day!  There's been so much going on.  I just started moving into my new house on friday.  It is in a very cool area in Uptown Whittier.  It is a 5 bedroom house and is about 100 years old.  It's got hardwood floors and looks really cool.  There's 5 guys living in the house now, but there will be 7 or 8 in the fall.  Im really excited about it.  We are just a few blocks from a really cool area with a movie theater, internet cafe (where Im at now)  record shops, restaurants, clubs, everything all just blocks away.  I also started a new job on monday.  I work from 2:30 pm to 1am in a warehouse.  I work for a industrial supply company and Im on the move team.  They added a third level and move all the material up there.  my job is to unload the forklift on the third floor.  I have to wear a harness in case i fall.  I like the job.  i work with some of my friends from biola and make 12 dollars and hour.  I wouldnt work the job normally, but it's good money and i need to save up to go to europe in the fall..  graduation was cool, wish you could have been there.  you kind of were because I tacked a picture of you and me at my high school graduation to my hat.    Sorry that I havent written more.  The last few weeks have been hectic.  I've been nervous and stress and not as reliant on God as I should be.  But I've been going to Grace Brethen of Long Beach for a while now and im trying to get pluged in now that I cant lean on biola any more.  i might even try to work with the high school group.  my friends matt and billy go there too, so its a good community.  im only gonna be working angel games on the weekends.  next up is dodgers last weekend of june.  if you don't know, lakers and redwings are the champions in their respective sports.  3 in a row for LA.  i wont be using the credit card anymore.  i guess i need to be financially independent now.  ill transfer the car insurance when I come home the end of august.  I'm a little scared about life on my own, but i'm pretty excited too.  Thanks for preparing me.  without your guidence, i'd be lost for sure.  i miss you and hope you have a good father's day.     love darren  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      anyway, on that last post.  I got Tasha's #, but I'm too scared to call.  We'll see what happens  I don't feel like writing, so I'll just post some excerpt from recent emails i've written.  Regarding bad relationships:  Yeah, unhealthy relationships are great. Such a good way to stun spiritual and emaotional growth. I make myself sick sometimes. I'm not in the "i'm never gonna get married" camp. Because I really want to, but I think I'd be wise if i held off on all that kind of stuff untill I'm about 30. I'd save a lot of hassle. Although, I know that I'll throw all this idealism out the window for the next pretty skirt that walks around the corner. c'est la vie...  ...Yeah, it's weird.  It's like something takes over your mind. Yeah. That's it. It's mind control. Amorous feelings in the wrong context can be deadly. Definitely gives you some kind of brain damage...Damn. What is that? It isn't love. I think it's just temporary retardation.  That is, unless you do end up getting married then I think it becomes a form of prison once you realize how stupid you are.  Regarding smoking and drinking:  I like beer. It might be my favorite beverage. I love going to pubs with my buddies and having a pint...  ...Yeah, I never drank or smoked until I was 20.  I'm a late bloomer. And yes, coffee is a solid number 2 for me. For a while I enjoyed a little coffee and bailey's in the mornings before class.  Now that was a drink.  :) Oh man, all my friends smoke like fiends.  i don't know where it came from, but everybody. yeah. it's weird. I resisted for a while, then i picked it up.  I've all but quit since being away from their evil influence. But man, in Europe I smoked like chimney.  I was at my height which was, at times, half a pack a day.  That was pretty hard to maintain though. I can't smoke more than 3 cigs a day with out feeling sick and gross.  But, i must say, there are certain times that a smoke is quite appealing. -When one is ont he back porch at night shooting the breeze with friends. -When one is enjoying a coffee either at night or in the morning. -When one is enjoying alcoholic beverages. -When one is in a foreign land.  Regarding the best beverage ever:  Sidebar: I have invented the most savory beverage on the planet — the Guinness milkshake.  They are more than excellent and I highly recommend them.  (If anybody steals that idea and markets it, I will bludgon you with a show horn)  Regarding Teen Missions International:  I was reflecting on the Ukraine trip with my buddy Trevor.  I don't if I told you about Trevor. He's my best friend.  He was on my '95 TMI Thailand team, we were roommates at Biola.  Anyways. The Thailand trip was fun, but the leaders weren't the greatest. Obviously you know about the Belize trip.  I'm just glad it didn't scar me too deeply. The Ukraine trip was unique to me. I don't know if i was just young and naive, but Everybody on the team just seemed really cool, like no real trouble makers...So in summary.  I like the Ukraine trip. Very positive, very life-forming.  Reguarding Vice City:  Um, yeah.  I was addicted to Vice City for a while. That game kicks the asses of every other game in the world. There are like 25 million ways to kill people in that game.  The problem with it all is that it affects you after you are done playing.  Like I'll be driving in real life and be sizing up things I could possibly jump. Or when I see a police car, I want to steal it. That's never good.  Regarding my crappy car:  Despite all the good things that have been going on recently, the past 2 weeks have not been too pleasant for me.  My car is dead. Well, not dead, it's just been in the shop for 2 weeks and will cost me lots of money which does not make me happy. The whole situation is pretty crappy. I took some vacation days so I could go watch the Detroit Tigers play in Anaheim and because of no car I had to sit on the sofa all weekend.  Boo.  Regarding my foul mouth:  I don't think swearing is something you necessarily do when you get older. I would think It would normally peak at the pre-teen ages. My language has gotten a bit out of control. I consider it one of my more obvious character flaws. I think it's mostly a product of being lazy. Foul words are much too easy of a way to express a mood. It's harder to confront a situation head on than it is to swear at it. I would consider my passiveness, sloth, and apathy much more devastating but less obvious character flaws than swearing though all tend to be equally repulsive.

      Conan O’Brien’s Speech to the Harvard Class of 2000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  I’d like to begin by thanking the class marshals for inviting me here today. The last time I was invited to Harvard it cost me $110,000. So I was reluctant to show up. I’m going to start before I really begin by announcing my one goal this afternoon. I want to be half as funny as tomorrow’s Commencement speaker, moral philosopher and economist Amartya Sen. That’s the job. Must get more laughs than seminal wage-price theoretician. By the way, enjoy that. Bring a calculator. It’s going to be a nerd fest.  Students of the Harvard class of 2000, 15 years ago I sat where you sit now. And I thought exactly what you are now thinking. What’s going to happen to me? Will I find my place in the world? Am I really graduating a virgin? Still have 24 hours. Roommate’s mom very hot. Swear she’s checking me out. There was that Rob Lowe movie.  Being here today, on a sincere note, is very special for me. I do miss this place. I especially miss Harvard Square. Let me tell you, (you don’t know this) Harvard Square is unique. Nowhere else in the world will you find a man wearing a turban and a Red Sox jacket working in a lesbian bookstore. I’m just glad my dad’s working.  It’s particularly sweet for me to be here today because—this is true—when I graduated I wanted very badly to be a Class Day speaker. Unfortunately, my speech was rejected. So if you’ll indulge me I’d like to read a portion of that speech. This is the actual speech from 15 years ago. “Fellow students, as we sit here today listening to that classic A-ha tune which will definitely stand the test of time, I would like to make several predictions about what the future will hold. I believe that one day a simple governor from a small southern state will rise to the highest office in the land. He will lack political skill, but will lead on the sheer strength of his moral authority. I believe that justice will prevail and one day the Berlin Wall will crumble, uniting East and West Berlin forever under Communist rule. I believe that one day a high-speed network of interconnected computers will spring up worldwide, so enriching people that they will lose their interest in idle chitchat and pornography. And finally, I believe that one day I will have a television show on a major network seen by millions of people at night which I will use to reenact crimes and and help catch at-large criminals.” Then I had a section on the death of Wall Street, but you don’t need to hear about that.  The point is that although you see me as a celebrity, a member of the cultural elite, a demigod if you will, and potential husband material, I came here in the fall of 1981 and lived at Holworthy Hall as a student much like you. I was, without exaggeration—this is true—the ugliest picture in the freshman facebook. When Harvard asked me for a picture the previous summer, I thought it was for their records, so I jogged in the August heat to a passport photo office and sat for a morgue shot. To make matters worse, when the facebook came out, they put my picture right next to Catherine Oxenberg, a stunning blonde actress who was expected to join the class of ‘85, but decided to defer admission so she could join the cast of Dynasty. Folks, my photo would have looked bad on any page, but next to Catherine Oxenberg, I looked like a mackerel that had been in a car accident.  You see, in those days, I was 6 feet 4 inches tall and I weighed 150 pounds. True. Recently, I had some structural engineers run those numbers into a computer model, and according to the computer, I collapsed in 1987, killing hundreds in Taiwan.  After freshman year, I moved to Mather House. Mather House, incidentally, was designed by the same firm that built Hitler’s bunker. In fact, if Hitler had conducted the war from Mather House, he would have shot himself a year earlier. Saved us a lot of trouble.  1985 seems like a long time ago now. When I had my Class Day, you students would have been seven years old. Seven years old! You realize what that means? Back then I could have beaten any of you in a fight. And I mean really badly. Like no contest at all. If anyone here has a time machine, seriously, I will kick your seven-year-old butt right now.  A lot has happened in 15 years though. When you think about it, we come from completely different worlds. When I graduated in 1985, we watched movies starring Tom Cruise and listened to music by Madonna. I come from a time when we huddled around the TV set and watched the Cosby Show on NBC, never imagining that there would one day be a show called Cosby on CBS. In 1985 we drove cars with driver’s-side air bags. But if you had told us that one day there would be passenger-side air bags, we’d have burned you for witchcraft.  Of course I think there is some common ground between us. I remember well the great uncertainty of this day, the anxiety. Many of you are justifiably nervous about leaving the safe, comfortable world of Harvard Yard and hurling yourself headlong into the cold, harsh world of Harvard grad school, a plum job in your father’s firm, or a year abroad with a gold Amex card and then a plum job at your father’s firm. Let me assure you that the knowledge you gained here at Harvard is a precious gift that will never leave you. Take it from me, your education is yours to keep forever. Why, many of you have read the Merchant of Florence, and that will inspire you when you travel to the island of Spain. Your knowledge of that problem they had with those people in Russia, or that guy in South America—you know, the guy—will be with you for the rest of your life.  There’s also sadness today. A feeling of loss that you’re leaving Harvard forever. Let me assure you that you never really leave Harvard. The Harvard fundraising committee will be on your ass until the day you die.  This is true. I know for a fact that right now a member of the alumni association is at the Mount Auburn Cemetery shaking down the corpse of Henry Adams. They heard he has a brass toe ring and they aim to get it. These people just raised $2.5 billion and they only got through the Bs in the alumni directory. Here’s basically how it works. Your phone rings, usually after a big meal when you’re tired and most vulnerable, and a voice asks you for money. Knowing—you’ve read in the paper—that they just raised $2.5 billion, you ask, “What do you need it for?” There is a long pause, and the voice on the other end of the line says, “We don’t need it, we just want it.” (Sinister laugh).  Let me see—by your applause—who here wrote a thesis? That’s nice. A lot of hard work went into that thesis. And no one is ever going to care. I wrote a thesis—this is true, I don’t lie—“Literary Progeria in the Works of Flannery O’Connor and William Faulkner.” Let’s just say that during my discussions with Pauly Shore, it doesn’t come up much. For three years after graduation I wanted to show it to everyone, and so I kept my thesis in the glove compartment of my car, so that I could show it to a policeman in case I was pulled over.  What else can you expect in the real world? Let me tell you. As you leave these gates and re-enter society, one thing is certain. Everyone out there is going to hate you. Never tell anyone in a roadside diner that you went to Harvard. In those situations, the correct response to, “Where did you go to school?” is “School? I never had much in the way of book learnin’ and such.” And then get in your BMW and get the hell out of there. Go.  You see, kids, you’re in for a lifetime of “And you went to Harvard?” Accidentally give the wrong amount of change in a transaction, and it’s “And you went to Harvard?” Ask at the hardware store how the jumper cables work, and hear “And you went to Harvard?” Forget just once that your underwear goes inside your pants, and it’s “And you went to Harvard?” Get your head stuck in your niece’s doll house ‘cause you want to see what it’s like to be a giant, and it’s “Uncle Conan, you went to Harvard?”  So you really know what’s in store for you after Harvard, I have to tell you what happened to me after graduation. I’m going to tell it simply, I’m going to tell it honestly, because, first of all, I think my perspective may give many of you hope, and, secondly, it’s such a cool, amazing rush to be in front of 6,000 people and just talk about yourself. It’s just great. It’s so cool. And I can take my time.  You see, kids, after graduating in May, I moved to Los Angeles. I got a three-week contract at a small cable show. I got a $380-a-month apartment, a terrible dump, and I bought a 1977 Isuzu Opal, a car Isuzu only manufactured for a year because they found out that technically it’s not a car. Quick tip, graduates—no four-cylinder used vehicle should have a racing stripe.  So I worked on that show for about a year, feeling pretty good about myself, when one day they told me that they were letting me go. I was fired. I hadn’t saved any money. So I tried to get another job in television as best I could and couldn’t find one. So with nowhere else to turn-true story—I went to a temp agency and filled out a questionnaire. I made damn sure that they knew I had been to Harvard, that I had written this thesis, and that I expected the very best treatment. And so the next day I was sent to the Santa Monica branch of Wilson’s House of Suede and Leather.  When you have a Harvard degree, and you are working at Wilson’s House of Suede and Leather, you are haunted by the ghostly images of your classmates who chose graduate school. You see their faces everywhere—in coffee cups, in fish tanks, you think you’re going crazy, and they’re always laughing at you as you stack suede shirts no man in good conscience would ever wear.  I tried a lot of things during this period. Acting in corporate infomercials. Serving drinks in a nonequity theater. I even took a job entertaining at a seven year-old’s birthday party. In desperate need of work, I put together some sketches and scored a job at the fledgling Fox network as a writer and performer for a brainy show called the “Wilton North Report.” I was finally on a network and really excited. The producer told me the show was going to revolutionize television. And, in a way it did. The show was so hated and did so badly that when four weeks later news of its cancellation was announced to the Fox affiliates, they burst into spontaneous applause.  Eventually, though, I got a big break. I had submitted along with my writing partner a batch of sketches to Saturday Night Live, and after a year and a half they read it, and they gave us a two-week tryout. The two weeks turned into two seasons, and I felt, hey, this is success, I’m successful now. Successful enough to write a TV pilot for an original sitcom. When the network decided to make it, feeling good, I left Saturday Night Live.  This TV show was going to be groundbreaking. It was going to resurrect the career of TV’s Batman, Adam West. It was going to be a comedy without a laugh track or a studio audience. It was going to change all the rules. And here’s what happened. When the pilot aired, it was the second-lowest-rated television show of all time. It is actually tied with a test pattern they show up in Nova Scotia.  So I was 28 and, once again, no job. I had good writing credits in New York, but I was filled with disappointment and I had no idea what I was going to do next. And that is when the Simpsons saved my life. I got a job there and started writing episodes about Springfield getting a monorail or Homer going to college. I was finally putting my Harvard education to good use—writing dialogue for a man who is so stupid that in one episode he forgot to make his own heart beat. Life was good.  And then an insane, inexplicable opportunity came my way, a chance to audition for host of the new “Late Night” show. I took the opportunity very seriously, but at the time—I have to be honest—I had the relaxed confidence of someone who knew he had no real shot, so I couldn’t fear losing a great job that I could never hope to have. And I think that actually that attitude made the difference.  I will never forget being in the Simpsons recording basement that morning when the phone rang. It was for me. My car was blocking a firelane. But a week later I got another call and got the job. So this, finally, was undeniably it. The truly life-altering break that I had always dreamed of. And so I went to work. I gathered all my funny friends and poured all my years of comedy experience into building the show over the summer. I gathered the talent, figured out the sensibility, found Max, found Andy, found my people. We debuted on September 13, 1993, and I was really happy, really happy, with our effort. I felt like I had seized the moment, that I had put my very best foot forward.  And this was what the most respected and widely read television critic, Tom Shales, wrote in the Washington Post. “O’Brien is a living collage of annoying nervous habits. He giggles and jiggles about and fiddles with his cuffs. He has dark, beady little eyes like a rabbit. He is one of the whitest white men ever. O’Brien is a switch on the guest who won’t leave: he’s the host who should never have come. Let the Late Show with Conan O’Brien become the late Late Show, and may the host return to whence he came.” There’s more, but it gets kind of mean.  Needless to say, I took a lot of criticism, some of it deserved, some of it excessive, and, to be honest with you, it hurt like you would not believe. But I’m telling you all this for a reason. I’ve had a lot of success. I’ve had a lot of failure. I’ve looked good. I’ve looked bad. I’ve been praised. And I’ve been criticized. But my mistakes have been necessary. I’ve dwelled on my failures today because, as graduates of Harvard, your biggest liability is your need to succeed, your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve. Success is a lot like a bright white tuxedo. You feel terrific when you get it, but then you’re desperately afraid of getting it dirty, of spoiling it.  I left the cocoon of Harvard, I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live, I left the cocoon of the Simpsons. And each time it was bruising and tumultuous. And yet every failure was freeing, and today I’m as nostalgic for the bad as I am for the good. So that’s what I wish for all of you—the bad as well as the good. Fall down. Make a mess. Break something occasionally. Know that your mistakes are your own unique way of getting to where you need to be. And remember that the story is never over.  If you’ll indulge me for just a second, I’d like to read a little something from just this year. “Somehow, Conan O’Brien has transformed himself into the brightest star in the late-night firmament. His comedy is the gold standard, and Conan himself is not only the quickest and most inventive wit of his generation, but quite possibly the greatest host ever.”  Ladies and gentlemen, class of 2000, I wrote that this morning. As proof that when all else fails, you always have delusion. I will go now to make bigger mistakes and to embarrass this fine institution even more. But let me leave you with one last thought. If you can laugh at yourself, loud and hard, every time you fall, people will think you’re drunk. Thank you.

      yogi bear knows how to stare down would be terrorists.  kinda like nic cage, except in real life.  yog' masquarades around with all those picnic baskets and mr. ranger sir, but in actuallity he's a double agent with an amazing ability plus quite an extensive an all-inclusive vocabulary.  boo boo?  he's a dupe.  a cuckhold.  he doesn't know his ass from his elbow.  probably stoned all the time, should go hang out with shaggy in the back of the mystery machine.  too bad yog' didn't hang out with snagglepuss, he was one dope dude.  i've tried to love huckleberry hound, mostly because he's got such a cool name, but to no avail.  snag' was tops.  can you imagine him and yog' crusing around jellystone in mr ranger sir's jeep.  that'd be sweet.  yog' pimping it with honey bear, who in my opinion was one foxy foxy tune.  of course should couldn't touch betty rubble, jessica rabbit, kim bassinger in cool world, or belle, well, while we're at it we might as well throw in ariel, snow white, cinderella and sleeping beauty (i'm not really a betty boop fan), but for all intents and purposes, as far as animal tunes goes honey is a hottie.  minnie ain't bad.  daisy duck, no.  but yog' definatly knows how to pick em.  i wonder if she knows about his double life as a secret agent.  'the negotiator' was origionally going to star him, but yog' didn't get along with the director.  it goes back to some arguement they had at acme university.  yog' played a big part in a recent flare up in the west back.  he didn't get much press though.  i think it's speciesism.  just because he's a bear gives the press no right to deny him credit.  oh well, it's an uphill battle for the furry ones, but God willing, it's one they can overcome, so that one day we will all be equal.

      one of the most pleasing things on this little planet is to sit on a paint-peeled park bench and watch geese waddle by talking among themselves as they go.  what do they say?  i haven't a clue but i know for a fact they they become most offended when i try and listen in.  one thursday a gander attacked me for no apparent reason or provocation.  i was halfway offended but (relating back to yogi) i realized and took into account our speciesial differences.  The gander may have had a hard life.  perhaps a poor irish immigrant brought up in brooklyn going to the school of hard knocks.  sacrificing for his family-mother and seven siblings.  trying to make ends meet.  giving up his last nickel for milk when he'd rather go to as picture show.  losing his sweetheart on account of long hours in the shop and the resulting crankiness afterwards.  an abusive father who died young on the shipyards and the overbearing mother impossible to please.  all this came to a head with my eavesdropping.  i can understand.  this ain't a perfect world.  we gotta cut corners somewhere.  but God bless America and thank God we're still alive to tell about it after that God awful war with the germans.  at least we're still waddling

Tunneling for a Brew Thu Sep 4,10:26 AM ET  SEOUL (Reuters) - Two South Koreans have been detained on suspicion of digging a tunnel to smuggle more than $1.5 million worth of beer and wine out of a U.S. military base in central Seoul, customs officials said on Thursday.   They said the two men opened a cafe -- called the "U-Turn Espresso Coffee Shop" -- as a front. A tunnel led from there to a cargo container inside the base 20 yards away.   "An anonymous caller notified police of the smuggling ring operations two months ago, and the two leaders were detained on Monday," customs spokesman Cho Min-ho told Reuters.   He said the suspects removed 58,000 boxes of beer and 4,000 cases of wine worth about $1.7 million. The alcohol was sold on the black market.   "No American soldiers were found to be involved in the operations yet," said Ji Gwang-ho, an official at the South Korean Customs Service, by telephone.   Cho said the tunnel had been built with a slight incline and equipped with rollers so the boxes of drink could be easily removed.

      FUNNY FRENCH LIGHTNING  i saw a lot of lightning tonight. crazy stuff that lightning. it's bright and scary. i'm glad i wasn't electrocuted. could have been a sorry sight. like that guy in 'the great outdoors.'   i was surfing the net and stumbled across this comic genius from the  urlLink anti-french joke page    (120) Date:   04/04/03  Name:   Ms Aurelie Catena  Sex:    female  Age:    not given  Joke(s):   Hi!  First to know you must that not my first language is English and thus strange will look my sentences.  Anyway by the words is not stopped the Wise and only the Meaning he does consider.  Moreover, the joke I'm going to send (it will come, be patient) was originally sent to me in German, which is also not my first language, and I had to translate it into English. Hopefully it will have kept all its original sting after the two-step processing. Here it is (for those among you who prefer to read it in the original version, I shall put it at the end):  Three Texan surgeons are playing golf and discuss about the latest advances in surgery. The first surgeon says: "I'm the best surgeon in Texas. A pianist lost 7 fingers during an accident, I took care of him and 8 months later he gave a private concert for the Queen of England".  The second says: "That's crap. A young man lost both arms and one leg during an accident, I took care of him and two years later he won a golden medail at the Olympic games."  Then the third spoke: "Your are but amateurs. A few years ago, a man, drunk from alcohol and cocain, was hit frontally by a train at 80 mph. All that was left from the accident was the arse of his horse and his cow-boy's hat. By now he is president of the France !"  Funny, isn'it?  Aurelie  And now, for those who prefer it, the German version:  Drei Texanische Chirurgen spielen Golf und unterhalten sich über die Fortschritte in der Chirurgie. Einer sagt, "ich bin der beste Chirurg in Texas. Ein Konzertpianist verlor 7 Finger bei einem Unfall, Ich habe sie wieder angenäht und 8 Monate später hat er ein privat Konzert bei der Königin von England gegeben."  Ein anderer sagt. "Das ist nichts. Ein junger Mann verlor beide Arme und beide Beine bei einem Unfall, Ich habe sie wieder angenäht und 2 Jahre später hat er eine Goldmedaille an den olympischen Spielen gewonnen."   Der dritte Chirurg meint, "Ihr seid Amateure. Vor einigen Jahren ritt ein Mann high von Kokain und Alkohol frontal in einen Zug der mit 80 Meilen daher kam. Alles was noch übrig war, war das Arsch des Pferdes und der Hut des Cowboys. Heute ist er Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten."

         I sold my car. My contact for the whole operation was a man named Johnny. Johnny and I met Wednesday night at a 7-11 parking lot in Glendale, halfway between Whittier and Thousand Oaks I got there a little early so I went in and looked at motorcycle trader magazines. Then I got back in my car and listened to Phil Hendrie. Johnny pulled up next to me. I got out and Johnny taked on his cell phone for 10 minutes before he communicated with me. He was from Lebannon. The car was for his cousin Fahd (or something close to that) who had just arrived from Syria. I rode in the passenger seat of my Eclipse as Johnny test drove the car. It was an odd experience. I don't know if I've ever ridden in the passenger seat of my car before. My perspective was all askew. I felt uncomfortable. We talked a bit. I told him about the car. I realized that I am a great one-on-one conversationalist with strangers. I think it comes from my Midwest upbringing. Also my mom can and does talk to anybody and everybody no matter the situation. So after a while of shooting the breeze, Johnny says, "You're a nice guy." "What was that?" I said. "You're a nice guy." "Oh. Thanks." I was taken aback. You don't get many out-of-the-blue, but genuine complements from people, let alone strangers. We got back to the parking lot and were met by Fahd and his father. I stood next to the car as they all conversed in arabic. I was powerless. I understood the words "toyota", "nissan", and "honda." Fahd's father owned a liquor store. He drove a hard bargain. I figured he could barter circles around me, so I didn't put up much of a fight at his price. Since I was now wheeless, Johnny and Fahd drove me back to Whittier. They spoke Armenian most of the way back. They apologized. Fahd didn't speak much English. Somehow I revealed that I was from Michigan. "That is why you are so nice," Johnny said, "you aren't from here." Johnny has lived here for 11 years. He is married and has a son. "This is not a good place to raise children. I am looking to get out." I didn't argue with him. "I consider myself white, I've lived here so long," Johnny said. I told him how different it was coming from an all white community to being a minority among the hispanic population in Los Angeles. "Yeah, I respect the white guys around here. They're the only ones when they walk into places," he said. He dropped me off and I watched my car drive away without me in it. I was relieved.  I'll tell you, that car was weighing me down. It was just a bad omen. I dreaded getting into it. Who knew what would happen next. Most of my memories of the car are connected to standing on the side of the freeway with the car unable to run. I felt it was best to put the old girl out to pasture. Then these guys come along and offer me some sweet flow. I was willing to accept anything more than a cup of coffee. No less.  Ah, the memories. Rear-ending a drunk lady on the highway James Dean died on. Getting side-swipped next to Wal-mart. Getting rear-ended on the way to a David Wilcox show. The alternator dying on the way home form covering the JetHawks. The stories go on and on. That car was like a retarted distant sibling. You have some kind of affection for It, mostly pity. Though you don't want to admit pity, but you don't know why you don't want to admit it. You feel ackward around It, but you don't want to appear ackward. You spend more time with It than you have to because you feel you should. On second thought, it think the car was more like a bad girlfriend. It took up all my time. Demanded more attention than other cars. Was stubborn. Finicky. Did what It wanted to do, when It wanted to do it. I wasted all my money on It. It used and abused me and made me It's bitch. So I finally kicked it to the curb.  I am leaving california for awhile. I am planning on a month or two. I should hear back from inetwork in early october (at least that's the word on the street). I could possibly be in Michigan for a few weeks then had back to L.A. or I could stay for a few months if the gig doesn't work out. I'll be back in california sometime in any case. I really hope this job works out. It's a bit stressful waiting on this whole thing one way or the other. Even if I don't get the job, I want to try an weasel my way into entertainment in any case. It will be some sort of combo or working the standup scene, and calaborating with Landa and one T. Downie. Though, I think it might be a little while before Trevor move back down to So Cal, but I believe he will some day.  The travel show, that's the ticket, brothers and sisters. I would be a phenomonon. And you know, if this itv thing works out, I want to be in front of the camera at some point in time. The nation won't be able to get enough of me. I am a Hungarian feast for cameras everywhere. I give them my permission to chow down. Honestly, I know the ways of the ladies. Cupid has be kid to me. Females everywhere desire to run their fingers though my chest hair. I am a machine.   Sept. eleven Nice trasition there, huh? I don't really know what to write about this. -9/11/02 We were in Granada, Spain, recent arrived from Madrid via a 2 hour stop in Sevilla. Billy had to leave his airport worker part-tive lover in the capital. We walked around the city a while till we found a desent hotel. The next day was the 11th. We walked up to the Alhambra, this giant Moorish fortress. I believe was smoked some hookah that day as well. I know we wandered, as usual. I ate some food. At night we went to this bar across the street from our hotel. I drank some local brew. Six of them actually. Every beer we ordered came with a plate of tapas, some apetitzer-like combo of potatos or meat or sauce or whatever. We stayed there a while. A 9-11 retrospect was showing on the tv in spanish. We drank and drank and were sad. I still get sad when ever I think of the day in question. What a shock. I was a senior at Biola and Trevor woke me up in the morning. I was mad. I wanted to sleep. We turned on the tv just in time to see the first tower collapse. I shouted ever obsenity I could think of. It still frightens me. That image is burned into my mind. It was like I was spiritually thrown against the wall by some cosmic force. A metaphysical concussion. It could have been the apocalypse. It was that jarring. It wasn't supposed to happen. It's like waking up and somevody telling me that Hawaii sunk into the ocean. It's inconceivable. I went out and bought a Dylan cd that day. Then didn't go to classes for about a week, just walked around in a daze. The next year in Spain, we drank. The waitstaff noticed us. Before closing, they brought us, teary-eyed Americans each a shot of something that was warm and good. I was closer to 9/11 in Spain than here in the desert. Here I am distant from everything I know. I've forgot my childhood. I believe that is why I am going home. To be reminded of where I came from. Everything is coming to a head at the end of this month. The Manor will be no more, My job is no more, Jason will be married, Andy and Matt go to Europe, The Red West cd comes out. Then shortly thereafter (hopefully) the itv verdict is handed down. Boom.   Trevor and Jayna just got back from Cinque Terre. I love that place. Billy and I arrive there with a fella named Chris. Chris was a drummer from New York City. We met him in a internet cafe in Barcelona. We first went to Nice for a day, but that scene wasn't too happening especially not for Chris. So down to Cinque Terre we went. It's between Genoa and Pisa, five beautiful fishing villages on the coast. We found a hotel room for two, then snuck the third in. It wasn't all that cheap, but damn was it beautiful. The first night we went to this awesome restaurant. I believe it might have been one of the finest meals I've ever had. Seafood pasta, made by an old, bald Italian man, brought steaming hot in a giant cauldron to our table. After that we made our way out to a jetty and drank wine under a nearly full moon listening to the wave lap against the rocks. We just sat and thought, The way you do on a long drive to a destination you love. No nervousness. No stress. All thoughts were creative, pleasantly reflective thoughts. I wish I was married and was sitting next my wife. I opened my eyes and looked to my left and there was Billy, imagine my disappointment. Anyway, we even talked to Chris about God that night. Not in a preachy way at all, but in a open maketplace of ideas sort of way. It was a very satisfying converstation on a very pleasant evening. The next day we hiked to the other towns. Simply beautiful. We went cliff-diving and laid on rocks like lizards soaking up the sun. That night we went to this bar in Monterosso. Billy stole a Beck Cd cover off the bathroom wall. I met two bartenders from Seattle as Billy and Chris talk to some girl. They kept buying me Jegerbombs (jegermeister and redbull) after I had already drank a liter of the sweetest nectar on earth (Bud). I drank four of those puppies in a half and hour then neatly deposited all that liquid and half of a fine pasta dish down the hall in the toilet. Also in the bar that night was an interesting speciman. It was a girl. I forget her name, but Billy thought she was from Washington. He went up to her and ask here where she was from. She responded with something to the effect of "Go to hell" or "F- off." Billy reported back to us. Chris said that she was going to pay for that. And yes, she did pay for that. The first sign of trouble was that she smoked obcenely thin cigarrettes, Qtip-like. That should have tipped me off right away. As the evening progressed, we all drank more then decided to go swimming. Billy, Chris, Me, the two bartenders, and the Qtip girl. One of the bartenders ran in nude so we all followed suit. Qtip kept shouting things like, "Don't look" and "Stay away from me!," like she was hot stuff or something. Billy responded with, "Don't flatter yourself, Honey." I was highly amused. Well, during our nocturnal aquatic advantures, Chris had snuck back to shore and pilfered Qtip's towel, sweater and bra. We all finished our swim and Qtip blew a gasket. I found her room key a few steps away and stuffed it in my pocket. Chris adamently denied any wrong-doing. The two bartender guys helped her look for her key as we went home. "Darren wouldn't take your key.  He's a good guy," they said, "It was probably that guy from New York." Well, I felt bad that those guys searched the sand for a while, but I haven't lost any sleep over it. So Chris, Billy and I went back to our room and stuff the clothing behind a dresser. Then we sat on the porch and drank and laughed over our misadventures of the day. That morning Qtip burst into our room. Apparently, she was staying in the room nest to us and hear us talking about stealing her stuff. Chris pulled the perfect "I-have-no-idea-what-you're-taking-about" schtick. She was pissed but left. Chris left altogether later that day to go to Rome. And Billy and I eventually gave the Chick back her stuff. She amazingly enough was cool about the whole thing. The bartenders gave me some friendly hell though. "We're out there in the sand, on our hands and knees, looking for this damn key defending your name." Sorry guys. The night before we left, Billy and I sat on this ledge next to the ocean and smoked some camels. There was this restuarant nearby blasting The Police's greatest hits over the water. It was honestly one of the best musical expeciences I've ever had. I want to go back there some day.   Lancaster R.I.P Sunday will be my last day in the Antelope Valley, so here is my tribute to the AV.   This is The Hangar, where the JetHawks played. I was here a lot.    This is what the AV looks like.  The Antelope Valley is a 3,000-square-mile high desert closed basin that straddles northern Los Angeles County and southern Kern County. One of nine California valleys with the same name, this one lies in the western Mojave high desert and includes the communities of Lancaster, Palmdale, Rosamond and Mojave. Populated by different cultures for an estimated 11,000 years, the Antelope Valley was a trade route for Native Americans traveling from Arizona and New Mexico to California's coast. Though the first wave of non-native exploration took place in the early 1770s, a later exploratory period starting in the 1840s led to the valley's first permanent settlement during the following decade, fueled by California's Gold Rush and new status as American territory. The 1854 establishment of the Fort Tejon military post near Castac Lake and Grapevine Canyon created a gateway for valley traffic.   Several developments were integral to the valley's growth starting in the mid-1800s, including gold mining in the Kerns and Owens rivers; cattle ranching; the start of a Butterfield stagecoach route in 1858; construction of the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco telegraph line in 1860; completion of the Southern Pacific Railroad line in 1876; and ample rainfall during the 1880s and early 1990s, which attracted many farmers. The decade-long drought that began in 1894-the worst in southern California's recorded history-decimated the regional economy and forced many settlers to abandon their homesteads, but after the turn of the twentieth century irrigation methods and electricity brought back local farming. The 1913 completion of the aqueduct spanning 233 miles between the Owens Valley and Los Angeles also revived the valley's economy. Today the Antelope Valley retains elements of its agricultural past but its economic base is now supported by aerospace and defense industries.  ANTELOPE VALLEY FACTS  The Joshua Tree, that is found here locally, is not a tree or a cactus ! ! (Yucca brevifolia) The Joshua Tree, the largest of the yuccas, grows only in the Mojave Desert. Natural stands of this picturesque, spike-leafed evergreen grow nowhere else in the world. Its height varies from 15-40 feet with a diameter of 1-3 feet. Originally thought to be members of the lily family, the Joshua Tree and other yuccas have been reclassified as members of the agave (century plant) family.

             Ever seen a motorcycle drive into a house? I have. Billy crashed his motorcycle into The Manor. He smashed through a door and did wheelies around the living room. Not quite, but wood and glass were exciled to the nether regions of the house in any case. It was really impressive. He revved up and tore right into the side of the house. Wham! Crash! Smash! Splendid. That reckless device, spewing fumes into the atomosphere, merged with the pine, glass and metal for one brief instant. Ah, and a glorious instant it was, however brief. Though as we see in the prologue, all good things must come to and end. And they did. In the form of the moto deciding to discontinue its journey through the woodwork and stall, wedged in the frame. That gets the adrenaline pumping. Billy should probably give  urlLink these guys   a call.       This is a picture of us after he drove the bike into the house.      This is Sylvia      Here's Lola.   I am flying home on the 3rd of October. Good times.

      We used to have a grocery store in the middle of town. It burnt down when I was six. My mother and I were inside, an alarm went off and we had to evacuate. I remember standing outside, underneath a blinking red light, watching flames shoot into the sky.  All that was left was tiles. Broken, charred tiles for years and years. I rode my bike back and forth over them and pretended I was riding though aisles of produce.  They built a new store, a bigger store, outside of town. I would ride to it on the old railroad track that was now just a white stone path. Then up a hill and through a cornfield to pick up dinner or ice cream.  The tiles are gone. They have been replaced by a dentist office and a bank. And green grass and trees But they are not very appealing to me.

        Trev, Jayna, and Me on my trip to Washington.  I hope that guy moves down to California soon. I miss him. He is a good friend. We've had many good times together. Friends are good. Last night, we (jeese, i, billy, andy, matt beth) were sitting on the porch, as usual, discussing hopes and fears. I realized how much I value my friends. My job sucked not because of anything job-related, but because it took me away from my community. I need their support and fellowship more than anything. Without that, I'm dead.         This is my wife  urlLink Katie . Our 1 year aniversary is coming up in October. We're going to the Cinque Terre in Italy.      This is me after I fell in a hole

      I wrote this a few months ago.  I lived in the Mojave Desert where it is routinely 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  I hated my job.  All day I stared at a computer until my eyes hurt.  I made far too little money for what my life had become.  Everyone had big plans for me.  I was supposed to be a big star.  I guess, in a way, you could say I did. 	 	My office was near a large retirement community.  My house was next to a hospital.  About once a month, a senior citizen’s fall, or heart attack, or stroke would coincide with my commute.  Because our routes were the same, I became an inadvertent ambulance chaser.  I felt an odd sense of power following these tragedies, the siren blaring, lights flashing, cars pulling to the side of the road like it was all for me.  	Every morning Euphrates and I would go for a jog.  Euphrates was my beagle.  He was in terrific shape.  We loved the mist and cool of the morning, the empty streets,  before any birds started singing,  	Sometimes I pretended that Euphrates and I were the only ones left on earth.  How interesting it would be to go into people’s houses and rummage through their things.  It would be like a yard sale.  I’d look for a nice-fitting suit, Dragnet style.  Just the facts, ma’am.  I’d throw some filet mingon down to Euphrates.  From now on, only the best for my friend.  Of course, all the meat would quickly go bad, all the cows would die and then we would.  We’d have to live on canned tuna in the meantime.  That’s not so bad. 	I never put a leash on Euphrates.  He was well-trained.  Sometimes when we were out running in our post-apocalyptic world, I pretended that Euphrates could talk.  Today was no different. 	“Ready for the jog, E-rate?,” I said to him. 	“Fa sha, Mon,” Euphrates replied.  In my day-dreams, he always spoke like a Rastafarian. 	We passed a large house with a Beemer in the driveway. 	“I’ll bet we be findin some good meats in there,” Euphrates said. 	“That’s a good bet,” I said. 	“An some sweet ViewMastas too,” Euphrates said.  The talking Euphrates was addicted to ViewMasters.  “I be lookin fa tha Sesame Street won.” 	We were barely ten minutes into the run and I was panting heavily.  Euphrates had hardly broken a sweat. 	“How are you in such good shape?” I asked between breaths. 	“It’s da sex, Mon.  I be doin all da sexy bitches,” Euphrates said.  Well, he had me on that one. 	We didn’t find any steaks, or, suits, or ViewMasters, but it was a good run.  We were approaching my house when DeYoung called out to me as he was getting into his car.  DeYoung was a psychiatrist.  I liked him, but came across as a game show host holding a card with all the answers.  I gave Euphrates a glance that told him to keep his mouth shut. 	“Hey, you’re still alive,” DeYoung said.  He startled me.  He must know more about the Apocalypse than I did. 	“Am I not supposed to be?” I asked. 	“I haven’t seen you in quite a while,” DeYoung said. 	We frequently crossed paths in the morning, Euphrates and I returning from our run and DeYoung heading to work.  But recently, Euphrates and I had been casing houses in wealthier neighborhoods. 	“Oh, just decided to try out a different route.” I said. 	“I see,” said DeYoung.  “Well, let Delia know that Robin and I are coming to your party on Friday.  I’m going as Keith Richards and Robin’s going to be Madeline Albright. 	“All right, great,” I said.  “I’ll see you on Friday then.”  I started to jog away.  DeYoung and Robin were incredibly attractive people.  The thought of them dressing as the ugliest people on earth made me laugh.  I wanted Robin more than anything. 	“Later,” DeYoung said as he got into his car.  	“Can you be a dear and pick up some vodka at the store?” Delia said as she prepared food, “We’re running dreadfully low and I desperately need it for the Martinis, Darling.” 	I was in the bathroom putting the final touches on my costume.  Delia was obsessed with themed party nights.  Her past themes have included Over-Dosed Celebrities (I was John Belushi), Accidental Deaths (Sonny Bono), Assassins/Targets (John Lennon), Murderers (Fatty Arbuckle), Rapists/Victims (Mike Tyson), and Talk show Hosts (Chevy Chase). 	Tonight’s theme was Senile/Terminally Ill Celebrities.  I had a tough time deciding who to be.  I’d considered Stephen Hawking and Muhammad Ali, but went with Ronald Reagan. 	I made myself look like death walking.  I was as pale as a Minnesota farm boy. 	“Yeah, I’ll go get it,” I shouted from the bathroom. 	Delia met me as I was entering the living room.  She threw her arms around me and carefully gave me a kiss as to not to mess up my makeup or hers.  She was Queen Elizabeth. 	“Thanks! You’re a doll,” Delia said and ran off to finish whatever she was doing.  I didn’t want to be a doll. I wanted to be a man with Alzheimer's, but I took it as a complement.  Delia had a certain way of speaking.  She watched too many movies growing up.  Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor had a profound influence on her.  Deep down, she wished she was royalty.  She was never pompous, but I always felt like the stable boy.  She was very elegant in all regards, except for her desire to someday make love in a coffin. 	 She admired me as one admires a good song, but we didn’t love each other.  I couldn’t, she reminded me too much of my mother.  I enjoyed being around her.  We had lived together for over a year.  Her family had money.  Her great grandfather had patented a hunting knife with a compass built into the handle.  It was called The Trusty Woodsman.  The Trusty Woodsman paid all our bills. 	As I left, I could hear her chopping in the kitchen.  	On the way to the store, I had a terrible time trying to decide what CD to play. 	“Marley, mon!” Euphrates begged. 	I was fiddling though my CD case, steering with my knees when Euphrates barked, ‘Watch out!” 	I looked up, jerked the wheel and narrowly missed a Nissan Ultima braking in front of me. 	I tasted bile. 	“You pale as a ghost, Ronnie.” Euphrates said. 	“Very funny.” 	“Dis som good Creedence doe.”  	The grocery store was just a few blocks from our house.  I had to leave Euphrates in the car.  He wants me to pretend I’m blind sometime so he can check the meat out. 	Nothing relaxes me like a trip to the store.  I hunch over the cart and slowly cruise the aisles.  It’s therapy.  Passing rows and rows of boxes, bottles, bags, packages, and containers, I lull myself into a daze.  It’s an out-of-this-world buzz, Euphrates would love it.  The music is usually a Enya/Yanni/John Tesh influx that heightens my hypnotic state.   	On this trip, I was on Cloud 29.  You could have knocked me in the groin with the jawbone of a donkey and I wouldn’t have felt a thing.  On these trips, I try to imagine I’m a petal on a very beautiful flower in the garden of an elderly Japanese man that is planning to go into business with his son-in-law breeding poodles to sell on the Black Market.  It is such a peaceful place to be. 	The Son-in-law was explaining to his father-in-law the principle of the stud when I heard the scream. 	I awoke in the double-wide promotional aisle.  It was near the front of the store and filled with items for the summer: wading pools, floatation devices, lawn chairs, BarBq equipment, suntan lotion, snacks, fireworks, beach balls. 	There were dozens of screams.  Near the cash registers, people scrambled for the doors. 	I rushed to the front of the store.  All the people were scattering from a man in a black trenchcoat.  He was waving a machete above his head. He ran toward a cashier was making for the exit.  She turned around just in time get one last scream out before he hacked her head clean off her neck. 	He stood over her body for a moment.  He stomped in the puddle of blood, jerked his head up, starred right at me. 	I looked around for a weapon, which are in short supply in a grocery store.  He ran right toward me.  I picked up a mini-outdoor BarBQ grill and tossed it at him.  It seemed to slow him down and make him incredibly angry.  I wished that there were more of those on hand.  I began tossing anything I could.    	When you’re placed in a life-or-death situation one of two things happen. 	A.) Survival mode kicks in.  It’a an animalistic, instinctual desire to survive at any cost.  An example would be those that trample other fans to death at English soccer games.  It’s either live or die, in their minds, and they are the ones that live. 	B.) Euphoria sets in.  Dying becomes a surreal experience.  For example, those inebriated drivers that survive car crashes due to their relaxed state. 	Of course, I gave examples where the person lived and that isn’t always the case.  	I was a type B, thanks to the Yanni, that served as a score to the bloodbath.  I was aware I was throwing aprons and spatulas at this crazed man, but it was as if I was watching it on a television screen. 	I watched myself stumble over a sno-cone maker.  I saw the man tower over me.  I watched him swing the sword. 	Then I felt the pain.  And the blood.  Everything was in fast forward mode.  I couldn’t slow it down.  All the noises were extra loud.  I couldn’t focus on any one thing.  It was like sticking my head out the window of a car doing 80 inside a shopping mall.  Images, forms, colors. 	Everything started moving.  I couldn’t hear people’s voices.  The words coming out of peoples mouths didn’t match with who was saying it.  People walked backwards. 	I couldn’t talk.  I ran outdoors.  I felt numb.  Nothing made sense.  Ideas streamed though my mind.  A million contradictions, circular arguments.  Philosophical concepts.  What is good?  What is evil?  I never had an answer.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  From every side.  In a cycle.  Sometimes my eyes were closed, sometimes they were open.  Occasionally I would recognize a voice calling my name.  I’d feel arms around me.  I was trapped. 	I tried to clear my mind to think of a white place.  All white.  No sound.  Nothing.  I just wanted to be at peace.  Then somebody shook me and called my name.  I looked down and blood covered my hands and was steaming down my arms.  I put my hands on my head.  There was blood all over my head. 	I closed my eyes and tried to think about God.  I couldn’t find him.  I couldn’t even remember if he existed.  If my father existed.  Or my mother.  Or me.  I thought that if there was a God, he could make my life appear real.  Then knew how everything really was.  Clarity hit.  I knew it.  I knew freaking everything.  At that point I knew the answer to freaking every question in the universe.  I was the answer.  I always was and would always continue to be.   In a loop.  I didn’t know how long this day had been going on.  I would have guessed at least a few years.  Every event, every thought, every action, every person, every sensation of that afternoon at the store had been placed in a box, shaken up, lined up in a random order and set on repeat. 	I was in limbo.  I’d always been there.  There was nothing solid for me to stand on.  No thought I could claim as an absolute.  I’ve always drifted.  I couldn’t tell if I was in heaven or hell.  I guessed hell, but I wasn’t burning.  But the thought of eternal insecurity terrified me.  But I knew it was too late.  If only I hadn’t went to the store.  It was so funny to me that the grocery store was the gateway to this higher understanding.  It was so ironic, but that thought just circled in my head like all the others.  I got caught in a spiral again trying to figure it all out.  But I knew I had the answer.  I knew what the meaning of it all was.  There was none.  There never was.  If only the others knew.  No, it was good they didn’t.  No one should have to go on as I had to forever.  I didn’t even know if they existed.  No, they couldn’t.  Only I existed. 	Then I was kneeing on the ground.  I was outside of the store.  A policeman had a towel.  “It’s just your cheek,” he said.  He was telling me that everything was going to be ok.  I heard somebody shout something about the roof.  I heard the word “blood” and “ambulance.”  My mind began to clear.  Everything stopped spinning.  I felt my neck.  It was covered in blood.  My hands, my arms.  I afraid to touch my head.  I asked the officer if I should touch my head.  He wouldn’t look at me.  He said I was going to be all right.  I asked him again.  I touched my shoulder.  I couldn’t feel it.  I couldn’t feel any of bones that were supposed to be there.  I couldn’t feel the left side of my head.  The officer wouldn’t look at me.  He kept saying that everything was going to be all right and that only my cheek was cut.  He spoke all his words in a deliberately soothing voice that wasn’t calming me at all.  He yelled at others to come over to help.  They just stood there staring at me with looks of horror. 	“It’s my head, isn’t it?,” I said.  They told me that the man had only glazed my cheek with the blade, but I knew what was going on.  It was that store.  It was cursed.  I was going to die.  I didn’t know how it all had happened, but the crazy man sliced into my head, but I was somehow still conscious after sustaining massive head wounds.  They were all amazed that I was still alive.  They knew it couldn’t last long.  I knew it too.  That’s why officer was so persistent about my cheek, because he didn’t want me to go into shock when I discovered what was really wrong with me.  But I knew.  I could tell by their faces.  It was obvious. 	So I ran.  	I entered at the height of the party. 	“Hey, What’s up?  Wow.  Great costume,” Keith Richards/DeYoung said. 	“Thanks, but it’s not a costume.  It’s real blood and I’m dying.” 	“You’ve outdone yourself this time,” said Johnny Cash. 	“I know, because I’m going to die.” 	“Ha.  Ha.  So what did you use for blood?” said Dick Clark. 	“Human blood from my body.” 	“Oh, you’re a riot.  You crack me up,” the Pope said. 	“I’m not trying to be funny.  I just got chopped up by a machete and I am a very mentally unstable person right now.”  	I spotted Delia. 	“I’m sorry, I forgot the vodka,” I said. 	“Darling, what’s the matter?” 	“I almost died.” 	The party goers noticed something amiss.  They quieted down. 	“And I’ve decided that I hate you.” 	She started to cry. 	“I’m going to pack up and leave now.”	 	I went into the bedroom and threw some clothes in a backpack.  I walked back into the living room.  Delia was on the coach weeping. She was being comforted by sicky-looking people.  Everyone looked confused. 	“I hope you all choke and die,” I said and left. 	 	I had left the car in the grocery store lot.  When I got back there, Euphrates was still sitting in the passenger’s seat.  He looked up at me.  He was holding a ViewMaster to his eyes.   	“Was happenin?” he said. 	I explained everything. 	“Reely?  I dinna see a thin.” 	“Well, anyways, I was almost killed.” 	“Das a bummer, mon,” Euphrates said, then went back to his ViewMaster. 	I needed to get out of the desert.  Fast.  I saw an officer walking toward me.  I started up the car and took off. 	 	My face hurt like hell.  I needed to get it looked at.  I ripped a strip off a brown paper bag and stuck it to my cheek.  	I began to hate Euphrates.  He was still in the passenger seat, enthralled with his ViewMaster.  What about me?  What about my problems? 	“I’m dying here, man.  Put the ViewMaster down.  Pay attention to me,” I yelled at him. 	He moved the ViewMaster a little ways from his face and turned to me. 	“Wa, mon.  juss needa chill fa a while.” 	I nodded. 	“An why ya gotta be knockin my ViewMasta like dat?” 	 	“I know of more ways to make someone suffer than most people on this planet,” the six year old girl told me. 	I wanted to leave.  But I knew was in this doctor’s office for something. 	My face hurt. 	Oh. 	I had to get the hole in my cheek looked at.  	I was sure I could peek my tongue through it if I had wanted to.  The torn piece of brown paper bag still stuck to the wound, like it was a flannelgraph.  I hunched over in my chair and stared at the dull waiting room carpet.  I was out of breath and sweating.  My clothes were spotted with blood. 	“I’ve been to torture museums,” the girl said, “I like seeing all the old weapons and devices.” 	Her mother smiled at me and adjusted a pink bow in the girl’s hair. 	“You remind me of my ex-girlfriend,” I told the girl.  She looked confused.  I couldn’t tell if it was because of my slurred speech or what I had said.  Her mother kept smiling at me.  I was never sure if the mom could talk or not.  I knew her daughter could though. 	“So, you must like that stuff, huh?” the girl said, pointing at a bottle I was clutching in my left hand. 	I looked down and realized I was crushing the life out of a plastic bottle of Red Eye BarBq sauce. 	“Oh this?” I dropped the bottle to the floor. “It’s ok.” 	“Sir, we can see you now,” a frightened nurse called out to me. 	A few of my misconceptions were vanquished that day.  I discovered that nurses sometimes do look afraid.  Also, you don’t always have to wait a long time in a doctor’s office.  That is, if you make a big enough commotion and bleed on enough people.  It also helps if you do all this in the office of a children’s doctor.  	I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t care.  Hit the road, driving blind, hand on the wheel is like nothing else.  I love the lines the strripes.  the yellow the white, the asphalt, the reflectors, the signs, the exits, all for me.  No cares no cares no cares.  a dog, my friend , at  mind side.  what else do i need.  it was afternoon to evening to night  and dark.  it was so dark.  I was blind to so many things, yet alive, yes still avile and free.  i was new, reborn.  and the desert was no longer me.  i was free.

      This is a pseudo autobiography i penned in spring 2002. It's pretty funny. I deleted anything that could incriminate my associates. Feel free to read what's left.  3-16-02 I don’t know how I got to be in charge of 900 people, but I was and I kind of enjoyed it.  Khaki pants, white polo, black shoes, belt and visor.  Not really me, but official and I had to play the part.  I was representing the university.  I was a paid staff member.  More than a figure head.  Much more, considering all the work I out in during the summer.  And what a dreadful summer it was.  Lonely.  Depressing.  My birthday was memorable, highlighted by Jacquie’s gift of XXXXXXXX and the out of control car games that ensued.  Besides that I worked in the Orientation office for the greater part of the day and at Edison International field for the greater part of the evenings.  I was a hawker.  I sold ice cream, peanuts, cotton candy, lemonade, and licorice ropes.  Preferably peanuts though.  They were the most fun.  You got to throw them.  There was a rule of no more than three rows and seven seats, but to hell with that.  Nobody cared.  I  just let the bags fly left and right.  On the last day of the season, I was at the bottom of the section and this guy at the top raised his arm and called out.  I wound up and chucked it with all I had.  The bag whizzed between the heads of two older ladies and landed in the guy’s lap.  I got a two dollar tip. I was alone that summer and kept myself going by laughing at Michael White, hawker extraordinaire.  Michael has hawked at stadiums in Atlanta, Cleveland, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Anaheim.  He says his middle name is “ain’t.”  I love the cafe.  All you can eat food.  And it’s pretty good too.  The cafe has been the sight of some pretty historic events in my life.  Today I was sitting outside on the cafe patio (my usual spot) and Jesse came out with a plate of three peanut butter squares with chocolate on top.  He said “I love these things.  I could eat nothing but peanut butter squares for the rest of my life.”  One of my favorite pastimes in betting Jesse to do things.  I said “I bet you twenty bucks you can’t eat fifteen of them.”  “Fifteen!”  he says, “I could eat thirty!” “Deal.” We shook and he ran inside.  He came back out with a heaping plate full of the squares and began to eat.  And eat.  Keep in mind he had already eaten a full dinner.    After fifteen he wanted to stop, but I reminded him that he was the one that had upped the ante.  Around number twenty-one we had to go to class.  Number twenty-three came during class and Jesse had to leave because he felt sick.  It was really a second reincarnation of Cool Hand Luke.  In fact I began calling Jesse that for about a week.  But that is just a reminder of the great cookie bet of freshman year.  Jesse likes to make absolute blanket statements like, “I could eat nothing but cookies for the rest of my life.”  Which causes me to say things like, “Oh yeah?  I bet you can’t.”  It was this exchange that led to the cookie bet.  The winner was originally supposed to get fifty bucks, but Jesse said he didn’t have enough money. And we all know that bets are more fun when the prize is something other than money anywise.  So it ended that Jesse was to eat only cookies for a week and the loser had to enter chapel by the back door in his boxers and in a bathrobe, go up to Brad Davies the student chaplain and say, “Hey!  What’s going on?  What are all you guys doing in my bedroom?”  Around the second or third day it was really getting to Jesse.  About that time is when I ordered a pizza to be sent to his room.  I’d also give good tasting and smelling food lying around his desk.  An incident around this time caused me to declare the bet null and void.  I discover that he had eaten animal crackers, a clear violation of the rules.  A cracker is a cracker.  There are such things as animal cookies, but those has frosting on them.  Animal crackers are frosting-less.  I was up in arms, but I let it stand.  He had garnered the sympathy of all the girls on campus.  I was the mean guy that wouldn’t let him have any food.  Go figure.  There were some girls that saw through to the stupidity he was inflicting on himself, but there were few and far between.  I don’t think it helped matters much when I again caused an uproar when I discovered that he was taking vitamins.  Obviously, a vitamin in not a cookie and it is a solid substance that is going into his body–food.  So no more vitamins.  And I still lost.  I never followed through on the bet though.  I’m not that stupid.  Today I really felt like betting Jesse to do something.  There were about 7 of us sitting around outside on the cafe patio.  I told Jesse to go stuff food down his pants.  So he walked into the cafe.  I didn’t think he’d do anything, but now he had a crowd.  That’s something neither of us can resist–an audience.  He picked the absolute worse things though.  He stood in line and got a plate full of spaghetti.  He looked around all mischevious-like then pulled open his pants like a drawer and tilted the plate so the noodles slid right down.  He walked back out side, but before the got out a big glob of pasta escaped from his left pant leg and stretched out on the tile floor of the cafe.  He got his applause though.  All this betting in the cafe is, I think, An attempt to outdo Rian Kennedy.  He has become infamous for the legacy of his bet.  Someone bet him 20 bucks to pee his pants, right there on the cafe patio.  Next thing you know, you heard liquid splattering on the concrete underneath his seat.  Everybody looked and lo and behold, the chair hovered over a puddle.  The seat was never washed to my knowledge.  The girls still cringe when it’s mentioned.  I don’t know what my greatest betting triumph would be.  I think I’d have to go back to high school–senior trip.  Me, Melvin, and Scott Krantz were sitting around Epcot Center in Florida.  I don’t know why Scott Krantz.  I talked to him all of 3 times in high school.  Anyways, everybody knows that Epcot Center in boring as hell.  Especially for high school seniors.  I take that back.  It’s got these dancing midgets and midget anything is exciting to me.  There have all these country sections there–Spain, France, Morocco, Japan, Italy, England.  It’s got them all.  We were sitting in Canada land of all places.  How boring can you get.  Canada land.  I think they had moose and fake snow there.  We were sitting on this little bridge looking at this giant fountain and as always, when I’m bored, I began to make up bets.  “I’ll jump in that fountain for 40 bucks.”  The unthinkable is the best.  I was eventually worked down to: I jump in the fountain, swim to the center, and climb the fountain for a pizza.”  I took of my shoes and socks and hopped this little fence.  I had to run though all these flowers.  I jumped in the water (it was pretty deep) and swam out to the middle.  There was no way I could climb anything.  But I look back and Melvin and Scott were gone.  I didn’t even see what direction they had run.  I was expecting to get thrown out before I had jumped in, but hadn’t planned on being ditched.  So I got out of there and run through Japan, Germany, Ireland, and Africa, before I eventually caught them in Israel.  I looked back and my wet foot prints had followed me the entire way.  Never got caught though.  Immediately afterward the three of us were sitting on a bench reliving our adventure when I noticed a fairly attractive group of girls staring at me.  One of them came up to me and said, “Do you mind if I kiss you?”  I’ve got a bet with my friends over there.”  I said that I didn’t have a problem at all and she kissed me on the lips no less.  Scott and Melvin called me a lucky bastard and I smiled for the rest of the the evening.  Today I finally decided that I needed to break up with Courtney.  It was at a Mimi's CafeXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXMany paragraphs deletedXXXXXXXXXXXXX  I don’t think I’ll ever be to go back there.  The whole lunch I couldn’t bring myself to do it.  I ordered a wine to calm my nerves.  I was shaking like crazy.  Finally she asked me how I was doing and I let it out about how I thought our relationship wasn’t working.  She got all pissed and wanted to leave.  So we did.  I took her home, rode home in silence.  And she started on all this about XXXXparagraph deletedXXXXXXX  What am I supposed to do.  I was still breaking up with her.  She made me cry.  I was genuinely sorry.  I felt like an asshole.  I wish I would have done it earlier.  I wish I never would have XXXXXXXXX.  I almost wish I never XXXXXXXXXX.  Give me some time though.  Trip up to San Francisco tomorrow.  The night in Big Sur will be one for the ages.  I’d never been there before. I acted like a jackass the whole trip.  XXXXXdeletedXXXX.  We headed up the coast on Friday.  I checked my voicemail that morning in San Luis Obispo and there was a message from Courtney the previous night at about midnight.  She said something to the effect of: “XXXXXXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXXXX  Thanks.  Bye.”  That depressed me.  One of her friends called me while I was listening to the message.  XXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXX.  Anyhow, I thought that XXXXXXX sounded like a grand idea.  So, while camping at Big Sur I XXXXX a XXXX and a half of XXX and half a pack of unfiltered camels and I don’t like to smoke.  I was loud and began to prophecy to Andrew about his life and made up funny songs to the tune of “What’s up” by the 4 Non-Blondes.  On the way up the coast we stopped at a pinata store and bought a Osama Bin Laden pinata.  I had spotted it outside the store while we we getting gas.  In excitement, I  bolted across the street and almost got hit by a car.  We tied Bin Laden to the back of Jesse’s Trooper and make a noose for around his neck.  We got so many honks and cheers and waves.  It was incredible.  I felt like a celebrity.  At the campsite in Big Sur we strung Bin Laden up in a tree.  I stuck knifes into him.  A couple of park rangers came and make us take him down.  Can you believe it?  Communists.  I was an asshole the entire trip or at least I tried to be.    We really XXXXX hard at the beginning of the semester.  I didn’t realize it until now. Things like the infamous XXXXX stepfather party where Jesse XXXXXXXXXXXXX and assaulted a few of the party goers.  Amy told me that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXNevermindXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  I found out that XXXXXXXnopeXXXXXXXXXX “Ok, well have a good evening.” Then Brent decides to add, “It’s all good.  It’s all good.” Thanks, Brent.  Brent said he talked to “The Dude” today.  Referring to XXXXXXX.  He explains it, “Have you seen his hair?  Long in the front, short in back.  Let’s face it, he’s a dude.”  Brent walked up to him and said, “XXXXXXX, right? He nodded. “So what’s this I hear about you wanting to XXXX Darren?” “Oh, well, I wasn’t serious.” “Yeah, cuz that’s just silly.” And Brent walked away.  Sunday: Jesse and I went to what was supposed to be Tony Gwynn’s last home game, but because of September 11th, That will be next week.  Jesse had bought the tickets in the middle of the season in anticipation.  It wasn’t a total loss.  In fact, it wasn’t a loss at all because the Pods were playing the Giants and we saw Bonds knock number 65 and 66 out of the park.  It’s great to be a part of history.  We were sitting in right field.  The percentages said that if Bonds did hit a home run.  It would be to us.  We took our shirts off and baked in the sun.  The stadium wasn’t even half full.  We both got those frozen lemonade cups.  Beautiful.  One hit 10 rows down from us and the other sailed over the centerfield wall.  For Gwynn’s retirement, the were giving away these posters.  I went around and picked up about 15 of them after to the game to sell on EBay.  I never will.  I’ll just have 15 posters sitting in my room.  After the game, since we were so close, we decided to go to Mexico.  I was feeling the traveling itch.  The bug.  Pretty much my whole summer had been wasted.  Not wasted.  Just consumed by orientation and busy work.  It would be a late summer mini-day road trip for me.  Jesse always talked about Roserito and the great lobster he had down there.  So we cruised down.  I felt adventurous.  I felt satisfied.  I felt the need to get out and experience life.  The lobster was delicious.  We made tentative plans to head down to baja for spring break.  We walked around a little bit.  It made me sad.  Kinda like vegas does.  Jesse showed me his El Jimador stuff that’s really supposed to do the trick.  He had had it out on a ranch in Montana that summer.  Coming back though TJ we somehow got totally lost in the city.  Jesse was freaking out as always and though were were going to die.  It was weird, we were cruising down the highway.  Then it suddenly ended.  We couldn’t go back because it was one way.  We were in some neighborhood.  We eventually followed this car down into a reservoir canal and back up the other side onto a road.  One thing we hadn’t counted on was the post-Sept 11 customs backup to get back into the country.  It took three hours to get back into the US.  I was selling peanuts on first base view when Bonds hit number 71.  We were playing the Rangers.  An old man yelled, “71.”  So instead of yelling “Peanuts,”  I yelled, “71.”  It was great.  Of course it wasn’t as exciting as when McGwire hit 62 freshman year.  Of course nothing ever is.  There were about 15 of us crammed into Dan Bush’s room.  And when he hit it we all went crazy.  It was intense.  I got very emotional.  It was one of the highlights of my life.  The whole chase with Sosa and all that.  It really brought me closer to the guys in the room.  I had just arrived at college and it really made me feel at home.  One of the guys.  I felt like I belonged.  After the last game of the season.  I went to get a beer after the game with Danny Neilson.  To him everything is: “Aww. XXXXXXXXX,  Yeah.”  The bar is between Edison field and Arrowhead Pond.  A Janet Jackson show had just got done at the pond and the bar was full of gay man and trying to be teenage middle age women.  Dany was hitting on them (the women).  He invited me to a bar in Fullerton and said we were meeting up with some Brazilian gal.  Halfway there he said she had a friend.  I didn’t care.  Halfway into he bar he said that she didn’t speak much English.  So all night I’m trying to communicate with my awful spanglish.  He ends up going home with the other gal and leaves me to take the non-English speaker home.  At least I learned how to say “left” and “right” in Spanish.  My mom kept bugging me about getting a job so I decided to get one.  I like jobs.  I want to have a lot of them.  I’d like to be a mailman, a waiter, a bartender, a dog catcher to name a few.  But I got, I think, the best job in the world.  I sell peanuts in the stands at baseball games.  I get in for free.  I went to Edison Field and walked around the stadium asking people where I go to get a job vending items in the stands.  They directed me and I applied for the job.  The lady I talked to tried persuading me to be a club runner.  “You’ll make more money,” she said.  Yeah right!  That’s everything I hate about baseball–the business man in his three-piece suit.  What a bunch of bull.  I am really not a fan of those giant Herman Muster shoes that have become ultra popular with the female crowd.  It makes them look like cartoons.  They are so over exaggerated. XXXXXno way in hell i will leave this inXXXXXX  It never really crossed my mind, but now I begin to loath it and cringe.  Am i just a shallow person.  It just fullers the fact that I could never be with her.XXXXXnoXXXXXXXXXX  We were sitting in the back yard and this kid rode his bike through the gate.  He just sat on his bike staring at us.  He looked about 10 years old.   “You guy’s have a Nintendo?,” he asked. “I have a Super Nintendo and a Sega Genesis,” I said. “The other guys would let me play theirs.” “You can come over and play if you want to.” “Now?” “It’s in a box somewhere.” “Oh.” He looked around. “Do you have any stuff I can have?  The other guys used to give me stuff.  They gave me a water bottle once.” “Um.  I don’t think so.” He went over to a refrigerator that we were planning to move into the house. “Can I have this?” “The refrigerator?” “Yeah.  Can I have it?  I want to put it in my room so I don’t have to go downstairs.” “No.  Sorry.  We’re going to use it.” “Oh.” He looked at Jesse who was sitting in a lawn chair tying on his laptop. “Can I have your computer?” “No, you can’t have my computer.” “Oh.  Ok.  Bye.” He turned and rode off.  I enjoyed my birthday.  I think.  I was pretty depressed about the whole situation for a while.  I didn’t have any plans.  I felt lonely.  Then Brent invited me to go to Long Beach with him.  He bought me a pint of Guinness and Murphy’s.  I appreciated the gesture and drank the whole pint, but wasn't that fond of the beverage.  I’m not a beer kinda guy. ****dated material (obviously)***** It felt good that he showed enough to care and all that.  In the evening, Jacquie came over with a cake she had baked for me.  It made me feel special.  And, she brought a large XXXXX of XXXXXXX.  Jacquie, Keith, Brent, and I played 31.  It;s this card game my grandparents taught me and with which they wagered many a nickel during the long winters they spent in the california desert.  But for my birthday, instead of nickels, we used XXXXXXX.  Loser had to take a XXXX of a XXXX.  Thing was, as the night wore on, those XXXX began getting bigger and bigger.  If the XXXX over XXXX, he had to XXXX his mistake.  After a while of getting XXXXX and XXXXXX, we said screw it and just XXXXX a lot of XXXXX.  Happy 21st.  This led to a giant XXXXXX binge over the semester.  I didn’t realize how much we had been XXXXXX until recent reflection.  I (we) were XXXXXX just about everynight, getting pretty XXXXX (i.e. XXXX).  So much so that Trevor XXXXXX because of it.  He XXXXX because we were XXXXXX every night.  Every Thursday was XXXXX Thursday.  With meant even more XXXXXX.  It all culminated into our house becoming just a giant pit of XXX.  I’d walk outside and there'd be people XXXXXXXX on the roof.  XXXXX emerging from XXXXXX after hours of not being seen.  And the XXXXX step-father night where Jesse was encouraged to put on XXXXXXX, whereafter he proceeded to XXXX in the corner of the room.  He also assaulted several members of the party.  Before going to bed, a bit XXXX myself, I convinced Jesse that he had said many XXX, unforgivable things to XXXX, a girl he’s always liked.  I think he began to cry.  Because of all this Trevor XXXXX.  Now I think it was a good move.  The house isn’t the greatest XXXXX.  Matt XXXXX came over one night for TT.  The mark of a first time XXXX is they continually talk about how much they XXXXX.  “I had four XXXX, three XXXX of XXXX, a XXXX of XXXX (I’ve hated XXXXX ever since that night I was caught wrestling the bathroom rug after a few XXXX), and, um, something else.”  He got XXXXX and went outside and XXXXXXX on Andy’s car.  Then he came back inside and lamented his XXXXXX state.  “This kind of stuff ruins XXXXX.  I can’t do this to XXXX.  She’s such a great woman.”  Then he started XXXXX.  I felt sorry for him.  I actually wasn’t the first time he XXXX though.  Him, Jesse, and I all went down to San Diego one night.  Matt had three XXXX in a XXX then we went to see “Saving Silverman.”  The whole movie Matt kept yelling, “Get it? Get it?  They’re ‘saving Silverman.’”  It was priceless.  Matt is one of the most honest guys I’ve ever met.  He told a girl she had birthing hips once.  I think I was by accident though.  He also pushes and crosses the line at the most ackward times.  Sometimes he just says weird thing.  A bunch of us were talking about school work and Matt the comparison, “That’s like buying weed from a sting cop.”  One of my favorite phrases in the English language.   We’re a lot better on the XXXXX.  Except a few nights ago, after i got back from betting on some horses at Los Alamitos.  I was depressed because amy decided that we should spend less time together and i XXXXX a lot of XXXXX.  After fasting for a week.  I went home.  A bunch of the guys were playing a game downstairs.  I went upstairs and started banging on my guitar and screaming aloud as I could.  I heard them storm up the stairs.  Matt, Keith, Andy, Drew.  So I leaped down the stairs over them.  I was more of a crowd surf down the flight of stairs.  But it was truly majestic any way you look at it.  I came home one evening and decided to pull an prank.  It had been awhile and I didn’t wanted to get out of practice.  My current best prank was  in the wee hours of April Fool’s day freshman year.  I was in the bathroom pretending like I was throwing up and Trevor ran into Matt Warner’s room and said that I was throwing up blood and we needed him to drive me to the hospital.  I should have won an academy award for my performance.  Matt is honestly one of the nicest guys you’ll ever meet.  So he gathered up some of his homework in anticipation that we would be at the hospital for a while.  We walk out to his car.  One problem, this was the second time that evening we had pulled this prank, and Keith, the first victim, was none too happy.  He saw us walking to the car and tackled me.  Dan ran over and ripped him off of me.  By the time Matt turned around, Dan and Keith we rolling around on the grass.  Which wasn’t anything too unusual, except it was 3AM.  We got in his car.  I even had a bucket for effect.  My throat was beginning to hurt now. “Where’s the hospital,” Matt asked. Trevor was sitting up front, mostly so I wouldn’t make him laugh (He’s not the greatest for pranks because he gets such a kick out of what’s going on that he laughs.  I caught him a few times that night.  I an the other have am reknown for keeping my composure in the midst of pranks. Trevor said, “Turn right.”  then they arbritarially said left or right when we came to a stop light. I finally weekly muttered, “What day is it today?” Matt, thinking I was planning ahead to fill out the hospital forms said, “April 1, Heh, that’s kind of ironic, huh?” We all cracked up, but he still didn’t get it.  “It’s a joke,” Trevor said.  matt was a great sport.  He didn’t try to tackle me or anything.  Then one day, I came home after a whole day of helping Amy move into her new apartment.  I hate moving.  I hate it with a vengeance.  So I was frustrated, sore, the whole ball of wax.  I come home and the house is empty.  I see Jesse’s car key’s lying i the kitchen table in front of the window.  I said to myself, “That’s not too wise.  If they wanted to, somebody could easily steal his car.”  A grin swept across my face and a picked up the keys and backed his car out of the driveway.  I parked the car on the street just one block over then walked back tot he house feeling very satisfied.  But then I got to thinking, “If someone were to break into our house, they would just take the car, they’d take all our other stuff too.  So I went through everybody’s rooms taking cases full of CD’s, CD players, TV’s, laptops, guitars and put them all in my crawlspace in my room.  I hid my stuff too, to complete the caper.  Then I left to go see a movie with Amy.  I was estatic, like a little kid.  I thought I was the genius of the world.  What really helped my cause was that, not a month ago some neighbor kids walked into our house and took some stuff: a watch, a mini TV, a guitar.  Fate was on my side.  Most of the guys in the house had went down to a concert in L.A., so I knew they would be getting back around 1.  I stayed out with Amy pretty late, then around 1:30 I began getting the calls.  I didn’t answer them, but waited for the messages on my voice mail.  Drew and Keith.  Drew said in the most somber, funeral director voice ever, “Hey Darren, this is Drew.  Um, you’re gonna need to call us as soon as you can.  We;ve had some stuff go down here at the house.  Oh, do your have your laptop with you.  Bye.”  I laughed so loud and so much.  It was uncontrollable.  I eventually called Drew back up and he told me that some stuff had been stolen and that I should come back to the house.  Amy was still with me and wanted to get in on the fun so she came along.  As I turned down the street, I saw a police car in front of the house, so I quickly backed up and headed to Super K.  I had Amy call the guys and tell them that I was really upset and had went to a park and left her in the car.  It was beautiful  I went back to the house around 3 or 4.  I took all the stuff out of my crawlspace and placed it all neatly in the living room.  I tried to be a quiet as possible, but the stairs were creaky and I actually dropped the TV on t he ground.  I thought I had broken it, but it’s a stuff little sucker.  In the morning everybody was so happy and the fingers immediately pointed to Mike Sycz, friend and known prankster.  The charade lasted about a day until Drew and I went out to eat at this Indian place.  He was asking me about Amy and school when he blurted out, “So did you do it?”  I couldn’t help but laugh.  I don’t understand women I really don’t.  I really have to learn how to control my mouth too.XXXXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXX  I’ve always wanted to get thrown out of a ballgame.  The closest I had got went opening day '99.  Jesse and I were in Oakland.  Clemens pitching for the Yankee.  It was a terrible day.  It was drizzling went the game started and just got worse.  After a while they stopped the game.  Jesse and I moved down to behind the Yankee’s dugout.  The delay lasted quite a while and people started going home.  The grounds crew covered the field with a tarp.  Jesse and I joked about running out and doing a slip and slide number.  We both said that if the delay lasted a half an hour longer, we’d do it.  It didn’t and we didn’t.  We did encounter of of my all time greatest baseball experiences though.  The game started back up and about three row in front of us was a guy decked out in a Yankee jacker and cap.  He was just cursing the A’s up and down, telling every player how much he sucked.  This lady behind us kept telling him to shut up.  He ignored her for a while.  Then he told to to suck a particular part of his body.  This caused her to yell at him even more, which prompted the Yankee’s fan to turn around, grab his crotch, and shake it at the lady.  The climax of this whole affair culminated with the Yankee’s fan replacing the “1...2...3...strikes you’re out!” part of “Take me out to the Ballgame” with “1...2...3...XXXXdeletedXXX!” and shouting that part as loud as he could at the lady.  I was amazed that he never got tossed from the game.  The rain picked back up near the end of the game and Jesse and I had to walk dozens of blocks across a very cold, very rainy San Francisco. 	My dream eventually came true though.  It happened at Dodger Stadium on a Friday night went the Cardinals came to town.  Jesse got tickets in advance in anticipation of Mark McGwire chasing the home run record again.  Unfortunately, Big Mac was out for most of the season.  But little did we know he would retire at the end of the season.  He never got into the game that night.  And I was mad.  In addition to the four seats Jesse had, I invited about 10 friends to the game.  And if you know me you know I love an audience.  We were sitting in the Left Field Pavilion, which is called the family section (no alcohol, even though Jesse, Dan and I sneak some beers in once) but is anything but.  The most diehard Dodger fans sit in the Left Field Pavilion.  I knew this.  Knowing that I wore a Cardinal Jersey to the game.  About the 8th inning, I was really getting upset that Big Mac wasn’t in the game.  So with the Cardinals leading 4-1 ?, I took my jersey off, marched down into the aisle, held up my jersey and shouted “Cardinals!”  I ran up and down the aisle.   Dodger fans taught me a little how the Apostle Stephen felt.  As soon as the dodger fans saw me they began pelting me with whatever they could get their hands on.  Popcorn flew, half drank soda flew through the air, Dodger dogs nailed me in the ear.  I saw the security guy approaching me from either side.  Somehow I was covered in ketchup.  They escorted me out of the stadium, took down my name, and gave me a lecture about why it’s not good to do what I did.  They were really nice. It was funny, because I had talked to the main security guy before the game and had asked him how rowdy it got on the weekends.  He probably though I had been planning this the whole time.  He told me that its good to root for your team, just not cause a riot over it.  He said that innocent people were being knocked in the head with concession because of me.  The security guy had asked me if I was coming to anymore games that weekend.  I said, “no.”  Then I came back on Sunday and watched Big Mac fly out a few feet in front of me to end the game.

      Happy Tuesday. It's the 23, like Michael Jordan used to be.  I'll be in Michigan on the 4.  Recent recap: I went and saw "The Italian Job" It made me want a Mini Cooper and Charlize Tharon. I saw "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" and it made me want to go to Mexico. I saw "Lost in Translation" and it made me want to be Bill Murray. I went camping. I got dirty. I shaved today though. Now I'm clean. I went to Biola today. It's still there. Just felt weird going back. I haven't been there in a while.

      I am excited about going home to Michigan. I'll be there for at least a month. I haven't been there for over 2 weeks at one time in about 4 years. It'll be childhood clashing with adulthood. There will be memories abounding. Time to reminice. I'm game. I'll go visit my school. Hang out with childhood friends. Ride my bike around town. Read in the park. Then I will come back to California satisfied, with a new job hopefully.  I'm very positive about the itv job. I'll find out in 3 weeks and start in November if it all works out. If it falls through, I will work overseas. Boo-yah.  One way or the other, I will win.

      Every time I try to update this thing, my computer crashes. That's what happens when you go to the Midwest.  In the last few days, I've gotten lost in a cornfield and well, that's about all that's happened, but I won't hold it against you. No, I went to Chicago and walked around. Cub-mania, my friends. It was good to get the big city back in my veins. But honestly, enough with this bullcrap, the real reason I am writing here is to sing the praises of our almighty govenor. All hail AH-NOLD!!!  It's amazing. He will terminate California. The Midwest is not California. I can tell you that much. There are more mustaches here. People care less about how they present themselves in public. Only 5% of the cars on the road are foreign made. There is a smoking section in restaurants. McDonald's is 50 cents cheaper across the board. So is gas. And the Wal-marts here are humongous. They are like shopping malls. It's really amazing.  In the year that I've been gone, my dad has bought every item being sold at every garage sale within a 30 mile radius of his house. For example, he now has 5 file cabinets, 3 books on the OJ trial, 5 on golf technique and 3 sets of golf clubs, 2 dozen hats (lions, panthers, blackhawks, u of m, wmu, nra, pebble beach, colon h.s., chevy, etc...), 2 bikes, and it goes on and on. He has filed 3 new bookcases. Seriously. I have a new raiders jacket now.  my friend john just got a M-16. Yeah, like a machine gun. I think he paid around 2 grand for it. He is a convicted felon. Just kidding. Really he just reached the 'master' level in the NRA. That means over 94% accuracy in matches. I guess that's pretty good. But I don't own a machine gun so what do I know?  my mom has this new dog, Jackie. She's a jack russell. This dog is on speed, I know it is. It has to be snorting the blow left and right. Nonstop jumping and running and general hyper schinanigans. I want to kick it to Pluto.  The weather has been remarkably splendid so far during my stay (knock on wood). It makes me a happy camper, or at least it will when I go camping this weekend.  Enjoy karate.

      I don't mind being unemployed, for a little while at least. I go golfing. eat pizza. drink beer. it's not all that bad really. you should try it sometime, about a month is good. after that, it begins to wear on you.  i am going to be kevin millar for halloween.  in michigan everybody tries to sell a car out by the road.  There are so many cars for sale. There is road kill everywhere too. If the PETA people came to michigan, they'd have a heart attack. It's all over-- racoons, cats, dogs, opossums, deer, rabbits, skunks...crazy. Another thing, at gas stations, there's no "Don't top off" warning. I guess only california is concerned about the whole topping off issue.

      two stories  Singer Elliott Smith dead at 34 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 Posted: 12:37 PM EDT (1637 GMT) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By RYAN PEARSON, Associated Press Writer   LOS ANGELES - Elliott Smith, a singer-songwriter whose dark, introspective songs won him critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination, has apparently committed suicide, his publicist and coroner's officials said Wednesday. He was 34.   Smith's body was found by his live-in girlfriend Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Records Supervisor Marsha Grigsby told AP Radio.   He sustained a single stab wound to the chest that appeared to be self-inflicted, she said.   His New York-based publicist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also confirmed his death.   Smith released five solo albums that received widespread acclaim from rock critics and garnered modest commercial success. "Miss Misery," recorded for Gus Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting," was nominated for an Oscar in 1998.   Smith's songs often were compared with those of Alex Chilton (news), Nick Drake and the Beatles, his favorite band.   Lyrically, they addressed dark subject matter such as drug addiction, troubled relationships and loneliness — though Smith tried to distance himself from the label of confessional songwriter.   "I don't feel like my songs are particularly fragile or revealing," he said in a 1998 interview in the Los Angeles Times. "It's not like a diary, and they're not intended to be any sort of superintimate confessional singer-songwriterish thing."   However, Smith had recently spoken in interviews about his struggles with alcoholism. "When I lived in New York I was really a bad alcoholic for a few years," he told Under the Radar magazine in an interview published in June 2003.   In an effort to quit drinking, Smith said he had undergone treatment which administers an intravenous solution meant to clear the bloodstream of toxins.   Smith was born Steven Paul Smith in Nebraska; his mother was a singer and his father was a psychiatrist. He spent most of his childhood with his mother in the suburbs of Dallas and then moved to Portland, Ore., while in high school to live with his father.   He studied piano and guitar as a youth and began composing songs when he was 13. He began calling himself Elliott in middle school, he later explained to a reporter, because Steve sounded too "jockish."   A graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., he later joined a Portland punk band called Heatmiser. On the side, he recorded several solo albums — "Roman Candle" (1994), "Elliott Smith" (1995) and "Either/Or" (1997), all on independent labels — that won him a devoted underground following.   In 1997, he moved to New York, where Van Sant approached him with an offer to use several of his songs on the soundtrack to "Good Will Hunting." The movie was a hit, bringing Smith's music to a mainstream audience.   Smith subsequently signed with DreamWorks Records and recorded two albums; "XO" (1998) and "Figure 8" (2000) continued his critical winning streak, and took him to the middle reaches of Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.   "I don't really have any goals as a songwriter," he once said, "other than to show what it's like to be a person — just like everybody else who's ever played music does."     Niagara Falls Survivor Blames Depression  Wed Oct 22, 9:03 AM ET    By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario - A man who went over Niagara Falls head first said Wednesday that he was driven by depression, not a desire to become a daredevil.   Kirk Jones, 40, of Canton, Mich., is charged with illegally performing a stunt. He is the first person known to have plunged over the falls without safety devices and lived.   In a phone interview with ABC News, Jones said he had been depressed, but surviving the plunge made him want to live again.   "I honestly thought that it wasn't worth going on. But I can tell you now after hitting the falls I feel that life is worth living," he said.   Family and friends have said Jones had been considering the stunt for years. One friend said Jones hoped to make a lot of money from the notoriety.   Eric Fronek, 21, also of Canton, told ABC that his friend had discussed going over the falls in the past, but was driven to act by depression.   "I think he just reached the point where whatever happened was the best plan for him ... If he made it, he might benefit with money. If he died, so be it," Fronek said. "That's what depression will do to you."   Jones said he made the jump on impulse, and immediately wished he hadn't.   Going over the falls was like "being in a giant tunnel, going straight down, surrounded by water," Jones told ABC. He said he "hit hard," was turned upside down in the water below, then pushed out far enough by the current to climb onto a rock.   Jones was not seriously injured and remained hospitalized in stable condition. He could be fined $10,000.   Jones' parents told ABC he had been suffering from depression, but his mother said surviving a leap from Niagara Falls had intrigued him for years.   "He said he always thought there was a spot you could jump and survive," Doris Jones, 77, told The Associated Press from her sister's home in Keizer, Ore. "We never agreed to it. We thought it was risky."   Suicides are not uncommon at Niagara Falls, although police are reluctant to give numbers. Since 1901, 15 daredevils have taken the plunge in barrels or other devices, including a kayak and a personal watercraft. Ten survived, said Niagara Falls historian Paul Gromosiak.   Only one other person is known to have survived a plunge over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls without a barrel or other contraption — a 7-year-old boy who was wearing a life preserver when he was thrown into the water in a 1960 boating accident.   No one has ever survived a trip — with or without safety devices — over the narrower and rockier American falls.   Niagara Parks Police Inspector Paul Fortier said police believe they have a videotape of the jump made by someone who accompanied Jones. That person has not been charged. Fortier said Jones was undergoing psychological tests.   Brian Merrett, chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission, called the stunt "stupid."   "Our people went down in the gorge and got him," Merrett said. "That's why we don't condone this. It puts all of our people — the fire department, the paramedics, everyone — at risk to do the rescues."   Water rushes over the falls at a rate of 150,000 gallons a second.   Lynda Satelmajer, of Brampton, Ontario, said she and her family watched the man as he entered the river and then went over the falls.   "He seemed a bit edgy, kind of jumping around," she said. "He walked over to where we were standing and he jumped and slid down on his backside and went over the brink.   "It was really freaky, actually. He was smiling."

      I'm going to take the dog for a walk soon. we're going down to the lake. i hope i can find some good signs there. that's been my thing. signs. i am constantly taking pictures of them. stop signs, 'do not enter' signs, left hand turn signs....for me, its something about the omnipresence of government in society. i take pictures of signs in front of cornfields, in front of rundown bulidings, churches...i like it went golfing again yesterday. my old man continues to beat my ass. i love to play though. get out on the open fairways, walk around for a few hours, what a game. i should find a home soon. i'm gonna go see pete yorn in grand rapids. that should be fun. the other day, i learned that... ...russia has 3 1/2 times as many libraries as the us. the oldest library is in prague. the library of congress is the biggest library. Japan has a relatively low number of libraries per capita. the swedes (and all nordic contries really) buy the most books per capita.  ...major southern us cities have a higher crime rate that other major us cities. Yuma and phoeniz arizona have the highest percentage of available sunshine of anywhere in the world. ...some composer has the record for the most grammies won. i think quincy jones was third with 20-something. Paul simon was not far behind with 16, i think. ...Antiqua and Barbados spends only 4 milion dollars a year on their military, the lowest in the world. they only have 4,000 troops. On the Island of Narau, 100% of the women get married. Egypt contains the largest number of muslim citizens. Anyway, i read this book called the "top ten of everything" that my dad has. it's pretty cool. those were some of the things i remembered. i get really geeked up about all that jeopardy-esque pointless information. party on.

           urlLink This  is priceless.  Red West  Artist:  The Red West  Album Title:  Red West  Date of Release:  Sep 30, 2003   AMG Rating: **** Genre:  Rock   Tones:  Elegant, Intimate, Restrained, Refined/Mannered, Calm/Peaceful, Sweet, Reflective, Lush, Delicate, Dramatic, Bright, Slick, Sparkling  Styles:  Adult Alternative Pop/Rock      While he was never very interested in accessibility during his short, bittersweet career, Jeff Buckley's acolytes usually try to shoehorn his majesty, soul, and meandering sound into a more cohesive frame. On their eponymous Atlantic debut, Cali's the Red West accomplish this with more success than most, if only because Jayson Belt's expressive vocal sway can appropriate some of the feeling in Buckley's elegiac voice. The album moves easily between the harder and softer sides of adult alternative, with "Don't Fall In," "The Balance," and "Crazy Cold" embodying the former, more Buckley-ish side of things, while the light, shuffling acoustics of "Twenty-One" or the singalong "Days Die" are closer to California beachfront campfire rock. It's an ambitious mixture. Although The Red West is filled with hooks, the quartet takes its time getting to them, and takes some routes that might be unfamiliar to the casual listener. The aforementioned "Days Die" drifts into a crackling fiddle and muted trumpet interlude, while "Disappear" rolls along on a surging piano and horn melody. Sometimes, this ambitiousness can be revealed as pretentiousness. Belt sometimes gets carried away with the sound of his own voice, and an untitled set break track that seems to ruminate on the relationship between the crowd and the band is aimless and, yes, pretentious. This is accessible pop music, after all, and shouldn't be caught up in too much conceptual drama. Luckily, the Red West put most of their ideas into melody and interesting songcraft. The adult alternative fan who found Buckley's Grace to be beautiful, yet too opaque, should be right at home with the Red West's more obvious version of that searching modern rock sound. — Johnny Loftus        1.

       MY BLOTTER IS FULL  I love police logs (aka blotters). In Seal Beach, one of my favorite cities around, I always used to pick up the newspaper to read the police log.  One time, it said something about a guy being found sleeping naked in his car covered in shrimp and fish.  I kid you not.  From then on, I was hooked.  The language they use in the logs is great: ‘transient,’ ‘suspicious person(s),’ and other words that you never see anywhere else. I try to picture the guys that have to write these every day.  They're hilarious.  At one time I was thinking about writing a script about a guy that is a police log writer for a small newspaper.  The guy would be an aspiring novelist, but can't get anything published so he makes up all kinds of wacky occurrences for the log.    But after reading some actual entries, I think real ones are even more hilarious than ones I would make up.  Here are some examples from the  urlLink police log at the medfield press    -Door in truck A resident of Main Street called to report that someone placed a door in the back of his truck on Saturday, Nov. 1, at 10:48 a.m. no damage.  -Stinky fire On Friday, Sept. 12, at 10:07 p.m., a residence from Adams Street reported that someone threw a bag of dog feces at the Dale Street School and set it on fire. The caller had put out the fire and clean the mess.  -A stuck skunk A caller reported that a skunk was walking with a container stuck on the head on Thursday, Sept. 11, at 8:21 p.m. at North Meadows Road. A driver reported that a skunk was on Rte. 27 near a fire hydrant was with a cup on his head, on Sunday, Sept. 14, at 1:22 p.m. The Animal Control Officer removed the cup from the animal's head. According to police, often times when skunks try to eat food remains from the bottom of cans, they wind up getting their heads stuck in the containers.  A caller from Spring Street was crying and very upset because he couldn't find his parents on Saturday, Oct. 11, at 6:55 p.m. Police kept talking to the caller while they were on their way and finally the father came on. The boy's parents were in the basement watching the game.   urlLink Here's another one   11:06 a.m., an MBTA conductor reported a suspicious person in the booth on Foster Street. When police investigated, they found a person eating lunch.  12:50 p.m., a King Street resident reported a large plastic Tonka truck was missing. Two neighbors disputed ownership of the truck. One of the people realized they had two trucks and the other had none.  11:09 a.m., a cell phone caller reported a suspicious person kneeling on the railroad tracks praying at the commuter rail station on Foster Street. Police found a person waiting for the train to Waltham. _____________________________________________________    What else is better than TPing?  This is an activity where one (overwhelmingly adolescents) sneaks onto other people’s property and utterly vandalize it.  In my career, I have also supplemented the TP with, cassette tape ribbon, Cap’t crunch, instant mashed potatoes, vegetable oil, tomatoes, tortilla chips, eggs, plastic, knifes, spoons, and (the favorite) forks. I think a well-TPed yard is a thing of beauty.  Especially on a full moon in the winter, when the snow and tissue glissen in the moonlight.  Ahh...be still, my heart. I have a real knack for "exterior decorating."  We hit one of my high school teachers with 100 rolls once.  But my favorite TP moment was in high school when me and my friend Dan Schwartz went to Tp our Youth Group leader Bob.  But, in addition to TP we made Works bombs.  I'm not going to describe how to make these devises because the CIA and the Illuminati are Patriot Act-ing my ass right now and if I say anymore I'll wake up tomorrow in Guantanamo.  But these WMA (Weapons of Minor Destruction) Dan and I made, involve an empty 20 oz bottle that makes a loud explosion as a result of a little backwood chemistry.  We TPed, then made 8 of those WMA suckers.  However, what we failed to plan for was the incredibly fast rate at which the WMA's readied themselves.  We thought we had a few minutes while the chemicals did their chemical thing but about halfway through our making of them, one exploded in Dan's face.  He started screaming, "Help me!  Help me!  I'm blind!  I went blind!"  I had to lead him by the hand through a ditch to Bob's garden hose amid random explosions occurring behind us.  Dan didn't go blind and Bob didn't wake up.  And that was the last time I played with WMA's. ____________________________________  I'll talk more about the upcoming presidential election in the future, but this can't wait.  I don't know who I'm going to vote for, but I know who I'm NOT going to vote for: Howard Dean and his creepy ass smile.

      I know Mel Dobberteen from high school.  Mel was bet 10 bucks to run head first into his car and make a dent.  He did it.  Mel crashed a motorcycle into a ditch and walked away.  He jumped out of a speedboat going 35MPH and got a concussion.  Mel was a boxer.  One time after losing a fight, he went into Burger King.  He ordered “5 cheeseburgers, no pickles.”  When the burgers came back, he bit into one, and guess what, he tasted a pickle.  Well, Mel was keyed up from losing and he went back to the counter and said, “I want 5 f-ing cheese burgers without f-ing pickles!”  He got them back and, pickles.  He went off.  He threw the cheeseburgers behind the counter and dropped many atomic f-bombs.  A policeman was there and warned Melvin and he would be cited for public obsenity.  Mel told him that he would “F-ing kill him.”  When we played basketball together Mel also told the ref that he would “f-ing kill him.”  Mel was thrown in jail for running over a gas station pump with his truck and also for shooting a truck with a potato gun.  This is only a part of the legend of Melvin.  I've told a bunch of people about the exploits of my friend Melvin.  Well, I found some pictures of him.  Here they are.

       THE BEATLES ARE AGENTS FOR THE ILLUMINATI!!!      Ladybugs.  Yeah.  In the last few years they have eaten this state.

At first it was just annoying, but then, I found  urlLink this ... "Over the years, several states, including Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, have attempted to establish the beetle as   a natural control agent of agricultural pests  ."  THE ILLUMINATII STRIKES AGAIN!!!  That's just spooky man.  We're being bugged.  They're beetles in disguise as ladybugs.  How much more tricky can these guys be.  I know they'll be talking about this on on  urlLink art bell .  That 2nd article was from 93, revised in 98.  They've been here ten years and have now spread to Michigan, a state not mentioned 5 years ago.  Thankfully, California will be last to be invested and then probably not until 2209.  At least privacy will be safe for west coasters for a while.   On a related note, every other TV commerical here is for lawyers. "Did you fall down?  Well let's help you sue the pants of somebody." That kinda stuff.  It's sick.

      Yesterday, was one of the better days that I've had in a while.  I looked though all these boxes full of old pictures. Pictures from High school, Jr. High, Elementary, and earlier.  It was great.  I love looking at pictures and putting myself back at the exact instant that flash bulb went off. Or thinking about all the stuff that’s happened in the time in between then and now.  I found some old notes.  Bordering on love letters really, but a Christian teenager version.  I’m a sucker for nostalgia, man.  The women I’ve been in love with, whether I was 14 or 15 or whatever, they are idealized.  These two girls in particular, Sarah Ann Foote from Arroyo Grande, California and the other Alania Caridi from Lord’s Valley, Pennsylvania, they were it.  They rocked my pre-drivers license world.  Everything was so dramatic from me at that age. The thing is, I find pictures of them in this box in my Dad’s damp shed. I haven’t thought about them in forever, but I see these pictures or read these notes and I’m like, “Alas, I will never love another as I did her, the perfection of woman.”  Damn. I heard Sarah was married.  I haven’t talked to either of them in 7 years though.  They probably both have grandchildren by now. I did find a picture of me kissing a girl. That’s always a bit shocking. Ever take any of those? Yeah? Well, I have. Plenty. And let me tell you, they suck. The pictures are dumb too. I had forgotten about this, but the big thing when you see people you haven’t talked to in awhile is “So do you have a girlfriend?”  Then you have to explain yourself. Well, I’m content with not being in a relationship, you know?  Well, I was until about the 50th time someone asked me who my girlfriend was.  I can hear these people now.  “Darren was always such a good boy, but since he went to California, I think he’s gotten a bit ‘funny’.”  Yeah.  F-off, Grandma. I know what my deal is with women though, I’m not aggressive with the ladies. At all.   I need to go up to hot women and then tap the Harbaugh.  Once the Harbaugh is tapped the ladies with be unable to resist.  And you know, most ladies with go for the funny man, even if he’s not a uber-attractive metrosexual. At least that’s what Maxim said. Shut up.  I’m going to bed.

      This is my dad.  We were hungry after cruising around Kalamazoo so decided to get some food.  It was almost 11 and I kept telling dad that all the fast food places would be closed.  I suggested Applebees or Olive Garden.  Well, he goes to Long John Silvers anyways.  It’s 10:56.  All the workers are leaning against the counter, talking. “We still have 5 minutes,” Dad said. Great.  That’s just what I want, some teenage punk to spit in my food. After much persuasion, I convince him to leave. Then he pulls in to Fazzoli’s.  Same thing.  They’re closing. He gets out, looks in the window, comes back. “We still have 3 minutes.” Again, I convince him to leave. Then he goes to Wendy’s.  They’re open late you know.  Yeah, right.  I give up.  We walk in the door as they are closing. Dad is slow.  He does everything very deliberately and very, well, slow.  I order my Classic Double and he’s still starring at the overhead menu and talking to himself. “Hmm...Taco Salad.  Chicken.  I wonder what...  Hmm...” 3 hours later he order the taco salad.  We got our stuff and he wanted to eat there.  I convinced him to leave because they were closing. As we walked to the van, I said, “Hey, I can drive.  I’m experienced at eating and driving. You can sit and eat your food.” “No. That’s all right,”  he said. Damn. We get in the car and he examines the taco salad. “Hmm.  Where’s the...hmmm.  I thought these came with meat.  Do you know?” “Iduhno.” I had already eaten all my fries. “Hmm...Yeah.  I thought they came with meat.” “You could put the chili on it.” “Hmm...I though they came with meat.” He examined the salad some more, then looked in the bag. “I’m going back in.” Oh no. He left then came back.  It was locked. “I need a fork.” Damn. We drove around to the drive thru. “I wonder what I should do,” he said. “You could just wait in line here.” He parked facing the Wendy’s building, between the two drive-through windows. Then he walked up to one of the windows, leaving the overhead light in the van on.  The effect of this was if I looked up, I was starting right at the employee at window #1.  I look to my right its the guy at window #2 and to my left was a constant rotation of customers ordering.  And of course I was illuminated for the whole world to see. Meanwhile, Dad is still standing next to an SUV, waiting for it to get its order and leave so he can get his fork. He comes back and starts to eat.  With the light on.  Not moving the van.  I can just feel all these people looking at me.  I mean, we are right next to the drive thru.  I tried to look down as much as possible as I finished my burger. But back to my Dad’s eating habits...  Earlier, I said my dad was a slow eater. Yeah. You have no idea. It is commonplace for me to almost be done with my meal as he is taking his first few bites.  This is a man that during the course of a meal must reheat his food at least twice.  I am not kidding. MY food was gone, but the adventure was just beginning.  I don’t know how long it was before we got back on the road, but it was a long time. Yeah.  All in all, It was pretty funny.  But next time, I’m demanding Olive Garden

      Hey-OH!  I'm in LA.  That's about it.  Although I thought the rain yesterday was a sign of the Apocolypse.   Also, I am planning to write a coffee table book on bread.  It will have pictures and essays and history. More on that later, but I know it will make me into a millionaire. Sweet.  This is what prompted it.  It made me feel sorry for bread.  Breadmakers Feel Pain From Atkins Diet  Sat Nov 8, 1:18 PM ET   By DAVID SHARP, Associated Press Writer   PORTLAND, Maine - Some bakers around the country are seeing a similar drop in business: With millions of people trying the diet created by the late low-carb guru Dr. Robert Atkins, overall bread sales are flat or down slightly, while bread-bashing seems to be at an all-time high.   A sign in Stephen Lanzalotta's bakery reads, "Senza il pane tutto diventa orfano." In Italian, that means, "Without bread everyone's an orphan."   But fewer customers are buying his European-style breads and pastries these days — thanks to the Atkins diet, many regulars are cutting back on carbohydrates. Lanzalotta says the low-carb diet has contributed to an estimated 40 percent drop in business at his shop, Sophia's.   Some customers have even stopped by to apologize.   "They'll say, 'I'm sorry. I haven't been in for six months because I'm on the Atkins diet,'" said Lanzalotta, whose muscular arms are a testament to long hours spent kneading dough.   The National Bread Leadership Council, which says 40 percent of Americans are eating less bread than a year ago, has scheduled what it calls a summit this month in Rhode Island focusing in part on low-carb diets and how to educate the public that breaking bread is still part of a healthy lifestyle.   "It's too bad that we just can't eat all foods in moderation. But no, we have to do something dramatic all the time," said Judi Adams, president of the Wheat Foods Council and a registered dietician, referring to the Atkins diet. "We have to look for this magic bullet."   Estimates of the number of Americans on low-carb diets vary widely, from 5 million to 50 million. Their boycott of bread has exacerbated a sluggish sales trend that was in place before low-carb diets became popular, said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential Equity Group Inc. in New York.   When Lanzalotta opened his bakery, bread accounted for 75 percent of sales. Now it accounts for just 15 percent. He boosted his dessert offerings and began offering sandwiches to try to make up the difference. He also adapted by selling artwork, including his own paintings.   At Standard Baking, co-owner Alison Pray said sales are nearly flat after previously growing 10 percent to 15 percent a year.   Pray sees plenty of couples stopping by, but often only one partner is eating. The other is cutting carbs.   She's a bit incredulous when customers ask if she produces anything consistent with the Atkins diet. "This one person asked me, 'Can you make a low-carbohydrate bread?' I said, 'I wouldn't know how to do it,'" she said.   Others are adapting. At Anthony's Italian Kitchen, owner Tony Barassa said his customers are ordering Syrian wraps without the wrap and panini sandwiches without the panini. They're also ordering meatballs without the spaghetti.   On Atkins, people can eat cheese, eggs and meat as long as they strictly limit carbohydrates and avoid refined carbs like white flour. White bread, pasta, potatoes and other carbo-loaded foods are blacklisted. The diet was once scorned by the medical establishment, but recent studies have shown that people lose weight without compromising their health.   The Wheat Food Council's Adams, who is based in Colorado, believes low-carb diets are just another fad. And she wonders if they're really helping.   She noted that the nation's obesity rate has continued to grow as flour consumption has declined. Wheat flour consumption has dropped by about 10 pounds a year per person since 1997, she said, calling Americans' tendency to eat too much of everything the real problem.   "We eat 300 more calories a day than we did in 1985," Adams said. "We supersize everything. We eat constantly."   Big Sky Baking Co. in Portland appears to have avoided the worst of the low-carb fallout because its whole wheat bread is the kind recommended for carb-cutters who can't resist a slice every now and again.   Owner Martha Elkus recognizes that times are changing. "The food pyramid has been turned upside down," she said.   Bread bakers aren't the only ones hurting. The pasta industry, the tortilla industry, bagel makers and even brewers of beer have taken their lumps for having too many carbohydrates.   The Tortilla Industry Association held a seminar last spring titled, "An Industry in Crisis: The High-protein, Low-carb Diet and Its Effects on the Tortilla Industry." The National Pasta Association has a "Diet Matters" section on its Web page that focuses on low-carb diets.   Joshua Sosland, executive editor of Milling and Baking News in St. Louis, said it's difficult for consumers to find good information amidst all of the hype that served to overshadow the science behind the diets. Often overlooked is the fact that bread and grains remain an important part of the federal government's diet guidelines.   "Here we have about the most healthy thing in the diet," Sosland said, "and it's being treated like it's poison."   Bakers are changing their products even as they seek to get out the message that bread remains part of a healthy lifestyle.   Flowers Foods' low-carb bread, "Nature's Own Wheat 'n Fiber," has proven to be the company's most successful new product launch to date, said Mary Krier, spokeswoman in Thomasville, Ga.   George Weston Bakeries Inc. has launched "Carb Counting" bread under its Arnold label that carries the Atkins seal. Maine-based Lepage Bakeries has introduced Country Kitchen "Lower Carb" wheat bread.   Panera Bread, a fast-growing chain that offers soups, salads and sandwiches in addition to bread, is also making changes to meet the evolving tastes of its customers. The company is testing three whole-grain breads with fewer grams of carbohydrates per slice.   "Our view of it is not to resist (the low-carb trend) but to recognize it as a real niche," CEO Ron Shaich said.  __  On the Net:  Atkins Web site http://atkins.com  National Bread Leadership Council www.breadcouncil.org  Wheat Foods Council www.wheatfoods.org  National Pasta Association www.ilovepasta.org  Tortilla Industry Association www.tortilla-info.com

      I'm going to become a substitute teach in the East Whittier School District.  They require that I get a TB skin test.  I was given a shot on Wednesday and had to have it looked at on Friday. -11/28/03. Friday. approx. 7:04 p.m. I arrive at the Whittier Community Hospital Emergency Room.  The waiting room was packed.  The woman behind the front desk told be to come back around 11.  I went and had some coffee and tacos.  I listened to a man play 'Free Bird.' -Friday. approx. 10:13 p.m. I arrive at the The Whittier community Hospital Emergency room for the second time.  As stand in the entrance doorway, I notice a pregnant woman doubled over at the front desk.  She is groaning, writhing in pain. -approx. 15 seconds later The woman lets out a bloodcurdling scream.  I hear a slimy noise, then see water splash on the tile floor beneath her.  Blood mixes with the water.  The packed waiting room is in shock as am I. -approx. 15 seconds later I hear crying coming from the direction of the women.  The noise is not coming from her mouth.  A reasonably-sized lump appears in her jogging pants.  The entire waiting room rises to it feet as if a touchdown has been scored.  Medical personal scurry like rodents.  A wheelchair is brought for the women.  One of the crowd yells, "No, she'll sit on the baby!"  The woman is eased into the chair.  I am still standing in the doorway of the entrance, holding my green half-sheet of paper for a doctor to sign regarding my TB skin test.  They pull down her pants to reveal a baby.  A BABY.  Alive.  A real baby.  Slimy.  Disgusting.  A nurse holds the baby.  There is a real umbilical cord.  There is blood.  I am too shocked to vomit or faint.  A nurse tells me to close the doors.  I try to close them.  No, move away from the doors.  They close on their own.  I move the wrong way.  A nurse guides me into the waiting room, past the puddle of human liquids, toward the chairs.  A man asks me, Are you the father?  I tell him that I am not.  He says, it makes you not want to have kids for a while, huh?  I nod.  On a TV above me was a news segment showing mothers in a shoving match outside of a Toys R Us earlier this morning, the Friday after Thanksgiving.  A boy next to me is playing with a dinosaur puppet.  He asks me if I have any money.  I'm poor, I say.  I give him 13 cents.  Do you want my car, I ask.  He laughs and steps on Cheeze-its that are on the floor.  A janitor wheels out a cart and begins to clean the floor near the front desk.  I walk past her and show my green paper to the woman behind the desk.  I can wait for however long it takes, I say, I don't have a lot to do.

      I'm going to Baja soon.  Awesome!  Billy, Dan, Keith and I are going down the 19th-24th.  That's the plan for now.  Merry Baja Christmas.  Fish tacos, here we come!  I love it down there.  Time for relaxation.  Substitute teaching is a lot of fun.  It's odd to have kid calling me "Mr. Harbaugh."  For the younger ones, I spell it out phonetically: Mr. Har-baw.  It's close enough.  My last name can give anybody trouble, let alone first graders.  Half the time it's 'Harbough'.  That's how it sounds, so it's good enough.  I can't spell or pronounce half the kids names, so guess that makes us even.  My first day of subbing, the school secretary introducted me to all the teachers as "the good-looking new substitute that we hope comes back here more often."  Great, all I need is 50-year old women hitting on me.  "Have any daughters, Lady?"  Things are good.  I've got an apartment.  A job.  A car.  not bad.  This all in a month.  I'm on my game.  This morning I washed dishes.  I don't think I've done that in a year.  AND...I'm washing my laundry this minute.  This is laundry that was dirty since before I left to go home to Michigan on Nov. 4.  Yeah, my housekeeping skills rule!  Went down to this crazy Christmas parade in Belmont Shore (part of Long Beach).  We (me, Billy, Brent) had a contest to guess how many people we there.  I said 16k.  Brent said 11k.  Billy said 14k.  Dan said 5k.  Yeah.  The paper the next day said there were 70,000.  We suck.

      WHERE HAVE YOU GONE...?  How ashamed I feel for not updating my blog.  It's a travesty, of course.  I've been a busy man though.  I recently finished a screenplay with my good friend Jesse Gloyd.  It's 93 pages, not a small feat, my friend.  We plan to pitch it to director  urlLink Dennis Dugan .  He's our only real Hollywood connection, one of those: 'my friend's roomates' dad is good friends with him' kind of things.  We taylor-wrote it for him.   The script is called "Of Mascots and Men,"  Though that will probably be changed.  I'll elaborate more on the script once we get it registered with the Screenwriters' Guild.  Word.  But things are lining up for this next year.  Next writing project will be for an independant piece that Trevor will direct up in Seattle.  We want to make our way ourselves.  None of us feel up for grad school.  Anyway, the consensus seems to be that if you take your money and invest it in a indie film rather than grad school, it goes to better use.  Trevor's a good director.  I have confidence that we can get the film shown in a few festivals.  I'll try my hand at producing the film (with the other guys).  It's an exciting opportunity.  Met with the  urlLink i.tv  people again.  Trevor had an interview.  They seem to like me, I'm just waiting to see what comes of it.  They way they talk. it's hard not to have delusions of grandeur.  I must say that this has been one of the best end of the year that I've ever had.  Got a car, a job, an apartment.  Trevor came down from Seattle and we hung out.  Drew got married.  I went to 4 parties at the end/begining of the year.  Halfway House Affirmation Night (Tradition among my group of friends where we hike up Tarantula Hill with some Bud and affirm one another), New Year's Eve, Drew's last night in the Bayou (House in Whittier) Party, and Drew's wedding reception.  All these parties were stellar, top-notch.

      DEAN GOES NUTS!!!  I love subbing.  It's great.  I rule school.  However, Howard Dean does not.  If you missed his speech after the Iowa Caucuses, you missed a treat.  He's better than Arnold!  Please.  PLEASE! check this out:  urlLink DeanGoesNuts.com .  The remixes are AMAZING!            Posted on Wed, Jan. 21, 2004	 Dean's Iowa speech shocks many By Jim Rutenberg NEW YORK TIMES   DES MOINES, Iowa - Sen. John Kerry's victory in Iowa took the political world by surprise, but it was Howard Dean's guttural, concession-speech battle cry that was as much the talk of the political world Tuesday.  The question that bounced around TV, radio, the Internet and even the Des Moines airport was if the speech would prove a defining political moment for Dean just as voters start paying close attention to the Democratic race.  "He looked hysterical," Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant said on the "NBC Nightly News."  "Howard Dean scared a lot of children last night," Tucker Carlson, a Republican political commentator, declared on CNN.  Like the other cable news networks, CNN played the image of Dean, shirt sleeves rolled up, neck bulging and arm pointing at the crowd, over and over.  The radio host Howard Stern played a recording of the tape and set it against background noise from a professional wrestling match.  Republican officials could not have been happier.  "That's six ads," one party official said, referring playfully to the number of advertisements that might be mined from that appearance in order to reinforce opponents' efforts to portray Dean as angry and nonpresidential.  Even some of Dean's supporters wondered how the speech would affect the race.  Dan Goldberg, a marketing executive with an independent film company in New York, said he had been planning to volunteer for Dean in New Hampshire.  After watching his Monday night speech, Goldberg said, he changed his mind.  "Any chances I would vote for Dean were completely erased by that speech last night -- scary," he said.  "I thought mirrors in my apartment would shatter. Especially in contrast with Edwards, who was fantastic."  Dean and his staff described the focus on his speech as another instance of unfair treatment at the hands of the news media, which they accused of turning an surprisingly upbeat address, despite a third-place finish, into a negative.  But political experts and some Democrats said the speech could prove to be for Dean what Dan Quayle's famous misspelling of the word "potato" was for him in 1992: a reinforcement of a perceived character flaw.  In Quayle's case, the misspelling went to questions, fair or not, about his intelligence.  In Dean's case, the speech went to questions about his temperament.  Even before Monday night, rivals sought to portray Dean as the angriest man in politics, prompting "Saturday Night Live" last weekend to caricature him as an offensive, cursing egomaniac.  Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University, said of Dean's appearance, "I think many people watching it would have thought he was just losing it, big time.  "It's a moment that provides a window into the soul of the man, and it reinforces many of the fears that people have expressed about Dean: That he's angry and that he doesn't have the proper temperament to be president."  Then again, other presidential candidates have had similarly low televised moments and still gone on to win or retain the White House.  During the 1992 primary campaign, Bill Clinton, after erroneously concluding that the Rev. Jesse Jackson had endorsed Sen. Tom Harkin (and also wrongly thinking that a nearby camera was turned off), called the move a "dirty, double-crossing, backstabbing thing to do."  It was a rare glimpse of one of Clinton's flares of temper. But that was before the age of three cable news networks and heavy Internet use, and it did no apparent damage to his campaign.  Dean and his aides played down the attention paid to the speech. Answering questions from reporters in New Hampshire, Dean said he was simply trying to rally Iowa volunteers gathered to see him off Monday night.  "Last night there were 3,500 people there who had worked for weeks in Iowa," he said. "And I thought I owed them the reason they came to this campaign, which was passion."  Responding to characterizations of the speech as a "meltdown" Dean's media strategist, Steve McMahon, said, "It was not.  "It was an acknowledgment that Sen. Kerry had won a primary but the people in that room had changed politics forever."  In a telephone interview, Joe Trippi, Dean's campaign manager, vented frustration with the coverage of the address.  "I think it's being mischaracterized. That's another thing that we're used to," Trippi said.  "I kind of thought that the news of the night was that, when he walked on the stage, the party was more energized than any victory party I have ever been to."    Dean's act in Iowa is over the top Candidate's speech raises eyebrows after caucuses Radio & TV: David Folkenflik  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Originally published Jan 21, 2004  Democrat Howard Dean's fiery oratorical style has clearly stirred a devoted core of followers. But as the former Vermont governor attempts to rebound from his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, the question is not: Can he lead the country? The question is: Can he do TV?  Here's what the printed transcript would tell you Dean told supporters Monday night as they waved flags and cheered.  "Not only are we going to New Hampshire," Dean said. "We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico, and we're going to California and Texas and New York. And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House. Yeah."  But that fails to capture the alarming energy of the scene. Dean was punching the air as he barked out the name of each state in a raspy voice. And the final word in the quotation above was a surprising barbaric yawp, even from the emotive Dean - more of an extended "yeeeee-arrrghhhh" than a measly "yeah." It fired up the faithful who were processing Dean's third-place finish in the Byzantine Iowa caucuses.  And it inspired almost uniformly bad reviews.  "Television is such a hot medium. It intensifies everything," says Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political scientist who studies media and the presidency. "You look angrier [on television]. Really, what you want to do is cool things down, not torque things up."  For one thing, no one's been that publicly demonstrative about Oklahoma since the last revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  MSNBC news anchor Keith Olbermann says the episode was "goofy-scary - and I don't know exactly why it was scary."  Dean's fevered pitch, while seemingly an effort to rouse a group of his faithful, appeared to outsiders utterly out-of-proportion to his standing in the caucuses, Olbermann says during a telephone interview. "I'm not sure if he was doing Hulk Hogan or if his voice was Louis Armstrong," Olbermann says. "This was not a television issue. This was a political disaster that happened to be on television."  In a caption, CNN invoked "Dizzy Dean," a nice allusion for 1950s baseball fans, while an anchor referred to the "Dean Scream," a desperate effort to rhyme in the absence of alliteration.  "I'm afraid what you saw there is Howard Dean rubbing salt into his own wounds," Clifford May, a former journalist and Republican Party spokesman, said yesterday on CNN. "He was badly hurt. ... Last night, Howard Dean was not presidential." Then, going in for the kill, May resurrected the Cold War-era question: "Do you want that man with his finger on the button?"  On the air, Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron, who reported that many people say Dean looked particularly angry Monday night, remarked that rivals believe the following truism: "The angrier Howard Dean gets, the less popular he becomes." A Fox News anchor posed this question about Dean: "Is he shooting himself in the foot?"  But the media may have been piling on, says Democratic consultant Victor Kamber. "The press is making too much of it," Kamber said on CNN yesterday. "He was exuberant, he was tired. His people in the room loved it. Critics didn't like it. I don't think it'll have one iota of bearing in terms of going forward."  Initially, Dean defended his remarks. But by yesterday afternoon, according to the Reuters news wire, he changed course. "Today, I am going to give a different kind of speech," Dean told supporters in Manchester, N.H. "Those of you who came here intending to be lifted by ... a lot of red-meat rhetoric are going to be a little disappointed."  That's probably overdue. Kumar, the Towson scholar, says people tend to seek leaders with a personality that comes across as moderate. And Dean's Monday-night geography rant will only affirm lingering doubts about his temperament. "Bursts like that of hyperactivity - the public does not look favorably on that," she says. "That kind of exhibition will stick in our minds."  A year ago, Olbermann touted Dean as a plausible dark-horse candidate. Now, Olbermann says of the one-time leader of the pack, "We're not debating if Howard Dean was imploding - we're asking why. And that's not a good place for a professional politician to be."

      HUH?  I honestly have no comment  urlLink on this one...   First Christianity-themed nudist resort to open in Florida 	 Thu Jan 22, 1:30 PM ET  TAMPA, United States (AFP) - The first nudist resort created primarily for Christians in the United States is due to open in Florida and its co-founder claims that he can provide passages in the Bible where nudity is prominently mentioned.   "Depending on the version of the Bible you use, there are as many as 40 passages that refer to nudity," said Bill Martin, co-founder of Natura, which will be the first Christianity-themed nudist colony in the country when it opens in a Tampa suburb in April.   "In (the Bible book of) Isaiah 20.2, God tells Isaiah to go into the wilderness naked for three years. So there's historical basis for a Christian nudist lifestyle," continued Martin, who is a Quaker.   When Natura is completed, the 240-acre resort area will have 500 homes, a hotel, a water-slide park, and a non-denominational Christian church. Although nudity will be mandatory, attending church services will be clothing-optional for residents, according to Martin.   Followers of the Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mennonites, and Quaker religions are some of the different Christian denominations who will call Natura home.   "Fundamentalist Christians and the Southern Baptists may object to us, but I will meet with them anytime to talk about both Natura and nudity," said Martin. "It's funny that some Southern Baptists oppose us, because for about the first 500 years after the death of Christ, mass baptisms were done nude."

      DETENTION  It's Saturday.  That's about it.  It's 1:04.  p.m.   I'm in the Whittier Public Library on Washington Ave., near Penn St.  There is a guy in front of me checking out ladies on an online dating service.  Good for him.  He is wearing glasses.  I'm not.  I think the website he is at is called "hot singles."  Shouldn't be looking at that in a public library, buddy.  Somebody that is bored will write about you in his blog.   I'm still teaching.  I taught 1st grade the other day.  This little girl, Jessica screamed at me and cried because I asked her to do her math homework.  I gave her a tootsie roll pop though and then she was happy and stopped crawling under desks and hitting other children.  So far in my subbing experiences, students have mistaken me for: Frodo (elijah wood), Clay Aiken (American Idol), Mario (video game character), and some guy from 'that 70's show.'    Don't ask me why.  I don't know.  They're kids.  Highlights so far:    One day I was supposed teach kids about 'longitude' and 'latitude.'  You know, the fake lines that surround the globe vertically and horizontally.  Well, the entire day, I taught the students the opposite of what I was supposed to be teaching them.  I still don't know which is which.  Anyways, at the end of the day, I realized my error.  The real teacher, who was in a meeting, came in and I told her: "Yeah, a lot of the kids had trouble with the latitude and longitude.  I was really trying to explain it to them, but they just couldn't get it.  You might want to go over it with them again."  That same class was studying the Crusades.  So I say:  "You know what the Crusades were don't you?  It's when a bunch of white people went and murdered Arabs and stole their land and said God told them to do it.  This worksheet you have is a bunch of crap.  I can't believe they are trying to teach you this.  This is ridiculous."  Any time I encounter a lesson in Columbus, I make sure that the students also know that Columbus' goal was to find gold, when he didn't, he murdered and enslaved the native people.  Most History books lie.  In one class, they didn't understand what it meant when it said:  "Living conditions on the Mayflower were unsanitary." I told them that it meant that "the Pilgrims crapped on each other."  They thought that was great and wrote it down on their worksheets.  I would love to see their teacher's face when she reads that.  Oh and detentions aren't called detentions anymore.  You don't give detentions, you give an Accelerated Learning Center (ALC) Referral.  What is that?  I call 'em detentions.  I say; "Anyone want a detention?"   They say; "They're not called detentions.  They're called Acc--" I say: "I'm the teacher and I call 'em detentions.  You want one?" I have no fear of giving detentions.  I play the detention game. "next person that talks, next noise I hear---detention." Then I watch until someone talks.  Usually they're quiet.  but the other day, it was the class president that was the first to talk.  too bad....detention.

      GOD BLESS THE SOUTHLAND  I'm reading about the ten plagues.  Man, would that suck to be on the wrong side of that.  Frogs, flies, lice, boil, darkness.  All that stuff.  That's like living in California.  Floods, fires, mudslides, earthquakes. riots.    I can't help but laugh at people's impression of California back in Michigan. - "Yeah, I'll fall into the ocean some day."   Huh?  That sounds like some kind of Monty Python skit.  But I'm serious, people say that.  - "All those earthquakes, I could never live out there."  I've lived out here 5 and a half years and felt one tiny earthquake.  Hello?  Blizzards anyone?  Tornadoes?  - "California.  That's filled with gays."  I don't know really what about this comment, except, yeah.  I think California is 9/10ths gay.  -  "All those Mexicans out there..."  Again, i don't know.  There same peopel that say this, eat Taco Bell by the barrel full.  Well, I can say this, when I went to Utah a little while back, I was kinda nervous because there were so many white people around.  It was kind of spooky actually.  Anyways, God bless Ah-nold, and God bless the Southland.

      Who goes to the library on Valentine's Day?  Me.  ha.  I love the library, what can I say.  The other day at school sucked.  I wanted to kill all the children in class.  but I didn't.  unfortunately.  I got more comments of who I look like though:  some kid from Jurrasic Park 3, some kid from Tarzan the Disney animated feature, Jack Osbourne, and the lead singer for Incubus.  Right.  I saw 'City of God'  the other day.  I'm still reeling from it.  I'll talk more about it later, but it was incredible.    A quick review of my favorite movies I've seen this past year: -American Splendor -City of God -Pirates of the Carribean -Big Fish -The Bourne Identity  Might as well do CD's I've bought as well: -Sam Roberts "We were born in a flame" -Dandy Warhols "13 tales from urban bohemia" -Wilco "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" -Coldplay "Rush of blood to the head" -Beck "Sea Change" -Flaming lips "Yoshimi..." -Oasis "What's the story..." -Oasis...  ok, actually I've bought every Oasis cd ever made this past year and I love them all, so, yeah.  anyway.  I'm done.

      EWCSD AND HEART DAY     I'm teaching third grade today.  I think that's my favorite.   urlLink This  is who I work for.  East Whittier City School District.  I'm been working a bit lately.  So that's cool.     My favorite game to play with the kids is 'Simon Says.'  Man, i've been playing that everyday.  That game is awesome.  I'll tell you what, there's some solid Simon Says gamers in East Whittier.      Valentine's Day is coming up.  I don't have a Valentine this year, not that I'm all that excited about the valentine's i've had in the past...  but moving on...  I was dating someone not too long ago, but I got burned in that situation.  It's interesting being on the other end of that for once.  Yeah, I'm serious.  It wasn't my fault this time. Kind of.  You can ask anybody.  I was responsible for dating her in the first place, so I've got to use better section powers next time, but out side of that...   I've realized that from all the relationships I've been in, that i've really learned what i DON'T want in a woman.  I know the possitives I'm looking for, but now I've got the negatives that I want to avoid down pat as well.  Also, I've realized that, until recently, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a woman that would want to date me.  Big problem, huh?  Catch-22.  But I've been pretty proactive recently and have asked God to help me not be a dumbass.  Slowly but surely i'm being transformed and some Valentine's Day soon I'll be ready for my Valentine.

      OVERZEALOUS?  American Airlines pilot calls on Christian passengers 	 Mon Feb 9,12:50 PM ET 	 NEW YORK (AFP) - An American Airlines pilot is facing an internal investigation after reportedly asking Christian passengers to identify themselves, and suggesting that non-Christians on his flight were "crazy."   Speaking Monday on CNN's "American Morning," several passengers said the Sunday flight from Los Angeles to New York had not yet taken off, when the pilot chose to address everyone on board.   "He said he'd recently been on a mission trip, and he'd like all the Christians to please raise their hands," said passenger Jen Dorsey.   According to fellow passenger Karla Austin, "He said, 'If you are a Christian, raise your hand.' He said, 'If you are not, you're crazy'."   Austin said no passengers raised their hands.   The pilot also asked passengers to look around at each other and use their flying time wisely.   American Airlines said the pilot, whose name was not revealed, had recently returned from a mission trip to Costa Rica.   In a statement, the airline said his comments amounted to a "personal level of sharing that may not be appropriate for one of our employees to do while on the job."   Passengers said the remarks had made them deeply uneasy and that many on board had reached for their mobile phones, fearing the pilot might take some sort of drastic action.   "Just given the history of what's happened on planes in this country, anything can happen at this point," Austin said. "There was definitely implication there that we felt that something was going to happen."   Complaints were relayed by flight attendants to the cockpit, and 45 minutes into the flight the pilot issued an apology, but one that was directed at his crew for having had to deflect the passenger criticism.

      THE RICE, PYTHONS, AND BRIAN     I learned how to cook rice.  I cooked a lot of it yesterday.  It's still setting on the stove.  I think I'll go eat it now.  Yum.  I've been writing a lot.  I hope something comes of it.  Jesse and I have been working on short films to send up to Trevor.  That guy needs to move down here soon, but that's a whole different topic.  I'm doing the read through the Bible in a year thing.  Now i'm in Exodus in what I sometimes call the 'boring' part.  That's kinda sad on my part.  It just frustrates me when they say things five times: "sacrifice the lamb on the fifth day.  On the fifth day you shall sacrifice the lamb.  And when the lamb has been sacrificed on the fifth day, over an insence sacrifice after the fifth day.'  repeatative, ya know.  It reminds me a lot of  urlLink monty python and the holy grail.        This part in particular:   LAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade. ARTHUR: Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him. Brother Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade! MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. ARTHUR: How does it, um-- how does it work? LAUNCELOT: I know not, my liege. ARTHUR: Consult the Book of Armaments! BROTHER MAYNARD: Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to twenty-one. SECOND BROTHER: And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu-- MAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother. SECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.' MAYNARD: Amen. KNIGHTS: Amen. ARTHUR: Right! One!... Two!... Five! GALAHAD: Three, sir! ARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom]   That reminds me...i just watched 'life of brien'.  I'm hoping the pastor preaches on that next sunday.     Here's a summary of that film from  urlLink imdb :  1st watched 6/4/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Terry Jones): Mostly unfunny movie based on a child born in a manger next to Jesus called Brian. Some of Monty Python's humor comes through, but it doesn't seem to work too well in this setting. I think that if it wasn't in reference to Jesus Christ they could have made this movie funny. The movie itself does not make fun of christians or Jesus but rather things in the time like stonings, lepers, and the Romans. The funniest scene in my opinion just happens to be the last of the movie where one of the crucified breaks out into song about looking at the bright side of life. There were not enough funny scenes to recommend this movie. Their best in my opinion is still their earliest 'The Holy Grail.'     urlLink Here's  the entire script if you've got some time on your hands.  I don't really recommend this movie.  i just thought it was really interesting.  Anyway...

      Man, I saw a great rock and roll show last night.  Richard Swift, man.  http://www.richardswift.us  He's a musican.  Mind blowing instumentalization and harmony.  Really hypnotizing, ya know.  There are certain albums that put me in a trance-like state: Sea Change, Rush of Blood, Amnesiac, Kid A, Play, 18.  I don't listen to 'trance' music and don't have a desire to but I love to zone out to albums.  I always put on music when I go to bed.  I think I listened to Getz/Gilberto every night for like a year straight.  That was what kicked it off.  I started listening to it in Ukraine of all places.  Those hypnotic albums are the bee's knees for me come bed time.  If anybody can recommend any other bitchin' zone-out albums let me know.  Pet Sounds, Dark Side are good too.

      I taught 6th grade today.  I noticed that the class was watching The 1959 classic film "The Diary of Anne Frank."  Now I know this is a bit odd, but I fell in love with the actor that portrayed 13-year old Anne Frank;  one Millie Perkins.  But hold on, before you burn me at the stake, take note that Millie was 21-years old at the time of the shooting and bears a resemblence to another oldtime starlet I adore.        Then I found this on  urlLink imdb :  Audrey Hepburn was first offered the role of Anne Frank. She refused it for two reasons: she had decided to accept the role in Green Mansions (1959) and, more importantly, she had lived in occupied Holland during the war and had seen the Nazis carry out street executions and watched as they herded Jews onto boxcars to carry them to concentration camps. She knew that making the film would bring back memories that were far too painful for her.  Yeah, Audrey would have 30-years old at the time of filming.  I wouldn't have minded though.  Kinda skews my view on 13-year olds though seeing as I just taught a classroom full of them today.  Anyway, Millie had an odd career.  Here's her bio from  urlLink hollywood.com :  Millie Perkins  Biography She won one of the most coveted roles in Hollywood history--Anne Frank, the Jewish teen who still affirms the human spirit while hiding from the Nazis--in George Stevens' "The Diary of Anne Frank" (1959). Yet the almost fragile, seemingly eternal dark-haired ingenue Millie Perkins failed to ignite with the audience to become a big movie star, partly because she projected an ordinary quality. There was so sense of urgency or recognition of the inherent dangers. After finding steady work in the 1960s, she seemed to disappear in the 70s, only to renew her career as a strong supporting player in the 80s and 90s.       Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of a sea captain, Perkins was a junior model and cover girl before winning the Anne Frank role. Her second film was "Wild in the Country" (1961) opposite Elvis Presley; it was de rigueur for every ingenue at the time to play opposite Elvis. (In a twist of fate, Perkins would later portray Gladys Presley, Elvis' mother, in the short-lived 1990 ABC TV series, "Elvis"). She continued her leading lady career in such efforts as "Ensign Pulver" (1964) and even was alongside Jack Nicholson during the Roger Corman period in "Ride in the Whirlwind" (1965), which Nicholson also wrote and co-produced. But by "Wild in the Streets" (1968), it was apparent Perkins' screen career was faltering. After her marriage to writer-director Robert Thom, Perkins seemingly retired, appearing only sporadically in film and on TV. It was not she was cast as Jon Voight's ex-wife in "Table For Five" (1983), that Perkins re-emerged. She had retained her delicate, porcelain features--her face had hardly--but her body was sturdier, and she now projected far more personal power and strength. Now relegated to supporting parts, she played Sean Penn's mother in "At Close Range" (1986), Charlie Sheen's mom in "Wall Street" (1987) and the parent of murder victims in "The Chamber" (1996).        On the small screen, Perkins first appeared on TV in 1960 on a Bob Hope special, and made her episodic debut on an episode of "Wagon Train" the following year. When she resumed her career in the 80s, she worked with some regularity in character roles. Perkins played a rape victim in "A Gun in the House" (CBS, 1981) and went on to a number of portrayals as wives, married to drunk driver Don Murray in "License of Kill" (1984, CBS) and Ed Asner's ailing Norman Cousins in "Anatomy of an Illness" (1984, CBS). Even in her first regular series role, she was typecast, playing the estranged spouse of William Devane on the CBS primetime soap "Knots Landing" during the 1983-84 season. Moving into maternal roles, she was cast as the penultimate mother, the Virgin Mary, in the NBC miniseries "A.D." (1985) and was the parent of the young Patty Duke in 1990 biopic "Call Me Anna" (ABC). Six years later, she appeared alongside Duke as an Amish woman in "Harvest of Fire" (1996, CBS).    I noticed that she's still alive.  I should ask her on a date.  She's 66, but in Hollywood isn't that more like 42?  I could work with that.

      IT'S A BACKPACK LIFE FOR ME  I went surfing at seal beach on my day off monday to celebrate the presidents.  it was dope.  i want to do it more often.  i hung 10.  i did a ridiculous amount of spring cleaning the other day.  I gave away 2 garbage bags of clothes, 2 boxes of books, and threw away 2 garbage bags full of absolute crap.  i win.  I'm finally becoming not a pack rat.  woo-hoo!  pat me on the back when you get the chance.  it's been a long journey.  i keep everything.  I think i have the receipt for my birth around somewhere.   but seriously, every movie stub, receipt from road trips, homework, the list goes on.  it's crazy. i went through a bunch of stuff, but you could have just thrown away boxes from my garage when i wasn't looking and i wouldn't be able to tell you what i was missing.  it's sick.  materialism, man.  it's a killer.  many times i've said i want to go minimalistic.  i still do.  i own no furniture.  it's on purpose.  i hate bulk.  i still have 3 boxes full of books though.  i couldn't bring my self to part with steinbeck, hemingway, keroac, and the rest of the boys.  you know how it is.  but if i could carry everything i owned in a backpack, i'd be a happy man.  pipe dream, i know, but i can dream can't i?  I have a dream that every man rich and poor will carry all their posessions on their back...ok i'll shut up now, but consider it, eat up my words, young sages, for they are wise and will bring healing unto your souls unto the 3rd and 4th generations...or maybe not.

      MAGNUM TIME AND ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US     I really enjoyed this  urlLink Magnum PI article   I found today.  Dude was from Detroit.  He looks kind of like my dad too.  I've decided to become his biggest fan.  I am now turning my blog into a Tom Selleck fan page. Check it out, I found his  urlLink stats:   ZUR PERSON Name: Tom Selleck   geboren: 29. Januar 1945   Geburtsort: Detroit, Michigan / USA   Grösse: 1,92 m / a.A. 1,96m (US-Masz: 6' 4")   Augenfarbe: haselnussbraun   Haarfarbe: braun   Eltern: Robert Selleck (Bankkaufmann) und Martha Selleck   Geschwister: Brüder Robert Selleck Jr. und Dan Selleck   Werdegang: Aufgewachsen in Los Angeles, um sein Studium finanzieren zu können, begann er mit Werbeaufnahmen. 1970 hatte er seine ersten Gastrollen im Fernsehen und spielte in einer Serie mit dem Titel "Brachen's World" mit. Von 1969-1977 spielte er meist nur kleine Rollen in Kinofilmen. Seine erste Hauptrolle bekam er 1977 in der Miniserie "Die Sacketts".   Aufmerksamkeit erregte er von 1979-1980 in "Detektiv Rockford". Den grössten Durchbruch schaffte er aber erst 1980-88 mit der Serie "MAGNUM p.i.". Für diese Rolle wurde er 1984 als bester Hauptdarsteller mit dem 'Emmy' (US-TV-OSCAR) ausgezeichnet.   Magnum-Star Tom war am Boden zerstört: Sohn Kevin (geb. 1966) war schwer alkoholkrank. Süchtig, wie viele  Kinder aus verpfuschten Star-Ehen ! Tom Selleck hatte den blonden Kevin im Alter von zwei Jahren adoptiert, als er dessen Mutter Jacquelyn Rae (42=2001) heiratete. Die Ehe hielt allerdings nur neun Jahre (a.Q 11 Jahre). Nach der Scheidung  blieb Kevin, damals 15, bei seiner Mutter. Auch als Tom dann das englische Fotomodel Jillie Joan Mack (geb. 25.12.1957) heiratete, versuchte er, den engen Kontakt mit seinem Sohn zu halten. Dennoch glitt Kevin immer mehr ab. Bei Liebeskummer und Studienschwierigkeiten tröstete er sich mit der Flasche. Der Student an der Universität von Kalifornien verfiel dem Teufel Alkohol immer mehr. Und "Magnum" macht sich nun bittere Vorwürfe: "Immer wieder habe ich ihm Geld gegeben. Immer wieder machte ich ihm teure Geschenke". Tom, der sehr an dem Jungen hängt, gibt sich selbst die Schuld für Kevins Sucht. Das Schicksal seines Sohnes wird nun für ihn selbst zum Problem: "Ich hätte ihm lieber mehr Zeit statt Geld schenken sollen", quält sich der Hollywood-Star mit Selbstvorwürfen. Als Kevin sich und andere mit waghalsigen Promillefahrten in Lebensgefahr bracht, griff der Vater ein. Er schickte Kevin in die berühmte Betty Ford-Suchtklinik. (Werdegang - Quelle: "Echo der Frau" 1989)   Familie I: Tom war von 1970-1982 mit Jacquelyn Ray verheiratet und hat mit ihr einen Sohn Kevin [geb. 1966] Jacquelyn ist Schauspielerin und Model.   Familie II: Tom ist seit September 1987 in zweiter Ehe mit der Engländerin Jillie [Jilly] Joan Mack [1999=41] verheiratet. Tochter, Hannah Margaret Mack Selleck ist 1989(a.Q.1988) geboren und das erste Kind der Beiden.   Jillie hatte (mindestens) zweimal in der Serie "Magnum pi." mitgespielt. Tom lernte sie bei den Dreharbeiten kennen und verliebte sich in Jill. Sie ist Schauspielerin und Tänzerin.   Martha und Kevin spielten 1987 in der "Magnum, p.i."-Folge "Irrungen und Wirrungen in der Psyche" mit.   Wohnorte: Familie Selleck wohnt auf Hawaii und in Californien (Los Angeles) auf einer 60-Hektar-Ranch.   Fan-Adresse: Tom Selleck c/o Banana Road Productions 100 Universal City Plaza Building 507, Suite 4A Universal, CA 91608 USA   Musik: Tom Selleck - "High Road To China" - Wazir 03:27   See!  I told you he was a cool guy!    urlLink Also:   Magnum’s Baseball Caps - Tom Selleck played private eye Thomas Magnum on the Hawaiian-based detective drama MAGNUM, P.I/CBS/1980-88. During the run of the series, Thomas and his pal, "TC", the helicopter pilot often wore baseball caps. Thomas was extremely fond of two in particular: a Detroit Tigers cap (which he first wore on episode “China Doll” 12/18/80); and a cap with the logo VM02 that he wore most often (first seen in episode "Tropical Madness" 11/12/81).  This cap was a souvenir from his days with his VM02 naval intelligence unit in Da Nang during the Vietnam War. T.C also had a VMO2 cap from his days in Nam. Magnum's grandfather was a Detroit Tigers fan, and so Thomas became one, too. On episode "Adelaide" 03/19/81) Thomas wore a red and white "Al's Collision and Muffler Shop" cap for the first time and on later episodes. On episode "Try to Remember" 01/28/82 Thomas has a car accident and wakes up in intensive car with amnesia. Soon after, the police find his Detroit Tigers cap near a murdered body. On episode "Squeeze Play" (11/17/83) Thomas wears a Detroit Tigers cap with an orange "D" on the cap. Normally, Magnum wore a cap with a white "D" (White means "home" game; orange means an "away" game). On episode 153 "Tigers Fan" Lt Yoshi Tanaka (Kwan Hi Lim) is murdered. At the end of the episode, Tanaka's son, Biff presents Thomas with his father's Detroit Tigers cap as a keepsake. Tanaka, like Magnum was a big Tigers fan. Magnum had given Lt. Tanaka a Tigers baseball cap the first time they met on episode "Try to Remember."      TRIVIA NOTE: Actor Tom Selleck hails from Detroit so the Detroit Tigers hat was an homage to his hometown team. Thomas Magnum was also seen wearing a baseball cap from the University of Southern California, where Selleck played junior varsity baseball in college. In 2003  Planet Hollywood sold part of its memorabilia collection from TV shows from the 1940s to the 1990s. On sale was Tom Selleck's Hawaiian shirt ($1,346) and a blue baseball cap with a handwritten "T.S." sewn into the lining ($1,617) from Magnum, P.I.. When Tom Selleck starred in the baseball comedy Mr. Baseball (1992) he wore a blue baseball cap with the letter "D" in his role as Jack Eliott, a fading baseball player who gets traded to a Japanese league called the "Chiunichi Dragons."

              ODD SCENES  I was driving to the library on Valentine's day.  At a stop light a noticed a teenage boy crossing the street.  He was dressed like a skater and carrying a boquet of flowers.  I thought, "Huh, that's cool.  I wonder who he's going to give those to."   I look down the street and there was a fire truck and ambulance, lights flashing, parked in front of a high-rise retirement community building.  "Shoot. Happy valentine's day,"  I thought. I noticed the kid crossing the street and walking into that same building as an elderly person was being wheeled out off and then loaded into the ambulance. odd.  One of the most bizare scenes for me though was on 9-11.  I was woke up, saw one of the towers fall.  I was totally freaking out.  Jesse and I decided to go buy Bob Dylan's new cd, (Love and Theft) that was released that day, to get our minds off everything.  We walked into Wal-Mart and there was a tv in the entryway showing all the distruction occuring in NYC.  Near the TV was an in-store McDonald's with a bench on which sat a life-size plastic Ronald McDonald.  A lady was sitting on the bench next to Ronald watching the 9-11 stuff on the tv.  The Ronald figure had his arm on the bench around the lady.  It appeared as if he was comforting her or something.  It was flat out freaky, man.  Anyway, I have president's day off.  I'm going to celebrate the presidents and go surfing in their honor.  word.

      i've been ill.  under the weather.  i went bowling.  i told 8th graders that i made it to the 3rd round of American idol last year.  then i sang a Backstreet Boys song to them.  they ate it up.  I was a superstar.  Then I told them about the Holocaust.  The transition was better than the one I just made though. It was actually a really intense discussion.  The kids were really amazed and shocked and paying attention to the material.  teaching is crazy.  from me, kids have heard about slavery for the first time, the holocaust, martin luther king, Native American slaughter.  That's daunting man and oddly cool at the same time.  It's just odd for white bread dmh to be speaking to a room full of hispanic 1st graders about civil liberties.  i like it.  well, recently:  we (jesse and i) gave a couple of our scripts to Dick Van Dyke, among others.  It the past week, we've shipped out scripts to about 6 different people I believe.  Pretty cool.  We're working on a couple new full-length scripts.  One that I hope could be shot rather than sold.  We'll have to see if trevor is up to it.  I could see it being done under a million dollars.  Which is saying a lot.  "Of Mascots and Men" would need at least a 30 million dollar budget as it currently stands.  I recently wrote a 10 minute short about a puppet that would have taken about 10 million to make after the first draft, but then I chopped it up.  I origionally stated bill murray, ray liotta, kevin cosner, john cusack, katie holmes, ashton kutcher, haley joel osmont, billy crystal, barry zito, dmitri young, nolan ryan, don knotts, and james earl jones to star in it among others.  yeah.  i decided to take it down a few notches. we are teaming with trevor to make a movie this summer.  there's a warehouse in the film.  besides that i'll leave you guessing.  oh there's a surfboard too.  and maybe Dick Van Dyke.  i need to get to this...yeah, i watched 'the passion'  i can't really say anything about it.  i don't really want to.  it's not a film in the traditional sense.  i was not entertained.  i was not educated.  i winced.  i shuddered.  i was in pain.  i was in a sense stunned, impressed upon, affirmed, greatful, anguished, distraught, confused, and exhusted.  but i was not entertained.   what do you do with that?

      this is pretty cool:  Posted on Thu, Feb. 12, 2004   Childhood dream graces Vanity Fair  By PETE TATTERSALL THE SUN HERALD  In the summer of 1982, 11-year-old Eric Zala and 10-year-old Chris Strompolos, both South Mississippi residents, set out to make their own adaptation of Steven Spielberg's "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The effort became a seven-year odyssey that would nearly ruin their friendship and resulted in at least one trip to the emergency room.  Now, more than 20 years later, their childhood film project has not only resurfaced, it has evolved into something of an underground cult favorite, landing them a 10-page spread in the March issue of Vanity Fair magazine and sparking negotiations to film a feature movie about their story.  "I think everybody remembers when they were kids, and they had some grand scheme that they wanted to pull off, or a daydream, some kind of childhood ambition," said Vanity Fair writer Jim Windolf, who stumbled upon the story while surfing the Web site www.AintItCoolNews.com. "Most people don't do it, and these guys actually did it."   ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Raiders Fan Story Sold   Scott Rudin has purchased the life rights of the trio of filmmakers who constructed the ultimate tribute movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation, Variety reported. Rudin obtained the rights from Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb, who as adolescents in Mississippi launched a shot-by-shot remake of Raiders in Zala's backyard while on summer vacation in 1982. They finished seven years later at a cost of $5,000 to $8,000, the trade paper reported.  Strompolos, who starred as Indiana Jones, came up with the idea when he was 10 and told his friend Zala, who was 11, about it as they rode the bus to school. Zala eventually storyboarded the 649 scenes in the film; Lamb, who was a fan of horror movies and Rick Baker special effects, shot on a VHS camcorder, the trade paper reported.  After the film was completed, it remained largely unknown until it was discovered two years ago by filmmaker Eli Roth, who submitted it for a showing at the fourth annual Butt-Numb-a-Thon Festival organized by Harry Knowles in Austin, Texas, in December 2002, the trade paper reported. That led to a letter of endorsement from director Steven Spielberg, the trio's story being pitched in Hollywood and a "Raiders of the Lost Backyard" story in the current issue of Vanity Fair.  Windolf's article, titled "Raiders Of The Lost Backyard," meticulously details the unlikely tale of Zala and Strompolos' (the two were later joined on the project by buddy Jayson Lamb) shot-for-shot remake of "Raiders."  "The second I read about it, I tried to track down the guys," Windolf said. "I did an Internet search to find them, because I thought every magazine in the world would want to interview them."  In December 2002, Ira Roth, a filmmaker who released his first movie, "Cabin Fever," in 2003, and AintItCoolNews.com founder Harry Knowles, premiered the movie at a 24-hour film marathon in Austin, Texas. It charmed the audience.  "Eli Roth was a friend of someone who used to be a roommate of Eric's at NYU, and he had a copy of a copy of a copy," Strompolos said. "And Harry Knowles published a review after the world premiere."  When Roth returned to Los Angeles, said Strompolos, he passed a copy of the film, titled "Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation," to Dreamworks, where it eventually filtered up to Steven Spielberg.  "And Spielberg wrote us a lovely letter, congratulating us and letting us know what a great job we did," Strompolos said.  Now, negotiations are under way to option the film rights to Strompolos, Zala and Lamb's childhood story. Think "Stand by Me" meets "Goonies" meets "Raiders," Strompolos said.  "We just did it because we didn't know that we couldn't. And that sort of creative energy was captured on camera, and that charm, that die-hard quality is what people are attracted to," he said. "I think the innocent and raw energy that kids have was captured over those seven years, and that's what caught peoples' attention."

      I am the King Midas of laundry.  I have so many clean socks and underwear now.  I feel so luxurious with the variety I have now in selections.  "hmm, should I go with the plain black boxers, or the cat in the hat ones, or the taz ones, or how about some red boxer briefs."  Shoot.  I feel like a millionaire.   Black socks, brown socks, green socks.  It's amazing.

      One month till baja.  There's about 5 people going now.  good times.  I'm doing my laundry today.  big time.  I'm on my last pair of underwear and have been regulated to wearing sandals on account of lack of clean socks.  I wish someone would invent self-cleaning laundry sometime soon.  Played 'boggle' last night.  I hate it.  I think it's the worst game ever.  I was so far in last place it wasn't even funny.  I just couldn't find the words.  It gave me a headache.  I think it might have something to do with the fact that I'm red/green color-blind.  or maybe not.  at any rate, I think that any game that uses an hourglass is stupid.  what is this- ancient greece?  use a frickin' clock!  Thursday night bowling might become a weekly event.  I really sucked last week, but it's a lot of fun, a dollar a game.  can't beat that, man.  I'm experimenting with a wicked curve ball.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  In our latest script, we're writing from the perspective of a 6-year old girl for a bit of the film.  I've got to say that I love how this script is turning out, but anyway, It'll be interesting because I've never really written from a female perspective and in this script we've got about 4 main female characters.  I think Lucy (the 6-year old) won't be too difficult to write because I'm around kids everyday, but the older characters might be a bit tricky.  I think it's easier for females to write about males than it is for males to write about females.  why?  we still live in a male-dominated society.  It's of a lesser degree today than in the past, but females have to assimilate to a male mindset in everyday life.  I don't ever really have to see things through a female viewpoint.  But almost everything is male dominated: government, sports, entertainment, higher education, religious leadership...and on and on and on.  Thus the male centered mindset.  anyway, forget about.  i've just been thinking about that a lot.  man, I'm hungry.  mac and cheese?  yeah, that and top ramen is about it.  i've got $2.87 to my name.  Come on, payday!

      HEATWAVE!  It is so freaking hot!  Yesterday the thermometer supassed 95 degrees and today feels the same.  A couple days ago it was in the 50's.  I went from using my heating to using my fan overnight.    Yesterday afternoon I went to downtown L.A. to the Los Angeles Islamic Center to hear a couple talk that spent the year in Baghdad.  However, The LA marathon was going on and blocked my path to the destination.  I ran in the marathon for 2 blocks.  I was passing everybody.  of course, they were all on mile # 26, but hey, whatever.

      I am "teaching" an 8th grade class at Hillview Middle School and I have to piss like a Russian race horse.  I drank a crap load of coke at lunch, and cups and cups of coffee throughout the day.  I'm going to die.  There's still 30 minutes left in class. We're watching "The Diary of Anne Frank."  THis is the 3rd times I'm seen it today. Oh man.  Too much coke.  I'm dead.  I'm going to pee all over the classroom.  This sucks.  I'm never going to drink coke again.  I hate it.  It's dumb.  Why would anybody drink that crap.  What a stupid dummy dumb dumb drink.  AGHHHH!!!

      I had a pretty normal week, a few cool things, but  I thought I'd review it to shed a little insight on a dmh week.  DMH Week in review. Starting with: Thursday, March 18 - I was a sub for a P.E. teacher at Hillview middle school.  I worked with Tisa.  It was picture day for the jr highers.  all i did all day was read the newspaper.  After school I read some bible, then I wrote a few pages on my 'bigfoot' script in the writing room at the Bayou, then I skipped my weekly bowling night because Brent invited me to go down to L.A. to see Barry Cavin's (ex- biola theater prof) new play 'fetish.'  friday,  March 19 - I was back at hillview m.s. in a class that I've subbed for before.  It was 8th grade language arts and social studies.  the class watched an Anne Frank video (babe!) and I surfed the internet all day.  Then I went home, read some bible, and wrote on the script for a while.  at night Billy, Dan, Frank and I saw "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" in Long Beach.  We got some brews at E.J. Malloy's afterwards.  I didn't spend the night in Long Beach though, which is a departure from my normal weekly activities (i'll do it tonight :) )     saturday, March 20 - Went with Frank down to a protest march down in Hollywood.    It was protesting American military occupation overseas.  I don't like the amount of US involvment overseas, but I went mostly to see the show.  It was incredible!  Thousands of people going crazy.  Signs, chanting, drums, shouting, preformance art, anarchists, democrats, socialists, homosexuals, palestinians, koreans, me, frank, a hummer made out of cardboard, excellent.  I loved it.  I met a hot muslim babe too.  Frank got all up in her game though.  Frank introduced my to the famous LA street hot dog.  It rocked.  a hot dog wrapped in bacon bought from a street cart.  yum!  Then i went home , read some bible, and wrote the rest of the night i think.  sunday - march 21 - went to church (grace brethren of long beach). i talked matt maust and nate warkentin too long though and missed the adult bible fellowship i go too afterward.  ate lunch with matt miller, frank, Bryan mazarello and hsi wife down on at pauls place 2nd st in L.B. i had a savory gyro.  we walked around belmont shores and I went home, wrote a little and then went to Matt bethancourt's engagment party  monday, march 22 - kindergarden at Ceres elementary.  It was exhausting.  oh, but i had a huge lunch break on which for some reason i went to stater brothers and bought 10 cans of wolfgang puck soup. I'm pretty sure all i did that day was read the bible then write on the script (seriously, exciting life, huh?).  tuesday march 23 -  1st grade at scott avenue.  I liked this class.  They were a bunch of huggers.  cute kids.  We learned about the number 10.  He hopped 10 times.  counted 10 shamrock and 10 stars, and colored 10 flowers and I drank 10 cups of coffee (well, almost.  I've really been pounding the coffee lately.).  After school, Jesse was back from hawaii so we ordered a little caeser, talked about our scripts and watched 'modern times' a charlie chaplin flick.  I don't think i wrote too much this day.  i chilled on the porch at the Bayou (matt, andy and jesse's place), then went home and bibled it up.  wednesday march 24 - i had a half day at oceanview, one of my favorite schools, the day started at 11:30a.m, so i slept in (yea!), made some coffee and bibled it. until work.  Dude, what did I do wednesday? oh yeah.  I wrote a little after school, started reading "for whom the bell tolls" by hemmingway,  then Dan, Billy and I went to a Long Beach state baseball game.  Jared Weaver, one of the top pitchers in the nation, was throwing.  it was cool, but the best part was this 'mascot' at the game named Joe.  He was hilarious.  I didn't really understand the whole thing though.  He wore a LB State jersey that said "joe" on the back and walked around carrying a laminated picture of a woman from the JC penny catalog.  he made fuuny faces and noises at people and was mentally hadicapped.  seriously.  between innings, he was "elvis joe" and put on a wig and danced and sang and played guitar.  i don't know, dude.  afterwards Andy met up with us and we had some pints a EJ Malloy's  thursday march 25 - for some reason I was in a serious funk yesterday.  I was down in the dumps, like really depressed.  I was back at oceanview.  The day went ok, but I got a huge headache, went home laid on the couch.  I didn't feel like writing, reading Hem or the bible, or watching a movie, or taking a nap.  I was in limbo and it sucked and i had a headache.  Ever feel like that.  it wasn't that I didn't have motivation, but everything that i would normal do appeared repulsive to me.  I wanted to run away.  I was depressed about writing, about relationships (or lack of femaleness), my own spiritual state before God, everything.  I hiked up taranutula hill, which is a few blocks from my place.  form there you can see the ocean, LA, Long beach, orange county, catalina island, most of the Southland really.  its one of my favorite spots.  I like trying to figure out where things are like a really life Rand mcNally in front of me.  I watched the sun go down and the lights come out.  the sky was beautiful.  baby blue, and purple and orange and black with all the greater la lights too.  It was great.  I still had a headache though and was still serverly depressed.  i wanted to drop out of society.  Then i began to remember memory verses I had learned on Teen Mission Int'l went i went to Ukraine and Thailand and Belieze.  I started saying them out loud.  verses like matt 10:28-30 and jer. 33:3 and phil 4:13 and Romans 8:18, 28, and 38-39, Acts 1:8, john 3:16,  Dude, it was like i could remember them all.  i had a huge peace.  afterward I went to hear matt miller read some poetry and then we all hit up bowling night in LBC with billy and dan.  friday, march 26  today is great.  i skipped work.  and got up at 11:30.  i'm doing the read through the bible in a year and i read in deuteronomy.  it's rough man.  repitition.  but i'm getting through it.   Then i hit up "For Whom.." I was listening to jazz while i was reading, then it hit me.  There's this cd, by Christopher o'brien.  it's solo piano of Radiohead songs.  I really wanted that cd right then.  I just had an urge.  it was like the munchies..  so i went up and put my laundry in at the MAT and bought the cd uptown at loevels.  it is incredible.  earlier i talked about how radiohead puts me in the trance like state.  well, i'm listing to it on my disc man.  i go back to the laundrymat and put my clothes in the dryer.  i sat there listening to my cd watching my clothes spin for about 10 minutes.  it was hypnotic.  i was in trance or something, but is the most peaceful I've felt in a long time.  i recomend doing it some time.  i just watched the dryer.  "oh theres my tigers shirt, there's my cat in the hat boxers, there my towel, theres my red boxer briefs, there's my paisley shirt..."  i loved it.  i wish i would have stayed all afternoon.  then i ate at this new cafe in Uptown whitter 'crepes and grape"  i had a chickem, roma tomato, feta cheese, mushroom, whole wheat crepe with an espresso.  i dreamt i was in europe.  it was so savory.  it was the most satisfied i've been my a meel in a long time.  today has been incredible

      I love tax time.  i get over 500 bucks back.  Beat that.  I'm gonna be rich.   Baja.  Soon.  First Week of April, come soon!  I think I might go to central america for a month this summer even if i don't have the money.  I just really want to go.  I need an extended wandering trip.  I'm planning on going with frank.  i believe he'd be a good travel partner.  It remains to be seen whether he's good enough to punch in the face though.  (Side note, I've punched two of my good friends in the face, one while traveling in Croatia ["watch out.  the wine is fiunny there.]).  Anyhow, I think that trip will do me good.  I've applied/sent resumes to teach at a private school next year.  I've hit up a luck number 13 different schools.  It's a even mix between high school and elementary/jr high.  We'll see.  I need some money coming in to fund my overseas adventures.  I'd rather spend thousands of dollars traveling every year than on a new Ford Taurus or whatever the heck people do with their money.  Because, dude, I am so poor it ain't even funny.  You could combine all the money I've made the past three years and it still wouldn't equal a year's salary at most private schools, which don't pay all that much themselves.  i hate money.  NEXT...        go see "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  It's ridiculously good.  It killed me with a broadsword.  It's the best movie I've seen in a long time, and that is saying A LOT.  It's the best Charlie Kaufman movie.  I was emotional through the whole thing really.  The directing, artistic and otherwise, is awesome.  Kaufman is such a good writer, he makes me want to run away and live in baja for the rest of my life seeing that he is the standard to which I hold myself.  I was in a daze for a couple days (ha) after seeing this film.  Stunning, mind-blowing, skillfully made, thought-provoking, trippy, artsy-fartsy, intense...I'm moved just thinking about the film now.   Shoot.

      i'm back and the tigers are 4-0.  what the freak else has happened since I went to baja?  man on mars?  one-world government.  damn.  i'll enjoy it while i can.  i'm burnt and peeling.  the sun liked me a little too much.  many stories, many good times.  big chill.  i read a book there.  It felt like i was reading my journal.  it's "blue like jazz" by Don Miller.  I feel it's a necessary read for any thinking Christian.  shoot.  it was incredible.  anyways, as a result I've decided to make a big effort to develop friendships with non-christians, give more of my time and money to the poor, and to tithe.  among other things.  check me on this in a couple months.  but it sucks, Christ called us to help the poor, to feed them, to care for the widows and the orphans.  I don't do squat.  It's in the bible for a reason.  It's supposed to be my job.  big conviction for me.

      Yeah, i'm still here.  I'm sick today though.  A cold.  Can ya believe it?  I've been though a dry spell in the writing dept.  hopefully I can kick that back up a notch.  I think I'm going to go to starbucks right now and write.  or at least try to.  we'll see.  I've applied to be an elementary teacher in the LA unified school district for next year.  I hope that works out.  I'd be working down in the city.  serious stuff, bro.  I think alot in the shower.  It's kind of like my office.  i get really good ideas in there.  So today i was deep in thought, the gears were really grinding up in mi cabeza.  So i turn the water off and start drying my hair.  I was so enraptured in my thoughts that I has forgotten to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  it was pretty stupid.  the lesson from this story?  I don't know.  I'll tell you later.  peace.

      Yeah, I've been MIA for a while.  blah blah blah.  I had a lot to write, but I'm feeling drained.   Alot to do.  I', taking a test to be a teacher.  I'm got an interview to be a teacher.  I'm got to take a nap.  yadda yadda.  i've been really tired recently.  nap nap nap.  I feel like an elliot smith song.    get this.  these questions were on my biola internet resume thing..

         I need to write more.  quick story.  i was teaching first grade.  all the children were sitting on the carpet infront of the daily calendar.  two boys come back from the bathroom.  one says, "ewww!  someone pooped all over the floor in the bathroom!.  "EWW!!!!" says the whole classes.  the two boys sit down.  a girl says, "ewww!!! there's poop on the carpet."  "EWW!!!" everybody says as they all scurry over to look.  "Rogelio brought it in on his shoe!"  "EWWW!!!"  "IT"S POOP!!!"  I tell everyone, "get back to your seats!"  the children continue to hover over a spot on the carpet, i peel them away and sure enough, there's a marble-sized pellet of poo on the carpet.  a girl smelled near it as said "Ewww!  it IS poop!"  another girl tired to clean it up.  i just set a paper towel on the area.  they went to recess soon after and i was left alone, in the room, with...IT.  "well"  i thought, "i've got to get that out of here.  i got a bunch of paper towel and went in for the kill.  as i did, an overwhelming sense of utter contempt and disgust came over me and i cursed that piece of poop all they way from moscow to timbuktu.  it made me feel better.  it's an emotion i believe that few have had. i could be wrong but i believe it only comes when one personaly and unwillingly handles another human's excrement.  try it out.  broaden your horizen  I think I got a job.  I'm not sure.  Almost though.  High school english teach for LA unified.  It'd be awesome and challenging and a job.  Not having a job that pays me more than my age (in thousands) is kind of a bummer.  Aren't you supposed to make twice your agae.  I don't think I really care.  I just want my loans paid off.  Debt, man.  I'd be better to have a millstone tied around my neck and to be tossed into the heart of the sea.  and then I blasphemed.  but anyway, it's heavy.  I want to earse debt so that i can move to spain and live on the beach and don't have to make payments.  Payments are for the birds.  It's like jail.  You're in debt you're whole flipping life.  school.  car. house.  kids.  if i could break even here, at least for a few years, that would be incredible.  a few years of freedom.  Billy an I were talking and thought that we should write a book about the "middle years.'  single people in their 20's are a prettu marginalized segment of society.  for example, church have ministries/programs for children, middle school, high school, college, married couples, seniors.  Don't try to tell me that 'singles groups' count.  that's just creepy.  Singles groups?  is this a meat market?  what can't churches think of a something better than that?  Maybe we're not marginalized to advertisers though.  Even though we're poor, we've got a bit a disposabe income.  I'm bavk in my wandering mode, i think.  teaching is cool.  if i found something better, i'd do it though.   what's better?  writing for a travel magazine.  getting paid to sleep.  food taster.  astronaut.  I think this may be one of my most confusing, pile of mental diarhea posts ever.  i'm all over the place, kemosabes.  i've dated a little.  this relationship between me and a gal escalated.  she was cool, but i realized. i don't want to date any one.  seriously, at least.  i told her this.  she didn't really understand.  i don't really understand it.  but i said, " i like my free time.  i like hanging out with my friends.    right now i don't want to feel obligated to share my time with someone else.  I like reading abook when I want to and going to the pub when i want to.  i'm selfish with my time and i like it that way.  i could put time and effort into a realationship, but i don't feel like it.  if we went out, i'd be unreliable and unloving, because i'd eventually feel like i was in jail because i want to be free."  funny huh.  i don't get me.  she asked if i thought it work out between us.  i said, "no, probably not."  "why not," she said.  "i don't know.  i just don't gfeel up to it," I said.  I'm just so pessimistic toward realationships.  I just hear about negative things in relationships.  obviously.  good aspects of relationships aren't extolled in detail.  anyway, a few of my friends have got relationships, but in general, but relationships i hear about are not existant, shaky, depressing, or broken.  I've already got the effects of my parents breakon how i view a relationship to deal with in addition to that.  so it's all to say.  i just want to chill.  solo.  it'll take a hot dish to turn my head.  it can be done.  but now i'm happy with my status.  i had been waking up and first thing on my mind was to talk to God.  then this girl starting creeping into my mind.  i hated it.  it's something i can battle and all that, but i want as few distractions as posible.  i'm weak, but i want God at the top.  i can't handle women. they consume me.  not of my friend have jobs.  real ones anyway.  when do that start to happen? success.  what's that mean?  it could be fame.  but look at musicians, or actors or whoever that are popular and your like, "i could to better than that."  i found how people get there.  you don't have to be the best, you just have to be motivated.  motivation.  so determined, 100% that you're going to suceed at this "thing."  I don't have that thing.  there's nothing, job/carrer-wize that i want to pour my hear into.  or some cause.  i applied to the peace corp, but but that on the far back bummer.  i want to travel.  work.  have fun. and drink lattes, beer (preferably Czech brew), egg nog, and pereier (that french sparkling water in the grren bottle.  it's yummy).  i could pour my heart into showing love to others though.  so, i just started volunteering with the middle school group at church.  it's cool.  i'm excited.  the kids are crazy, fun wild.  and like me at that age...annoying  :)  i'm also part of a team that works on meeting the needs of single parent families, widows, and others in need in the church.  it's an exciting thing that i think will have a big impact on people that are hurting and needy.  i'll bet this has a lot of typos.  let me know if theres any funny ones  i'm not checking it.  it did that as a job once.  i'm over it.

      THE SKINNY ON THE DIP (FRENCH STYLE) AND COURTESY FOR A COURTESAN  My nomination for least desirable food item to purchase on a short lunch break: French Dip Sandwich. Let me say this, I've always been a fan of the French Dip. That was before today.  I ran to Arby's.  The Dip seemed like a good choice.  I hardly ever get things to go (I dine in.  It's my style).  But I thought that today was the day to branch out.  I got The Dip and a large curly fries to go.  They gave me a little styrofoam container of the dip juice.  I set the bag on my passanger seat as I cruised back to school.  Little did I know that The Dip was trying to escape on the way to Oceanview Elementary.  I arrived at my destination and grabbed my bag of Arby's savories.  But cursed was me!  Fate dealt me a cruel hand!  The dip juice had broke open.  It had not only dipped my entire bag and its contents but had dipped my passenger seat, my day planner, my sweater, a book, my cd and most of the floor as well.  This toxic dip ate though the bag and as I snatched it from the passenger seat it disintigrated as I held it over my lap.  So the dip sandwich, curley fries, packets of horsey sauce, arby's sauce, catsup and a fountain of bovine-scented juice (that was plotting my demise in the bottom of the bag) assaulted my loins.  I was dipped.  It was disaster.  Curley fries decorated the pavement.  The driver's seat joined the dip party, drinking up the rest of the juice, my pants did the backstroke in the pool of dip.  I picked of the fries and put them back in their container.  I wasn't going to waste them (God made dirt and dirt don't hurt!).  I angerly devoured the remnant of my lunch, offering it up as a sacrifice to my frayed nerves and offended appetite.  I pulled myself together and pushed on through the rest of the day, exhibiting the character of the professional that I am.  But WARNING! anytime you have a desire for the French Dip, PASS.  Because as I type, my eronous zone still reeks of liquid sirloin.  And that wasn't all today.  Yesterday some of the students in the 5th grade class I'm teaching couldn't shut their mouths.  So today, they had to get a dictionary and write the defintion for courtesy 15 times.  I told them to copy all three definitions. It was all great, but at the end of the day I was looking through the papers and saw that one student, instead of copying all three definitions, she copied the definitions to three different words.  One being the word "courtesan."  Definition?  "A prostitute, most commonly found in a royal court."  I wonder how that converstation went with her parents. "So, Jackie, what did you learn in school today?" "Well..."

      NAYKID HICCUPPING ROCKSTAR IN GUATEMALA I taught kindergarten the other day.  They are going on a trip to a farm so i read them stories about barnyard animals.  Afterwards they had to color pictures of the animals, then write a sentence about each one. Daniel, the only white kid in class incidentally, colored his pig and said smiling, "Teacher, look at what I wrote!" I looked at his paper and read out loud, "'The pig is a naykid pig'. Oh, the pig is naked.  Yeah, Daniel.  That's true.  I guess the pig IS naked." "Look at what else I wrote," he said snickering. "'The pig now how make pig,' I read.  "What does that mean?" "The pig knows how to make pigs," he said. "Oh, he knows how to make other pigs?" "Yeah." "I see--"  The other day I was teaching 5th grade and we were out on the playground playing Melonball (baseball but with a kickball-style bouncey ball).  Briana, a girl from my class, was up to bat and she lined a shot and smashed the pitcher, a girl from room 4, right in the face.  The room 4 girl, dropped immediately and started weeping face down in the dirt.  So cartoonish was the incident that a burst of laughter escaped from me before I ran over to check and see if she was ok.  She was alright, but Briana was crying because she was sorry she hit her.  Then Natalie started crying because Briana was crying, then Wendy started crying because Natalie was crying.  Pretty soon all the girl were crying.  Well, all that is except one girl who was laughing and making fun of the girls that were crying.  She started laughing so hard that she started hiccuping.  Picture this for a moment.  The whole scene was so surreal that I would have felt more at home in a Dali painting.  I just got a Little Caeser's pizza.  5 bucks for a large pepperoni.  What an awesome deal.  ate it while watching Mr. Show which has been the dvd favorite as of last.  We're on season 3 now.  So funny.   I was a big loafer today.  slept in late, read, sat.  i plan on doing more of it.  right now actually... Saw The Shins put on an awesome rock show last night down in L.A. at the Wiltern.  Rockin' show.  The Fiery Furnaces opened for them and inspired me to start up a rock band.  I'm positive I can be a superstar.  I'm THE talent.  I'm got star power oozing out of me.  one glance from me and the ladies will swoon.  No doubt about it.  THe problem is, despite my awesome stage presence I need some musicans.  I'm a preformer not a musician.  All interested parties contact me immediately.  I've already drawn interest from Tom Morello, Flea, and Mike D, so act quickly.  The supergroup will be like a rage against the machine/stevie wonder/white stripes/ben folds/chemical brothers influenced sort of thing.  an entity in an of it's self.  I'm such a draw i guaruntee maganize covers within a year.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1...blast off! I am going to Guatemala in 3 weeks.  I get to hike up volcanoes, explore mayan ruins, chill on the carribean coast.  word.  I leave on June 22nd. I'm been doing a lot of research and reading for this trip.  I'm pretty excited about some of the places I'm going to.  I'm going here (tikal):    Volcanoes around Lake Atitilan

        I sneak in here and go swimming in their pool and chill in the hottub.  It's the hilton (now radisson) in whittier.  One time we snuck in and the pool area was surrounded by a bunch of people that were dressed kind of nice.  Not your normal poolside attire.  There was an older couple in the pool, a bit loaded from sipping on mixed drinks.  "Come on in!  It's fine!," they called to us.  So we got in.  I swam around, but began to get an eerie vibe.  All the people around the pool were snacking on finger foods and were dressed in black.  Then I looked near the hottub and there was a giant photo of a woman with flowers placed around it.  I had walked right by it when entering the pool area.  Then the drunk couple began to make disparaging comments (rather slurred and loudly, I might add) about the photo and the woman, who happened to have been beheaded in a machete attack at a Ralph's supermarket in Irvine.  yeah.  I wouldn't have believed it, but I had read about the incident a few days earlier in the LA Times. I wanted to leave, but Jesse and Andy wanted to walk behind the photo and chill in the hottub.  We got in, reeling from this surreal scene that was before me.  Then andy, shirtless, barefoot, and dripping wet with clinging boardshorts decided to help himself to the snacks among the mourners.    Here's John Greenleaf Whittier for whom the town is named.

      A while ago I began writing my memoirs.  Then I stopped.  I just read over them and I think I will post a bit on the ol' blog here.  It might inspire me to keep on keeping on.  "My junior year of high school I made the big switch to public education.  I figured that it was as good a time as any to get my first girlfriend.  So I found a girl and asked her on a date.  It was pretty easy and not as terrifying as I thought it would be (mainly because her friends told me that she liked me and that she wanted to go on a date with me). So for my first date I decided to take her to the dollar theater to see "Twister."  I don't remember what happenned, but we missed the movie.  I had to do some quick thinking.  'What else do girls like besides movies?'  Toys!  Of course!  Well, at least I liked toys, so I took my date to Toys R Us so I could play with the toys there.  That place still gets me.  Everytime I go in there, I feel the spirits or millions of toys calling out to me and I go crazy.  It's like a fisher-price brand of Sars when i walk through those sliding glass double doors with the dumb giraffe on them.  Anyway, when my date and I went to the store it was Christmas time.  This was in the era of the first appearance of that delightful toy "Tickle Me Elmo."  That evening was the first time I'd ever seen the toy and I thought it was the best think since hygiene.  So my "date" that night pretty much consisted of me frantically scrambling down the aisles of Toys R Us activating dozens of the Tickle Me Elmo dolls and intermitently falling to the floor laughing my ass off as my date stood awkwardly by taking in this entire scene."  "It was enough to make her want to be my girlfriend though. 'Damn.  This love stuff is easy,' I thought, 'Why didn't I try it out earlier?'  We were official.  I gave her my ring and everything.  We held hands.  I figured I might as well have my first make-out session.  We were in the basement watching The Beatles movie 'Help!'  I think her parents, actually her whole family was upstairs.  I sat through the beginning of the movie wondering how to make my move.  At some point I just lunged at her, mouth first.  I started sloppily sucking her face, a bit violently I might add.  I'm sure I scared the hell out of her.  In defense of myself, All my impressions of passionate kissing were from hollywood.  And with that as a standard, I thought I was doing a superb job for a first-timer.  Then my mind honed in on that award-winning film 'From Here to Eternity.'  and I had the desire to roll.  At that moment I thought that rolling was the pinicle of making out, so i quite forcefully and awkwardly rolled her over me, then I rolled over her.  In the process I shifted all my body weight on to her illiciting some not so passionate grunts of protest.  Remember 'Stop-Drop-and-Roll'?  Yeah it was like that except with two people interwined and open-mouthed."

             Hank Jr. and Kwame (detroit mayor) celebrate the piston victory.  I LOVE THIS ARTICLE.   MITCH ALBOM: Detroit guts over L.A glitz for NBA title   June 16, 2004  BY MITCH ALBOM FREE PRESS COLUMNIST  They attacked all night, the way you attack a fire, the way you attack an enemy hill, no counting on luck, fate or chance, just sheer will and your own pounding lungs, drive the rim, drive the lane, until finally, the horn sounded to end their eight-month shift, which began in October and ended one week shy of summer. Rip Hamilton was jumping in place, a ball of energy. Mehmet Okur was hugging Tayshaun Prince. Ben Wallace took the spray paint and marked the last game with a big old "X." The team whose motto is "Goin' to Work" had put in a little overtime, and the once-mighty Lakers hadn't just been defeated, they had been stomped and crushed like Italian grapes. The Pistons didn't just beat L.A., they reduced it to a single letter: "L," as in loser. And as the music soared at the Palace the Pistons soared right with it.   Pay dirt.   "Never stop dreaming," said Chauncey Billups, the series MVP, smiling widely after the raucous 100-87 Game 5 victory that clinched the NBA title.   Never stop dreaming. But when you wake up this morning, you'll notice a new crown in town. It wasn't stolen. It didn't fall from the sky. The Lakers didn't squander it, and the referees didn't conspire it. The Pistons -- write this verb down -- won it. Got that, Phil? Got that, Shaq and Kobe? They won it. They captured it. They grabbed it right from Game 1 and owned everything but 11 seconds and one overtime period, in what some are referring to as the NBA's first "five-game sweep."   Along the way, they broke the mold of NBA championship teams. In the final, crowning, 48 minutes Tuesday night, Detroit ran dynamite under the Lakers' ego and blew it to shreds. From Billups' game-opening drive to a late Ben Wallace put-back slam, the team-oriented Pistons slam-dunked the superstar era, ripped up conventional wisdom and threw a bucket of paint on the portraits of four future Hall of Famers, who, for this season, only will be remembered as all the things the Pistons were not: greedy, selfish, whiny and discombobulated.   The Pistons, meanwhile, were five bodies and 10 hands at a time. And all their hands are on a trophy now. Detroit is back atop the basketball world after 14 years.   "I'm very fortunate to coach this team," a humbled Larry Brown said. "They play the right kind of basketball."   Pay dirt.   A perfect first half  What's left to prove? For pete's sake, they led at one stage Tuesday by 29 points! And from the tip, the Pistons showed maturity beyond expectations. Long shots were passed up. Short shots were passed up. If it wasn't a lay-up or a slam, they didn't want it. They scored more than half of their points (52) in the paint. On one play, Prince leapt twice for a loose ball and was already moving to the hoop before he even had control. He finished with a slam. That was typical. The Pistons shot 61 percent for the first half and had 55 points.   So much for the moment overwhelming them. They made the Lakers look old and slow. The fact is, the Lakers' best attitude came from Jack Nicholson, who played trash talk with the big screen. Unfortunately for the Lakers, Jack's only slightly older and slower than the rest of them.   Some will call this the biggest upset in the history of the NBA. How amazing is it? Well, remember, the series was preordained as the Lakers versus "the other guys." The Pistons were supposed to be mindful of their station. "Forget what happened before," pundits kept saying. "This game, you'll be put in your place."   They said it before Game 1, at the Staples Center, which the Pistons won by 12. They said it before Game 2, when the Pistons were supposed to collapse but didn't. They said it before Game 3, which Detroit won by 20. They said it before Game 4 -- another Pistons victory -- and they said it before Game 5, which was over by the third quarter. "This game, Pistons, you'll be put in your place."   They were. Their place is on the victory stand.   Hey. Maybe the Lakers were the "other guys" in this series.   Rings to everyone  Fingers, please. Who gets a ring?   Ben Wallace gets a ring. The big man with the big hair who was the locomotive of this chugging train finally will be a champion. He wasn't drafted, he was traded twice, but there he was Tuesday night, grabbing 22 rebounds, scoring 18 points, including a solo fast break that saw him leave the ground somewhere past the top of the key, a feat of both enthusiasm and gravity.   Chauncey Billups gets a ring. The point guard who wasn't good enough for the smaller stage in Boston, Toronto, Orlando, Minnesota or Denver was great enough for the biggest stage in the game. He takes the MVP award by averaging 21 points and 5.2 assists. But the best part? He wouldn't have cared who won it. "We don't play as a bunch of individuals," he said. "We're a basketball team."   Catch that, Shaq and Kobe.   Richard Hamilton gets a ring. He was everywhere in this series, racing off of screens, pulling up in the lane, curling to the baseline and rising to the backboard. A lot of people expected a certain shooting guard to be a star in this series; nobody figured it would be this one. Plastic masks are being marketed as we speak.   Larry Brown gets a ring. The coach who had done everything but this has now done this: won an NBA championship at age 63, oldest ever to do so and perhaps the most deserving to wait this long. Brown's stubborn focus on the old-fashioned basics -- ball sharing, rebounding, group defense -- brought down a Cyborg Lakers team built for a title, and stamped him in the history books. Five games? None of the victories was closer than eight points? Give us the finger, Larry.   We mean that in a good way.   Rasheed Wallace gets a ring. The newest Piston and arguably the most influential -- sorry about the word "arguably" -- was there again Tuesday night, hitting easy jumpers, playing big-man defense. People used to describe him only as "a hothead." Now they'll have to modify that. At worst, he's "a hotheaded champion."   Tayshaun Prince gets a ring. Watching Prince defend Kobe Bryant was like watching the invention of the iPod; suddenly, everyone's going to want one. Prince's long arms and quick instincts draped a net over the NBA's flashiest star, and by the end, Kobe was merely mortal. He failed to shoot 40 percent for the series. Meanwhile, you hate to see the NBA Finals end because Prince is getting better every night. It's hard to believe this quiet, lanky man is in only his second season. It is not hard to believe he was the reason the Pistons passed up on Carmelo Anthony. Not anymore.   And how about the man who made that decision, Joe Dumars? Joe gets a ring. It means more, he says, than the two he won as a player "because this time I'm responsible for the whole team." Not too long ago, supposedly wiser general managers were advising Dumars to construct a team the way they had done it, one superstar, maybe $20 million a year, and a bunch of role players. Dumars thought about it, then said, "No thanks." He built on character, toughness and team defense. And consider this: Besides Lindsey Hunter, who went and came back, there is not a single player on this roster from four years ago when Dumars took over, yet everyone that he would want to keep for next season -- with the possible exception of Okur -- he will keep.   That's his hand in this.   Give it a ring.   Hunter gets a ring, his first as a Piston. So do Corliss Williamson and Elden Campbell, all men who are well-traveled in this league and old enough to know how rare these moments are. On the other end, Okur gets a ring, as does Darko Milicic (what a baptism!). Mike James gets a ring. Darvin Ham, too. The coaching staff, loyal to Brown, is rewarded, too.   All of the above, and all next year, will be referred to as part of "the Detroit Pistons, defending NBA champions."   How's that sound?   Shocking the hoops world  So how will history remember these Finals? Mostly for their shock value. Here's how shockingly good the Pistons were. They beat the Lakers in five, and the Lakers had home-court advantage. Remember, these were the same Lakers who knocked off San Antonio, the defending champion, by winning four straight, then knocked off Minnesota, the West's top seed. Obviously, they must have been doing something right.   But suddenly, in this series, as the losses mounted, it wasn't about the Pistons' success, it was about the Lakers' loosening their screws. This Finals series, it seemed, would only be over when the Lakers said it was. Even before Tuesday's head-chopping -- facing a 3-1 deficit that no team had ever come back from in the Finals -- the purple-and-gold superstars acted as if fate had promised them a championship.   "I'm telling you right now, we'll win Tuesday," Kobe Bryant said.   Too bad.   "We have every intention of winning this game," Phil Jackson said.   So sad.   "Got to win," Shaquille O'Neal said.   Buh-bye.   Enough already about the team upended. Can the sports world focus on the team that did the upending? If folks watching this series weren't so busy rubbing their eyes, they might have seen more of the obvious: The Pistons outplayed the Lakers in every facet of the game. Outrebounded them, outdefensed them, outhustled them, and, yes, outshot them. Hello? If the Pistons' offense is so awful, well, it scored more points in four out of five games -- so what does that make the Lakers' offense?   You know what? Who cares? "Lakers" is now just another word the Pistons have scratched out, alongside Milwaukee, New Jersey and Indiana.   Hooptown, now. There were gas stations in the Detroit suburbs selling Pistons paraphernalia out of small tents, and cars on the highways flying Pistons flags from their windows. The Motor City has big new wheels, orange with laces, and kids everywhere will be growing out their Ben Afros and nicknaming themselves "Rip."   Nothing given. Everything earned. They hit pay dirt in a way that every laborer and sports fan alike can admire. Take a picture of that final moment -- Ben spray-painting where X marks the spot -- and frame it for next year, above a modified slogan:   Goin' to Work . . .   As the Boss.

      We are watching 'an extremely goofy movie' for 8th grade science today.  I have 6 periods, so, yeah, I get to see it 6 times.  I'm feeling so goofy right now.  I'm doing medical testing when I get back from guatemala.  I'm getting paid lots of money to have people poke at me and give me drugs.  First up,  a 10 day stay in the hospital and a couple of spinal taps.  word.  I'm going to be a counselor for houseboat camp for Grace middle school group.  Me and another gal on staff will be in charge of a boat with 15 kids.  We'll have 9 boats all together.  130 kids I think.

      WELCOME TO HIPPIELAND! hola amigos!  i am now in san pedro, a small town on lago atitlan.  freaking a!  this place is so beautiful.  ive found the big chill, that vibe i got in europe and in baja.  this town is on a beautiful lake surrounded by green hills and 3 volcanos.  san pedro is filled with hippies too.  it like a time machine back to the sixties or maybe just a bizarre disneyland-esque hippieland/mayan villageland.  i love it. as you know traveling is about the people you meet, i hooked up with a crew of 3 americans.  yeah, crazy.  that wasn´t a typo.  americans.  the lot of us hardly travel.  i always met brits, irish, aussies, germans, but never too many americans.  i decided i would hang out with them despite their handicap.  oh yeah, im american too.  damn it.  anyways, it´s good times here in guate.   ive discovered thier wonderful selection of beers.  gallo, which has a big picture of a rooster on the front.  some people might be akin to calling this beverage "cock beer" but of course that kind of crass language is far beneath me.  the other beers are victoria and brahava.  both are good, especially when consuming them repeatedly in the one liter quanity. san pedro is jesustown usa.  errr...strike that.  jesustown guatemala.  on ever building is painted some little catch phrase.  dios te ama.  jesus es el senor. etc.  its like TBN stormed the town with a battallon of spirit-filled graffitti artists. despite all the hippieness, mayan saleswomen, born-again vandalism...no wait, because i all that i love it here.  it´s like no other place ive ever been.  its like ive slipped through somekind of dimentional loop, wormhole or someother equally spooky sounding sci-fi thing i would see on an episode of the x-files.  all this to say, i could stay here for a while.  amigos, forward my cell phone payments, biola loans, insurance bills to:  dmh, big chill place on the lake near where all the mayan womwn wash their clothes, san pedro GUATEMALA.

      ANTIGUA TIME i was planning to climb up volcano pacaya today, but that might have to wait for later in the week.  out of the dozens of places taking groups up the volcano, mine cancelled the trip this afternoon while i was waiting and missed the chance to hook up with another place.  suck.  oh well.  i´m going to catch the rest of england vs. portugal world cup qualifing match with a couple of irish guys i met last night.  it´s halftime now. last night i walked around antigua with this german chick, Dalia, i met at the hostel.  she was one of those people that you tend to meet while traveling that is cool to hang out with for about a day then after that could be annoying.  it´s great.  i know i´ll only be around certain people for a few hours so i can be best friends with about anybody for that amount of time. i slept in today until 10.  i felt a bit guilty, since im in guatemala and all and need to explore everything, but i was tired. antigua is a dope place, cobblestone streets, ruins, old stuff.  i like it.  but i think i need to head out to lago atitlan tomorrow for some chill, do nothingness.

      I'VE ARRIVED yes.  i am here.  in antigua guatemala.  i spend the night in atlanta because the flight was oversold.  i got to eat dinner with a bunch of high schoolers traveling to spain.  their flight was oversold too.  one kid showed me a list of his 200 favorite cartoons.  i told him that homestar runner needed to be on there.  he had no idea about the site.  kids.  the airline gave me a 400 dollar flight voucher so i have my next trip in the works (ireland, thailand?)  I had a wonderful introduction to the country.  In line waiting for customs i met a guatemalan couple, luis and ruth.  They were the most hospitable people ive ever met.  they offered to show me the bus from guatemala city to antigua.  then told me that they would drive me there.  its an hour away.  they wouldnt let me refuse.  so we loaded up with the couple their nephew and luis brother.  it was hilarious.  at the airport, they were met by what seemed like dozens of their relatives. they just kept showing up, crawling out of the woodwork.  it was like they knew everybody in the city.  they waved to people on the road as we were driving to antigua.  they introduced me as their adopted son, darren.  classic.  ive only been in guatemala about 3 hours, but i love it.  i met a couple of irish guys, andy and martin who were blasting u2 achtung baby back at the hostel.   antigua is pretty dope.  it used to be the colonial capital of central america (side note: justin timberlake is bumping it here at the internet cafe) all the buildings here are really old.  there are a lot of travelers here as well.  they have a few language schools here.  i almost feel like an old man with all these youngsters running around.  well, im going to head to the donna luisa (our friend william jefferson clinton who is in the news so much nowadays visited there on a trip to guatamala as president) for some local grub if i can find it.  nothing is marked here (street signs, names, addresses..)  peace.  check my blog, i´ll try and give more updates as the trip progresses.

      happy july and i'm in placencia, belize.  booyah.  i love it here.  carribean lifestyle, my friends.  the belikin beer is very good, mon. shoot, i've been doing so much traveling that i just need some time to chill on the beach and this is the place.  the vibe here is relax central. since last report, i'v traversed the longest bridge in central america twice.  in a heavy down pour.  some of my stuff is still a bit wet and smells like a combo of damp dog and sour ass, but beside that i'm in good condition.  my passport suffered a major casualty though and is feeling and looking a bit like a wet noodle. i met up with frank in rio dulce and we stayed in the weird disneyland-esque jungle cruise place that hovered on stilts over a swampy marsh. i don't know how or why i keep hooking up with american travelers, but the two frank and i are traveling with hit even closer to home, california.  damn.  i just left that place.  no, it's good times, good travel buddies.

      ok.  i fear i may have gotten an ameoba.  for those of you that are hip to ameoba records down in LA, this is an entirely different thing altogether.  i met a lacrosse player here and all she talked about were these ameobas.  "ameoba this and ameoba that"  it has kinda freaked me out.  anyways, i don't know how you get them, but they're supposed to make you lazy and stuff, so i think i've had them for quite a while. i went to this bar yesterday.  amazing, the owner was this wonderful piece of work from texas.  he might be the most interesting person i have ever met.  extremely racist and opinionated to the point of: "i want to (sentence deleted)"  i just realized that if i left that last sentence intact i would be put on a government watch list and this guy would be hunted down by the feds, so nevermind, i´ll tell you the story in person.  ask me about it. i've got a script brewing in my mind.  i can feel it.  i'm pretty excited.  it think it might be fun.  in kinda of a 'punch drunk love' sort of way.  oh blessed be this script.  please be good.

      IDEALS, TRAVELLER HIGH, AND PEEWEE'S BIG ADVENTURE tomorrow frank and i are meeting in coban to explore the mystic falls and enchanting waters of samuc champey (at least that's how my guide book describes it and i believe EVERYTHING it says). adios san pedro, i barely knew you.  i need to take a trip without any time constrants sometime.  i'm envious of those that say, "yeah, i think i might kinda have to be up in mexico city sometime maybe in august or something.  i don't know.  we'll see.  i might make it by then." i have the traveller's high though.  everything seems really cool and interesting and exciting.  it is, don't get me wrong.  but are things just like that because i'm experience this outside of america?  billy and i talked about this.  stuff like, "that girl is so beautiful!", " that view is so amazing."  But...if i saw the same thing, or the same instance happened to me at home is it really that beautiful or amazing?  honestly, i'll live in ignorant bliss if i must.  i love the ideal.  you say, "this is the greatest thing ever!" but then experiencing it out of your context sours the whole deal.  for instance, i always thought that 'peewee's big adventure' was the greatest film ever made.  that was when i was 10.  i hadn't seen the film for about 10 years, but still claimed it was the best ever.  now i love peewee, but the jokes weren't as funny, peewee wasn't as cool, large marge not as scary, the lost of pee wee's bike wasn't as worrisome.  anyway, the moral of this story is, as long as i don't watch that peewee movie while on my trip, guatemala will be the coolest place ever.

      CASTAWAY TIMES TWO i am a tomato.  i got the crap sunburnt out of me yesterday.  i'm still in san pedro, day three.  i could stay here indefinitly.  its one of those places that attatches a sensor to your brain and blocks everything but what's around you. we took kayaks out yesterday.  Karen and Gabe (seattle/nyc) were in one and jessica (maryland) and i in the other.  the lake was windy as hell and it wasn´t long before we started taking on water.  but we kept right on paddling out in the middle of the lake.  we were similar to those cartoons where the character keeps paddling until he's underwater.  yeah, in the middle of lago atitlan, jessica and i were forced to jump ship.  hollywood makes the concept of being shipwrecked a novel, even romantic occurance.  i.e. titanic, swiss family robinson, gillian's island, that frickin tom hanks one, yadda yadda yadda (feel free to suggest your favorite shipwreck movie int he comments).  but i´ll tell you what my friends, being shipwrecked ain't no box of twinkies.  two words: life and death.  we hung in the balance, staring down the bloody point of the grim reaper's sickle.  well, not really, but it kind of sucked a little.  the kayak flipped over and we clung to the upturned bottom. waves bombarded us and all the while i successfully held both our cameras above water.  it took about 45 minutes for the wave to drift us into shore.  overall it was a good conversation starter.  as jessica and i faced immenent death head on we shared with each other what our favorite books, cds, and movies were.  a nice little icebreaker all in all. meanwhile gabe and karen were on shore watching the whole debacle.  we got to shore safe and in one piece which i was pretty happy about. we switched kayak partners on the way back, gabe and jessica had the kayak i was in earlier and low and behold the water taking on happen to them again.  karen and i didn't know though because we had jetted off across the lake.  a half an hour later we were like "Now where did they go?" i got back and went to a pub to watch the end of the holland/sweden euro cup match.  near the end of the game jessica storms in.  "do you have the key?´ i lost my $%&@# sunglasses! it's fine with me it i never see a $%&@# kayak the rest of my life!"  i was sincerly empathetic with her plight, but the look on her face and overall demenor at that moment was empathatically hilarious. it's been really great hanging out with karen, gabe, and jessica.  cool, chill people.  as opposed to the potentially annoyed german gal in antigua, these three are true traveling buddies.  like rockstar chris from the bronx, who billy and i met in italy.  it a bit like a camp atmosphere at times because odds are you´ll never see these people again but the connection everyone has though the love of traveling is huge.  world budget travellers have a lot in common, similar personalities too.  it's pretyy cool the people you meet halfway around the world.  i go to guatemala and meet frenchies, israelis, dutch...etc.  cheers.

      I am in finca ixobel.  It’s this little ranch in a rain forest in the northern peten region of Guatemala. Anyway, as per my comments and the responses on ‘mere Christianity,’  I’ll be posting quotes once I return stateside, but one thing that interested me was his comments on thrills in live.  That hit me big time.  Searching for thrills in travels, in relationships.  He mentioned letting the thrill die and settling in to a quiet satisfaction I think he called it.  The whole thing was really thought provoking anyhow.  I’ve recently been really motivated to do something.  It’s a big step, my friends.  Because for the most part, save for the occasional spontaneous outbursts of energy and creativity, I am a pretty lazy so-and-so.  What is this ‘something’ that I want do to, you ask.  I have not a clue.  Be it a job.  Possible.  Overseas work.  Possible.  Frankly I don’t know, but there is something welling up inside me that is saying, ‘dmh, you need to get off your hindend and DO something.’  I have this voice around from a while, but now he/she is really beginning to turn up the volume.  Have I ever mentioned my desire to be a monk/  well that phase has come and gone and I was never really into it as much as drew was anyway.  But now I’m on a new kick, the pilgrim.  I think I should be a pilgrim for a while, not he hats and turkey and Indians and all that, my friends, but kind of a journeying, wayfaring, spiritual pilgrim.  You know visit the holyland and other far off holy sites in Siberia or somewhere equally remote.  Hmm.  I think I maybe over this phase as well, but it was worth a try. Side note.  In the 2000 US presidential election 105 million votes were cast.  In this year’s American Idol finalist vote there were 65 million votes cast.  Yeah, I’m gonna be sick. Side note number 2.  Fattest region of the county.  The deep south, especially Mississippi.  Leanest.  West and New England. There’s no special significance to any of this, I just read a time magazine yesterday though

      STINKY FISH i went snorkeling today.  i swam with big fishies, sting rays, manatees and sharks.  it was really tiring.  i really had to poop at the end of the trip and thought that i might have to make a pre-emptive strike while still in the water.  luckily i made it to the guesthouse bathroom and stank it up.  have a nice day.

      to all my friends and lovers...there is no one who compares with you. i tried posting dope pictures on here, but technology eludes me again.  i'll be amazed if anything actually appears on the page.  give me a shout out if you see anything.   well, i'm here and gone.  on sunday morning i'll be out a week.  up north near sacramento at camp with middle schoolers.  houseboats on the delta.  i'll give a full report when i return.   but what about guatemala, huh?  i'll give a brief run down.  top (almost) ten moments (in no paricular order) -anytime i napped in a hammock. -shipwrecked and adrift at sea in lago atitlan with jess. -stealing a golf cart, crashing it into a tree, and running away on caye caulker, protected by capt rob and his bottle. -arriving back at LAX and discovering that jesse left the lights on in the car, killing the battery. -twice crossing the longest bridge in cent america in a monsoon, soaking my passport causing it to mold, then meeting frank 10 minutes later. -leaving san pedro on a chicken bus at 5am, life threatening hairpin curves, the radio blaring 'unchained melody' by the rightous brothers, and and elderly man napping on my shoulder. -neverending (card) game of war with evelyn in the guatamalan airport, westin hotel, country inn hotel, atlanta airport, airplane... -losing my $400 flight voucher. -freestylin with frank -jake and the 250 quetzal luxury bus incident. (jake almost jumped off a moving bus that was playing titanic) -chilling in the pimp 'i and i bar' meters above caye caulker. -the evening of joe from volcano bar -clouds creeping over the hills in lago atitlan shout outs to bagley and kevin from vancouver, chris from indiana, brian and kim from manitoba, luuk from holland, beevers from england, capt rob from toronto, elena and julie from nor cal, evelyn from belgium, eddie from phoenix and elsewhere, martin and andy ireland, gabe and karen from nyc, woomie from maryland, jake from chicago, jeff and dina from pennsylvania, those dutch girls i met in tikal that i can't remember their names, selma from livingston, jon from vancouver, sabina (who frank was in love with) and her sister from austria, and everyone else whose name i can't remember or pronounce.         chicken bus.  i rode these alot.  good times      san pedro.  stayed here a week.  i didn't really do much besides sleep and get shipwrecked.      these are sharks and sting rays i saw while snorkeling.

      all day i've been checking flights to cuba, dreaming of another adventure.  wake up after noon and at 6 i realized the day had begun.  walked up to develop pictures but the one-hour was closed.  talked to trevor and read magazines.  as i passed winchell's donuts i talked to tisa about the bar-b-q, but said i was sorry because i thought we were out of hamburger patties.  trev said i should come up with some short film ideas, but lately i've been feeling pretty dry.  all my long ideas fall flat around page 8, and all my short ideas have yet to hit ther screen.  lot of others are gearing to become pseudo-famous (maybe), but i have a bit of trouble getting off the porch.

      this summer has been a hoppy one for me.  guate, houseboats, and i'm going to head up to seattle sometime soon as well.  good.  i like it hoppy.  last night after heading back to Grace from camp, i stopped by the guys' (dan, billy, keith) place in long beach.  word on the street is that they've booted lance from the casa.  brent was chilling there and they were all playing texas hold em.  i ponied up my 5 bills and joined in.  long story short, i was the last to enter and and first to be cleaned out.  it was a load of fun though.  i dig the game.  i lost many a quetzal down in guatemala playing it.  it'd be great to make it a reoccuring event.  5 bucks?  that's cheaper than a movie and you get to feel like a bigshot for a while too.  i recounted bits and pieces of my guate trip to dan and billy and passed on the trevel bug to them.  they started planning a trip, i suggested cuba and they're on it.  i might have to stop by there myself as well.

      HAHA.  I wrote on a script today, sucka.  15 pages.  Be it crap or not, knock on wood, I'm back.  It felt good not to be a lazy a-word.  more writing to come.  Jesse and I are dedicating August to scripts (because we have no jobs) so the hope is 2 more will be cranked out in the next 30 days. other note, i might head up to seattle for a few months.  Trevor and I want to make movies, so let's do it.  I need to apply at Tully's and Seattle's best.  and worst. my buddy holly glasses broke.  Don't weep for them, they will live again. Poll: What picture of my trip would you like to see next? a) me in front of a lake, b)  me in front of clouds and a lake, c) me and people I chilled with, d) a lesbian lacrosse player drowning, e) a special request of your own choosing.  food. i eat it as we all do.  maybe a bit too much at times.  today? buffet. yuk Grand China Star buffet.  sick.  gooey chicken, rangoon things, mayonaise imitation crab meat, general moo moo's liver delight, squid weenie, ox butthole.  yeah, I really ate that.  No lie. anyway.  The whole buffet system is excessive in my mind. Case in point: a buddy of mine went to grand old county buffet.  He looked over and saw a fat mom, fat dad, and fat little kid gorging themselves on plates and plates of fried chicken, pizza, assorted meats and cheeses and whatnot. the Fat Kid says to his mom. "How do I know when to stop eating?" yuck. So them mom says, "When It hurts." thank you. Enjoy your happy meal and don't let mayor McCheese hit you on the a-word on the way out.

        Frank and I at Tikal.  I love this picture.  Sorry, i haven't given too much of an update of my houseboat trip.  it was awesome.  I'll post some pictures once they're developed.  Me, shannon, and twelve 7th graders.  It was odd being in the situation of telling kids to quiet down at night when I want to cause trouble too.  "Stop talking about Preparation H." "No more comments about Michael Jackson, Richard Simmons, or Janet Jackson's body parts."   During the week I had a freestyle rap battle (ala Eminem in '8 mile') with Paul, an 8th grader, and lost.  I think of myself as a solid freestyle, but he cut me up.  pulled out stuff like: "you eat Ramen rice noodles" "your shirt from China" "your curly hair." I said I'd "feed him Gerber through a tube in his nose."  but the death blow was when he called me out for spitting the same trick twice in a row.  It was on 'poop' and 'underware' at that.  It was totally 'moted.  Then he killed me off my saying "you use a training razor/and you don't drive a truck, you drive a barbie blazer."  I was dead.  and we had to stop because there were so many people crowding on the houseboat to watch the duel that it was starting to sink.  dope times.

      SALUTE TO THE MIDDLE FINGER   me and my homies (circa drew's bachelor party)    jesse is not happy with me (circa junior year may '01).  neat, huh?  I found out how to post pictures.  guess what else I'm done with.  convenience and instant gratification.  yeah, 1-hour photo.  i don't think so.  I paid 2 bucks extra a roll for next day photo.  i'm done with all of it fast food.  microwaves.  email.  internet.  caffine.  whatever.  done.

      The radio anounces that hillary rodham is about to speak.  I've bowed before the blue glow god most of the afternoon.  with the rest of the day i've filled myself with corporate liquid sweetness (i.e. starbucks venti mocha frappachino).  What am I done with? art.  most all of it.  unless it... A) entertains me and/or provokes tangible reflection or mental stimulation or B) is a commercial/financial success  in: billboards, magazine ads, blimps, coke, mcdonalds, budweizer, thomas kinkade out:  jackson pollock, 'art' that isn't nice normal and clear like a photograph.  I am also done with wine. It is all wine to me.  don't talk about blah blah 1995, merlot, blah, blah, rich, dry, blah, blah it's wine, you can describe it, say whatever you want to, but all i hear is, "wine?  wine wine wine wine.  wine wine wine." And wine is red.  If you pour me something that isn't red that you call wine, I'll pour it either on the ground or your face and call you a fool.  also, what hasn't coke bought the moon and made a huge billboard out of it?  i would.  a huge "coke" light in the sky.  that's money baby.  throw down a cool bill and make a spaceship and make the moon say "coke'  it's that simple.  matt miller wants me to go to estonia and russia with him, billy and dan want me to go to mexico and cuba with them.  trevor wants me to go to vietnam and thailand with him.  I think I'll do it all and just be poor.

      drink caffeine free diet coke.  I am in renton, washington.  east side.  (what, what).  I am in trevor's big a-word house.  I ate a big bowl of chili about hour ago so i'm excited to see how that mother's gonna work itself out.  i'll give a full report.  it's the 6th today, which means that yesterday at 5:29 p.m. eastern standard time I turned 24 years old.  It's the same as before, just now it's officially another year of slacking my life away.  I bought some gillete razors today.  a 4 pack.  big decision whether or not to purchase the 2-blade or 3-blade model.  i went for the 2er.  i'm frugal you know (at least that's what all the hot ladies say). in case you're wondering, whivh i know you are...yes I am wearing a viking helmet with horns on it.  i rather enjoy wearing it, so back the heck up, holmes.  get off my game. trev and i are to meet up in a joyous reunion with brent tonight.   what do you call those hand-gripper, strengthening metal exercise things?  I'm playing with one now.  it kicks a-word. i rode a stationary bike today.  it was amazing.  it was like a bike, but was in a house and didn't go anywhere!  it just stayed in the same place.  i've never seen anything like it.  and hope to never again.  it frightened me.  someone must have conjure a spirit and cast it into that thing. Question:back alley, bare knuckle brawl.  who wins, Glue Stick or White Out?  My money's on White OUT!  p.s. i know this is dude of me, but i'm mirroring this on the virtual porch.  i'm too lazy to thing of other not-quite-witty things to write about. so L and Z word you

      Plans change and I'll in seattle in 24 hours.  I'm really freestyling right now as frank would say.  Trevor and I are going to chill and make movies.  pray that money-making opportunities arise for me (i.e. job)  here or there.  I just want to be able to pay the piper (i.e. creditors).  I've been foolish in my monetary ways and the sharks are circling.

      to WiFi, or not to pirate WiFi? i can remember times when i was little that we had cable tv for free. my dad would sneak over to my neighbors house while they were gone, throw a splitter on their cable line, and manage to hide the fact from them for years.  so now, faced with a similar chance, without all the sneaking around... should i continue to sneak onto the WiFI network i find in my new building, or should i just let the charter communications guy actually install the internet for me when he gets here tomorrow? free internet... or $50 a month for internet and cable tv, what's a guy to choose?  in other thoughts, i think the porch here is great. maybe would could throw up a couple of pics of some humming birds, gloyds ramshakle plants, a couple of cigarettes, and a crazy durnken neighbor or two just to make the place feel like home.  anyway, its good to have a computer again. let the blogging commence.  ps. there was a fire in my aparment today on comstock while i was out. three fire trucks... more to that story later. now i gotta sleep.

       the following email is from andrew hamilton...   Gentlemen:  Please excuse any misspellings, exaggerations, or otherwise eccentric behavior.   I am drinking  the whiskey.  First, the Bayou is a Bayou no longer. The mighty magnolia has fallen; no shade falls on the sacred roof; the tender semen smell laces the cool morning air no more; the leaves do not litter the path; possums do not swing, nor waddle, nor twitch; and the landlord's grandmother turns in her grave. Perhaps she waits for the troubadour, Jesse Gloyd, and his promises of evening love for the dead, as strummed on a bandaged guitar.  Or,   Perhaps not.  One thing we know for sure. The Bayou, as we have known it, is gone. Much too much pale light changes the atmosphere; no better, no worse, only changed.  In other news, Iraq has been returned its sovereignty, Michael Moore continues to prove his stupidity on a national scale, and a new Bevmo has officially opened in Pasadena. And yet there remain those who doubt the existence of a God.  Disagreements:  Jesse: In continuation of our real time porch conversation of last night, and picking up the pieces of this virtual one, David Fricke, despite his (what you call) boyish, and (what I call) frighteningly preserved and (ultimately) bizarre looks, is definitely not our generation's Greil Marcus. Greil Marcus is first and foremost a social scientist. He is a semiologist who bridges pop culture and philosophy. He is a connection-maker by trade, signifying the hitherto mundane or merely factual. David Fricke is a music critic, albeit a usually very good one; with the exception of his wasting 5 stars on Adrock and the After School Crew. Greil Marcus on the other hand, is a critical theorist, much like Lester Bangs, Roland Barthes, and David Hickey.   There is, my dear boy, a difference.  Of course, too be fair, the only writings I have read of David Fricke are those in his tiny column in RS. He (usually) has good taste in music. He (according to the blurb in italics, apparently) has been to more shows than I have. I am sure that the 500 words he gets per month are not a qualitative sampling of his thoughts on pop culture as we know it, and, were he to have a few books, or even a longer section, I might change my mind. But, until he convinces me otherwise, I will not hold him as my generation's Greil Marcus. Instead, I pass that mantel on to either Nick Hornby, or Jon Singleton. Whom, come to think of it, are probably closer to Greil Marcus's generation. So, oh well.  On to other thoughts...  Old Music or New Music?  Is there anything worth listening to these days?   Do they make it like they used too?   Can there be such a thing as new music, given the range and subconscious influence of music history?   Considering the existence of the blues, has there ever been any such thing as New Music?   If there is such a thing as New Music, that is, music that has no place, only new, nothing to tether it to the long corridors of tradition and influence, music that uses nothing that anyone has ever used before, if there is this New Music, what does it sound like?        Ok.  Enough.  I am getting a little big for my britches, a little dogmatic.  After all, there is so much goodness to be enjoyed, why question it?   As long as it makes you want to   a) scream b) cry c) smile d) quiver or e) motherfuckingdance!  it's ok with me.  In other  news...  Andy: I continue to pray for you.  Matt: You too.  A & M: Don't get discouraged. No matter how many teenage love handles you see, never forget that while you are being paid (albeit ten dollars a day, or whatever), to travel around the country and play the rock and roll, some other people don't get to do that. Not that some people mind that much. No, but seriously, I can understand why you guys might get discouraged, and I'll be praying for you. That must be draining.  Matt: Is there a concrete plan for your B.P.? If no, do you want there to be? J-Glo and me gots plenty of time on our hands, if you want a plan to be in the works. Also, I heard about the rehearsal dinner situation with your mom. I am sorry, and I am praying for you too.   Jesse: I have nothing to say to you. Oh wait, yes I do. Thanks for the CDs. Bill Evans kicks so much ass. I am burning you some selections from my collections that you might appreciate.  And, I am officially tapped out. I take my last drag of cigarette,                                             , pat Matt on the fur coated shoulder, (pat-pat), pee in the dark because I believe the light bulb is burned out in the bathroom again,           , and, collapse into a bed writhing with Sylvia fleas. Good night boys...  -Andrew  P.S. Jesse, I read today that white sage is an ancient aphrodisiac. Supposedly, if you bottle the smoke and then sniff it through a straw, it will make you very, very "potent," if you know what I mean. You should try it.  P.P.S. A&M: Mustaches? Are you mustachioed? Oh god I hope so...  kisses,  a.

I enjoy the folks in these here parts, but Hawaii is Hawaii.  In almost cool news, as many of you know, I missed eating next to Sir Willie Nelson in the little Mauian town of Paia by twenty frigging minutes.  My mom blessed her self with the condensation left by his water glass.  Oye vey.  I'm about to make my July music mix.  I'll post a setlist when I'm finished.  Jesse

There really is, but don't tell anyone, ok, holmes? OK?!  Times Square would like to wear underwear but it's an imposible feat. a square wouldn't dare because it's not fair to the people walking on its streets. because they like to see its wee wee. aka pee pee.   ah, what a special nyc treat!

           it's been said, and heard by many of us, those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.... or something to that extent. well friends i think that we are (aside from religious beliefs) looking at another sign of the end of the american civilization.  i was listening to  urlLink studio 360 , a program on  urlLink npr , this last weekend and i heard something that got me thinking about this. let me start out by saying that this didn't really shock me perse, but it made realize that are group of friends is once again an acception to the rule.  the full text of this commentary can be found at  urlLink this link . but here are some highlights from kurt anderson's piece:   We all saw the recent news stories about the big decline in the percentage of Americans who read fiction or poetry or drama. Back in 1982, a large majority of people said they read a work of literature that year. And now, just two decades later, it's less than half that.  Reading fiction â€“ any kind of fiction, from Jackie Collins to Stephen King to Philip Roth â€“ has officially become a minority taste in America .  What's more, this decline appears to be accelerating â€“ nearly the entire drop occurred in just the last decade.  The new study was undertaken by the National Endowment for the Arts. And Dana Gioia, the clear-eyed poet and former businessman who runs the NEA, says what we are witnessing is â€œa general collapse in advanced literacy.â€ He calls it a â€œnational crisis.â€   check out the link and read the whole thing. it's scary. in fact here's the scariest thing in there...  The historian and author Kevin Starr was quoted in the New York Times as saying that this glass looked half full to him â€“ nearly 100 million American adults still reading poetry and fiction and drama.  â€œ In an age where we're returning to medieval-like oral culture based on television ,â€ Professor Starr said, â€œI think that's pretty impressive.â€

      Hi again...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sitting in Poppo and Grandma's condo.&nbsp; We just finished eating and watching some ESPN.&nbsp; Bed is on the horizon, as we are going snorkeling very early tomorrow.&nbsp; I went surfing this afternoon and jogging with Robyn.&nbsp; I got her some running shoes for her birthday.&nbsp; We went to a luau last night.&nbsp; A man ate fire.&nbsp; We ate pig.&nbsp; It was fun.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also recovering from stepping on a sea urchin while falling off my board.&nbsp; It looked a lot nastier than it felt.&nbsp; Like a porcupine.&nbsp; Pictures to follow.&nbsp; I tried to pee on it, but it's kind of hard to hold your foot over the toilet and pee on it (try, you'll see what I mean).&nbsp; I soaked it in vinegar instead.&nbsp; My mom then picked out the pieces with an unsanitary needle.&nbsp; I acted like a baby and bitched and yelled at her.&nbsp; Everyone made fun of me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dodgers have won 17 of 19.&nbsp; Rumor has it, Randy Johnson has said he would wave his no trade to play for the Blue Crew.&nbsp;  Surprised By Joy  is pretty fantastic.&nbsp; C.S. Lewis is still a nerd.&nbsp; Local Hawaiian food is very good.&nbsp; Ask Sycz, he'll vouch.&nbsp; See everyone Thursday.   -Jesse

      I just bought  A Century Ends . Amazing ablum. I think you especially would love it, O'Brien. Hey, I'll burn it for you as a contribution to the "O'Brien got his music stolen" collection. Anyway, the woman and I just broke up (mutual), and here is a song that I think is amazing. Don't worry, I'm not too heavy hearted over it.  Gathering Dust  I got no reason but that I must maybe I feel like I've been gathering dust I must leave this harbour for the sea I'm too young to settle down and make a home But I don't know where I'm wanting to be I just know I have to be there alone  Stole my time, all my time stole my time, for you  Pale winter sun is beatin' the ground why 'm I throwin' away  the best thing that I've found My young heart's in tatters and I'm sure that it will be a long time healing it's so hard to see what I'm doing this for when loneliness is all that I'm feeling  Stole my time, all my time, spend my time, for you  chorus: Now the wind it is blowing blowing leaves from the trees I've got no use knowing that with time it'll ease I don't know where I'm going hope I get there soon cos my soul is hollow as the sorrowful moon na na na na...  The night is raining on my weary head Taking me back  See the sun spread its wings of gold as the dawn unfurls Hear the song that the moon sings to the darkened world Feel the fire lighting in the bitter cold It's like the light that shines through the windows of your soul

      in honor of those of us who are near the sea, or those of us (me) who dreamed about it last night, here's a fun one that jangly old gloyd will want played 24/7 in 70 years when he is in a nursing home   PIRATE LOOKS AT FORTY  -  urlLink jimmy buffet   Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call, Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall. You've seen it all, you've seen it all.   Watch the men who rode you, Switch from sails to steam. And in your belly you hold the treasure that few have ever seen, most of them dreams, Most of them dreams.   Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late. The cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder I'm an over forty victim of fate Arriving too late, arriving too late.   I've done a bit of smugglin' I've run my share of grass. I made enough money to buy Miami, But I pissed it away so fast, Never meant to last, never meant to last.   I have been drunk now for over two weeks, I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks, But I've got to stop wishin', Got to go fishin', I'm down to rock bottom again. Just a few friends, just a few friends.   Instrumental   I go for younger women, lived with several awhile And though I ran away, they'll come back one day. And still could manage a smile It just takes awhile, just takes awhile.   Mother, mother ocean, after all these years I've found My occupational hazard being my occupations just not around. I feel like I've drowned, Gonna head uptown.Â

      Hey, I'm finally connected to the virtual porch. However, I am wondering if the conversations will be as lively without the assistance of cigarettes and beer. This will probably be better for everyone. Smoking and drinking are bad habits, and I don't mean habits in the Catholic way. I mean consistent behaviors. Goodnight.  Matt

      it works. i'm here.  thoughts on ray?  last album out in august says rolling stone.  duet style ala j. cash.  i'm in. if hawaii was a hot dog would you eat it?  i would.  they're delisous. whittier is hotter than satan's crack right now.  its because the tree is gone.  i told jesse that i'm no longer referring to this dwelling by it's previous name.  to me it is the place-formerly-known-as-the-bayou.  i sat in the hammock (which i have relocated to the only shade spot in the 90601 vicinty) and thought that with this cursed heat the falling of the tree was the christening of a new era (well, that along with many other personal [public and private] struggles that those of our order have dealt with)  any suggestions for a new name.  i thought {@} had a nice ring to it.

      I got an e-mail today about a  urlLink petition  to sign to extend the assault weapons ban after this year. It is being spread by a father of one of the kids killed in the Columbine shootings. The cool thing is that you can track the petition, so I can track who has signed the petition because of me. Make sense? Well, if you agree with me and would like to see the assault weapons ban extended, go here and sign this petition.

      so i've been unpacking books a lot lately, what with moving and all so i thought i would share a couple of poems with you guys that i really enjoy  The Jewel  There is this cave In the air behind my body That nobody is going to touch: A cloister, a silence Closing around a blossom of fire. When I stand upright in the wind, My bones turn to dark emeralds.  -  urlLink James Wright   and this next poem, by billy collins you can listen to if you want to  urlLink here (if you have Realplayer), or just read it below  The Best Cigarette  There are many that I miss having sent my last one out a car window sparking along the road one night, years ago.  The heralded one, of course: after sex, the two glowing tips now the lights of a single ship; at the end of a long dinner with more wine to come and a smoke ring coasting into the chandelier; or on a white beach, holding one with fingers still wet from a swim.  How bittersweet these punctuations of flame and gesture; but the best were on those mornings when I would have a little something going in the typewriter, the sun bright in the windows, maybe some Berlioz on in the background. I would go into the kitchen for coffee and on the way back to the page, curled in its roller, I would light one up and feel its dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.  Then I would be my own locomotive, trailing behind me as I returned to work little puffs of smoke, indicators of progress, signs of industry and thought, the signal that told the nineteenth century it was moving forward. That was the best cigarette, when I would steam into the study full of vaporous hope and stand there, the big headlamp of my face pointed down at all the words in parallel lines.  --  urlLink Billy Collins

           though i am sure gloyd will be the most interested, this whole thing is fairly cool. considered among rock circles the best unreleased album ever created, "smile" has recently been finished nearly 40 years after the original recording session in '66   urlLink this article  that i found on msnbc has a fairly glossed over, sort of awed tone to it. there's a fairly interesting  urlLink press release  on the official  urlLink brian wilson  site as well. but it looks like we'll finally get to hear it by the time i am married, because nonesuch is going to release it at the end of september. who knows, maybe with all the music connections floating around here, we might get to hear it earlier than that. i could drink to that...

      I realize I might be late on this. For the first time, perhaps, I realize the genius of Tom Waits.  We share a dinner with Peter and Alison. As the evening winds down, the Itunes brings us to Closing Time. Three tracks in, they leave; Amanda reads in bed; I stay up with a bottle of whiskey and actually listen to the lyrics for the first time.   His musicians run circles around him. It doesn't take a genius to notice the complex patterns the drummer brushes around his clunky chords; the tasteful blues notes of the guitar slinking their way beneath the clinky plinked piano. He is not a vituoso. In fact, he can barely play.  I remember reading somewhere, or perhaps hearing firsthand, I can't remember, that Tom Waits used to know someone in Whittier, an old college buddy. He'd visit late at night, before he'd recorded anything professionally, and he'd tap out tunes on the friend's piano, early into the morning. He was horrible, and he kept the neighbors up. There were complaints, threats to call the police if the behavior conitnued.  I had never really listened to a Tom Waits song before tonight. I had never noticed the hearbreaking sincerity wound between the deceptively simple melodies and themes. Heartbreak can only carry a song so far, and it becomes easy to write a melody off for being recognizable. The lyrics are not groundbreaking. They do not express anything that Cole Porter never thought of. They are absurd, but they carry something more than true in their artifice. Tom Waites has made a career out of creating a character, a disheveled ballader, a ner'do well whiskey hound, a hobo with a penchant for Joyce and Brecht. His songs do not mean anything, and yet, they mean exactly everything.  I don't know how to adequately communicate exaclty what it was that I discovered tonight. Perhaps it's that his songs seem to be lacking something; they seem tired and cliche, but retain something so startling and urgent that they demand your fullest attention and loyalty. You want to believe him, though you know he is chasing something impossible. He represents something lost, a Tin Pan Alley nightmare skating on thin ice. But I am right there, waiting to hear what he will say next. And no matter how inevitable it may seem, the next line always seems perfect, fitting, the only phrase that could have ever worked.   It's strange how small perfections can slip your notice, when you are too busy looking for something profound.

      ...caffeine free diet coke.  I am in renton, washington.  east side.  (what, what).  I am in trevor's big a-word house.  I ate a big bowl of chili about hour ago so i'm excited to see how that mother's gonna work itself out.  i'll give a full report.  it's the 6th today, which means that yesterday at 5:29 p.m. eastern standard time I turned 24 years old.  It's the same as before, just now it's officially another year of slacking my life away.  I bought some gillete razors today.  a 4 pack.  big decision whether or not to purchase the 2-blade or 3-blade model.  i went for the 2er.  i'm frugal you know (at least that's what all the hot ladies say). in case you're wondering, whivh i know you are...yes I am wearing a viking helmet with horns on it.  i rather enjoy wearing it, so back the heck up, holmes.  get off my game. trev and i are to meet up in a joyous reunion with brent tonight.   what do you call those hand-gripper, strengthening metal exercise things?  I'm playing with one now.  it kicks a-word. i rode a stationary bike today.  it was amazing.  it was like a bike, but was in a house and didn't go anywhere!  it just stayed in the same place.  i've never seen anything like it.  and hope to never again.  it frightened me.  someone must have conjure a spirit and cast it into that thing. Question:back alley, bare knuckle brawl.  who wins, Glue Stick or White Out?  My money's on White OUT!  p.s. i know this is dude of me, but i'm mirroring this on my site.  i'm too lazy to thing of other not-quite-witty things to write about. so L and Z word you!

Gone for the b-party weekend.  Hawaii in Sept.    Pray for my Grandma.  It looks like lung cancer.  Not suprised, just sad.    I'm listening to Marty Robbins, about to finish the Great Dictator, and will see Jerry Stahl read some later tonight.  The Dodgers are 4-1 since the trades.    Jesse

      hello, all. i'm writing this from the cloudy stanwood washington. dmh and i drove up here monday, it was a flawless performance, 19 hours of bliss. i dropped dmh off at the mall with trevor and then made it up to stanhood by 130 am. it's strange to be here this time, but i'm excited to be heading east next week. i did some research on something i'd always wondered about and found this very interesting. the land in northern california around redding is considered by some to be the 51st state, jefferson state. it's fascinating really; they have a website. urlLink look!  i don't know if that link worked or not. basically these folks got screwed by salem and sacramento and are pissed. the stanwood camano fair is this weekend and the headlining act is starship, whose hit you might remember is "we built this city". i might be busy, however, and i'm not sure i'll make it. or if i do i'll be preoccupied with the livestock i'm sure. pigs are awesome. so is bisquits and gravy which three gas stations on our road trip were advertising specials on. can't think of anything that goes better with ten gallons of fuel, a pack of cigarettes and a dirty restroom. ciao.

      Preface: So in case I am not doing this correctly, this is andrew, not jesse. andrew hamilton, not jesse gloyd. jesse knows how to set up blogs and give clear directions to his friends so that they may join him on his blog. i, andrew, do not know how to set up a blog or post things in my own name.   In case I am doing this correctly, disregard everything I just said.  I. Moving     A. Moving is a strange experience, as I am sure you all can attest. For those of you who have seen the new house, which I believe is the majority of you, rest assured that the house is well in order. Plants are growing, trash is being emptied, life carries on. I have not written a creative word in nearly two months, a cause of much shame and shit upon my head. I am however counting thevirtualporch as creative writing, which should lift any residual shit or shame from my head.   II. Work       Work was going really well. I felt like I was getting the hang of it. I felt like I was begining to gain the respect of my superiors and coworkers. I felt that perhaps fundraising work wasn't so bad. After all, it is a noble and good thing to do one's task with honor, to not waste time by looking up news events and current politcal debates on the Internet. If the Good Lord has given one a job, the least one can do is learn to ignore the cursory boredom and seek to do it well. And so I did. Until last night.       Amanda and I spent last night with our good friends Peter and Alison, parents of our godson Maclane Finnegan, and all around good people. I like Peter and Alison quite a bit. They are creative, well read, fine cooks, respectable drinkers, commited smoker (peter), and sincere and loyal friends. They also hate to hold steady jobs, and seem to relish just barely making ends meet. which in its own way carries a certin amount of respectability with it. After all, I would love to stay home and play with a kid and make art, or read, or, or, well, whatever it is you do when you don't have a full time job. Anyway, just being around them reminded me how much I have ignored how much I resent wearing a shirt and tie everyday, and getting up at 7 fucking o'clock in the morning, and wallowing in front of crazy people for what seems like a measly paycheck but is actually quite good but it's amazing how fast you can burn money no matter the amount when you don't understand the fundamentals of sound finance. it's a catch-22, in the purest sense. I want to stay home. I need money. I don't mind my job, but I hate my job, but what else am I going to do between 8 and 5, but i have debts to pay, but i need to be doing something that reinforces my romantic notion of myself as a WRITER, i.e. i need to be in college and stay up till 9am drinking wine in cowboy hats.  Now of course I don't want to be drinking wine in cowboy hats.  The evening tipped the scales, that's all. And today at work the slightest little thing, I can't even remember what it was now, sent me on an internal rampage, and a passive campaign of telling all of my co-workers that I was quitting.  The moral: 8-5 jobs suck. They pay the bills. They suck the life out of you. I have no one to blame for my lack of creativity but myself. History is soaked with writers who wrote while they worked day jobs. They had what the French call "dedication" and "tenacity." Two qualities that I am severly lacking.   It's not that I hate my job as much as I resent having to pretend to be interested in something that I could not care less about. But, there is that paycheck...  III. Kentucky       Amanda and I went to visit her grandparents' farm in Kentucky two weeks ago, which has proven to be a formative experience. I gained ten pounds in five days by eating meals comprised primarily opf gravy, fried cornmeal, and assorted boiled vegetables, I learned to shoot a gun. I killed birds with said gun. Said gun was a motherfucking shotgun. I met some of the most solid and remarkable men I have ever had the privilege of coming into contact with.        I won't go into terrible detail, as I am planning to give a painfully detailed account of our trip in my next post. But I will say that Kentucky is not a different state, it is a completely different country; much like England in that they speak an English that has little remeblance to the language you and I speak. Exhibit A: Cousin Mary Lynn, pronounced "Merlin." Also witness turkey fans, throats, and feet nailed to the side of a hunting cabin, and bumper stickers reading "I brake for animals. I eat them and wear their skins," and "I don't brake for liberals, gays, and anti-gunners." Also witness a sense of family and place like you would not believe, along with a profound sense of satisfaction with one's life and vocation. I hope your appetites are sufficiently whetted.  IV. Reccomendations      A. Zadie Smith's forward in The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003     B. Don Delillo's Libra, but only after you watch JFK     C. The Thinking Fellow's Union Local 282 -- think sonic youth meets a travelling yiddish carnival, and you might be close.     D. Not buying Charles Shaw and springing for the extra $1.50 on a nicer bottle of wine.     E.  Not using Wal Mart to develop your film, or as a source for anything in particular.     V. Bed       A. I am going to bed.
