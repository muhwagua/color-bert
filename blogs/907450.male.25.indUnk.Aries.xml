        i love the cure always:   vegas was ......... hot, really really hot, tiring, gambling, smoking (blech), casino royale, slot machines, drinking, bright lights, losing money, gaining money, indecisive, motion loitering, why do we have giraffes, stripclubs, $35 dollar Bellagio buffet, walking, alexander calder (the art of invention), good times, bad times ......... that's all i have to say about that  crossroads is a bad movie, very very bad. even if it was so bad it was good it still is bad. what is with the "quite" thing ...... seriously. oh my goodness no toilet seat covers, are you going to be okay pigern. ha ha.   work tomorrow, how depressing.

        pigern:  hello everyone. hope vegas was fun. london has been quite enjoyable so far. although the plane ride was extremely long and tiring. i watched crossroads on the plane. hee hee. it is quite a bad movie. so bad it's good... no still bad. hah hah. my anxiety regarding complete isolation have been relieved, as the students in my group are quite friendly and there are some students from other schools besides ucd. today we went on a sight seeing tour through london and saw all of the famous spots, such as big ben, tralfalger square, and the buckingham palace. we then took an extensive tour through the tower of london, where past monarchs imprisoned criminals. it also holds the crowned jewels which are carefully guarded. i have much reading to do and catch up on but hope all is smashing with everyone.  p.s. small differences i have noticed: there are no paper towels or toilet seat protectors in the loos (as they call bathrooms). they use the air dryer method or a towel roll. also, the traffic lights turn red, then yellow, then green so the cars know it is almost their turn.

      today was pretty crappy...lets see, what did i do?  i found out someone actually made tremors 2.  then i was flabbergasted to find out that they made a part 3...wtf...how many people actually saw the second one in order to justify a making of a third one...anyways, i then went to circuit city to get my money back from the head unit i bought on sunday.  after, i met up with wally and lisa and we went to priceclub.  that sucked too.  next, we ventured over to wally's house to watch the draft and i was totally disappointed when the clippers didnt get andre miller.  i left around 7:20 to get some popeyes and went to aaron lee's house to fix my car.  i ended my night by going to tapioca and wasting 2 hours with aaron, tyler, and steven.  sorry brad, i forgot to call you.  thats was pretty much my day....i hope i was able to waste a couple of minutes of your lives with this sad summary....okay, gonna go sleepy time....ilovethecure, dont you regret inviting me into this message board?  peace out!

      per conversation with curelover, i started thinking about how people continue to believe myths.  misunderstanding something is easier than bothering to find out the truth.  if everyone just took some time to figure out the complexities behind certain conditions or incidents, we would all be a more enlightened world.  but no one bothers and they prefer feeding off the myth.  if only we could be fortunate enough to come across someone who has achieved such knowledge ... and is willing to share it.  because sometimes these individuals figure, "why bother?"  in my cynical musings, i believe even they are too lazy to impart what they know just as we are too lazy to listen.

      hi nick and juwanna ..... welcome to the house.   nick there is a point to this blog crap ....... it is called random thoughts and the likes, if you don't like it i'll be more than happy to kick you out, ha ha. you are not a total loser cause not all tv is bad. hello gilmore girls rocks ....... i know darth loves the theme song .... although i'm not sure if the mole is ranked very high but hey crappy shows like american idol make it all the time in top spots. i haven't really noticed how cheap you have gotten ......... just short  sorry juwanna it took you so long to figure out how this blog thing works. you are lame, has summer made you dumber, ha ha.   okay so here is my random thought for the day ........ friendships are a tricky business. just when you think you have figured out where you stand with a friend things change. just when you thought a friendship no longer existed, you find out it still does in one simple conversation. on the flipside friends who you thought would be around for awhile or at least would still exist end up fading away. so i guess you never really do know what is going to happen ........ oh well that's life right ......... i guess  my song of the day: sleep/swim - mum

      hi guys ..... well we are moving into our new home. ha ha let's see how long we actually keep this sorry thing going eh. hmmm what should i write about now. okay here's one i think pigern would like.   why do people always say a friend of a friend. i.e.   wannabe: "i know this guy in a band" or "i know this famous person" non wannabe: "do you know them know them" wannabe: i know a friend who has a friend who knows a friend who knows this person" non wannabe: "so you don't actually know them" wannabe: "welllllllllll i know the friend of the friend of the friend who knows them"  you get my point ....... how annoying  my song of the day: anything new order

      What's up everyone.  I haven't blogged in a while it seems.  Dorkus Melorkus, i totally agree about the diet thing.  it seems like every woman in my office is on a diet.  during lunch, if you look around, all the men are eating meat, burgers, pasta, etc...and every single woman (except me) is eating a salad.  what's up with that?  I'm very sad that Miles got traded. I only wore my jersey like twice and then now he leaves the team.

      the people here at work are on the "Peckers & Pondwater" diet. well, at least that's what i call it. they drink this green wheat drink (i saw the ingredient list - it has 50 types of leaves, roots, and bark) in it and it literally looks like pond water. i have come to the conclusion that mosquito eggs, dead tadpoles, ground up peckers, used tampons, toe jam, and belly button lint are also part of the ingredients. it sure smells like it.

      i completely agree with you dorkus about mass e-mails (and your logical line of reasoning works for me) ....... seriously. but i think these people can also be fobby because maybe they can't read english well so they think reply to all means reply. you know english is a tricky language :P so they are fobby tippy asian people.   so vegas is on for some of us on this message board and all i have to say is ...... VEGAS BABY !!!!!!!  thought of the day: i am so sick of people talking about their weight at work. it is always: "i need to go on a diet", "i need to lose weight", "i will try this crazy diet plan", "i will starve myself from food" .... and for what. i have no idea. i always thought if you wanted to lose weight it would be a slow and gradual process not this whole get thin quick thing. it is just as bad as the whole get rich quick idea ......... people people people if any of these stupid tricks worked don't you think everyone would be thin and rich but alas NO........ so get use to who you are, accept who you are and MOVE ON ...... i swear if i hear the word diet one more time i will shoot myself in the head.   music to my ears: dreams never end - new order  where darth, candy cane and beet be at????

      so what irritates me more than mass emails is if someone sends you the original email KNOWING that you are not attending the event in the first place. meaning, my friend sent me an email invitation even though she knew i wasn't going. she even wrote in the email, "you can disregard this rsvp - i just wanted to include you in the email" - what's that all about??!!!!! i'm NOT going! so that means i don't want to get a thousand emails from people who ARE going!   i've come to the conclusion that only tippy asian people send out mass emails (and respond to all recipients of the original email). i am not tippy. therefore i hate mass emails. (no offense to tippy asian people.) (okay, so this is not exactly a logical line of reasoning, but it works for me.)

      okay, so i know this pales in comparison to the cure in england, but i will attempt to give a quick rundown on the ben kweller show at the roxy last friday. his set was almost exactly the same as his set on wednesday at chain reaction. opening bands were pony league and my morning jacket (again!). anyway, the drummer from pony league is the drummer from ben's high school band radish. they weren't anything special. the lead singer totally thought he was kurt cobain, whatever. my morning jacket hurts my eyes and ears. that's all i have to say about them. luckily, my friend and i scored a table in the vip section (one of the only tables that actually wasn't reserved by the Beautiful People), so we were surrounded by people i HATE.   celeb sightings: selma blair (like), kirsten dunst (ehh), and ben lee (love!) conversing with one another, nick (like) from Freaks and Geeks leaving in his brand new white ford explorer.  new wave, you are so right. I HATE MASS EMAILS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING!!! I GET THEM ALL THE TIME AND I JUST AUTOMATICALLY DELETE THEM BC THEY ARE A BIG WASTE OF MY TIME.  see ya

      hello everyone. the cure show last night was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. it was amazing. the weather at hyde park was picture perfect -- sunny but not too hot. all of the opening acts were good but the cure was top form. when they came out, the crowd went mad. i wanted to take pics but felt like a dork. but once the cure walked on stage, cameras were going off everywhere. it was like paparazzi. i think i got some really good shots myself. robert walked slowly from one end of the stage to the other taking the crowd in. and then they started their set, which included many older songs. they even played three imaginary boys, with robert describing it as the song that came out when they were just starting (i think he said as a three piece). robert was wearing a black button down and jeans... actually i think they were all wearing black shirts. except for simon who was wearing a black vest. they did an hour and a half set and then came back to sing two encores. it was hilarious because after the first encore, everyone became even more insistent they come back onstage. the cure ended their second encore with just like heaven, inbetween days, and boys don't cry. all three sent the crowd into a frenzy, jumping fit. fireworks went off in the end and robert said "it's been a great 25 years. see you again in the next 25." even after the show was clearly over, the crowd continued to cheer and no one would move in the hopes they would come back... even after the stage lights were turned off and the equipment was being moved off stage. sigh. good time.

      hey juwanna man, my friend from san fran was sitting next to me and i pointed out your last blog. she said, "well he is in sacramento." so, not all north cal people suck. just those in sacramento. just kidding. when are you going to change your name? isn't that movie really old now? new wave girl, have you been getting a lot of mass emails? sorry to hear how irksome they are. hey, in only a few hours i will be at the CURE SHOW. WOOOOO!!!! maybe i'll hang out with them after the show and we could go hang out at a pub. hee hee. i actually feel sad today that everyone in my class has left. it's weird because i didn't really hang out with them that much or even talk to them but the familiarity of their presence gave me comfort. now the dorm is all filled with weird people i don't know. random quote of the day by me: the less i know you the more i like you. random thought of the day: never underestimate the importance of a perfectly elevated pillow. song of the day: ANYTHING BY THE CURE.

      hello from Sacramento, the most boring city in the world.  Let's see...Juwanna and I met my sis for lunch near her work and ate all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta, salad, and soup for $5.  not bad price...not too good food.  then we went swimming and took the dog for a walk....then went to the market. tonight, we see Austin Powers...juwanna is very excited.  so that's our boring day.  Tomorrow should be better...san francisco.  we gonna try to go to alcatraz.  anyone been there?

      hello again. class is finally over. i just took my final and it was pretty easy. now i have two free days in london, highlighted of course by the cure show in hyde park. dorkus melorkus, i'll try to see if there are any other copies of bk's phone home. there are so many cds i want to buy here but my luggage is already filled to capacity. the bk show sounded pretty good although i dislike chain reaction. i think the floor should be sloped so everyone can see better. i went to a small club called borderline last night and it was really hidden. you know like how in swingers they say the cool clubs are those without the signs? well you had to walk off the main road to another side street and then the club is on another street off that side street. supposedly really famous bands have played there under pseudonyms, like r.e.m., blur, etc. the band that played last night was mediocre though. i think i have to go to a show tonight by myself because everyone else in the group is pretty intent on going clubbing, which i really dislike. has anyone heard of the rapture? sound like early cure and have been given frequent coverage by NME recently. darth, as much as i would like to see dc here, i can't because i will be back home by then. how sad huh? btw, small wonder was such a bad show, it was good. and out of this world is classic. classic i tell you. also, i went to this photography bookstore yesterday and the owner asked me where i was from. when i said l.a. he said, "oh all that smog and those earthquakes!" i thought that was funny because the air in london is pretty bad itself. i think l.a. smog is even better than the exhaust filled, grey air of london. and earthquakes aren't that frequent in california. oh well. i just smiled politely. he was an old man, i couldn't argue.

      New Wave Girl? Exercise at the gym? With people? That is almost unheard of....  Pigern, I saw Ben Kweller last night at Chain Reaction (all you emo kids must die!), and he was really good! The opening bands sucked BIG TIME. Some rap group (I think), and My Morning Jacket (which looked like Pearl Jam circa 1993, but sounded like they belonged on star 98.7)...Anyway, BK was really good. He started out with "I can't help falling in love with you" (elvis right?) and played most of the songs from Sha Sha, and maybe 2 that I never heard of. For the finale, all the guys from the other bands joined BK on stage for Weezer's Undone Sweater Song. Please note that one of the groups actually rapped to this song. Other than that, it was a fun rendition. Good show, but not great. Too many people (sold out), hot (98 degrees), and couldn't see anything (i hate tall people). Oh well, I get to see him tomorrow night at the Troubadour, and I will get there early to score a seat upstairs where I can watch BK perform uninterrupted.......I can't believe you got EP phone home! I'm so jealous. I took too long to order it, and by the time i was getting ready to, they weren't selling it anymore...Did you see any more copies while you were there? Oh well, maybe I can find it online somewhere....  Darth Bronger - afternoon tv shows? (sorry haven't had a chance to read other people's posts) these are the ones i remember: Who's the Boss, Small Wonder (how can i forget that show? i practiced talking like a robot bc of that show. and i always wondered why no one ever wondered why Vickie wore that same red and white dress every day.), Mr. Belvedere, Diff'rent Strokes, Facts of LIfe, Hey Dude, Salute Your Shorts, Saved By the Bell.............

      Wow Pigern does exist!!! good to see you blogging again.....i think punk shows across the world are pretty much the same, young angry (usually about nothing) youth...getting a teenager depressed is like shooting fish in a barrell. haha....you should sooo go see DC cause they rock (er...uhh....suck) yeah its kinda weird that new wave uses capital then lower case letters and is starting to use the word peeps, looks pretty t---- to me.....hahaha.....gyms are cool if they are clean, if not i'll stay away.....juwanna's question is quite perplexing I mean after sitting in between both of you and getting molested I think its safe to say that its a tie....you are both super gay....today at work we are discussing classic television shows that used to be on in the afternoon, like mr. belvedere, facts of life, wonder years, etc...are there any other shows that you guys can remember?

      i don't know what everyone's name is so new wave girl, you can change the names. dorkus melorkus, is the ben kweller concert coming up or has it already passed? let me know how it is. at this small record store in london, i found his phone home ep and it was only a pound. i so wish i could see him. his album is barely coming out here. but it has been pretty highly praised. the vagrant kids are doing a show here in august. saves is the headliner with dc, face to face, and hot rod supporting. the punk shows here are just like the ones in l.a. -- a bunch of young teenagers but they actually wear the band shirts. hee hee. how dorky. new wave girl, since when do you use the word "peeps"? it's so unbecoming of you. :o) alright, nothing else going on. take care everyone.

      hi everyone.  wow newwavegirl, 10 pm is early, even for me :)  i remember when i first started working i was in bed by 10:30 everynight.  pretty sad.   anyhow, i've been going to the gym lately and realized something.  The machines there are actually really gross.  Think about it, someone's sticky body pouring sweat all over the machine, and they just wipe it off with a towel (which is actually more like smearing the sweat all over the machine) and then someone else is supposed to use it afterward?  that's gross.  so why do i use the machines?  beats me. going to sac and sf this weekend?  any suggestions on yummy restaurants or places to go in sf?

      Yes I do check the website, daily, actually multiple times a day, I have it bookmarked at work so I can check to see if any of you guys left any interesting blogs.....can i really say whatever I want.......hmm let me think, what do I want to say.......computer virus do suck, as many of you may have noticed I am rarely if ever online anymore, the simple reason being that my computer at home has a virus and allows me to go online for increaments of about 5-10 minutes usually, so its not worth my time to sign on......don't worry juwanna i'm sure the angels will return to their sept glory of past years, so don't get your hopes up to big......lucky for me the dodgers don't seem to want to make me go through that sort of pain and have decided to stop playing now, i'm still confused why dude where's my car was left off the top 100 movies.....here is the question of the day "If you had a choice of being the top scientist in your field or haveing mad cow disease which one would you choose?"

      Bronger is disgusting.  I don't believe you wasted......errr watched so many of those movies, that is insane.  NickE you on the other hand, I have no idea what you've been doing, but I guess you have more of a life than Bronger.  Anyways I have seen 25 of those movies all the way through, and bits of the others.  So I am at a good medium I think...  And to answer Bronger's question:  Yes I would eat myself, because hot dogs are good!  My quote of the day will be:  It's better to shoot for the stars and miss than to shoot for a pile of crap and hit it.  Movie quote:  "Whoa!"  (Keeanu Reeves the Matrix)

      so i'm sitting in the lunchroom with some coworkers today telling them about nick edney and how she has never seen so and so movies. then they started asking me if i've seen certain movies and someone named top gun in which i replied nope ......... yes it is true I HAVE NEVER SEEN TOP GUN. i know i know how could i have NEVER SEEN TOP GUN ...... but it's true and honestly i have no desire to watch it. it looks like a lame action movie with some hot and up and coming star name tom crusie in it. not very appealing to me. eh but whatevers ..... so don't feel bad nick edney cause I NEVER SAW TOP GUN (and yet i've seen so many other films but i guess those don't matter) and at least you have. and please by no means does this mean i'm some movie buff/know it all ...... far from it, i think darth bronger is more in that dept. but i'm just saying i hardly call top gun an actually good movie compared to the other stuff out there.   side note: last time i checked top gun was not on the  urlLink AFI's 100 Movie List  .... hee hee okay okay rocky was on the list and i know I HAVE TO GO and see that one ...... blah blah blah

      That movie list is pretty scary Nick, i'm almost too scared to mention any other movies cause I have a feeling that you haven't seen them and it will give me a heart attack....wizard of oz, i still don't understand it....every year it was on cbs......juwanna you know I missed our times together, don't worry we have a dodger game tommorrow, i'm sure we can get away from the others, and then again on sat.....check the OC website also, there is an accounting specialist position, its money and that way you can drive me to work, doesn't get much better than that....time for another fun filled day of -----------------------------, yep all day long.....new wave sorry that you ran into people of the past, the worst part of it is that they are from brightwood so they have to suck, unless of course they are in the BWC, then its all good.....hahaha......peace out

Very cool. So i'm curious as to who you saw while walking, NewWaveGirl...cuz i almost went with you so i'd probably would've had to chat with them too.  not good.  I don't like seeing people from the past either.  I can never remember anyone's names which makes it really uncomfortable.   Today, juwanna man's bro comes home.  can't wait to plant a nice wet kiss on his lips.  if not, juwanna will do it for me.

      Hey Peeple Of the Old School.  Was trying to think of something deep to write but once again creativity escapes me. However random song lyrics always see to find a way to fill the head and resonate within the emotional tip so I'll begin (and end) with this...  When does love change a man? When his heart is held in your hands. He'll close his eyes. He'll take the bait that you're creating as he's slipping under. And all along, through the storms so strong. He will not hear the thunder. He'll close his eyes...  Fire and Theft – Game 9  Makes me believe that people can really touch the soul if ya hit the right chord. Music as message? Surely. Message as meaning. Definitely. Meaning as Truth. Truth in love. Love in Truth. Interchangeable. Truth in music. Repeat. I believe this is the equation of life. Don't ask me why but songs simple lyrics like this make it all so easy to understand. Good night all and good dreams.  Love and Bass, -E

        just to let some of you guys know -  urlLink Blogger  is just where you write your message/blogs (make sure you press post & publish for it to publish) and that  urlLink 742 Evergreen Terrace   is where you can view your message/blog. in case there was any confusion.   thought of the day (not random): why can't i have a nice stroll around my neighborhood without seeing anyone i might remotely know ....... but nope it is almost impossible. i saw two former classmates today and groaned silently to myself. of course i didn't say hi but looked at the ground because we all know how far more interesting the ground is. however if i was to look up and  maybe  made eye contact with this individual i'm sure the conversation would go something like this:  former moron aka classmate: "oh (insert your name here) then pick either: a. "i didn't recognize you" (this could be due to the fact that you are enormously huge because you never lost the weight you gained in college and work is just adding to it and they can't see you under all those layer of fat OR that you got super good looking/hot and now talking to you seems worth it) b. "its been such a long time"   me: "yea"   former moron: "so what have you been up to?" (like they give a sh**, why do they insist on asking this)  me: "working" (a year ago this would have been graduating from school, dang how fast time flies ..... sheesh)  former moron: "where at? (yet again like they give a sh**, they are just waiting till you get to asking them what they are up so they can rant for about 5 to 10 mins about their boring ass sh** life)  the point is i don't think it is wrong to completely ignore someone you haven't seen in 4 or 5 years. i mean you didn't care about what was going on in their lives then and you sure as heck don't care now. i'm not being mean, i know others feel the same. dorkus melorkus i'm looking your way ....... we've both expressed the same dislike for eating or hanging out at places near our area ........ and it is understanable.  song of the day: bulletproof - radiohead  everyone go and get Amelia and Kids In the Hall: Brain Candy DVD tomorrow .......... ha ha.

           ATTENTION:   hey everyone i changed our template  because the other one was boring. this one has a "recommended website" and "e-mail corner" section. if you guys have any sites that you think is worthy to be looked at e-mail me. in addition, there are some kinks with blogger. take note, blogger will sometimes eraser a blog you were writing and the server does go down so sometimes you are unable to publish what you are writing.     it is late and i'm blogging so this might not make an sense, actually i'm sure it won't. some of us have gone to some good shows this weekend like the lost weekend tour and warped ...... sounded like you guys had good clean fun ..... okay well mabye not candy cane.  three good cure things happened to me today (well okay more like two but i'll say three): one -  i heard "maybe someday" at the bowling alley we were at, so very very happy, i mean honestly how many places actually play that song, two -  i got to put my cure sticker on my car .... finally and three - i listened to my cure cd all day today in the car with other people in it, sometimes i like to change the cd or go to radio to accomdate the people in my car but today i was like .... nah. ha ha.   random thought of the day: why is there so much focus on being thin, especially in the asian community. i'm always told by my family how much bigger i have gotten since high school and blah blah blah. so far none of my friends have directly told me about my weight situation but maybe they are scared i will kick their ass ...... and i would. just cause i'm so tired of hearing about how thin we are suppose to be. most asian girls i know are too skinny in my opinion. they are flat chested with a size a or aa bra size who have no ass what so ever. some of them look like 10 year boys because asian girls are small as well. ick ..... blech ...... nasty. what's worst is there are actually guys who like these super thin asian girls. now tell me please how are you suppose to have fun under the sheets with a skeleton, seriously now people. (shiver) if thin is in then count me out.   song of the day: catch - the cure

      Ok, So I finally made it to the Warped Tour this year at Ventura, whcih I dicovered is really, really, really far.  I left from LA at around 12:30PM and didn't get there until like 3:30PM.   I missed like the bands that I wanted to see...which was only MXPX and Alkaline Trio. Anyway, I felt really old going to the Warped Tour because there were like kids born in the 1990's.  Kids suck.   The concert would have been better if the sound systems were louder.  Half of the time, I was straining my ears just to hear which songs were being played.  It wasn't enjoyable.  Well, there's always next year.

      hi everyone, yesterday i went to the lost weekend tour, which included hoobastank, the vandals, idlewild, and the hives. it was an awesome show. i was in the pit amongst all of the slam dancing/moshing. idlewild was excellent and so were the hives. i got so messed up there -- beer and soda was spilled all over me. and i got kicked in the head by someone crowd surfing. i'm sore all over too from all of the pushing and shoving. but it was worth it. :o) very very fun stuff.  i'm so sad because next week i am going to ireland to see travis but the show is cancelled because neil got injured. ((tear)) alrighty, i have a major headache but i hope you guys are all doing well.

      Time for another rant......I sort feell like Andy Rooney......you ever wonder why you get more peanuts in a mixed nuts jar? okay enough of that, hey juwanna we really miss you over here, much like we miss the plague, hahaha......j/k.........new wave i know what you are trying to do with your name the upper and lower case names but it really isn't working, it looks like one of those tippy names you see on aol, especially cause it ends in girl, no offense or anything, just don't think it looks that good....my two cents......emo kids are soooo cool dorkus, I used to know these two girls who were in love with dashboard confessional like one of them has a button that she no longer wears on her bag, and the other used to have a sticker on their car...hehehehe....I was told how good he was and how much emotion he puts into his music.....I just don't see anything appealing about a 12 year old (yes thats how old he looks) crying, its too 8th grade for me......New wave I never understood why people get mad when a little group they like makes it big, I mean that is their point of making music, any one who says its all about the music if full of crap why else would you live in crappy conditions, get no money to play your music or have to pay others to play a concert? they are trying to make it, if they got big then they fulfilled their dreams. I heard someone say this once and I agree "What do you want them (the band you like) to do sit around and play concerts in your backyard all the time just cause you want them to stay small?" I always found that funny...okay thats enought ranting for today.....snooch to the nooch

      how many emo kids does it take to screw in a light bulb? my answer would be D ........ big time hate the emo kids with their striped shirts and their hearts on their sleeves ....... and the sad, very, very sad truth of the matter is i use to really like dashboard confessional. like truly liked them ......... of course that never lasted because there is only one great and wonderful band and their name is (drum roll) THE CURE. okay how many of you guys saw that coming.  can't imagine going to the warped tour since 1997 ........ boggles the mind  the new red hot chili peppers cd got 4 stars in rolling stones ..... at the same time they did an article about dashboard confessional and entitled it ...... "King of Pain" ..... it states chris c. likes to drink coffee and have a muffin in the morning .... and for lunch and dinner - a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so that is how he stays so short ......  why is it that once a band/groups gets big you want to hate them but at the same time you are happy for them because they are making money and does it really take away from the quality of their music and shouldn't artist try to change their sounds, we wouldn't want the same repetitive albums over and over and over ........ so where do you draw the line ...... eh (shurg my shoulders)   oh i changed my name if anyone cares or in case you could not figure who this was.

      How many emo kids does it take to screw in a light bulb? a. None. They are too busy crying. b. None. They are too busy crying and writing a song about it. c. None. They are too busy listening to ________ (insert emo band here. Please choose from Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, Jimmy Eat World, onelinedrawing only.) d. None. I hate all emo kids.

      Welcome Candy Cane! Lucky that you get to go to warped tour! Why isn't it on a weekend by the way? Just seems like it would be more successful if it were on a saturday or sunday thats just my two cents on the issue. Since yesterday I was talking about warped parents and the names they give their kids (and yes Nick, Mary Christmas is toture), today I couldn't help but notice a recent celebrity son. John Henry Williams was trying to preserve his father, Ted Williams in a cryrogenic state so that in the future he could sell off his DNA and there could be more Ted Williams running around (according to his sister this is exactly what he envisioned). How super warped can this nut case be? He was doing it for pure profit, exploiting his father's celebrity cause he thought he could make an easy buck. John Henry sucks and gets a big BOOOOO........Nick make sure you can get your money back if you don't go to the gym that much at first, you don't want to be out a big bundle......Currently listening to the new Red Hot Chili Peppers Cd through my cubicle (my coworker rushed out to get it). It doesn't seem unbearable like "One Hot Minute" was, but at the same time I'm not hearing anything that makes me want to rush out and get it myself.

      dang it!  i just wrote out this long paragraph and it got erased somehow.  great...don't feel like writing it out again, so here's just a little....i'm getting gym membership tonight (but might be a waste of money), went walking last night...saw a cat's paw on the street...it's strange when you see 10 plain houses in a row and then out of nowhere a huge ass remodeled house...strange and sorry, very random thought.  darth, adding to your thoughts on warped names parents give children.  ok, my cousin told me she knew a girl named Mary Christmas.  not as bad as Semen (which i might add is probably the worst name i have ever heard of), but pretty darn funny.

      I'm really excited about going to the Warped Tour this year, then again, I always look forward to the Warped Tour.  It's like my one big concert for the year.  I've been going like every year since 1997.  I even ditch work to go see it.  Now, is that bad of me?  I think not.  I can't break tradition.

      Finally Darth Bronger has returned to 742 evergreen ter. haha.....its been a long time since I last blogged, crappy computer not running to smoothly at home.....Something has always bothered me and today its bothering me a little more than usual maybe one of you guys can help me....why do parents give their children such warped names? Celebs are notorious for this (i.e. jett travolta, talollah and scout willis and the most recent kydd ducovony) but today I came across a name on our waiting list at work that takes the cake...now I'm used to the weird vietnamese names like bich phuc or something along those lines but today i came across a man who's name is Semen Rufkin, yes thats right his name is Semen, and his application states he was born in this country, so his parents purposely gave him this name. How many jokes and embarressing situations did this guy have to deal with......parents can be so cruel.

      yes life does have meaning once you give it one, however do i even know what that meaning is yet ........ i am still trying to figure out what i want to be when i grow up and what i want to accomplish. i'm still confused as to who i will become that it is hard to decide what my life is going to be like. in addition, what might bring us meaning at one point in our lives does not mean it will bring us that same meaning a day later, a week later or even a year later. people drift in and out of our lives everyday, people get sick, people lose their jobs, people lose their security, and etc. yes the life/the meaning of it is not handed to us on a silver patter and yes we must try to search it out, that is i suppose the purpose of living, at least a part of it.  yes i know i complain a lot. people view me as someone who blows things out of proportion, a drama queen if you would like to call it. i'm sure i'm blowing this whole "meaning of life" thing out of proportion and if i am then so be it. however who doesn't whine and bitch about stuff. you think everyone flows through life completely content and the minute anyone says something negative or that comes off as a downer, notice how people are so quick to shoot them down, to agrue with them that every point they make is WRONG, INCORRECT, ERRONEOUS, WICKED, SINFUL, AND THE LIST GOES ON. well i'm tired of it. so here are my negative thoughts and you can think they are wrong as long as you like.

      darth and curelover: you guys did not answer my questions. esp, you curelover re: cure rarities. as for curelover's bleak perspective on life -- life does not have meaning until you give it one. so perhaps life is not about the process of work, marriage, retirement, and dying. but what else is there? what can an individual do to make their life have more meaning and substance. it's not handed to us on a silver platter but we have to search out for it. well, that probably won't really cheer anyone up really but hey, i tried.

      dang it has been 3 days since my last post ...... my bads, i'm all MIA and stuff. let's see everything that happened to me darth and nick edney were at but oh well i'll just tell anyways.   on july 4th i saw fireworks, it was alright. i had nothing else to do anyways.  july 5th went to work, i was busy so time went by fast and july 6th went to a wedding which .......... let's just say wasn't too great. the wedding itself was really nice but my aunts' behavior was a different story (big sigh) pigern i'm looking in your direction. all in all some pretty crappy days for me.   why am i so lazy that all i desire to do is stay at home on my computer or read. i hardly like to go out and i've been told i can be extremely grumpy on the phone ... nick and darth i'm looking in your direction. eh oh well. ha ha i like how you think no one is happy in this blog page pigern.   but seriously what is there to be happy about .... remember life goes like this .... you work for awhile, maybe meet someone, get married, have kids, work some more, retire and then die. now tell me at what point is there stuff to be happy about. i'm not being cynical here i'm just telling the truth. some people find these points in life enjoyable and to them and i say more power to you but others ..... like myself, eh i don't really seem to care.   you would think i would enjoy life after going to a wedding but nope, just made me see how sad it really is. i mean two people are promising to love each other forever and ever but remember there are no guarantees in life. you just have to do the best that you can at whatever you do (actually advice from my dad ......... shocker huh). blah blah blah and then you die. ha ha i rather just skip to the dying part. sorry if this sounds so bleak, maybe i will be happier later on ...... no wait i doubt that seriously.   okay but i seriously can't end this on a downer so ummmmmmm I LOVE THE CURE ALWAYS AND FOREVER ....... miss talking to you pigern :( but i know you are having tons of fun :) and nick edney, darth bronger and juwanna you guys are cool ....... i guess, ha ha no seriously you guys are cool.  song of the day: at this bleak point .....

      pigern, you seem to be keeping yourself busy with lots of touristy things.  me, on the other hand, this is the 3rd morning in a row that i've slept in til noon.  i don't think that's happened since xmas.  let's see...last night lisa and i were at shirley's restaurant for 6 hours during wedding stuff.  pretty tedious work, but nice chatting with them (cuz it's not like i chat with them all the time, you know????). curelover and darth stopped by.  i think they had a really really really fun time :) ha ha.  well, it's off to shirley's for more wedding stuff today....i'm excited.  for one, i actually like weddings...and two, i have no life.  i took a tylenol last night cuz my foot was hurting...that damn tylenol feels like it bruised my throat.

      hello everyone. no one seems very happy on this blogger. well, with the exception of juwanna. anyhow, today i went to notting hill. my friend and i were looking for the bookstore in the movie but couldn't find it. darn, i wanted to take a picture of it. it was very very crowded and there were so many antiques and used clothing. i walked around there for four hours and still couldn't see everything. note to curelover: where have you been? email me please. also, darth i went to a toy store today and i saw some star wars action figures but no yoda. only anakin and some other characters. the packaging looks the same too. is it any different if i were to buy the toys in london? curelover, what rareties of the cure do you already have? any dating back to 1977 to 1980? i have had no luck finding really good singles of any of the bands you like. i saw some cure records but you wouldn't be able to listen to them. if anyone would like anything specific for me to pick up for them let me know. :o) my thought of the day: from virginia woolf, man is never completely separated from sadness. even when he is happy, he is sad because he knows it will end.

      so so jealous of you juwanna...watching fireworks on the beach sounds nice...but can you beat watching 50 firework shows at one time?  next year, dinner at my house. I'm so happy...no work tomorrow.  sorry for rubbing it in everyone.  ha ha.  but yeah, when i switch jobs, it will feel weird not to have so many days off...we are definitely spoiled at my office.  i told my mom to wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow morning, just so i can say "yea! i don't have to work today!" and go back to sleep.  what a loser i am.

      oh, curelover. i'm so sorry. you know i would give you my ticket to the cure in a second. maybe i'll meet those other cure fans at the pub and we can all have a drink together... hmmm... sounds good. b.r.m.c. was playing tonight but i came back too late from hampton court. it is the house where all the monarchs lived before. quite beautiful but nothing compared to the french, which i guess some consider gaudy. school is getting tiring. we have class from 930 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then we have a field trip that usually lasts until 4 p.m. this leaves little free time. but i still had time to go to kensington today. it is a high class neighborhood. and the shopping at h&m is excellent. ten dollar jackets! oh, nick... the drag queens were pretty obvious. their gender i mean. but i suppose some are complicated to figure out. last few notes: on the bright side curelover, i'll get you a t-shirt from the concert. it will be like a "my sister went to a cure concert in london and all i got was this lousy t-shirt" hee hee. but seriously, the cure will come to the states again. i'm sure of it. also, oasis' heathen chemistry is an excellent album. 'stop crying your heart out' is my song of the day.

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TELL ME THIS IS NOT HAPPENING ......... PLEASE!!!!!!  so pigern gets to see the Cure at Hyde Park July 27 ....... and ME -  the one who is a DIE HARD CURE FAN who loves them ever so much - is not going to. i'm extremely happy pigern gets to see them but at the same time so very very jealous, i almost want to cry, you think i'm kidding but i'm not. something is very wrong with this situation. (sigh) alas nothing ever goes right for me. i guess it makes sense why i'm so miserable all the time then huh.   some other dishearten facts: 1. i have to work July 5 while practically the whole world has it off 2. i have to get up early every day this entire weekend for various reasons so no sleeping in and 3. traffic is very very very evil (double sigh, head down, dragging my feet away so i can continue to live my bleak and ultra dull life)

      cheers everyone. today i went to the globe theatre and saw shakespeare's twelfth night. and it was excellent. bravo bravo. people who say they dislike shakespeare have obviously never seen it live. it was a riot. the actors were smashing. as a bonus, we sat on hard wooden seats just as they did in the past. they also have men play the female characters since women were not actors in the past. my friend next to me joked that they were the original drag queens. hee hee. our class will be able to see midsummer night's dream next week. i can't wait. after that visit, i think i will attend more theatre. it is definitely worth the trip and money. hey darth, how come your middle name is fatty? the boss conversation sounds very strange indeed. your discussion on norms sounds so good. and i don't particularly like norms. but the food here does not suit my taste. i had the fish and chips. too fried... salt and vinegar is too much. :o( if i lived here for a long time, i would probably lose a lot of weight. another thing i have noticed: people really do have bad teeth. hee hee

      hello all. pigern here. i wish i was in vegas right now or at least could enjoy a few days of hot weather. it is cold here. very very cold. it rains each day and i can hardly remember it is july considering the dreary weather. my room is frightfully cold and there is a draft that blows in through the old boarded windows. i wish i had my scarves, mittens, and large overcoat. today i went to the museum of london where one can take a quick summarized tour of everything from the celtics in londinium to the victorian era. there were some paddington bear items in the store nick! i am getting accustomed to the tube and can't wait to do some further exploring. also, i bought tix for the hives show next week. it is at hyde park, only fifteen minutes away. :o) very excited. they are playing with idlewild and the vandals. another girl in my group is coming with me. it should be a good show. i'm thinking of taking a train to manchester, home of morrissey. hee hee. a great festival is taking place there. new order and the doves are scheduled to play. so many good shows... so little money.

      yipeeeeee !!!!!!! 3 day weekend. oh how i long for these times. unlike some people, looking your way nick edney ha ha, i don't have any days off except for three day weekends.    yes there are many and i mean many bad bad movies out there. (sigh) but have no fear there are great dvds out there like simpsons season 2 and pulp fiction. and of course fall tv is coming up ........ ohhh i can't wait .... gilmore girls (9/24) and will and grace (9/26) for me but bernie mac (9/18) and that 70's show (9/17) are just as good. i would say x-files of course but ...... may it R.I.P. (sniff) i miss mulder and scully :(  for now i'll just settle for american idol .... go kelly :)  good about the no baseball strike ... go dodgers .... i love popples, like pigern said i use to have a rock star one ..... and seriously jem was truly outragous  random thought of the day: this is actually more for yesterday ..... why do i bother watching the vma's, they are no where near as good as the late 80's and early 90's i.e. paula abdul, janet jackson, snoop dog and dre, old madonna, most 80's hair bands ha ha and the list goes on. the good: michael j. and his speech (that was classic), hives and vines, christina a. with new boobs and being high, jimmy fallon, guns n' roses performing  the bad: no doubt winning best pop song (that is wrong), dashboard confessional winning mtv2 award (come on people), eminem (will he PLEASE SHUT UP), the entire show ........  music to my ears: what about us - jodeci

      yes....the strike has been averted, i was looking forward to hitting nick in the stomach like juwanna had promised me, oh well, now i'll just have to settle for a brian downing bobblehead....pigern, jem was truly outrageous. i would say that swimfan reminds me a bit more of fear with mark walberg and reese witherspoon. the last movie i saw was austin powers but i can't remember anything before that other than star wars. its been a long crappy movie summer.review of the vma's all i need to say G'N'R can still rock!!! Yeah axel looks different but he can still scream and do the snake dance so what more do you want? Welcome to the Jungle!!!!!  There were a few other good moments, christina being high, jimmy making fun of the american idol dorks, hives/vines. and of course there are the band things as well i.e eminem flipping off moby, how some people read write of the teleprompter with no emotion (see avril levine and lisa marie) and of course some of the people who won.

      hey juwanna, popples weren't ugly. they were cute. new wave had rock star popple who had a mic you could velcro to her hand. awesome huh? ah... memories. i love all the old toys in the eighties and early nineties. when i went to hot topic, i saw a JEM notebook that said "1986 World Tour" on the cover. yes, truly outrageous. darth, i agree with you about the drought of worthwhile movies. i have not been to the theatre for eight weeks now. it is amazing that studios are spending money on such recycled trash. when i was watching films on the plane, i couldn't believe the unoriginality of the scripts. the last film i looked forward to was the importance of being earnest and even that was a disappointment. doesn't swim fan remind you of the crush with alicia silverstone? or some movie like that...

      hey party popples, remember them?  they were cool...you could turn them into those balls or flip them out and you'd have these ugly stuffed animals...as wally would say, "they're swet."  anyways,  how is everyone?  i decided i would blog today since i havent the last 3 or 4 weeks.  i didnt want new wave girl to kick me out, then i would totally have nothing to do.  i finally found a job!  too bad i didnt get it....hhahaaa....that made me laugh.  hey darth, dont be so pessimistic...i bet you 50 credits that there wont be a strike and ill let you punch nick edney in the stomach if they do.  the players arent dumb enough to ruin the game, at least i dont think so.  maybe im just naive and stupid like james.  i saw orange county today. it was pretty funny...almost funnier than collateral damage.  okay, i hate writing so peace out and see you guys in three to four more weeks.   quote of the day:  "people arent dumb, they just do dumb things....especially mexicans" -dedicated to my el monte neighbors

      hey party people, been a while since i blogged...welcome cheebo....wow g'n'r touring again would be cool, but slash really had the look of the band so it won't really be the same. This is the worst time of the year for movies, you are inbetween the summer movies, and the preoscar movies. Examples being: Pluto Nash and Serving Sara, these are both really bad movies that the studios are just dumping on us cause there is nothing else to see. Its mindboggling that anyone saw them at all really. Only 2 more days til the baseball strike is set to begin, i'm still holding out hope that there will be an agreed upon contract, but with every passing day I worry a bit more. The whole thing is pretty stupid when you sit down and read what the players are asking for, and like with the basketball strike a few years ago, its hard to sympathized with multi-millionaires who feel that they are not being paid enough or that the owners are trying to restrict them from signing huge ass contracts.....ahhhhhhhh....think mcfly think.....okay thats all I wanted to say about these issues  quote of the day: "Reason, too late perhaps, may convince you of the folly in misspending time" - dedicated to those in the mlb labor dispute

      Pigern, ya Slash still looks the same and his hair is still big and intact.  The only thing was he had no top hat, that was disappointing.. oh well.  On the radio I also heard that the real G'n'R with original members was going on tour again, minus Slash.  That was pretty interesting, so watch out for a haggard Axel Rose in a couple months.

      neat i have an ally against the dark forces called dorkus melorkus ....... ha ha ha ha (insert evil laugh here) no cheebo you are not lame  i think the entire D/C subject has been exhausted so nothing to say there .........  random thought of the day: like pigern type 1 i think there has to be some requirements for those people to work at those stores ........ i think darth and i have both touched upon the whole amoeba worker dying to be in a band but they are playing local gigs like someone's house party or bbq ....... ha ha get a job and a haircut man hee hee okay okay i'm kidding i mean they do have a job ...... to work at amoeba and act really snobby when people ask you about music .... and really who cares cause the real people who are annoying are some of the customers - there is the b.o. bunch (i didn't know people could smell that bad), the i go to ucla and i'm down for underground music (they don't have a clue what is going on just from the stuff they do hear from their more indie roommate), the mainstream bunch, the i'm 45 or 50 and trying to still stay hip, the i'm in a band that's going to make it big, and the list goes on ..... they are so very very very annoying ha ha. as for the hot topic people .... well they sell over priced merchandise to young naive kids who blow their parent's hard earned money ...... i'm still not sure if these super cool hot topic people are aware that THEY WORK IN A MALL for crap sake ......... whatevers   music to my ears: look around - dressy bessy

      hey mac the knife, how does slash look? still have the big hair? big hair defines the eighties. anyway, darth and new wave have this joke that some of the requirements to work at hot topic are piercings, tattoos, and dyed hair. the more you have, the more likely you will get hired. along the same vein, i think that in order to work at amoeba, you must be a struggling musician of some kind who is a snob about music. the more down and out your band is, the more likely you'll be hired.

      Just a quick note, yesterday I saw Jamie Pressly and Slash from G'n'R at Melrose.  Who was I more impressed with?  Slash, and it's no joke, this guy defines my 80's, on the other hand Jamie Pressly is smoking hot.  I guess it was a little better than the time I saw Andrew Dice Clay there....err... maybe not.

       Currently listening to: Pixies - Where Is My Mind?   Whoa i'm lost in the entire Nick conversation, but hope you're aight.  Secondly, I don't know who cheebo is, but welcome.   Moving on now.  Emo is cool?  How can it be cool to be depressed and have no self esteem?  These kids get screwed around by girls/boys or get picked on by others and drown themselves in this music just to feel better.  Don't get me wrong, there are the good songs along with the bad ones, and yes music is supposed to be an outlet for whatever you interpret it as, but some of this isht is depressing.  I am not here to say emo is good or bad, but about it being the in thing now though, that is a bunch of horse crap.  Yes people are now following bands such as Dashboard Confessional, because they think Chris Carraba is gay**...er cool because he wears his heart on his sleeve.  That is so lame.  He is a smart guy for cashing in on these little high school kids that know no better than to follow the "trends", but this guy is a pompous arrogant ass.  If you don't believe me go read some of the articles where he is interviewed or those televised on MTV.  Well I guess my discussion on emo turned into why Chris Carraba sucks.  Sorry people, well at least some of you will enjoy this.  **There is no proof that he is actually gay, but that's my take on him.  (Also sorry to the D/C fans in 742, but he just annoys me a great deal.)

      so many random thoughts in head ......  hey cheebo welcome to the house, remember to play nice .... well not with dorkus melorkus ha ha.  as for the music thing ... i agree with darth AND dorkus, they both give some good points. after all these people are out there to make their music heard even if it is to the yucky masses who follow whatever is trendy i.e. the swing/big band phase ..... man people were all over that one. yea it would be nice for them to stay small but at the same time i would feel bad that their music was not reaching a larger audience. in a sense if their stuff can drown out the horrible horrible crap on KIIS FM then maybe the world could be a better place ..... ha ha nah i doubt it. my thing is what i mentioned to dorkus before - you are a true fan when you liked them when they were a nobody, a somebody and then a has been. or you could always love the Cure hee hee cause they are a somebody to EVERYONE ...... (sigh) how can i write about music and not once mention the greatest band ever !!!!!!!  as for avril levignes ... yes she bugs, have you heard her skater song about some boy ..... simply awful, but if she is willing to beat the living day lights out of britney then all i have to say to her is ... O Canada O Canada.  this part is for nick edney - after some thought mr. bra and panties boy is pretty messed up for making that "bet" with you. i hope it was his lack of sleep and judgement that caused him to say that. who says crap like that ...... honestly now. especially after never having met the person. sheesh. oh well people can be so strange.  where are reel beet and candy cane >>>>> where in the house are you guys hiding????  music to my ears: no distance left to run - blur (this song use to have a lot of meaning to me a year ago and now listening to it i don't feel the same way anymore. funny how songs do that to you, they remind you of a point of time and place you were at in your life.)

      welcome cheebo. hope you find blogging enjoyable. actually, i don't mind avril levigne that much. i prefer her popularity and media blitz over britney's. as for a band that wants to stay small, i know the white stripes hate their popularity. as stated in an interview with rolling stone. and i really think that they are sincerely uncomfortable with it and wish they were still a small garage rock band in detroit. although you think they are lame for the whole bro/sis or husband/wife thing, darth. but i think that is a statement regarding the degree of privacy in which musicians are allowed. regardless, their music rocks and i wouldn't dismiss them if they choose to lie about their relationship.

      dorkus i used to question the "staying true to your fans" thing, but honestly why do you think these people got into the music industry? I mean hey it would be great for a band you like to stay small and play these little shows where you and some other random people go to see them, but is that really what the bands or artists themselves want? I mean the bands are trying to get their music heard by larger audiences, that is the purpose of making music isn't it? All bands to some degree want to make it big. Trying or wanting to keep them small is in a way preventing them from doing what they want to do. That's my 2 cents on the issue

      hey guys, new to the "team" and new to the whole blog experience.  i hope it will be a joyful and fulfilling one.  anyway, i completely agree with dorkus... even jason mraz got signed (riding the john mayer wave?).  however, i can't seem to tear myself away from the teeny magazine articles, if only to groan about how lame they are.  oh well, the teen targeted media will let the emo thing go in about a month, once the trend is over.  until then, we can only grin and bear the avril levignes of the world... she was on trl today and she bugs the crap out of me, but i can't get her song out of my head!  it's so exasperating.  we also have to realize that the goal of any band is to "spread the music" (r.i.p. kara's flowers).  and if that music is actually good, popularity is a possible inevitability.  the media, in turn, attempts to cover what is popular.  the bottom line is, we can't expect any band that we might like to stay small.  on the other hand, we can't expect them to stay big for long either.

      pigern, yeah it does suck that being "emo" is the new trend. what's up w/ that?...but what can you do...just bc dashboard and saves the day and get up kids are featured in magazines and playing on mtv now doesn't mean i hate them. i still like them, i don't hate them, i just hate the kids attending their shows. all the posers and teenyboppers. look at what happened to phantom planet and maroon 5. before, there weren't that many teens in the audience, and now when you go to one of their shows (which i don't!), you feel old, because the next guy is 15 and 16. it's sad...it's weird bc jason schwartman even said in an article that he was good friends w/ ben kweller and that "you should go and buy ben's album so that you can say you bought his album before he got all big." hello!!! why oh why is he doing this? can't we all just have one band that stays good and true to their fans, and only like you and a couple of your friends know about them? just one?

      ummm new wave you never cease to amaze me, thats about all i can say about that cheerful rant. call me crazy but i actually think some people get married cause they really do love each other and they have kids who to them are seen not as a financial burden but as a joy.....i know it seems odd to you and all, but do some research and you may find that i'm speaking the truth.....i hear my grandparents tell me what it was like raising their families, rarely hearing about their youthful days, so ha......and no one in my family has been shoved into a retirement home   : P    This rant is basically to dispute yours haha, cause i've been told i have to be right.   Knife, I'm really gonna miss TD vardell he was the man in his prime, no one else could run it in the endzone from the 1 yard line like he could...sniff........oh yeah and davis is gone too, i guess thats news.

      okay new wave, so life is depressing. get over it. (i mean this in a nice way.) it's depressing thinking about how life is depressing. i try not to think about it. sure, life isn't fair, and it sucks to work a full time job; that's part of the territory, i guess. i don't want to use the "lemonade" cliche, but it's true......look, i'm not the most optimistic person around, but i try and enjoy what i have while i have it.  (it could always be worse!)  i also think that marriages in general can go both ways, whether or not they are under the eyes of God. Sorry, but just because you are God fearing Christians doesn't mean you have will a better marriage than the next guy. I'm sure it helps to be under the eyes of God, but I don't think it is the determining factor. But what do I know? I'm nowhere near marriage, nor am I a churchgoing Christian. I'll stop before the religion discussion starts...remember when you were younger and you had this ideal age in mind when you wanted to get married? Mine used to be 26. now that i'm just a couple years away from 26, i'm like, "yeah right!!"....i am so not ready for marriage and children. i'm too selfish for this....but you never know.....

      aww you poor saps.  stop worrying so much about marriage.  we're kinda old, but still young enough to not have to worry about it.  well at least i don't.  why?  because you need another person to get married.  haha.  and ya i guess going off of new wave's thing, life is depressing, but i guess you gotta do what you gotta do.  if not then try something new, it may work out and who knows what could happen.  ya i'm just a plethora of stupid quotes, but hey if i think i can, i think i can.  and sorry darth, but TD is now officially retired.... ya i'm talking about touchdown tommy vardell of course, is there any other?  actually i don't know if that's true or not.  i'm lame, peace.

      ok you know ms. wedding planner has something to say about new wave girl's comment on marriage.  true, weddings are final and heavy.  you ARE closing another chapter in your life but at the same time, opening the most important chapter.  i mean, yeah, childhood, teenage life, college, first jobs are all important, but the part of your life you're going to remember is the one that starts after the marriage. your kids, your job, growing old together, making a life together. ok, now i'm rambling. and yes, i too have many opinions on who will get hitched first and others who will never make it to the altar :)

      okay okay, so as darth and new wave have informed me, spongebob is not a sponge for kitchen countertops but the sponge that lives underwater.  but i think the confusion is understandable considering spongebob looks more like the former, not the latter.  and i checked... after an extensive search on google... of the sponges of the canadian reefs.  yes, i have a lot of free time.

      hi.  man, vegas was sooooo fun.  it was so fun drinking and gambling with you guys....oh wait, i didn't go.  at least you guys had fun.  darth you really disappointed me, you didnt yak...what the heck!  anyways, the job search is going great...so far no call backs or potential interviews.  im gonna go back to schoool and kick the assssss of my professors for saying, "dont worry, the job market will pick up soon."  those douche bags, no wonder they teach at csulb.  im not bitter or anything, just shirley like darth.  okay....go angels!  peace out.

      hello. so i am watching my first spongebob squarepants ep and it is so cute. hm... competing with powerpuff girls as one of my favourite cartoons. after the simpsons of course. hey darth, i have noticed that you have become more surly. or darker. hm... disillusioned with life?  how come the other characters in spongebob are animals but spongebob is an inanimate object? cartoons never make sense (i.e. mickey mouse owning pluto but his friend goofy is a talking dog)

      ...so i ask myself why aren't i asleep. funny thing 'cause i've been waiting for my MD player to run outta battery 'cause i want a full charge. i never knew one bar could last so long... yeah i'm a lamer but whatevers. anyways, vegas was fun. highlights of the trip had to be seeing the kahunaville chick (ok so she wasn't THAT hot, my bad) in a black thong, new wave girl nursing a pineapple for 10 hours figuring out whether or not she was buzzin' (a classic), sleepin' with an inflatable, cocktail shrimp and jello, "the bowl", and the shot of Frozen Yuri Dolshinayannakornikova Vodka! Damn, forgot to call Bronger's mom. we must do again.   random thoughts: 1) i'm tired, but want to do so many things, so i guess that means i'm never really asleep... wtf? don't think that made sense. 2) need a new job. freakin' economy give us a break.  3) oh my gosh the md is STILL running down, 2 1/2 hours later...  must sleep now. keep the beatnonstop people. peeeace!

      hey everybody, sorry no posts lately, just been lazy and surly, mostly surly i think. yes new wave you are a poser, but then again everyone is a poser. You just happen to see it a little bit different now.  Look at juwanna man and spiderman for example...haha....see I can make fun of him cause he never posts. Nick, jury duty does suck, but you can always take new wave's advice and just say "I hate everyone" then no one will want you, haha...Never refer to the drink as love potion dorkus, its official name is "the bowl." Vegas was fun, buts it always seems cooler when you win money right nick? haha, 80 bucks from 3, that was cool. next time gonna get like a dozen or two jello shots that will be entertaining. so when are people going to start getting kicked from the house? Man I really need to clean my desk here at work and room at home, i got the car cleaning finished, but it was exhausting, and yet again the lazy and surly factors come into play.

      where is everyone ....... the house feels so empty!!!!!  random thought of the day: I AM A POSER ..... A BIG FAT ONE. my reasons: 1. i use to dislike the dave matthews band a lot for various reasons and now i have two of their cds and really enjoy their stuff 2. i use to think vegas was such a sinful city full of massive evil ..... actually i still do but i'm actually willing to go now more so than before ...... well not at lot but still 3. i use to be such a uptight bitch about drinking in college. i was always the one not part of all the reindeer games and now look ..... i actually drink some stuff, never enough to get buzzed but still you know ......  I AM A POSER .......well at least i admit it >:l  music to my ears: home and dry - pet shop boys

      hey ya'll.  ok, so jury duty REALLY REALLY sucks.  i had to go in again today for jury selection and the lawyers and judge drilled us for hours about whether we can or cannot serve on this specific case.  it was painfully boring.   i'm watching this david blaine special (it's a rerun) and i'm thinking....no way is this guy human.  he's too weird. but dang...he is hot!

      I had a good time in Vegas too.  Yesterday I didn't get home until 1:00 a.m. It seriously sucked...Had lunch at the Stage Deli in the Caesar's Forum Shops, and walked around and stuff...Left around 6 pm, traffic in some areas, stopped for some in-n-out, and more traffic again. I am so freakin' tired! I need toothpicks to open my eyelids like Tom and Jerry.....  Nick, you are right about putting money into slot machines and getting NOTHING back. It is SO not right. I have way better luck at carnival games (yay Spongebob!)  Next time, I'll try a jello shot. (maybe)......or a Love Potion # 9. oh wait, that is a GIRLIE GIRL's DRINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      THANK YOU NICK EDNEY.........  YES NO ONE BLOGS ANYMORE.  if people don't start blogging soon then there will be some ass kicking going on, ha ha okay but seriously no pressure but if anyone wants out of the blog/board just let me know.   now on to vegas ..... good times had by all ...... well at least i hope. i can't speak for everyone but i had a good time. thanks to reel beat, darth bronger, nick edney, and dorkus melorkus and her two sidekicks. i'm pretty sure i was buzzing that one night but i kept telling myself i wasn't ....... i guess it really is mind over matter. ha ha. hey is it just me was it getting HOT in here "so take off all your clothes" ...... ha ha. oh and darth won big (sorry nick) so that was cool as well. side note - it was fun waiting for the the hoppers to show up (which took forever) and fill the slot machines ...... NOT !!!!!!!! i will end on this note: $1.00 jello shots anyone???????  random thoughts of the day: 1. why is everyone shocked that i drink now ..... i guess it is surprising .... eh 2. why do guys just have to slap on a polo shirt and khakis and they are ready for a club but women have to take over hour to get ready and look all nice and wear painful shoes 3. i wish i got paid more at work 4. when will good tv be back on ...... geez 5. people who live in their bubble world are scary >:oI  music to my ears: to wish impossible things - the cure

      no one blogs anymore!  i just got back from a vegas...pretty fun but i swear never to play slots again.  why is it that i always end up sitting at a slot that never pays anything!!!! and then darth and new wave put in seriously 15 cents and win $60.  not fair.  but anyway, had lots of fun. random thought...a big pet peeve of mine is when someone uses my ice cream spoon and doesn't leave the spoon clean.  that grosses me out.

      hmmmm it's been awhile since i'm been home aka the blog page .....  well to catch up on some old stuff ..... people who do "crazy" diets are still lame ... last week i had dinner with my old college roomie who is back in philly now and her boyfriend "the little red headed boy" and we (me and the little red headed boy) were discussing how every woman at our workplace talks about losing weight yet they are still fat so obvious something is not working.  dorkus melorkus - at our office we have a card (usually really corny) that is passed around for some coworker's b-day and most of the time i'm writing "happy b-day so and so. have a good one." i have no idea who these people are ?!!??? oh well. it's almost as great as those lame high school yearbook we would sign with "k.i.t" and "it was nice knowing you in chem. class" and "see you next year". ha ha cracks me up.   my highest at blowing so far is 174 or something like that. not that great ..... eh.  random thought of the day: if supposely you become cynical as time goes on .... meaning you realize a lot of the dreams and hopes you have as a young person say 21 till 30 will vanish as time progresses because reality sets in ..... what happens to those who already are way too cynical at age 21 and on .... do they become even more cynical ..... is that even possible .... i'm just wondering .......  music to my ears: homesick - vines

      People at jury duty are so ghetto.  Actually they're just retarded.  This fob girl next to me kept asking me to use my pencil and then after the jury staff was done explaining the whole jury procedure, the fob girl asked me, "can we leave now?"  freakin idiot. of course you can't leave. what's the point of the whole juror thing then??????  stupid fob.

      Hey everyone....quick note last night I bowled a 243 and a 249 all new highs for me, i'm sure you are so happy for me....anyway today's rant is concerning office courtesy. If you see someone goofing off for a minute, or talking to someone do you run and tell their boss immediatly? I hope not but there are some sad sad people in our office, who spend all their time looking out for what everyone else is doing and not bothering to concetrate on their own work.....I just had a cool meeting with my supervisor who had been told by someone that they didn't think me and my two co-workers were working, when in reality I'm way caught up on my work and searching for crap to do....my boss even said "Sh*t man, why can't people stay out of each other's business, its dumb" Now we all have to be on our very best behavior, some office people have way too much free time on their hands. Its also amazing that those who we suspect of being super nosey are always behind and having to get others help with their work, think there is some sort of corelation with their lack of work and nit-picking everyone else's activities? hmmmm.........

      hey everyone.  just got home from work...hmm that's really all i have to say about that hehe.  anyway, i was just thinking about my friends here.  for some reason i got appointed to plan our outings this year.  last year it was my friend melissa cuz she was all itchin to go out ( i think she didn't get to go out or party enough when she was in undergrad and she's trying to live it up now....) but how did I become this person who has to plan everything?  And it's not like there's anything I really wanna do out here.  I don't like the club scene all that much.  I need to go out dancing like once a month but that's it.  I can only take so much of annoying girls who are deprived of attention so they dress like hoochies and get drunk.  So I go once a month and get my dance on, but that's all i need.  I think I'm getting old.  I just wanna stay home and sleep haha or go to a movie and go eat dinner.  the red head started school at UCR today...he says he hates it....HATES IT...he sed it's like twice as big as it was last year so it's all crowded and he sed the ppl there are annoying...big surprise huh?  hehe. i feel so bad for him....onnneee more year.   i learned a new expression today.  my coworked sed it's from detroit.  They say "kick rocks" which means "get out of my face" and I suppose it all really boils down to "F*** off!" hehe.  So I've been saying it all day today.  It sounds so juvenile...like "i'm rubber you're glue!" type language.   Ok i'm gonna lay down cuz I'm tired and lazy.  :)    Winamp is spitting out   : Gin Blossoms "I found out about youuuuuuuuu"

      hiya mates. new wave, i'm not sick of blogging because i enjoy reading what other people have written but sometimes i'm too spacey to think of anything of my own to blog. so i guess that's a sort of iffy response since if everyone felt the same way, no one would have anything to read since no one would blog. did that rant make sense? i wonder who came up with the word "blog" and "blogger." strange. i came across the word "pulchritude" the other day and thought it was strange it meant "beauty." doesn't that sound weird? the word itself sounds so harsh.  ...erm, anyway, to darth's inquiry, i think for myself it varies in each situation. if it will clearly hurt your standing to back them up and their mistake was really carelessness then i would be less obliged to take some of the responsibility. it's difficult because you are their friend but at the same time, you are in a professional environment and have to think of your own interests. i would probably try to help them as much as possible without seriously jeopardizing myself. have to be a bit selfish in this situation.

       Currently listening to:    Guns N' Roses - November Rain   Hey did anyone other than darth and I see the Celebrity Stunt Challenge thing on Monday?  Man that was awesome, just because of our good old buddy Dennis Rodman.  If you didn't hear about it his stunt was to drive off a cliff and be pulled out by a chord.  So that was done and he was pulled out successfully, and the momentum pulled him outward so he was stoked and screaming oh ya!  hell ya!  oh ya!.........OH SHIT!!!  So after he was pulled outward he came swinging back into the side of the cliff and hit his face against the wall, he was wearing a helmet, but for some odd reason he wasn't yelling anymore.  Pretty funny stuff, I think I heard the announcer say he was knocked out.  Haha.  Oh well.  In other basketball related news.  I saw Shaq O' Neal at a bar yesterday.  He's not as big as I thought he would be.  I didn't go up to him or anything even though it was a small bar, but I think he had enough drunken idiots around him on his tip anyways.  Must suck to go somewhere and not be able to just chill out.  But then again must not suck to make tons of money playing basketball.  Alright peace.

      well i guess it's time for a post.  :)  yes I was out of town.  i've been checking in randomly to read, but I've been too lazy/busy or nothing to talk about to post.  the red head was in town last week.  we went to NY and saw most of the tourist stuff.  empire, ground zero, liberty/ellis island, mad sq garden, rockefeller, timesquare....all in one day.  we took the cheapo chinatown bus for 10 dollars round trip--very good deal.  and then we had dinner in brooklyn.  the bus was suposed to leave at 11pm for philly....we got to smelly old chinatown(the part of town where they have the fish markets) around 1045....11 comes around and no bus driver...there was a bus...just no driver.  the redhead called the place and they said there was no bus going to philly at 11.......so as the redhead got more and more red in the face, my friend's dad picked us up(she's from queens) and took us to the greyhound station...BUT the next bus was leaving at 230(it was 12am) meaning we would get home at 430.  SOOOOO we ended up crashing at my friends place in Queens.  The redhead was not happy at all.  So that sucked, but everything else about the week was great.  I did slack off for the rest of the week and I spent this weekend catching up.  let's see...i don't know anything about the greek wedding, but i was interested in watching it---but speaking of Joe Fatone---he's in RENT on broadway now playing Mark.  I didn't think he'd have the voice for it...but I listened to an old Nsync song and he has the right vocal range i suppose.  It would be interesting to see his performance....but I think the next time I'll be in NY is to see "into the woods."  I don't know anyone who would wanna go to NY w/ me to see it.  My co-worker has seen it 5 times(one more than me) so mayyybe...but I doubt it.    three questions: dang these are hard to think of maaaan---no thinking!!! 1. dancing for janet of course, a hospital as a dr. duh, and a housewife with no kids so i can be lazy alll day :)_ 2. RENT soundtrack, DMB *crash* or *under the table and dreaming*, john mayer *room for squares* 3. in the philippines at this church my parents were married, in hawaii overlooking the ocean, ahhh i can't think of a 3rd one...i'm trying to think of a place that i think is totally beautiful, like a building that's really pretty--but i can't think of any :-\  ok....so i'm guessing you guys are on ur camping trip now....hope it went well, where'd u guys go?  SEASON PREMIERE of FRIENDS! this week yay! AND AND, they put scrubs on Thursdays!  see how little a life I have here in Philly hehe.  I have to tape it tho cuz I'm volunteering at the Chinatown clinic from 6-8 but it usually runs until 9.  Well that's all the rambling I have for now.  So, New Wave...I'm back in town! :)

      Hey everyone, been a while since i posted so let me look back and see what everyone has been talking aboot...Lets see, mac whats in my 8 track right now. (i do have an 8 track if anyone wants it by the way) i've been listening to some elliot smith, and dave matthews a lot lately and some doors but those are all older people so i can't really say its "new music." Due to my super cool computer I really can't dl anything right now so i haven't been finding any new music of late, another sad thing in my super sad life, haha....don't worry looking into getting a new computer, probably a dell, anyone have any suggestions for me? looking forward to the camping trip to a certain extent this weekend but i'm sure it will not be a smooth trip and some stupid thing will cause tension during the trip, my goal is still to wander off and get lost. Today is my day off and how did i spend it you ask? Taking my car up to get serviced which i found out will cost about 500 dollars, super sweet i know...moving on i haven't seen nor do i care to see the greek wedding and i know i won't watch the crappy cbs show they are now making. Its a simple story how it got so big is mind boggling. answers to the 3 questions new wave: capitol hill, dodger front office, ESPN, cds: nevermind, unplugged in NY, DM101, wedding: vegas, beach, nice church somewhere. Here is another question for you all: how do you deal with someone who is both a friend and a coworker, in that i mean if they mess up at work are you in any way obliged to have their back or do you completely forget about them? just curious to how others view this dilemna. okay word up

I MEAN BESIDES THE CURE WHO I TRULY AND DEEPLY LOVE .... moving on ..... to name a few - doves (can't wait for their show), ladytron (they are pretty good, not great but good), interpol (like joy division but not), unwritten law (i love the black album), and mum (mind blowing).  yea so those are my picks but i hardly doubt any of you will dl this stuff. so moving on .......  random thought of the day: work still sucks   music to my ears : cailin - unwritten law ... actually holiday as well

      hiya mates. okay, i really don't comprehend the success of my big fat greek wedding. i viewed the film on my flight from europe and was eager to view it because 1) it is an independent film; 2) focusing on a largely ignored minority; and 3) features a presumably strong female protagonist. but i found the film unappealing (besides its trite, predictable story line) because the humor was very sitcom and made the characters caricatures, not actual people the audience could relate to (especially the father and his windex). most of the humor actually, like the story line, was trite. such as the title character's brother convincing her fiance to say something embarassing in greek. how many times has that been done? and the relationship between the woman and her love was very rushed and underdeveloped. they love each other to the extent that he becomes greek orthodox? but at least this film became the sleeper hit and not some nonsensical film such as crossroads or something. sorry if this blog turned into a movie review. but i really don't understand why so many people find this film so incredibly appealing and charming. and i really really tried to like it. if anything, i think it has the potential to be a sitcom and fittingly enough, it will become a mid-season show for cbs. as for mac's query, ah man, no m.c. hammer? darn. erm... i just picked up division of laura lee and it's true- the best music is coming out of sweden.

      guaranteed juwanna won't get bit by anything on the camping trip.  haha jk baby you know i "heart" you.  hey music people, matt skiba from alkaline trio has a split release with kevin seconds from 7 seconds.  l really like alkaline trio, so maybe you won't like it, but most of alkaline's stuff is really bitter and thought out.  i'm rambling out of order, but no matter.  the matt skiba songs are all acoustic so it might be worth it to check it out, i haven't heard songs from kevin seconds though.  just go download it.  so here's a question for everyone.  well minus new wave because we all know she loves the cure and darth because we all know he loves dashboard confessional.  haha just kidding.  but here's the question who is your favorite band from the recent years? no nirvana, no cure, no m.c. hammer., but the newer bands.  i just want input, because i want to see what's playing on your 8 tracks.  alright, well go check out the alkaline trio, that's my pick.

      i edited this because the other one was too violent with rage .......... ha ha  pardon my french here ........... THIS IS FUCKING LUDICROUS !!!!!!!!!!!! i just found out that other people here at work get paid more than my coworker and i. i know know darth has it just as bad as us but i mean it make me question ....... why did i go get my stupid degree huh. what is is all for. i mean there are people out there who get more money than us who never went to college and most likely barely made it through high school and they are getting how much. i know i know you could say "well new wave girl look at the long run ....... you will get more in the long run and blah blah blah" but for the time being i think my coworker and i deserve our self worth. this is stupid. this is why movies that make it seem like the ugly people will win against the evil cruel world are so very very wrong. the reality of it is looks get you to the top  ...... so i will conclude with FUCK THIS SHIT .......... EVERYONE WITH ME RAISE A MIDDLE FINGER IN THE AIR AND SCREAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   please note: i will calm down after all this madness but for now this is nice :P

      a band post-1995 can't really be as influential as say, the beatles, though because they are probably still establishing themselves as artists and the new musicians are still growing up... when these younger musicians in the mid 2000s are giving interviews and talking about what music they grew up with then maybe they will cite a group like sigor ros. 1995 was only seven years ago. it's usually difficult to reach a high level of influence in such a short amount of time. i can only think of nirvana maybe who accomplished that feat. as for song meaning, mtv did a post-9/11 special about predictions that musicians would become more serious and write songs with deeper meaning but that didn't really happen. musicians claim they are trying to lighten up the mood, etc. but i wish there were the bob dylans of our time who would make the youth think about what the politicians and world leaders are doing or even what is happening to them locally. not that musicians must bear that responsibility but they should recognize their influence.

      so i was talking to new wave about the state of music.  i think that's what most of our conversations revolve around, but it's cool.  anyways getting back to my point, the state of music pretty much sucks ass.  i really can't think of an influential band since 1995.  i would say that Pearl Jam has pretty much influenced, in a bad way, the likes of Creed and other bands that sound like Eddie Vedder, but they are old.  then there's that whole rap/rock crap that's out there but they all sound different right?  yeaaaaaah.....  whatever happened to the good old bands that actually had talent, and not some gimmick?  even good ol rap music sucks now, everyone ranting and raving about their bling bling, ho's, cars and what not.  all the beats are taken from old songs and remixed, no one is original anymore, Ja Rule, Mystikal, P-Diddy can all take a backseat to Sir Mix A Lot, Paperboy, Vanilla Ice....errr maybe not them, but seriously EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy, etc.... put them to shame.  but alas i find hope in band of the yester-years of my life, for example Milli Vanilli, now there's a band that was influential.  they influenced all the new "pop" stars out there.  who else could lip sync better than Rob and Fad?  you may say oh well there's Britney Spears, but come on now, she was obviously influenced by Milli Vanilli.  haha okay i'm really lame and i know it, but regardless the state of music sucks, whatever your genre.  any comments?

      yeah when new wave starts flashing back we are all in trouble, its best to stay clear.....did motown philly make you want to find 3 friends and wear matching sport coats and jeans with hats on and dance around? I know it always does for me. Yes pigern job searches are depressing, hence they are a search, the best idea is to first apply where you'd really like to work, then where you wouldn't mind working, followed by anywhere that is hiring......sorry you spent yesterday watching that show you could have turned it off if you had wanted to......yes new wave there are no good bands of recent times, many groups are good like the ones you mentioned but the problem is that they are inspirational not influencial......like others may here them and appreciate the music but it does not impact the music of today, its in its own category.....sigur ros is a good band, and i'm sure they are appreciated, but you don't find a lot of people who say that they were totally influenced by them.....With commercial appeal being one of the leading factors to what many consider to be "influencial" there doesn't seem to be an abundance of good artist to come out in recent times. If you look back to the 50-80s you can see defining musical styles of the time, mainly because of the social atmosphere of the time, if you look at what many of the bands today are singing about is it really worthy of being influencial on another person? Which goes back to my song meaning vs. song sound rant, which i will go on another time........thanks and goodnight

      oh no, new wave is getting junior high flashbacks. bad. hee hee. my answer to your query is idlewild, who are a solid band although i can't think of whether they influenced anyone. darn, i can't think of anyone else. i'll have to work on that one. anyway, the job search is getting depressing. i'm considering pathetic positions like post office worker and receptionist. hmm... maybe a career in the lucrative world of bartending. free drinks to boot. starbucks is having a job fair at ten of their locations! mmm... caffe lattes anyone? hee hee, nick thinks i'm addicted to coffee right? i don't have a song of the day but i watched all five hours of pride and prejudice (BBC) today so that would be my movie of the day. love the movie and the book.

      OH YEA FRIDAY THE 13TH ....... SWEET DEAL :)  i had this interesting chat with my coworker yesterday and i asked him to name me one really truly good band, you know the types that influence other bands to do what they do, that has come out since 1995 ........ keep in mind they started their career in 1995 or at least making music and the likes, not they got big or whatevers in 1995 ....... we were both drawing blanks ...... i'm sorry but all the good stuff happened in 1979 aka the creation of the Cure ... ha ha okay but seriously people can anyone mention a band ...... here are a few for me:   travis  - never really reached commerical success in the US  sigur ros  - see above  doves  - see above and they are under the radar  mum  - see above   belle and sebastian  - see above  sleater kinney  - actually here is a group that could influence other bands to be something ........  saves the day  - band members changed too many times so not really original anymore and they are too "indie" to get big but hey look at dashboard confessional  and i'm sure there are others but i have work tomorrow so i need sleep, why the heck am i even awake still. man i'm strange  music to my ears: motownphilly - boyz II men (i heard that on 92.3 today and got major flashbacks ...... i love that song)

      Sept. 11 was probably one of the longest days of my life. When "Sept. 11" happened, I was working at a out of town trade show at the San Diego Convention center. That morning as I was leaving for work, I heard something about a plane crash but didn't pay much attention. Slowly, the news trickled in, and we were able to bring a radio to connect to the outside world. Soon, we were flooded with calls from exhibitors who wouldn't be able to attend the trade show. We had a lot of people back out of the trade show that day because they couldn't travel (a lot of them were coming in from the East Coast). There was no way it would be canceled although all everyone wanted to do was go home and be with their families. My co-workers and I were stuck in the convention center in downtown San Diego, near numerous naval bases, and everyone was scared that something was going to happen. One coworker was friends with someone in a nearby military base, and it was confirmed that the convention center was on the list as a potential target. That was pretty scary. I went back to my hotel and could not escape the images on the television. It was too disturbing for me...It was scary being alone that night, away from family and friends.  The next day, we received a bomb threat at the convention center, and had to evacuate. We were stationed near the marina, and waited there for probably 20 minutes until they told us we could go back in. Some people didn't, some people did. I did go back in. A lot of us were pretty shaken. All I wanted to do was go home and get away from all this. A couple days later, I was able to go home. That surely was the longest week of my life (does time pass a lot slower in San Diego or what?).  I will be going back to the San Diego Conv Center next week, and I will never forget what happened there last..

      exactly...the year has definitely flown by.  Listening to all these radio call-ins this morning was hard.  A lady from New York talked about how, like any other work day, she was supposed to get off the subway near the north tower at the time one of the planes hit.  but  of all days, on 9/11, she didn't.  i only caught the end of her story so i don't exactly know what caused her to miss it.  but she was definitely blessed.  and it was hard to listen to her say she felt guilty for being one of the fortunate ones... anyway, i remember it just like most of you guys...getting woken up by my mom, telling me to turn on the tv.  when i first saw it, i thought, oh, a fire or something.  but when i found out what had really happened, i was so taken back.  i could not believe that people in this world could actually be this coldhearted and evil.  i listened on the radio the whole way to work not even thinking that the office would be closed for the day.  so i sat in the office for a couple hours with people who had come into work as well.  When i heard that downtown LA was under heightened alert, i kept calling my mom (who works there) to leave and go home, but her office wasn't closing down for the day.  i can't tell you how nervous i was for her.  and  i can't even imagine what it could have possibly been like to be a new yorker that day....

      can't believe it has been one year ........ so strange. i just remember driving to work and hearing about it on the radio and thinking it had to be a joke. it just didn't seem real .... i kept waiting for someone to say this was some sick joke ...... even worst my sis was 3000 miles away in boston so i was worried about her well being. i was wondering if they were going to do anything over in the LA area. watching the news that night was so very very very hard ...... but a year later i feel some what not attached to the whole thing. i guess because over in Calif. we are 3000 miles away and we just don't feel as connected as people in NY and the east do ...............  all the heroes that day will be remembered ........

      last year on september 11, I went with a couple of my friends to the library to study for our Immunology exam.  It was about 11am.  Then my friend went to go check out a book and walked into our study room and said "you will not believe what just happened!" and that's how we found out.  We all went to my apartment, cuz they closed down the library and just watched TV. I couldn't think all day.  and we all bombed the immuno test.  it was a surreal day.  reading the newspaper today gave me chills.....

      hiddley hoodley neighboreinos...... not exactly how to spell that so you can pretty much figure it yourself....AT&T has been fine for me, everyonce in a while i get an echo, but it doesn't bother me that much....since T-mobile is somewhat new i'd be a little suspicious of it just because you want to see how it turns out. Good to hear the red headed one will be heading eastside to visit you, he should be happy its football season and hockey season is around the corner. hope you enjoy your trip up to NY.......on a serious note, we are now on high alert for a terrorist act which makes me at least a little aprehensive...Its hard to believe that it has already been a year. Random thought I remember last year getting awakened by my mom telling me to turn on the TV to watch what was going on and then almost having a heartache after I did. It was weird for me having been in both places (DC and NY) just earlier that year, and super nerve reckoning knowing that my former place of employment was a target. I guess that made it a little extra hard for me....okay thats all.  .........And the Band Played On

      hmm well AT&T has been good to me the past year.  Maybe it's just good in Philly *shrugs* but when I went home it worked fine for me.  oh and when i do hear that echo i just hang up and all back hehe...but it doesn't happen very often.  i'm supposed to be "studying" right now.  I have 2 more lectures to go...i might as well get over it.  bleh.  I can't wait until tomorrow afternoon...no academic thinking for a good week hehe.  The RedHead(my bf) is coming this Thursday and I'm super excited.  We're going to NY and Six flags in Jersey.  Plus we're gonna eat alot of meat haha.  We're going to this really pricey steakhouse, gonna eat cheese steaks and I'm making him shortribs...oh and these sausages he likes.  We'll be fat but happy hehe.  Sux tho cuz my friend, we'll call him Banana, who's supposed to be driving us around is going home to Irvine cuz his grandma fractured her hip.  I feel bad for him and his grandma but it kinda puts a damper on things.  Plus there was supposed to be 4 of us going to NY on Saturday, me, RedHead, Banana and this other girl, we'll call her May.  So now I feel like May will feel like a 3rd wheel and I don't want that.  :(  *shrugs* I'm sure it will all work out.  haha like any of you guys care :P but that's what this is for right? to rant and ramble. :)    random thought of the day.....can i just quit school and become a drug dealer? the kids don't need doctors, they just need some really good drugs. haha

      hey guys and gals.  sorry i haven't blogged either.  but i've been reading almost daily (just not posting:))  i've heard pretty good things about t-mobile.  i have AT&T right now and personally, i think it sucks.  at least in my area.  50% of my phone calls i can hear my own echo and it's like 3 people are in the conversation instead of 2.  sooo annoying!  and i don't get signal in as many places as i used to...i'm thinking about switching too and i'm leaning towards t-mobile. the weekend was excellent...went fishing with darth.  had lots of fun even though we didn't catch anything.  not even a bite.  next time, we're trying fishing off the pier.  if anyone is interested in going fishing...i'm totally down for it

      hello all. sorry i haven't blogged in a bit -- don't kick me off new wave (oh one with all the power).  hedwig, i have not heard good or bad on T-mobile or AT&T although those are the two i'm considering switching over to. btw, have you seen 'hedwig and the angry inch'? just thinking of it since they have similar names. i have been so bored i've been watching the sorority life marathon on mtv. it was playing on saturday and now they are playing back to back episodes today. i guess mtv has limited manpower to operate their switchboard so they just stick to one program to make it easier on themselves. if i was a sorority girl in the house, i would be really embarassed because mtv commercials poke fun at their obvious shallowness and idiocy. but if i have enough time to watch the show i guess i should be the one who hangs my head in shame. i haven't caught any of the ads for the new season programming but it all sounds pretty disappointing. ooh, but i'm looking forward to a new season of trading spaces and the spinoff while you were out. yay. i love home makeover shows.

      yes john doe does look semi good....it kinda reminds me of the pretender tho...but a lil bit cooler.  did you guys see the previews for that good morning miami show and the in laws....i think both will be booted w/ in the first 2 months hehe.  i wonder if the MD drama that's gonna be on ABC is gonna last...i haven't seen any previews for it but i remember one is coming out.  anyone heard anything bad about T mobile?  I'm thinking about switching cuz they have a really good plan for the price I'm playing at AT&T but I really like ATT service...so I dunno what to do.  T mobile is relatively new and I think for some reason the networks are diff in CA and PA....cuz here it's on a voicestream service and there it's cingular...*shrugs* any advice is welcome :)

      first off i would like to welcome hedwig potter to the house, so happy you have joined us ........ how did that article on prempro study go. ha ha. don't worry hedwig nobody really blogs here all the time, i have to get on their backs about it. they all suck donkey balls, ha ha.   my american idol wrap up - i'm really glad kelly c. won. i have no idea why but i actually want to hear her song on the radio, i usually hate this stuff but honestly this girl has talent and deserves to be shown off. i mean look at all the no talent out there that gets the same attention ..... as for justin i think he was a good sport about the whole thing and he WILL STILL do well ....... and yes the british guy (the pop idol who won over there, not simon who i really like) was terrible, how did he win over there, go figure ..... why did they drag the last ep out for two hours, i guess they were milking it for all it was worth ....... i hate the two host, they are terrible, i'm just waiting to see ryan starr become a porn star ha ha .......  well now that american idol is over there really is nothing to watch on tv. oh well i'll just wait for the season to start, there are some good shows darth but yea you are right ........ most of them will get cancelled right away but i mean there is a new season of 24 - this is for hedwig, keifter sutherland comes back for another 24 hours and they don't bring back his wife cause she died in the last one so he gets a new love interest but the daughter is still in it ....... and john doe looks pretty good as well.  amelie is a great movie. i just like the way the movie was done ...... visually stunning you know ........  random thought of the day: i can't believe it has been one year since sept. 11 ....... it makes you think of all the things that have changed and some the things that haven't ........

      yeah I watched AI last night.  For some reason I think Seacrest will get the job again...i think because he is annoying.  I don't think Brian Dunkleman is all that bad, at least he doesn't look very happy doing his job hehe and that says something about him hehe.  Ryan just looks like a dumbass smiling and talking out of his ass.  I thought the performances were good last night tho.  Dang I can't believe they're gonna hve the final 30(!) tour.  Some of those 30 really sucked...hell ppl on the top 10 sucked.  hmmm i had wanted to talk about something else besides this when I went on the blog page...hmmm how fragile short term memory is hehe.  anyway to darth's question: i will be looking forward to the last season of FRIENDS, W&G, and Scrubs...all on the same night which is awesome.  mmm other than that....i doubt I'll watch anything else.  I wanna see the season premiere of Frasier.  I want to watch last season of 24 or at least the pilot ep...just to see what all the hype was about.  Each ep was an hour of the 24 hours he had to find his daughter or somethign right?  Did he find his daughter?  What the hell are they gonna do for next season?  Just wondering if anyone watched it.  has anyone seen Amelie?  it's good..the soundtrack is good too. :)  quote of the day: "my spoon is too big.................my spOOn is too big!.............my spoon is too BIG!.............IIIII AAM A BANANA!"----anyone seen spike and mike's?  hehe~~REJECTED

      hey everyone, welcome to the house hedwig.....i watched the finale of american idol, or the last 10 minutes of it, which was all anyone really had to see...ryan and brian (aka gay and gayer) were totally unbearable and are easily the worst part of an already bad show. Its almost new tv season, so what are you guys looking forward to watching? Are there any new shows that actually look appealing to anyone out there? I don't think I've seen anything on any of the networks that looks super entertaining, other than the same shows I already watch.....lets see how many get canceled within a month this time...NFL season starts today!!!! GO BRONCOS. This has been a very tiring three day work week for me, haha, j/k.

      hello everyone. who watched american idol... and was completely annoyed? first of all, fox had the audacity to make a show that could have easily been a half hour two hours long. then use fillers like ford focus plugs and coca cola moments. argh. i think kelly deserved to win but i think it was awful that they made her sing right after the announcement. she's not a robot. it was a very emotional moment for her and she had to sing through her tears. that is ridiculous. i probably won't watch much of the sequel since i was so bugged by this one. but if i happen to come across it, i hope hope hope that ryan seacrest and brian dunkleman are NOT the cohosts. they were the worst worst part of the show. hardly "comedians." note the quotations.

      OHHHHHH and yes Kelly should win...Justin doesn't have a chance.  All the TV stations here are like "go justin" just cuz he's from Doylestown PA...so gay.  And for whoever watched it tonight........how lame was the british guy? Ok goodnight everyone

      GREETINGS!  New to this blog site...sorry I can't grace you with my random ramblings tonight.  I have to evaluate this article on that Prempro study.....snooore.  Well the study itself is interesting, I just don't wanna evaluate this article.  It's busy work, remedial boring.........Anyway, hope everyone's doing well.  I'll ramble more later.

           HAPPY HALLOWEEN       to everyone in the house. i hope you guys all get A LOT of candy and get really sick ...... be safe and have fun tonight :P  hey hedwig, bummer about living above a bar with all that noise. that must super suck. love your idea about being a gryffindor quidditch player ... i totally agree with you, halloween sure loses its meaning as you get older. actually i think everything loses its meaning as you get older .... damn how depressing.   can i really get some beer from you mac. if you have new castle can you hook it up. that stuff is sweet ..... as for celebrities i would like to be friends with i would have to say no one really. i mean the only people i would die to meet are the members of THE CURE aka THE GREATEST BAND ON THE PLANET (sigh) i love them so much. but see i would only want to meet them, not be their friends.    music to my ears:  ALL CURE TODAY :)

      for those of you who don't know, i live above a bar.  they just opened a club/lounge thing on the second floor.  it is now 1:22 am and music is bumping loud and i need to sleep.  it blows.  you'd think they'd put some kind of insulation/noise protection or sOMETHING!  :(  I guess this is what I get for cheap rent.  Halloween hasn't felt like halloween in a long time....oh well HAPPY HALLOWEEN everyone!

      i can't think of celebrities i wanna meet/hang out w/.....but what does everyone think of the winona ryder trial?  you think she's guilty?  if she is she has major mental issues.  they sed that she was preparing for a role...and that she had spent 3k in there earlier that day and that they had her credit card still.  so it doesn't make any sense.  and does anyone know the reason why the snipers did what they did besides the fact that they're psycho maniacs?  I would look all this up but I'm lazy and well, I don't have time.  just things that have been on my mind.  i think i'll go to bed now.  so what does everyone want to be for halloween?  I want to be a Gryffindor Quidditch player....that would be awesome! R.I.P. to Richard Harris...wish he could have finished the movies...poor guy.

      Hey everyone its new music tuesday go pick up the nirvana album, its really good. I was driving with my two co-workers today, coming back from Best Buy today and we see all the happy go lucky angel fans all sporting their red shirts/hats/flags etc, anyway we see a group of them have the camcorders out and are filming the banners in the sky and the stadium. As I drive by they both roll down their windows and yell "GO DODGERS!!!" the look on these poor peoples faces was priceless. They were utterly shocked......I would like to be friends with ed norton just cause he seems cool. I would also think that gwen would be a cool friend. Natalie of course would be more than just a friend. okay thats all for now....and i agree with dorkus, new wave your halloween costume probably wouldn't fly over at work, but nice try, trying to dress in your normal attire.

      OH MY GOODNESS ..... jackass: the movie was some funny shit ... hence my gleeful imood. ha ha. that smiley face with stuff around it is the closest thing that comes to laughing out loud .... (wipe the tears from my eyes) ... good times ...  hey mac just curious and i know you don't care and are not going to elaborate but your year can't be that crappy, i know i don't live your life but i think all of us in the house have had a pretty fu**ed moment at some point this year. for me this year has been alright ... last year was the shit that blew up all over my face, but i'll save that story for another day.   anyways you are not lucky enough to get up every morning for an hour communte while the sun is rising and get your boss riding your back to finish work and then drive home tired and worn in the dark just to have to go to that place again .... ha ha ... seriously though i don't hate work ... that much.  hey nick and juwanna are you guys going to set up your imood. if not i'm going to just take your names off the list.   music to my ears:  untitled - interpol

      New Wave, no that's not the only thing that's been shit this year, but I care not to elaborate anymore on my crap year so far.  Anyways Darth you will have a good time, but I want Chris Pontius (Party Boy) to get the supporting actor, because he deserves it, you'll see why.

      hey everyone....trip to laughlin was cool, won money, went bowling, met louie anderson, does it get better than that? way to go angels. props to juwanna for sticking with them for many years, now you just have to wait for the clippers and lions to win and you are all set!!!!! Sorry I missed your party hedwig and sorry you are back in philly, but you'll be back relatively soon. i agree with nick, nice "white" weddings are the way to go,....j/k.....to each their own. flat tires on the freeway are great, i had one of those freeway guys with the tow trucks help me out, which was nice. gonna go watch jackass now, i heard good things. I'm hoping steve-o gets best supporting actor at the academy awards, i'm sure he deserves it.

      yay. the angels game was awesome. :o) i think all of the collective thinking worked. hah hah. what's the ted bundy movie? is that about the serial killer? i partly agree with you nick re: chinese weddings. i wouldn't want everyone banging their chopsticks on their tea cups... so embarassing. no karoke at my family's weddings though... but i wouldn't really want a wedding ceremony anyway. i'd rather elope. so i'm not really against chinese weddings per se but against the spectacle of weddings in general. thanks for inviting me to your bday dinner hedwig. i think i'm getting really fuddy-duddy. can't even stay up late anymore. sigh.

      wait mac the "year totally fucking sucks" because you got a flat tire ......... i hope that is not the only reason. having a flat tire is no biggie. ask darth bronger and pigern how many times i got that along with locking my keys in the car. ha ha.  wait nick and juwanna you guys didn't have some hanky panky the whole day for your anniversary ....... yea i'm sure you guys were watching the "ted bundy" movie (wink wink) is that what you crazy kids are calling it now .......... ha ha this is what you get for saying that stuff about chinese weddings. and for the record the ones i go to don't have singing because the singing is the worst ever, so cheese ball and tacky. blech.    music to my ears:  nothing but this crap on 94.3

      yea!  hats off to the angels...especially for game 6 :) the weekend was pretty fun.  juwanna and i watched 'Ted Bundy' for our anniversary. ha ha.  not the most romantic of dates :)  don't watch that movie...it sucks.  went to a typical chinese wedding on saturday and threatened juwanna that if we ever get married and have a chinese wedding, i will break up with him before it even happens.  that's right, new wave, nothing chinese whatsoever.  ha ha.  those weddings are so boring...you just sit there and watch other people get up and sing chinese songs.  BORING.   anyone that hasn't seen jackass (or wants to see it again), wanna see it with me?  i'm probably going this weekend.

      Angels are the 2002 World Series winners.......:) !!!!!!!!!!!!  sorry we left your b-day thing so early hedwig but pigern (yea that is my sis) and i were tired, 8 hour work days can really beat you up. it was really fun and i wish i had a chance to talk to you and the red headed boy more :( sorry to hear you have to go back so soon to philly but thanksgiving will be here in no time.  man going to clubs in LA is such a high school thing. i can see why people in high school seemed to enjoy it there. i.e. dublins was lame ....... the dj there sucked so bad, the  music selection was predictable and where was the mixing, it was like he was ending one song and was just going to the next, hello where is the transition people ....... man it blew. and the people there looked all old and haggard and aged from all that clubbing and dancing and drinking ..... ha ha   but wait i'm being judgemental again aren't i ... oh shoot. okay okay i'll play nice .... i'm sure not all those people were like that and i'm sure there were some really nice people there as well .... see i'm trying to be better .... oh fuck it who am i kidding, those people are lame and LA clubs are not my scene ... on a side note i hope some of you got to catch Chris C. from dashboard confessional on MTV 2 120 minutes ..... hee hee  i still need to go see jackass :( ....... darn it  any one dressing up for halloween this year? i was thinking of going as a die hard Cure fan ..... i love them ever so much.  oct. 29 is new release day and man good stuff is coming out ------> tori amos, sigur ros and of course nirvana. everyone should pick up those cds, especially sigur ros, they are amazing.    music to my ears:  dreaming - blondie ..... i have a secret crush on debbie harry :)

      that angel's game was awesome...and this coming from a person who doesn't even really like baseball.  i had a family party while it was on and all the guys; my cousins, uncles and the red-head(only white person in the house btw haha) were all up on the TV...I was talking to my friend that came to see me but half watching the game.  I watched the first 6 innings and thought "oh well, that sux" hehe..but then all of a sudden they got some runs.  It was just cool to hear ppl cheering in my house all loud...hehe and the red head yelling out "yes!!!!" like 4 times and pumping his fists.  :P  I'm gonna watch tonight b4 my flight.  I hope it will be over by 8...just cuz my flight is at 920..and I'd have to leave by then.  Ontario airport is sooooooooo much better than LAX....no traffic.  Just get off and go...i love it.  totally worth the extra 50-70 bucks.    So I'm off to Philly again.  I have a 2 hour layover in Vegas.  I'm gonna play another 5 bucks on the quarter slots in hopes of winning me some laundry money haha.  I jacked all my mom's quarters for my laundry.  Surprisingly she had a lot...I think I can bust 2 loads w/ the quarters I have now!  To Slut and New Wave and New Wave's sister, I'm pretty sure you're on this blog but I still haven't figured out which one you are....I am actually guessing Pigern...am I correct?  Anyway, thanks for coming out to my bday thingie.  Sorry Slut I didn't know you were leaving too or else I woulda sed good bye when I sed it to New Wave.  I hope you guys had fun...that long island iced tea tore me up.  Anyway, time to go pack now.  I had a great week...dont...want...to go.....back! :(  random thought: I want a lap top.

      pigern, i know exactly what you're talking about. that's why you wear tall shoes to concerts. i always wear my platform maryjanes (if i plan on standing).....otherwise, if it's at the troubadour, i just sit up at top. don't have to worry about tall people standing in front of you.

      Hey everyone, sorry pigern haven't seen that commercial but i'll look for it. I'm sick right now which pretty much sucks, hence my mood is on yucky. Since I have an eventful weekend in laughlin coming up I would very much like to get better......like now so any suggestions of what to do other than drink a lot of fluids and rest (slut of the world and hedwig i'm looking your guys way since you are gonna be doctors soon). I've counted angel flags out my window today and the count is at 23, they are going faster than a j lo marriage. Hope they win tonight. yes trendy people suck, except of course bobby trendy cause he is super cool. okay thats all for now.

       i hate fake people + i hate trendy people = i hate people from L.A.   so i always go off on how morbid and strange OC people are and don't get me wrong, they are ... however i never really said much about L.A. people. well after tonight's great show i saw just how lame and trendy and fake (well i don't know if they are fake but some of them sure seem like it). they are all into the "scene" and the who's who and it is just lame ... and pigern's new job/company sounds just as "hollywood/L.A." as they come by ....blech ...... join the real world you sheep freaks ....baaaaaaaa baaaaaaa baaaaaaa goes the sheep call ..... ugh how annoying.   as for the show, good fun had by all. run run run was pretty bad bad bad but division of laura lee was pretty good and haven was really good, i think i just like haven more because they are from manchester, england where all the great bands come out of like new order, joy division and doves ....... hee hee  as for scary movies ..... i don't think it is really scary but i love psycho, you can't get better than that, honestly. it just slowly draws out the story ...... great stuff. i guess others would be carrie, the shining and children of the corn ha ha.    music to my ears:  say something - haven

      for all of you who are 5'3 and below know how annoying it is when the tall people of the amazons decide to stand in front of the stage right? so i went to the haven/d.o.l.l. show tonight and i went really early so i could get a good position. and by the time haven comes on, this tall blonde girl stands RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. hello? i have been actually at the venue for two hours and she just pushes her way to the front! if you get to a show early enough, you earned your space. grrr... and it's obvious she didn't even know any of their songs. i don't know why she was there. to make it worse, the two guys standing next to her were just as tall. about two heads taller than mine. if you don't even like the band that much, why stand in the front and make it horrible for the short people who do? please excuse the rambling but it makes me pissed. blar blar blar.

      "Scariest movie i've ever seen?  Showgirls, scared the hell outta me."  Actually it's a movie called "Dolls" it's freaking creepy people.  I saw it when I was a young'n and it was about these little creepy porcelain dolls, and to top it all off, the main evil one was yes an ugly ass clown porcelain doll.  What the heck is that all about?  Freaking demented director.  These things went around killing people that stopped by to stay over at that hotel/home.  Okay so I was a puss, whatever, but those things are ugly, and you know it.  Anyways JACKASS THE MOVIE this weekend!!!!  Darth, Juwanna, and whoever else, we gots to go.  Oh ya and the NBA is starting in less than 2 weeks.  SWEET, now we can see the Asian Invasion take over, go cheer for you're local chinaman, whether it be, Mengke Bateer (San Antonio) Yao Ming (Houston) or our local boy Wang Zhi Zhi (LA Clips).  Alright well gotta run out and get his jersey.  Peace.

However, I do want to see the Ring and punch drunk love....i will for sure see the ring this week w/ the red head, but he and I also want to watch barbershop...and I only have a week in CA soooo we'll see.  No doubt i'll see PDL when I get back tho.    Ok i'm all hopped up on coffee so I might as well put it to good use and get some information in this tiny brain of mine.

I do like the new format with the mood listings on the side though, and the page being back to the blue background. Another great sports weekend, I really do live for watching football and world series games on the weekend, i know i'm lame but we all watch different things on tv, mine just always happen to revolve around sports. okay angels just gave up their lead, so annoying. i agree with new wave i have been spending way to much money recently, gonna try not to do that the rest of this week, but we'll see how far that really goes. it all goes to little crap which is annoying.  movie reviews: punch drunk love was a disturbingly cute and nice story when you get to the core of it Very well acted by Sandler whom steps out of his normal character to deliver an unforgettable performance. the ring was a slightly above average horror/thriller that kept my interest but never went over the top for pure mind numbing terror.......but naomi watts is super hot so that made the movie better than it should have been....

      i quit my job today. i hate confrontations. it took me all of my courage just to tell my boss i was leaving. too bad difficult things can't be communicated through memos or telegraphs. this reminds me of steve buscemi's character in ghost world... when he breaks up with his girlfriend after sleeping with enid... he tells her, i've stayed in horrible relationships just so i wouldn't have to do this.

Anaheim Angels all the way! Hear them shout that you're the best, all throughout the golden west Watch 'em play, night and day, Keep the crowds in the clouds! Anaheim Angels, Win that game!! Anaheim Angels, Win that fame!! Everybody blow your horn! With the Halo we adorn the Anaheim Angels team!   GO ANGELS!!

      man, Kate Hudson (playing Penny Lane) in Almost Famous was the best! I developed a non-sexual female crush on her thereafter. I think she's extremely talented. (and she's our age too! that's kinda weird)...and her brother is amazingly hot too.  ...Anyway, working in Anaheim, especially right on Katella where the stadium is, you can't help but escape all this Angels imagery. oh yeah, how can i forget that Disney OWNS Anaheim. it's ridiculous!!!!!!!!! i couldn't care less.........

      the angels game sunday was amazing. it was unbelievable how they scored ten runs in one inning. the twins must have realized after the 7th that it was OVER. the series has been really exciting and i never follow sports. well, sometimes ucla. anyway, saturday should be equally exciting. money from kevin and bean predicts the angels will win the world series. i'm sure long-time angels fans have been waiting for what feels like forever. i've also realized why lots of sports fans have big guts... these games last several hours and all they do is sit at home and watch the telly while eating unhealthy snacks, which is what i did this weekend.  hah hah.

      Ya so that cockroach thing, you do have to sort of expect it, but when it really does happen, it's really freaking gross.  By the way that incident at Sunday cafe was witnessed by myself and some friends.  It crawled up next to my friend's head and the roach was about as long as my middle finger.  Nasty.  What's even better is that the fob ass owner of the restaurant was laughing and telling us that it was just like Hong Kong, and then he tells us to just move seats and order more food.  WTF is wrong with these people.

      why am i the only person f*cking blogging ......... ha ha :oP  so darth tells me some story from another person's blog page about how they went to a chinese cafe and saw some ugly roach there and how gross and nasty it was and then darth added ha ha to chinese cafe ...... look people every resturant is dirty some how some way. if you are telling yourself this is not true then you are in serious denial. i'm sure we would all like to pretend that the place we are eating at the cleanest in the world but truth but told ....... no. anyone who has worked in a restuarnt can tell you it is not the cleanest, i never have but some coworkers of mine did and they told if there are not roachs then there are mice so take your pick. ha ha. as for chinese places, honestly i know they are dirty and i think if you are stupid enough to go there expecting a clean environment then you deserve to be stupid and if they were really as dirty as people think they are then the health dept would have shut them down ......... just my thought. in addition, it hasn't stopped me from eating at sam woo on garvey and I KNOW FOR A FACT that place is really not clean but it is really yummy ........ ha ha so bite me .  i could have sworn i did a rant about this before .......... hmmm i wonder when (shurg) oh well.

      thanks for the sympathy nick. the 101 isn't tooo bad. not the best freeway... but i like listening to my tapes while driving. it takes a little under an hour to drive to universal city. hey, i interviewed for mccann-erickson advertising and my interviewer cited your company as one of their competitors. and i thought it would be funny if i worked there because we would be "enemies" in work and in school (ucla v. usc). grrr... hah hah.

      pigern...i don't know how you do it.  you have an insane commute on the most horrible freeway.  how long does it take anyway?   actually, i knew this lady that used to work in my office (marina del rey) that commuted from the 15.  is that crazy or what?  but she's no longer here.  guess she finally got fed up.  but she did it for 4 years.  anyway, i'm trying a yoga class this weekend at the gym in sacramento.  never done yoga before, but people seem to get fit from it, so i thought i might give it a try.  i don't understand how stretching and breathing exercises would tone your body, but who knows?  oh and if you thought juwanna wasn't gay enough, he's going with me.  ha ha.  sorry about that juwanna.   i want to see that movie 'white oleander'.  anyone heard any good press about it?

      the layout is fine. don't mind either way. today on the 101, there was a horrible accident. a white mercedes behind me started swerving back and forth across three lanes and then spun all the way to the farthest right lane, crashing into two other cars. it was very unreal... like watching an action film. coincidentally, the car in front of me had a sticker that read "i'm the only person on the planet who knows how to drive."

      I have yet to see Red Dragon, but I will be going tonight.  I hope it has a psychic that can forsee the future with Buffalo Bill/Bob forgot his name doing his dance going oooo eeee.  I think that's what Juwanna is talking about.  And yes Hector does it very well, and it is just as disturbing.  The Rolling Stone thing blows.  What the hell is Maladroit from Weezer doing on that list?  That's just one of the few crappy things I can think of right now.    One last thought, I just saw Bush's speech on Iraq, scary ain't it?

      hey everyone......Angel game on Saturday was great, engery was amazing and the crowd was really into it. My favorite part had to be at the end of the game when the random drunk guy came up and gave juwanna a hug, it was very touching.......red dragon was good, not quite as good as silence but still good, sorry juwanna since you guys didn't call me til later i thought you had decided to go do something else. Welcome to the house super slut of the world, haha, good to hear from you again. Hedwig i don't think i need to learn about menopause right now but maybe some day....haha.......the rolling stone cd list was pretty disappointing but then again, look who is judging it fans of RS, which i hate to admit has turned into a pop culture magazine, instead of a true artist's magazine. Looking at the cover with Keith Richards is also quite sad considering the man is like 55 but looks about 80. I recently bought the 40 licks rolling stones cd, its great for any music collection. I highly recommend it. Yes the light right above my desk has stopped flickering and gone out completely, i guess i should go find someone to fix it.   random quote of the day: Angel announcer Rex Hudler to manager Mike Scoisa after the angels beat the yankees "mike, did you like the way your team played this series?"   -what a stupid ass question

      hey everyone.  im pissed, i didnt get to see red dragon.  by the way, silence of the loins wasnt that great.  it was awesome the first time i saw it, but i saw it again with jen and wasnt that impressed by it.  the movie seemed a lot shorter and the plot was eh.  the only good part is the psycho dancing naked....you should ask hector to reenact it for you.  Game 1 tomorrow for the ALCS.  Im so excited and i just cant hide it!  oh yeah, dont hate mac.  GO ANGELS!

      see red dragon. see ralph fiennes. be amused by the irony that his character is suppose to be disfigured. try to imagine him as a psychotic serial killer despite prior knowledge of his charming demeanor and smashing good looks. and the rest of the cast is good too.

      all this talk about "real" fans of the music and bandwagon sports people is getting OLD .... so i think we should just move on ..... however if anyone wants to continue the discussion by all means do .......  i really really hope you make a super duper great med school hedwig potter. you have worked your ass off and you deserve to go somewhere good :) also, if i have any menopause questions i'll make sure to go your way ha ha ...  hmmm didn't do too much this weekend, just saw red dragon and i think everyone should see it. warning: it is pretty creepy/scary but still very very worth it. of course it is no where near as good as silence of the lamb but much better than hannibal. red dragon followed more the movie format of silence and that's what is great about it.   kinda of old random thought: so i was reading my rolling stone (issue 907, oct. 17) and was so pissed off at the reader's poll 100 greatest albums of all time (if you have a lot of free time you can go through the whole list  urlLink Click Here ) ........... so FU*KING STUPID ...... just see what the stupid readers thought was the 100 GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME ..... so lame. at least the top 10 was decent .... oh well ........ ack   music to my ears:  april tenth - garbage (FTC, it is growing on me :P)

      hey everyone.  4 articles down 5 to go...i'm learning a lot about menopause tho hehe.  so if you ladies have any questions hehe.  i also have to finish my powerpoint presentation on menopause too.  bleh!  sorry i don't have anything more to talk about.  i got my mcat scores back...got the exact same score as i got last time i took it.  what a waste.  i went through a 2 day depression and aimless wandering.  i'm ok now.....but everyone pray for me that i get into a medical school.  And if you're feeling extra religious pray some more that i can miraculously get into a California medical school.  I don't think I can pray for that cuz it would really be asking for too much hehe.   i haven't been following any of what the outside world is goign through right now....so I dont' really know about the Angels or music haha.  but congrats to angel's fans...cuz i heard they won and beat out the yankees from the redhead.  well back to the joys of menopause....hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings oh my!  i like the new look of the webpage. :)  good job new wave.  thumbs up!  winamp is spitting out: first track of the amelie soundtrack...

      Hey here's something interesting while we're still on the topic of bandwagon fans.  And please feel free to answer this.  Why is it that if a team is shitty and starts doing well people start liking them and getting up on their jocks, but if a small band starts to become popular and played on the radio, the "real" fans don't like them anymore?

      u go new wave chick!  yeah i feel the same way u do, but more about like garbage fans.  i dont care if other people like garbage.  i dont care if they havent liked them since the beginning, because it wasnt their fault they didnt know about them.  but then, there are the evil people who think they like garbage because they like "special" or some other song they heard on the radio, or because they bought one album, and then go to the concert and take up seats, while true garbage fans, who know the lyrics and enjoy every single song (not just the singles or the ones from the radio) have to sit in the back and put up with a room full of posers!  FTC! u feel me on that one?!?!  i dont particularly like the angels, i dont like baseball, too boring, so i cant judge whether or not theyre a good team, but yeah, all them wannabe-fans, that will forget about them next year if they dont do well, should get over it and get a life, find something u REALLY care about to cheer for. anyway, pigern, thanks for the welcome!  and the name is from none other than garbage's song "confidence"      "ur confident, so confident, ur full of it, ur full of sh*t.      but you see...       the world is full of girls like you, the world is full of sluts like you,      so u see...       we'll believe it, when we see it." ok well, thats about it. hey, ftc: have u gotten the "april tenth" song?????  its soooooooooo good!

      so let me get this straight ......... we should never root for a team unless we have been a true fan from the start. what if people are only rooting for the Angels because it is a so. california team (like me) or because they like the color red or whatever crazy reason people root for stuff. bandwagoners have been around for ages ....... nothing new there. i can see how you are annoyed mac the knife because that was how i felt about the Lakers (blech) but i think more people are rooting or cheering for the Angels because it has been A LONG TIME since they made the playoffs so if anything it is an accomplishment for them not like the crappy ass Lakers who buy their wins ....... boooooooooo to them .......... just my two cents .... and personally i think a majority of people know the Angels won't win the entire series so why not root for them now (sorry juwanna but you have to be realistic about this. the Angels have a good chance but not a great chance. i mean i don't like the Lakers but i know they are the best team in the NBA so go figure)  hey dorkus can i just beat you up just because ....... i mean there is no reason for it but just because i feel like it. ha ha ........    music to my ears:  doves - pounding (so excited about tuesday show ..... YAY!!!!!!)

      on kevin and bean this morning money was talking about bandwagon angels fans. he said people should stop complaining because if the stadium was filled with only true blue angels fans then there would only be 2,000 people. just thought i'd put that comment out there. i really have no authority on anything sports-related. in other news, gweneth paltrow's father died today. poor gwennyy...

      (this is not directed to only the people in this blog site, but everyone else reading this)  okay so how many of people other than juwanna were actually Angels fans before they got good?  blah blah blah, i hear all this crap about oh Angels this, Angels that, ya they're good, but please stop.  if you were a true fan before than fine... but it's odd how there are so many people that like them now, how many fans did they have at the beginning of the season?  ya the seats were all filled up and everything at Edison, boooooot.  so other than Juwanna and Johnney, if anyone says anything to me about the Angels beating the Yankees, i'll tell you before hand to shut the F up.  Thank you.  oh ya and the SD Chargers are doing very well right now too, so you should cheer for them too.

      Yea! Go Angels!  and no, i'm not a bandwagon angel fan.  i don't claim to love them now that they're in the playoffs.  i like them better than most baseball teams but still prefer basketball over baseball any day of the week and really don't care who wins the world series.  but for my safety, i hope the angels go pretty far, or else juwanna will beat me or at least throw things at me.  ha ha.    quote of the day:  if you leave a goldfish in the dark, it will eventually turn white - Snapple bottle cap

      happy thanksgiving everyone! hope everyone eats a lot of good food while vegging in front of the telly. hee hee. i miss vegging so much.  while i was driving home from work i was calculating how i spent my day and how much of it is spent at work. i am in the office for about 10 hours so that leaves 14. then it takes me 2 to get to and from work and 1 to get ready. so i'm down to 11. then 7 to 8 to sleep... erm, down to 3 to 4. 1 hour to eat dinner. crap. hardly any time... i'm sure most of you who have been working for quite awhile now have already come to this realisation. ((sigh)) alright, so i have been chatting with coworkers and friends and they have been saying how they plan to go shopping this weekend. is it just me or is that crazy talk? madness i tell you! do people just like to subject themselves to torture? see, i'm taking the easy route and shopping at mom and pop discount stores. who doesn't like kitschy, tacky items... like plastic molds of birds? hey new wave i'm being sarcastic and looking in your direction.

      i should be asleep now but eh ....  i was talking to my coworker today about the holidays and christmas and discovered she celebrates it like darth and nick with the whole "whiteness cheese ballish" and i'm thinking hey but she is asian and stuff ... shouldn't she be deprivated of presents, a tree, santa and so on .... then slowly i realized "wait no it is only my family" (pigern i'm looking your way) who does this ... it use to really bug me growing up but as i got older i just hated everything so i didn't even care anymore but a childhood with that whole "whiteness" feel to it would have been nice .....  i really don't like some of my coworkers by the way ... they are such tards ... blech  oh the person in the ad was chia chia pet ... those from brightwood know who i'm talking about and sorry to the other members of the house for this whole inside joke/story thing ...   music to my ears:  crash - dave matthews band

      a Vaseline ad?  hmmm i have no clue.  my guesses would either be kaigee or ryan, just cause they were on tv shows and what not.  hmmmm nick?  i would've guessed that you would say the same thing.  i think you know those two guys, don't you?  hahaha.  plus i didn't even go there and i'm still not a crustacean because that was what i was most likely to be.  wtf?

      hey y'all....yes, i know i've gone MIA for a while.  but not as bad as juwanna.  i really don't have anything to say about the encore thing so i won't.  darth: you're welcome.  please don't do that ever again :)  but that was pretty funny that you were "attempting" to study for your GRE.  Pigern:  i'm sorry about UCLA's loss.  ha ha.  that was mean.  btw, did you ever take the olympic to los angeles street route to get home?  how did that work out?  new wave: i'm wondering who could be in the Vaseline ad cuz you know everyone that came from brightwood is ugly and bitchy.  ha ha.  and how would mac even remember someone from brightwood?  right pigern? anyway, i'm tired, tired, and little more tired on the side.  it's been a weird couple of days.  i'm sorry to rub this in everyone's face (those of you that work full-time), but i can't wait for december.  i think i have more days off in december than i actually have to work :)  i know you are scrunching up your face in disgust, new wave.  good times.

      i never thought encores would spawn a discussion but i guess it did ...  i came across this ad in the dec 2002 Self mag (pigern gets free copies) for Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion and they used an old classmate of mine as a model ... how funny is that. mac and nick it is someone from brightwood ... can you guess who??? (btw where the heck are you nick edney and juwanna man ... sheesh you guys are all MIA ...)  well the holidays are upon us ... eh i don't care. i hate this time because i feel like a consumer whore and then i feel like helping the needy but then that makes me feel bad because why does it have to be once a year you decide to help others who are less blessed than you are ... shouldn't you do that all year long ... ack it is just depressing is what it is ... and when you help others less blessed than you don't you wonder if they feel like they are getting your pity and that it is taking away from their dignity ... just a thought   music to my ears:  exploding boy - alkaline trio and strange - tori amos (sooo good)

      i like encores. i think it's a compliment to the band. like, you guys were brilliant. now come back out (even though you are tired) to do just a bit more. come on now ((clap clap))! one of the funniest moments was when i went to see death cab for cutie and the lead singer was deathly ill. so when they finished their set (barely), the audience was like "erm, do we applaud for an encore? we feel bad..." i don't think we made them come back out. the lead singer was vomiting or something. hm, moving on... thanks for everyone's traffic tips. i have actually been staying at work until 7 p.m. so it makes my mapping techniques moot. but if i ever leave earlier... f.y.i. i don't like no doubt. i never really did but i like them less with each album. especially the 'underneath it all' tune: "and when it's really bad i guess it's not that bad." who writes that? eight-year-olds! geez. i would have like to see the distillers. i like their new album.  alright, have a happy thanksgiving and watch out for the windy weather. try not to get blown away.

      first off i wasn't presuming anything, although it might seem that way because of the way i typed it.  the "no?" should've probably been "or not."  so that being put out of the way, i still stand by my words and say encores are lame.  i just hope one day people are disappointed when a band doesn't come back out, that would be sweet.  hopefully it's at an emo show though, so a flood of tears flows throughout the crowd.  i will speak no more on this subject for now.  darth, man you're sweet.  i think you're going to get the highest score possible, whatever it maybe on your GRE's.  oh ya and darth did you see UCLA beat the crap out of USC, it was kind of like ken shamrock beating the crap out of tito ortiz.  and jamal anderson winning the superbowl, what is it like 8 years in a row?

      Hey party people, its been a while since i last blogged so i guess i should before i get kicked out. I assumed garbage would put on a better show than no doubt, just cause no doubt seems to be everywhere and i think the hype was too much for them.....A special thanks to nick and juwanna for aiding me in my hour of need. Here are a few pointers for the kids out there 1) don't drink and drive....thats obvious.....2) don't attempt to study for your GRE's while waiting for a ride.......3) Always make sure you have a backup person to pick you up..........Encores are cool, but sometimes they are annoying cause the band takes forever to comeback and the audience has to sit there hollering and clapping and just making noise, its sort of annoying that way, but its cool when they come back out....so I see both of your points.

      Mac the Knife, you say, "Just play the damn set thoroughly, and not come back out for an encore, everyone knows its coming. that's just my two cents. but i think you people would agree, no?"  Well, aren't you being a little presumptuous? thinking that we would all agree w/ you about how encores suck. whatever! don't presume anything about anybody! I'm not saying encores aren't lame or cheesy or that they are the best thing ever, but encores are needed. maybe for psychological purposes, for closure or something, but really, if i saw a band (esp one that i paid a lot of money to see) and they didn't have an encore, i would be like, what's up w/ that? a band can play a solid set, but an encore will still be demanded by the audience. get over it! accept it! yeah, everyone knows it's coming, but that is just how it is. No matter how good you are.   I was at the No Doubt / Garbage show Saturday and did not stay for the encore. Oh well. Knew it was coming, but decided it would be better to beat traffic. I mean, how many times do I have to hear "Spiderwebs?" Nonetheless, good show. Encore or not.

      from Scott Adams' Dilbert Newsletter...SO true.  Is there an Induhvidual in your house who doesn't understand that when you're using a sink you can't hear conversation directed at you from another room? If so, try this little speech.  My Running-Water Speech:   "I can hear a vague buzzing sound that I believe is you, trying to talk to me from another room while I am using the sink. Believe it or not, the physics of sound have not changed that much since the last fifty times you tried unsuccessfully to yak at me from another room while I was using the sink. Tomorrow, when you try again, I will still not be able to hear you over the sound of running water in the sink."

      ok, must blog after the interesting show last nite.  of course, shirley and the boys kicked major ass, shirley is soooo cool (and no, i do not sound like a girl).  the distillers were cool also, but brody looks like a major druggie and i feared she would fall over and die.  and then there was no doubt...  the set was alright, or it could have been alright.  they are a good band with good songs, but the audience TOTALLY KILLED IT.  i mean, they killed my "concert buzzed" that garbage had created.  once they came out, the audience went crazy, and not in a good way.  too much shoving for the first couple songs, with people trying to get to the front, only to just stand there like bitches, totally no respect for anyone.  it was all them, i-know-two-songs-and-own-the-latest-album-so-im-a-fan peeps.  not that i was so into the set, and im sure people wanted me to get out of there, but i had my garbage shirt on and there were no ambiguities as to why i was there.  anyway, i knew i had withstood the insanity for some reason, because after the "encore", which, yeah, i think is silly.  gwen brought out garbage & the distillers and the girls sang blondie's call me, while the boys played, totally awesome.  of course, all the kiis-fm/no doubters hadnt a clue what they were singing, but i totally enjoyed it.  i was, however upset with myself that i had not saved a couple pics on my camera to take of the girls singing.  oh well, lesson learned.  so, yeah, garbage needs to tour alone from now on. oh, and FTC, the blur song, is, um different, yet good, cos its blur, haha. alright, peace out.

      i just finished doing some christmas shopping and realized the holidays are scary ....... it is not even near christmas and there are TONS AND TONS of people buying stuff. i'm scared just to think how bad it is going to get the closer to christmas.  hmmm dawson's creek ... yea when are they going to end that show.  i so want to hear the new blur song t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y ...  hey mac i think encores are cool. i don't mind them, especially if they are a worthy band. sigur ros didn't do an encore for us :(  even though we were cheering for a good 20 or some mins. but when i saw travis, radiohead and of course the wonderful and all great the cure they all did encores and i was so happy they did :) .... not sure if seeing an encore of no doubt really would have been worth the wait though ha ha. i mean i like them, don't get me wrong but put that up against garbage and i think we all know who wins .... dang i would so make sweet love to shirley manson .... she is so fucking great :) her and debbie harry.   music to my ears:  fernando - abba

      i can't fall asleep...it sucks.  anyways i caught a rerun of an old snl and the musical guest was ugly kid joe.  i never noticed it before, maybe because he's been out of the business for quite sometime, but he really looks like freddie prince jr.  i went to the no doubt concert on friday, yippee.......  actually i couldn't back out of it.  anyways i went into it thinking it would suck, but it was actually decent.  the distillers put on a nice set, even though people didn't know who they were, then garbage came on and shirley manson kicked ass.  never really seen them before, but their set was the highlight of the evening.  man i feel like a girl.  anyways then no doubt came on, and did the whole encore thing.  i hate those, it's so lame.  why do bands, esp. the "superstars" have to do that?  just play the damn set thoroughly, and not come back out for an encore, everyone knows its coming.  that's just my two cents.  but i think you people would agree, no?  oh ya, and of course almost acoustic x-mas is coming soon.  night 2 anyone?  c'mon you know you want to see chris carraba.  someone, anyone, please?  haha.  hopefully i can go to sleep now.  peace out.

      hello everyone. okay hedwig, i also watched dawson last week. i don't watch it regularly... actually i hardly ever watch. i think it was the fifth episode i've ever seen but i was curious since no doubt was on. i think joey (or katie holmes) looks less cute each year. i don't know what happened to her. her coloring is off... too orange. and audrey slept with the guy jen liked! ewww... i think jen looks cuter each year.  alright, new topic. i was pretty upset yesterday at work because me and the coworker i dislike were both given tasks. and i did mine incorrectly because i was given the wrong directions. so while i was fixing my mistakes, my coworker snorts and says "you aren't done yet?" ewww... the nerve! so i lost my temper and replied, "you don't have to be so haughty." but i thought about it more and i suspect that arrogant attitude stems from the fact that he is older (about 30) and born in china. in that culture the man is dominant and therefore more domineering. i don't want to think we can't get along with those from other cultures but i think it can be more difficult. when i was at ucla, i met a great girl from hong kong. she was super nice but i could never really talk to her because communication was difficult. she didn't get my sense of humor and i had to explain more in depth what i said to her. so naturally our friendship fell apart pretty easily. anyway, perhaps if i take into consideration these factors of culture and communication, i'd get along with my coworker more. i hope. i think it'll be hard though. (and by the way, he really did snort. gross.)

      ahhh finally done w/ all my secondary applications.  i just finished temple.  really highly doubt i'll get anything from the UC's....*shrug*  UC's suck anyway!!!!! :P  anyhoo, just wanted to drop in and say hello to everyone in the house---or shall i say NOT in the house.  I get to go home next week so that's cool...I'm hungry, I want turkey hehe.  I bought Lion King tickets for December so I'm happy about that.  It will be a good Christmas break.  I cant' wait until school is done.  I hate it.  I hate this year.  I need more structure.  I don't like research...it's interesting but I'm too lazy to be doing all that work dammit.  I'd rather see patients and take their history's...can't I get a Master's degree by doing that? hehe...master's in community service.  awesome! :D  i am neglecting my research duties...but I don't care.  don't care!!!!!  mmm oh I watched Dawson's Creek...I didn't really like the ep too much....the show is annoying, but I watch it every week...weird.  i just don't like the fact that everyone gets w/ everybody else.  I guess you need that kind of dynamic to keep the ratings up.  I guess it would get pretty boring if Joey and Dawson were together for the whole duration of the series.  Ah well, I don't like Dawson right now...I like the guy Joey has, but no doubt before the end of the series D and J will get back together....i don't think they should.  I DO however think Ross and Rachel should....don't worry they will.  hehe.  Ok enough of my sad sad sad discussion of TV characters as if they were real people.  *sigh* the life i lead...it's sad hehe.  currently listening to: THE LOUD ASS LATIN MUSIC PLAYING IN THE LOUD ASS CLUB NEXT DOOR.  they play every wed til 2am....i'm livin in the lap of luxury, complete w/ live in mice and cockroaches(well just the one cockroach that i saw and tried to kill today)...soon my room will smell like smoke if it doesn't already.....*COUGH!*....*cough*...*choke*.....*flatline*---"beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"

      the sigur ros show was v. entertaining. it was like a philharmonic concert, because there was a mini orchestra that played with the band and everyone was seated. to be honest, it was so mellow that i was half asleep during the first half. i don't know if it was because the music is mellow or i was just tired from work. hm... so i went to the grove on my lunch break to visit barnes and the place is elaborately decorated in christmas themed schlock. the big christmas tree is up and there is a tacky santa riding in his sled with the reindeers and christmas jingles are playing over the loud speakers. okay, first of all, it's november. november! christmas is in december! secondly, the christmas themed surroundings seemed very insincere. the grove people just want you to buy buy buy. all these lame signs about the perfect christmas gift. consumerism hidden behind the pretense of holiday cheer. grrr... plus it was 80 degrees today and gap is selling scarves and mittens. i wonder how well those sales are going.

      shocker .... i'm the only one blogging again ... oh well  i went and saw me some   sigur ros:   and it was GREAT !!! every minute of it ... they are so good live and just the lighting, the images they used and of course their music made it a wonderful experience. they started off the show with some slower songs but by the end of their performance everyone was on their feet clapping and cheering for more .... i'm sorry if this sounds vague, i'm not good at describing things really .... just believe me when i say it was a GREAT !!! show and i was quite disappointed when it ended (smiling blissfully) .....    music to my ears:   anything sigur ros :)

      good to see some people are in the house :o) ......nick why would you divorce or split from the person who you knew you would be good together with, i mean he is not the supposed ONE but if you knew he was good enough to be together with then isn't he was worth the fight of working things out with. and i don't think it would be the end of all relationships for you, just with that one person who is the supposed ONE.   in reality (at least my warped one), there is no ONE person out there, actually my random thought was more on why people use the term "knew/know" was all because i don't think anything in life is for sure. i think people would like to think the person they are with will be the ONE but maybe others don't. and yea maybe people want to settle but see they don't think it is settling, they think it is their true love and that they "knew" this was the person, i just don't like people using that stupid phrase. and mac i agree with you shockingly enough, i mean if there is that special someone then why do people spend so much time looking, don't you think that ONE person will just come when it is time ...... obviously they don't so we as people settle for whatever we have around us and sometimes, key word i used here is sometimes please note that everyone ... i did not say always, end up in unhappy marriages just because society deems it so. ha ha man people are fucked ......   music to my ears:  nothing really ....

      what a weekend.  so exhausted yesterday, it felt like i dug a deep deep hole and fell in it for 20 years.  i was so dead to the world.   pigern: hmmmm....shall i reveal my commute secrets to my biggest rival?  ha ha!  you probably won't be able to take my path anyway since you work north of the 10.  but find a street that runs parallel to the 10, (for me that would be Adams on the southside of the 10) and take that east towards home as far as you can.  i usually  hop back on right before the 60.   no matter what, taking a street is hell of a lot better than the 10.  damn that 10 freeway.  but  yeah, it took me 1 hr 15 minutes on friday still. ok and now on to the whole couple thing.  i don't know if i believe in that whole "i knew it was him" thing.  for me, i know there was a specific moment when i knew that we would be good together, but not necessarily  he was the one i was SUPPOSED  to be with.  cuz if i was supposed to be with someone, if we end up breaking up or divorcing, does that mean the end of relationships for me?  that no one else in this world is for me, because i broke up with the one that was supposed to be for me?  i don't know....everyone has their own opinions.  ok, enough about this.... i'm gonna see harry potter this week sometime if anyone wants to join me.

      Currently playing on Winamp:  Slick Shoes - Angel, Millencolin - Duckpond, Samiam - Sky Flying By   The One.  Isn't that a crappy Jet Li movie?  My thoughts on that, hmmm well, I think that there is no single one for any person, I think there are many different "ones" out there, it's just whoever you find first.  I agree with pigern, I mean who really wants to say, "I settled," instead of "I knew he/she was the one."  Classic example is the Wedding Singer when Julia Goulia was going to settle for that Don Johnson dude.  See that makes everything so clear!  Okay I don't know what i'm talking about.  What I do know is if there is that special somebody for everyone how come so many people are still searching and never find that person in a lifetime?  Think about it.  The funny thing about this is that the people in relationships are probably gonna have the opposite views of the singles, so speak up, I want to know what you're thinking.    Oh ya and pigern, I don't know exactly where you work, but you can exit any street after Vermont and take Adams which is one or 2 blocks south of the 10W.  It will get you to La Cienega faster than going on the 10.  Only bad thing is you pass through some "nice" neighborhoods.  Nick should be able to give you all the details though.

      nah i haven't seen COS yet, I'm waiting to see it with the red-head and other friends when I come home COME HOME! for thanksgiving.  I wanted to see 'far from heaven'...i'm glad that it was good.  i suppose i will watch all these movies i missed this summer on video hehe.  still waiting for lilo and stitch DVD.  I have it on my computer but I want the DVD so I can take it home home to watch it on my couch w/ my sis.    right now i'm studying for my next pathology exam...boring.  It's only 840 and it feels like it's 1am.  I can't wait until tuesday afternoon.....or better yet, I can't wait until NEXT tuesday afternoon and I will be on my way home! woohoo.  as far as the true love thing.  i'm not saying that when i met the red-head, I "knew"...but well, right now I don't even know if he's "the one" but i'd like him to be and i'm hoping he is.  you never really KNOW until it's there--there being when you get married...and even when it is there, you still don't know b/c who's to say it's not gonna fall apart?  SEE I'm not single and I'm synical and insecure still hehe. But right now I'm in a good place and so are the red-head and I...so I just continue to hope that it will stay this way.  Cuz lord knows it wasn't always this way.  Welp, gotta get back to the hell that is studying path.  BLAH! hate it.  listening to: Big E.

      hello everyone. like new wave, i would recommend the film 'far from heaven.'  both julianne moore and dennis quaid gave brilliant performances that may be oscar worthy. i think one of the central themes of the film is repression. and whether you should go after what you really want or follow what is expected of you. it seems like the answer would be obvious with the typical 'follow your dreams' spiel we always hear but then this film explores the degree in which societal expectations and restraints make such pursuits seem foolish considering the negative consequences. also, the film was visually stunning, which followed the theme of superficial perfection. so hedwig, did you see harry potter yet? if so, how was it? i'm eager to see it but am waiting out the long lines. i've been hearing good things so far from critics. on another rant, it took me an hour and forty minutes to get home on friday. an hour and forty minutes people. i live sixteen miles away from my office. okay, there was a game at the staples center that night and a three car accident that closed off one lane on the ten... but still... going four mph was not fun. nick, how do you get home? or will you give the secrets of your commute to your dual rival? grr... (lol) new wave, i was thinking about what you were saying re: your coworkers saying they "knew" it was the person... blah blah... and perhaps people say these things to reassure themselves and convince others that they made the right decision. i mean people can't go around saying, "yeah, i love the girl but i'm not really sure you know? but i figured i was getting old and i'm tired of dating..." they have to say to people, "this is my one and only true love" so people can swoon and think "ooh, how sweet." as for people i don't like at work, the other guy who was hired to the same position as me is super annoying. and he has to sit next to me. and he is in the same team as me. i think i would be much happier at work if i could avoid him at all costs... or if someone else was hired. he makes me think, "gee, what did the boss see in him?" and "was it slim pickings?" isn't that awful? and there's no real concrete reason for my strong distaste. i just find him extremely irritable. he makes work less enjoyable. as for music, i am currently listening to the pixies. brilliant, subversive rock. so subversive that i think my coworkers who hear it on my stereo think i'm weird. hah hah. especially the line when frank black yells, "AND THE DEVIL IS SIX... THEN GOD IS SEVEN!" RAWK!

      where did everyone in the house go .... well i'll just keep talking to myself   hi how's it going ..... good good and how are you   this is me talking to myself  saw far from heaven today. it was good but very sad ... you don't come away from it feeling great. all i know is i could not live in the 1950's .... i would die. but pigern and darth pointed out that in the 1950's you wouldn't know anything else so you would just accept the way things are but i would think a part of you would find something wrong with it ... i mean it was so very very repressed then ... makes sense why people freaked when the 60's and 70's started ... ha ha    music to my ears:  you know you're right - nirvana

      i should be asleep now, sheesh i'm like 40 now. i'm so sick of traffic, i hate it ever so much. no one in the house is really talking. i guess everyone left. oh well.   so just random thoughts going on in my head:   - i was talking to some co-workers and they were telling me about how they met their husbands/wives and how they just "KNEW" that was the person they were going to spend the rest of their lives with .... so i'm thinking how can you "KNOW" ... i mean honestly i think that is such a dumb thing to say, nothing in life is for sure, there are no guarantees in life EVER ... i think the only one for sure thing is that people will die ....  i mean i'm not saying it is not possible to meet that one person i just don't like it when people use the pharse they "KNEW/KNOW" because no one really knows anything   - i noticed a majority of the people in this house are single and i wondered why that was ... it's not like we are all ugly people. i've seen all of you and i think we are alright looking ... i know for me a relationship makes my stomach curl up in a ball because i use to be in a four year relationship (kinda of marriage) so i know what that was like and i so want to stay away from that for awhile and as for the dating thing .... there are WAY too many losers out there. ha ha i think i already brought this subject up huh.  - i hate how people at work drag all their personal problems to work, hey was there a sign in the front of the office that read "WE GIVE A DAMN" because last time i checked there wasn't ... i don't care about your sorry ass sob stories about your family and paying the bills and the kids and blah blah blah. just shut the hell up .... seriously  - i REALLY REALLY don't like the MIS people at my work place  - no doubt is so overexposed right now ... they are reissuing the rock steady cd, they were on dawson's creek the other night, they are doing breakfast with kroq and like 5 or 6 shows in la ... man i'm tired of them already  - i truly love THE CURE. i'm not sure if i mention this enough, they are so ..... i don't even think words can explain how awesome and great they truly are. i'm sorry for bringing this up to people who hear me talk about all the time but i mean seriously they are so good. (sigh ... brushing tears away)   music to my ears:  plainsong - the cure

      Hi everyone, haven't posted in a while, I was sick for the longest time.  It really sucked, but now i'm better.  Anyways the main reason I wanted to come on was to share this awesome news.  Manute Bol is going to play in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), basketball, boxing, hockey......what's next?  This guy is the athelete among atheletes, he is sooooo sweet.  Don't believe me?  Check out ESPN, should be on the main page.  I know for sure Darth is enjoying this very much so.

      man, i feel so lame because everyone at my office always goes out to eat and i sit here at my desk with my packed lunch. i don't like spending money on food but there is this pressure to do so since everyone else is. peer pressure. i hate it. anyway, i haven't given christmas much thought. except that i would like to go to london on holiday. :o( yeah right. in my dreams. i went to see badly drawn boy on friday. it was a good show except that he played for 2.5 hours. i was so tired that even though i had floor seats, i went upstairs to the balcony by the second hour where i proceeded to fall asleep. hee hee. i was so tired and his music is so melodic. my friend also dozed off. by the end i was thinking, finish already! people need to get home and go to bed. this morning there was hardly any traffic. i was half hoping the office made a mistake with the calendar and we did have veteran's day off. but alas, everyone was here working. so i sadly trudged in to work...

I got him part of his gift and i got his grandma something but that's the extent of the Christmas gifts.  i just watched lilo and stitch for the second time.  my friend downloaded it. :) I've been waituing to see it for months now.  so cute.  :D  I've never sen U.S. Marshalls...and now i don't think i'll ever watch it...esp since it's like the Fugitive.  dang man it's only 1130 and i'm getting sleepy.  we finally found this filipino restaurant in northeast philly.  decent food except the adobo didn't taste/look like adobo....it looked more like teriyaki chicken.  everything else was good! and we are all full and fat and sleepy hehe. it made me happy to see my people haha.  ok back to my presentation....what fun.

      hey all...i saw 8 mile on friday night...was sold out til like 11...so we watched the 11 showing.  it was actually decent.  it's also getting a few good reviews...however, they give way too much credit to eminem's acting.  i mean...yeah he can act.  but well, i don't think i would say that his quiet desperation was really him acting.  or well it didn't look like it.  he just kinda looked like his face was blank.  he pulled off a pretty decent performance.  i'm sleepy and can't really think straight......so i'll end it here. hehe.  cya

      Hey people...its friday!!!!! that actually means very little....its raining depressing and makes me want to go to sleep. I love how all the newstations are going crazy with STORM WATCH 2002!!!!!...because this is the biggest storm that has ever hit anywhere in the world...so stupid....i wanted the valley to break away from l.a. if and only it had gone with the name camelot that would have been hilaiously funny.....to answer a part of your blog concerning the two party system t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y. i feel that a new party can only arise if they bring about some new change that the general public is in favor of (i.e. the creation of the whig and republican parties of the past). Until a party come across with new ideas that appeal to a bigger population voters will continue to vote in a similar fashion. The independent party formed by Ross Perot had the best chance to make a run for a new party, but because of splits within the party it has all but fallen apart.....okay thats just my opinion though........traffic blows big time.....it took me over and hour and a half to get home yesterday and come in today......i love the rain and i'm sure rain and darkness will be just as sweet tonight!!! thanks again to new wave for meeting me up for those beers.....i'm still waiting.....still here.......hello?!!?!?!? hahahhaha....

PLEASE HELP !!!!  the cure trilogy concert is coming up ... okay i'm not going to cry ... seriously i will be good (sniff) man i love them so much. do you know how AWESOME it would be to see the cure play pornography, disintergration, and bloodflowers in full and back to back ...(lip quivering .... sniff)    music to my ears:  i'm still in love with you - new edition ... i've been on this total r & b / hip hop kick right now ... my alternative cds are just not doing it for me, i need a break from them.

      oh, i'm so happy that the blog house is full of people. yay. (note imood) anyway, i agree with you slut. why are we off to fight another war? our nation is suffering and we have to go try to "help" others. i remember one of my professors said that our country tends to think it's the american way or no way but that's a really arrogant attitude. because our country has its own set of problems. for example, the number of deaths caused by guns. we have over 10,000 gun-related deaths but some countries have just a few hundred (according to 'bowling for columbine'). i'm still complaining even though i didn't vote. hah hah. but seriously, i will vote for the next presidential election. i will make sure of it. alright, so i have been noticing more and more liberal stickers on cars. examples include "no more bushit" and "waiting for 2004." interesting... maybe this conservative tide will turn. soon soon soon. so i agree with new wave: i am too old for these emo punk shows. i mean i could ignore the little high schoolers but i feel out of place. can't relate to math class and senior class photos you know? on an embarassing note, a rep from SPIN came to the office today to make a presentation and one of her slides had a pic of Travis. so i pointed out to one of my coworkers that Fran Healy (the lead singer) is cute. and the rep heard me and said, "oh, this girl likes him eh? he is cute." and all my coworkers turned to look at me. so embarassing. i turned bright red. that rep must have super good hearing.

      ok so yeah, i promised new wave that i would blog, finally, even tho i dont really have much to say. so ive read the last several blogs, and u guys have some interesting things going on, i should check it out more often, but im too lazy to type in my long-ass log-in name, although it is worth it, who doesnt like being called a slut anyway? ok, so, yeah i forgot to change my address for registration to vote, oh well.  although that will not hold me back from complaining about the gov't (a retarded one, i might add)  i mean, whats the difference, our good ol' two-party system allows us no options anyway.  the only thing i wanted was the valley to get away from LA (damn i hate LA), and that didnt happen.  and whats up with the republican control??? why is the general population still too wrapped up in the supposed post 9-11 shite and so hyped up about war?  good lord, can we start to make some changes at home before we try to taint the world with our materialistic, egotistical, dont give a f*ck about anyone but ourselves thought processes? ok im over it.  *sigh* what a beautiful world we live in.  i am afraid that theres much to be afraid of  oh yeah, props to the peeps who yelled "go dodgers", sounds like something i would do, u know, just to be in opposition, kinda like when the laker hype comes around. hmmmmmmm, i think i would like to be friends with rappers, cos they like to spend money, and i would make them pay for my med school apps. hehe, they have enough to go around.  and then i could be part of their posse, and roll with like 20 peeps, and dress all ghetto.  oh yeah, and talk ghetto, cos i LOVE doin dat. but seriously, i think shirley would be a totally cool person, but she would probably get annoyed by me.  i guess it would have to be someone i dont follow too much.  i think vanessa marcil would be cool to know (btw, shes back on gh, hehe) but then i would just stare, so i dont know. so yeah, hedwig pretty much summed up our feelings on the med school app process.  also, its so fake.  just some remnants of the old (white) boys' club. but dont worry, we will get there! ok cant think of anything more to say. and no, im not getting the nirvana cd, isnt it just a bunch of old stuff anyway?  im not getting u2 for that matter.  i wonder if the next foxy will be good?  ive been hella ghetto lately, oh well, u cant take the hood out the homeboy. damn im so out of the music loop, how sad oh yeah, i went to hollywood for halloween. we went to the party at the roosevelt hotel.  it sucked ass!  they oversold tickets and almost didnt get in.  after waiting an hour, we finally got in, teh drinks sucked, the music was alright, but not worth the 30 bucks we spent.  would have been better off drinkin at home.  (its all about the kick-backs, ftc!)  so yeah, i dont doubt that the bronger west hollywood incident occured, after all ftc and i have heard some crazy stories (haha, sorry dude, cant stop the taunting just cos we dont live together anymore) so thats it, a novel later.  does that make up for time lost new wave?  song-o-d-moment:    kylie minogue - come into my world (fischerspooner remix)  ,  someone called as i was listening to the song and thought i was watching porn cos the end has these noises that sound like a woman making sex noises.  funny stuff. hasta la próxima...

      yes darth there are a lot of cars on the road now ... what is up with that. it is taking me so much longer to get to work now, not that i'm in any rush to get there ... i'm just saying. hey darth sorry about the mix up this evening ... i'm a loser and rude hence my imood.  i didn't vote today ... so i can't say anything, i really wanted to though .. (sigh)  man hedwig sorry to hear about med. school, i always found it funny when people said oh doctors make all this money and blah blah blah ... i mean think about the amount of work that goes into being a doctor and it's not like you have all this time to spend money or even make that much ... eh go figure.   nothing much to really talk about ... you see strange movies nick and you and lisa are SERIOUSLY SICK for going to the bridal expo ... and actually having fun, what is wrong with you ... ha ha. hey dorkus please tell me all the good reel beet stories when you get a chance, i bet they are all classic .. HA HA.   this post was for sunday:  i went and saw me some saves the day  - aside from being WAY TOO OLD for these shows, std gave a good performance, i liked how they played a pixies song which none of the kids there even knew who the pixies were ... ha ha classic, seriously.  personally i don't think it was as solid as it could have been, a lot of stuff from their older albums. and what is up with chris (the lead singer) and his new look, a hanson hair cut with nerd glasses and we are not talking the typical emo kind then there was his strange dancing. the other three bands were not so great, ash was the best of the three but even they were pushing it. although they did bust out jack names the planets and kung fu from the angus soundtrack. one highlight from their show was their cover of a weezer song, pretty sweet.    music to my ears:  love will come through - travis :o)

      yes radio is a cool yet bitter song.  that's the only song i have from alkaline trio...but well it's a good song so, so what. hehe.  Sorry Darth, i didn't vote today.  i didn't do an absentee cuz I feel like I would be voting blindly cuz I don't know about the issues...etc etc.  I usually vote tho.  :)  I was working on my USC secondary application for med school.  so annoying AND they make you pay 90 bucks after making you go through the hell of answering their redundant stupid questions.  Slut and I were talking about the app process and how retarded it is.  No wonder why doctors are so synical and anal retentive.....you get the shaft up your arse enough that lil hole starts to close up and your face starts to permanently form a scowl.  AFTER you get into medical school IF you get in...you accumulate an enormous amount of debt that could probably pay for a decent house and a car!  After you graduate and hopefully pass the boards that cost a sh**load of money also, and HOPEFULLY get matched...you get to earn a crappy salary despite the fact that you work 36 hour days...so it takes you FOREVER to pay back your loans.  But don't worry I'm not bitter hehe.  So I must really want to be a doctor huh?  :)  I just wish the system would change somehow.  We all deserve better for our efforts.  well that's MY two cents.  I'm going to go read about the kidney now.  Happy urinating everyone!  Now playing on winamp:  'waiting in vain'--annie lennox

      i'm sooo bored right now i think i'm going to die....haha...i'm sitting here at work doing nothing, cause i am so exhausted. it was a really busy day and now i have to rush home to go vote. GO VOTE TODAY everyone!!! If you don't vote you can't complain. Thats my two cents....okay its dark out and i have to drive through....why can't people drive at night and why does it seem like there are more people out at night? This time of the year is sooo annoying...okay i'm leaving a bit early today.

       Currently listening to:    Alkaline Trio - Radio  (probably one of the most bitter songs ever, but damn good)  Being sick sucks, ever since Halloween i've been sick.  Dammit.  I think I might of caught something that night in West Hollywood.........a cold, what are you guys thinking?  Anyways Band of Brothers DVD comes out tomorrow.  If you haven't seen the series, and like Saving Private Ryan, or movies of that sort, it's definitely worth a watch.  I think you can rent it, because it's going to be pricey.  Nick you watch crappy movies dude.  Where are the likes of Battlefield Earth, Ghost Dog, or Dude Where's My Car?  Those are the classics.  All right i'm getting sleepy, night all.

      if no one blogs, this blog page will self destruct in five days. hah hah. but serious folks... you are making me sad. :o( anyway, i went to santa barbara this weekend and it was happy days. but v. expensive. i forgot how fancy schmancy it is up there. quaint small town life for rich people. downtown santa barbara anyway, not ucsb, which is pretty craptacular in comparison. anyway, you guys should check out 'bowling for columbine.' it gets you thinking... even if you don't agree with michael moore.

      well, it's now november. the year is almost over... halloween was a good time. there were lots of creative costumes when i went to west hollywood. some memorable ones were the moveable disco party, the plant from little shop of horrors, the board game operation ivy, and several droogs. i was surprised so many had the same idea as me. the only downside was that we had to leave early because of work. oh wells...

      so i've been MIA a while.  just a quick cameo to wish everyone a happy & safe new year.  im about to go get ready for a nite of alcohol, to follow a weekend full of alcohol (HAHAHA, btw: hedwig, new wave & darth:  my ex-wife got married sunday, it was pretty cool, i was so happy for her) so yeah, i quickly read some posts and i liked maid in manhattan.  it was entertaining, and had some cool commentaries about the working-class (although, yes, i KNOW jLo is a spoiled witch, but oh well)  and yeah, shes latina and gets paid bank!

      Blazing on the 1's and 2's:  Foo Fighters - Everlong (Dave Grohl is awesome)  This year is finally ending!!!  Yes!  A New Year is upon us.  So Happy New Year's to everyone, oh and NKOTB you don't have anything to worry about in your hood, no gun fire or anything right?  jk, but everyone stay safe tonight.    Top Movies (no order and my list is almost a carbon copy of Darth's)  Jackass the Movie - the guch c'mon and the sea cucumber, I think Chris Pontius deserves best actor for that. Star Wars Ep. 2 - cause Yoda man, haha I hate that commercial, oh and i'm a nerd too. Lord of the Rings: Big Boss Man and Akeem the African Dream - the action scenes were great, oh and that elf guy is soo hot.... Red "Angry" Dragon - I was waiting for dirty sanchez, but he never came out, oh and where the heck is buffalo bill, he's cool, GIVE ME BACK MY PRECIOUS OOOOH WEE! Sweet Home Alabama - It was so sweet, Reese Witherspoon is so great in this cute little romantic comedy.....actually I never saw it, but I can't believe you had to watch this Darth, hahaha.  what's wrong with you?  are you ambiguously.....? jk. Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai - It's a few years old now, but it's Forest Whitaker as a samurai.  Now that's kick ass.  But it's in my top movies for life now.    New Year's Resolutions: 1. Don't become a fob in Korea 2. Read more 3. Stop watching a lot of T.V., actually being a bum  4. Start my career 5. Be a better person/Christian (need people to help me)

      Hey everyone! just want to say Happy New Years to everyone.....and don't forget don't spike the punch cause it will make you punchy!  Anyway my new year's resolutions are:  1. try to do more outside stuff: i.e. golfing, camping etc 2. read more books that I have been saving up 3. keep my room clean for more than 3 days 4. stop buying stupid crap and save more money 5. stop making stupid lists  and here now are my top lists of the year  Top Movies 1. Star Wars Episode 2 ----Only cause i'm a really big nerd can't believe I have to wait another 2.5 years for the next one 2. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers -- great story and effects, the finale is only 1 year away!! 3. Antwone Fischer -- Denzel directing debut shows his great ability to be a story teller and a character at the same time 4. Red Dragon -- Way better than Hannibal plus it had Ed Norton, he's cool!! 5. Far from Heaven -- This movie leaves you feeling depressed, but it has amazing acting performances by moore, quiad, haysbert hon. mentions: undercover brother(most underatted comedy) jackass (it gave what it promised) panic room(not a great film but jodie foster was cool) punch drunk love (disturbingly cute)  Worst Films 1. Sweet Fricking Home Alabama ---Sweet merciful crap how did this get made? 2. Van Wilder -- I can't believe I paid for this tripe 3. Spirited Away -- Animated Films should not be over 2hours long movies that are bad even though i never saw them: Scooby-Doo, maid in manhattan, crossroads, how does this crap get maid?  i'll have more best of's in a bit.

      hello everyone. okay, so today one of my coworkers went to mcdonalds for lunch and super sizes his order. now, i haven't been to one for awhile so i was unaware of how enormous the super sized drink has become. it is gigantic!  i can't believe the chain uses a cup the size of a small popcorn cup in movie theatres. when i was in europe, the x-large serving size there was a large here... their large was a medium... and so forth. there are no all you can eat buffets there. it just makes me think of the american mentality that bigger is better. and as a result, we are making ourselves sick. not only from the mass food consumption but i think of other things... like how the hummer 2 is currently being marketed. because people really need a car that size. and that is making us sick too because those large utility vehicles are polluting our air faster than a small sedan. i just don't understand. when will moderation become fashionable?

      ah new year's resolutions....well i'm not making any official ones, but i did tell myself that once i got back to philly that i would go to the gym more and really WORK HARD on my research.  i don't know if either of those will pan out, but I will prolly end up going to the gym--not "more," just go.  and i will prolly work on my research...not hard, just work. hehe.  that's about it for me.  i go back on sunday BOOOOO!  :(  I don't want to go back.  5 more months...i'll just keep chanting that on the plane ride home.  i really don't think I could take staying there another 4-8 years.....yes, I need to be in CA.  I like Philly and all but I get wayyyyy too homesick.  Maybe it's b/c the redhead and my family are here...and more of my friends are here...I have like 3 friends I go out with there...less variety b/c they go to my school.  At least here I have little clumps of friends in various areas around So Cal and they all offer their own little variety of personalities.  Random question: how many of you know what a doctor of osteopathy(D.O.) is or ever heard of osteopathic medicine.  2nd random question: if your answer is yes...how'd you learn about it and what do you think of it?  Just wondering.  Explaination later.  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!  toodles.

      actually dorkus melorkus it has been about 2 weeks since you lasted blogged so not too bad ...  as for gifts this year i did alright. i got more simpsons stuff than i thought i would but i'm a bit bummed i didn't get as many dvds as i hoped for but hey what are you going to do about it right.   i went and saw me some  antwone fisher  and  real women have curves : AF - was great. i HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone. it is a good story and the acting is wonderful. RWHC - was good as well but i felt a bit too short. they could have developed some characters more, it almost seemed as though they ran out of money for the movie so they just ended it, eh who knows.  i still want to see gangs of new york, max, adaptation, about schmidt and of course lord of the rings: the two towers again .... hee hee that would no. 3 for me. i kinda of want to see the hours, standing in the shadows of motown and chicago. if there are any takers for these movies just give a me a ring. :)  random thoughts: it is going to be 2003 soon. oh my goodness. what have a done this year .... nothing much i guess, i just can't believe another year has gone by, sometimes i miss school ... well at the very least the 2pm naps and all the tv i use to watch. man i'm getting older and not wiser ... ha ha. okay so i offer this for you people who might actually read or post in the house ...  WHAT ARE YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOULTIONS  ... i know this is dumb because no one really keeps them but for me it would be to translate the hobbit into latin and like everyone hit the gym more ... ha ha okay that was from snl. not sure what mine really are ... i'll post them next time :P   music to my ears:  warsaw - joy divison

I am seriously in love with Billy Boyd who plays Pippin the Hobbit. His accent is hot!  Maid in Manhattan: Thumbs down! Need I say more? (no, you can't make me feel guilty for watching this movie. It is a makeover movie; therefore it is deemed okay to watch. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels: Thumbs up! If you like Guy Ritchie and Snatch, you will like this movie. It's really funny, you know, in a crime caper kind of way. Wanna watch: Catch Me if You Can, Adaptation, Lion King on IMAX Gonna start reading: Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence by Paul Feig, creator of Freaks and Geeks CD currently received: Smashing Pumpkins Earphoria DVDs received for Christmas: Toy Story/Toy Story2/ Bug's Life Boxed DVD Set, First season of Felicity (yes i might be 1 of the 5 people who have this) Waiting for: Joe Millionaire to air (guilty pleasure)  That's it with my boring pathetic life.

      hope everyone had a merry christmas.  i did pretty well this year in terms of gifts.  i especially loved the calendar juwanna made me that showed him wearing a wig for the month of january.  i think i'll take that to work and show off my hunky boyfriend.  anyway, the week has been way too boring and relaxing.  i've just been bumming around and hardly leaving the house.  it feels good not to work for almost 2 weeks.  (darth and new wave, you knew i had to throw that in.  ha ha) I haven't seen any movies lately...i just lead the most boring life possible i think.  but i do want to see 'catch me if you can', '25th hour', and 'about schmidt'. so if any of you have heard anything bad about these movies, please let me know so i won't waste my money. what's everyone doing for new years eve?  i have no plans whatsoever...if anyone knows of somewhere fun i can go...let me know.

      hello everyone. :o) hope you all had a merry christmas! mine was kind of dull. it's weird because christmas is suppose to be this special day but it doesn't really feel like it. maybe it's just me. that's the problem with special events and holidays. i have all these expectations and then nothing happens. the theatre was really crowded that day. i agree with the new wave review of catch me if you can. nice, mindless entertainment. i currently recommend adaptation. it was a lot funnier than i thought it would be. it's interesting how you can read a text or script one way and then when you see it acted out, it is completely different. i guess like shakespeare... it reminds me of how iago can be acted out as a sinister, evil character or a comical one. v. interesting.

      i went and saw me some  catch me if you can:  this is a good movie, not too serious and not too light. a good strong entertaining movie. christopher walken was great, i love him even if he is crazy and all.   well i hope everyone in the house had a nice holiday season. not sure if you fools have plans for new year's eve. i know i don't so i guess it is drinking at home in front of the boob tube .... ha ha. take care everyone and try to stay warm.   music to my ears:  i know for sure it is not christmas music ........ blech !!!!!!!!!!!

      hiya everyone. there are so many good holiday movies coming out... i'm so behind. i haven't even seen lotr yet! and i have to, since my men (elijah and orlando) are in it! ahhh! anyway, thanks for the review hedwig on gangs. i wasn't sure if i should see it or not... and now i'm leaning toward not. especially since it's 3 hours long. it takes a rare film for me to sit through that amount of time and not notice. surprisingly for me, chamber of secrets was one of them. it was better than the first and kept my attention throughout. since i haven't had a chance to go to the theatre, i've been watching some of my old dvds. has anyone seen pi? it is a really brilliant film. i even watched the director's commentary, and i rarely do that. new wave, i know what you mean about christmas. i feel like i'm living in a vacuum. i can't believe christmas is on wednesday because my life is so consumed by work. ((sigh)) oh my friends and i were talking about the vh1 80s series. gosh, it's so addicting. and i love the nostalia. i can't believe the things people use to do... what were they thinking!? i.e. acid wash denim and hair crimping!!! ewww...  has everyone finished their christmas shopping? i passed by the beverly center yesterday and it was a mad house. people are crazy. i would rather order online a few weeks ahead of christmas than wait until the weekend before and fight the masses. but that's just me... well, hope everyone has a very merry christmas and enjoys the time off to celebrate with family and friends!

      ah well it looks like i'm the only one w/ no life... i went to go see gangs of NY....this is just my lil critique of it--no spoilers here, but if you just absolutely don't want to hear anything about it then skip to the next paragraph if there is one--pros: acting is pretty good...daniel day lewis was really good; it looked cool--cinematography, costumes, time period etc; for guys--it showed a lot of breasts, but personally i odn't htink they were like great breasts...just breasts hehe...cons: it's 3 hours long, when it should have been only 2; it was slow in some parts--hence the 2 hour suggestion; the plot was...eh, it's been done, and done better; and most importantly...the ending was very anticlimactic and kinda left you there saying---wait so why did we sit here for 3 hours then?  so that's my 2 cents about that movie.  wait for the video.  mmm well that's all i really had to say.  take care all.

      hey popples, sorry i have also been away, business calls......working is way to hard, but to support my gambling problem i need to do it right? I'm somewhat lucky because i only need one shot of alcohol to get me pukey drunk so i don't need ot spend to much money on it. My favorite movies of the year have to include 40 days and 40 night, sweet home alabama, and the tuxedo.....i watched all 3 in the theater and I can really see each one being seen as a classic in the upcoming years. Okay I gotta get back to work now....GO CLIPPERS!!!!!!!!

      hey everyone sorry i haven't been around the house, busy and all, plus extremely tired lately. The tori show was soooooooooo great, she is a brilliant musician....some people just get all the talent. When you can play two instraments and sing at the same time, thats something special. Lord of the Rings was always really good. Not reading the book I really don't have anything to compare it with. Some parts were a little cheesy but overall its still great. Saw the preview for T3, it looks cool, but to me it doesn't seem like the previous eps, probably because of no james cameron. Not top 10 lists up yet, still going over my options, it will probably be a top 5 list. Golden globes came out today, good to see adam sandler get a nod for his quirky character in punch drunk love. some nods i'm a little more concerned about....(i.e. the greek wedding and unfaithful...i was told they both sucked, but whatevers to that)......gangs of new york comes out tommorrow, looks awesome.....i liked your new wave impression hedwig that was funny.....hahha.......i guess i should start my shopping now, i'm really bad cause of all my procrastination....oh well, i guess i'll have to endure the masses this weekend....sigh.......has anyone else caught any of VH1's I love the 80s series this week, it has brought back som many memories i don't even know where to begin...o.g. wwf, small wonder, smurfs, atari, just to mention a few and tonight ALF!!!!! man the 80s were weird....haha.......okay i shall return to the house soon.

      i'm so tired :(  i went and saw me some  lord of the rings: two towers:  and it was great. good movie but i did find some flaws ... i guess the biggest one being it did not follow the book as closely as the first one did. oh well still a very good movie and i'm going to see it again.  i've been so tired lately with work and the holidays that i just feel really really burnt out. i'm looking forward to my two days off next week, i know it's not a week (ha ha like you nick edney) but hey it is something right. it is sick how even work is taking away the holidays from me. i don't believe it will only be 6 more days till christmas. sheesh.  hey i just want to say sorry for bugging you guys to blog. i just think it is nice when there are a lot of people in the house but i know everyone is busy and caught up with stuff so i'm sorry if i come off as a nag.   music to my ears:  anything by the ramones ... you want garage rock pigern then listen to some ramones, they put white stripes, the strokes, the vines to shame ....

      i went and saw me some  tori amos : wonderful show ... she is truly one talented musican. it blows my mind the stuff she can do with a piano. tori's voice is in a class of its own, she can range from high to low and never misses a beat and can i just add she looks great, she is up there with shirley manson and debbie harry for hot chicks :). i was so amazed and in awe by tori, too bad i'm not a bigger tori fan or i would have LOVED it like darth did. don't get me wrong it was a great show but i don't know enough of her music/album to really soak it all in. she did play "sugar" and that totally reminded me of you FTC homie. you use to sing that all the time at the apt ... hee hee.   other thoughts:  yes where is everyone in the house. i guess they all went on a long extended vacation. well if you guys are reading this let me know that you want to be taken off the board and it will be done.  yes pigern - the white stripes are part of the whole tired garage rock thing that is going on ....... blech hedwig - cool that you saw vic ... ha ha E2E that is too funny. you know me, you and FTC are all still in the house representing, and i guess darth was an honory member of the hall  i'm out ....... too tired to say anything else   music to my ears:  china - tori amos ... and i found a new found love for cornflake girl

      hi everyone! omigosh, it's been so long since i last blogged! well, i have been trying to compile a list for best records of 2002... i wanted to put r.e.m.'s reveal until i realized it was 2001. darn! here are some in no particular order... ben kweller: sha sha (dorkus, i'm sure you agree?) white stripes: red blood cells (no, new wave, it's not just because of the whole 'garage rock' thing) bjork: family tree and/or greatest hits (you can't go wrong with bjork!) strokes: is this it -- hee hee, no i'm just kidding. it's good but not the "best" coldplay: a rush of blood to the head (seriously, better than parachutes. it's amazing. and i'm not a big fan but they won me over with this one) idlewild: american english (they just get better and better! i'm counting this one even though it hasn't been released in the states yet) haven: between the senses (produced by johnny marr... come on, anything related to the smiths can't go wrong right? hee hee.) lorien: under the waves (not sure if released here yet but absolutely brilliant. just when you think the last track was amazing, the next one blows you away) badly drawn boy: about a boy soundtrack (surprisingly, it outshines his full length album 'have you fed the fish?') death cab for cutie: you can play these songs with chords (b-sides the make you think, "these didn't make the album?") hm, stuck on the last one... i'll reluctantly end with nirvana: best of collection. (reluctant only because the collection feels like the first 15 minutes of a really good film. it leaves out much of their brilliance found in the rest of their albums. 'you know you're right' is enough reason for the album to make the list though. that single is tops!)

      ok ok i'll blog.  i tried blogging the other day, but the page was all retarded. sorry also that i'm too lazy to think up top 10 anythings...i'm on vay-K...no thinking can be done in this period of time.  so i went to oh sushi to some events company shindig...it was fun...music was good, drank before we came so i was having a good time.  saw some UCR peeps there...katipunan/909 flips--eh.  OHHHH slut, darth and new wave...Vic was there and he said hi.  I forget where he's living right now, but he's looking for a job...job market sucks right now.  He asked who I kept in touch w/ from "the hall" E2E!!! and I said you guys.  weird he keeps in touch w/ Dana...do u guys remember her?  it took me a good 10 min of him describing her until I remembered her.   so that wasn't the point in me mentioning i went to sushi oh....it was fun....until the fight...and i guess even the fight was cool....until they kicked everybody out.  the fight started off w/ the chicks...and then all of the guys started fighting...3 vs 1 it looked like...here was the progression of the fight....punches thrown....glass thrown...table turned over....some guy picks up a chair...holds it over his head and is waiting for the other 2 guys to stop beating the crap out of the one guy on the floor.....just when he's about to hit...a cop comes flying across the room and grabs the chair...then 5 other cops show up...friggin crazy.  DJ Icy Ice was like...."man y does it always have to be the dressed up ppl?  those banana republic wearin people always gotta mess stuff up" and he was kinda rowdying up the crowd...so everyone was yellin at the guys who were fighting b/c they killed the party...then the cops start getting all pissed off and kicked us out.  But wait! theres more!  It was the red head's friends bday....she was really drunk...and we were all waiting outside...and she decides to throw up on herself, shoes and all.  So the red head carries her to ralphs so she could walk around.....good times.  good times.  We actually talked to one of the guys that got caught up in it.  it wasn't really that he knew the ppl involved...he just got punched and started hitting back--lucky guy, the cops let him go.  he had a tat of "japanese pride"--gay hehe.  alright wooh what a rant---satisfied new wave?  :P   p.s. i agree that the music out there sux.  COS was better than the 1st...and i can't wait to see 2 towers.  :D  Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night! listening to: the gentle humming of my computer...and the soft pitter patter of the keys as i type.

       DUE TO THE HOLIDAYS EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE DECIDED TO DROP OFF THE FACE OF THE FRICKING PLANET AND DISAPPEAR .... THANKS GUYS :) AND I HOPE TO BE SEEING YOU SOON   top 10 best albums of 2002 (in no order)  *mum - finally we are no one (awesome live) *doves - the last broadcast (okay live) *pet shop boys - release (great live, not their best album but strong nonetheless) *sigur ros - () (brilliant live, not as strong as their last album) *wilco - yankee hotel foxtrot (a good cd considering their whole sob story) *aaliyah - i care for you (not the best but it does seeming fitting since her death :o( *nirvana - nirvana (def. not the best of their songs but "you know you're right" is great) *sleater kinney - one beat (good album but their older ones are better) *tori amos - scarlet's walk (good album but still love little earthquakes WAY more) *interpol - turn on the bright lights (the closest thing to joy division for me)  and that's all i could come up with and i was really pushing  it...man music is so bad right now  top 10 worst albums of 2002 - there were just too many. basically most of the music out there is crap and even after awhile the indie stuff starts sounding like crap. i think this year i found better music by going back in time to the 70's and 80's when music had a purpose ... to sound good.   top 10 best movies of 2002 (in no order)  *lord of the rings - the two towers (haven't seen it yet but i know i will like it) *punchdrunk love (found it entertaining in a disturbing way) *far from heaven (depressingly good) *red dragon (so much better than hannibal .... so so so much better) *minority report (just entertaining but the ending is so cheese ball happy - blech)  *about a boy (charming all the way through but the book is much better) *harry potter 2 - the chamber of secrets (much better than the first) *bowling for columbine (informative and funny) *panic room (entertaining and jodie foster kicks butt) *i have no idea what else was good .... i had to really think for 2002 ... i would put about schmidt or adaptation on here but i have to see them first  top 10 worst movies of 2002 - yet again TOO MANY to name. how do they greenlight some of the garbage out there ....... blech   see i was bored and i did all four, ha ha man i'm lame   movie to my eyes:   two weeks notice - it was good

      ok, so ive been thinking about my top ten list.  after discussing it with new wave, and after she decided that neither  beautifulgarbage  nor  rock steady  were eligible for a 2002 list, ive made some other choices.  (this is tentative and may be edited in the future)  8.  since music sucks nowadays:  my home-made best of the smiths & depeche mode cd (HAHAHA - anyway, ill be back to finish up later, when i can think of at least 3 more cds that i own and like enough to list here) 7.  paulina rubio -  border girl  (the new songs are cool, but love the new english versions of some of her best spanish stuff) 6.  mariah -  charmbracelet  (not the best mariah work, but ive been with her since "vision of love") 5.  juanes -  un día normal  (just a cool spanish album) 4.  garbage -  shut your mouth  (3cd uk singles  // features some bad-ass b-sides plus two versions of the video and an awesome cover of the stones' wild horses) 3.  shakira -  grandes éxitos  (a collection of most of her best spanish stuff, bronger, check it out) 2.  aaliyah -  i care 4 u  (although not a real best of, it includes alot of good songs and the new ones are also good) 1.  kylie minogue -  fever  (uk re-release featuring a bonus disc with remixes and unreleased tracks, note: "can't get blue monday out of my head" & "come into my world (fischerspooner mix)")

      Top 10 Best Albums of late 2001 - 2002:  I think Billboard did a great job, so those have to be my top 10!  Anyways here's my real top 10.  Chocolate: I Never Meant to Hurt Anyone Except You Queens of the Stone Age: Songs for the Deaf Jurassic 5: Power in Numbers Junction 18: This Vicious Cycle System of a Down: Toxicity Margot to the Rescue: It's Over! The Lawrence Arms/The Chinkees (Split): Present Day Memories Death on Wednesday: Buying the Lie Alkaline Trio/Hot Water Music (Split): I only liked the Alkaline Trio songs though. MXPX: Ten Years and Running (it's a comp, but I listen to it a lot, oh and I guess that Nirvana comp is cool too, but  Darth Bronger I think they need to get back together and start touring again.)

      too funny and true!! i just read a lil blurb on the billboard awards....what's going on w/ music today?   nelly(decent but best male artist?), ashanti?(can anyone say overrated?)  puddle of mudd---sweeping the rock category--which was last done by U2 ( YOU CAN'T COMPARE THEM TO U2!!!) not that they're bad, but they're not THAT good...avril *shaking head*  anyway i totally agree with you slut....so sad.  the only name i read that i guess actually deserves to be on that list is Eminem--hehe some of you may disagree but I think he's talented :D  anyway i dunno if i can really talk cuz i've been out of the music world...but ah well it's just my humble opinion.  i'll work on the top 10 thing after i get home....i have much to worry about...including my flight which I hope is not cancelled on thurs---supposed to have ice/snow/rain on wed and then like rain/ice on thurs morning :(  listening to josh groban-starry starry night------he's awesome great solid voice

      i haven't blogged in awhile ...  funny story about the bathroom mac ..... (LOSER) ha ha   hey pigern the reason why people at your workplace don't like books and cds is because YOU WORK IN L.A. where the people are shallow and love material goods, afterall it improves their self worth.  sorry hedwig no idea where you can get cheap disneyland tickets at :(  so yesterday i went with the "i love lucy" crew to medieval times and good fun was had by all. it was actually pretty entertaining considering how expensive it was ... not sure if i would ever go again. the highlight of the night was when this moron picture girl spilled pepsi on me and jason (the b-day boy) ... yea we both LOVED that but our fair bar wench was quite kind about the whole thing and gave us extra desserts.  okay so december will soon come to a rapid end and then 2003 will be upon us ... so i just thought ... to get some  people talking in the house ... you guys would want to do a top 10 for 2002 (PLEASE 2002 ONLY) - you can choose either best/worst albums or best/worst movies .... if you do all four then you are hardcore and have a lot of free time.  i haven't done mine yet but i will be posting it up shortly.    music to my ears:  miss you - aaliyah (go buy the i care 4 you cd with unreleased tracks and bonus dvd people !!!)

      hi everyone. i had every intention to blog for the past few days and i had quite a number of thoughts on what to blog but each time i returned home, i ate dinner and then watched an hour of telly and then went to sleep. sometimes no telly but just sleep. it's really pathetic what my life has become. so very unstimulating. and one of my coworkers keeps asking me, "so how do you like the job so far?" to which i have no idea what to say. the job is a job. i try to fake enthusiasm but it takes so much effort. what are you suppose to say? anyway, mac that is a funny story to which a similar incident happened to me. at my old job i was locked in the bathroom because the door handle was broken. and my coworkers were wondering why i was away for so long but thought it was weird to knock on the door and ask. so thirty minutes pass and i get desperate so i climb out the window... rather jumped out. and then explained to them that the bathroom door was locked from the inside. it's horrid to be locked in a confined space for so long. so mac, i take it your house bathroom does not have a window? i felt very 007 jumping out btw. hah hah. so at lunch today my coworkers were all talking about christmas gifts and what to get their girlfriends, etc. and i gave my suggestions (books, music) but they seemed appalled or shocked because these gift ideas were so "inexpensive" and "cheap." not exactly their words but their impressions from what i gather. so it just made me feel like if you got them something you know he/she would like, then why does it matter how much it costs? why should you feel obligated to get someone a louis vuitton purse because it is several hundred dollars to impress them? anyway, they said i would be an inexpensive girlfriend to shop for, which i'm not sure was a compliment. hm... hedwig, heard it is quite chilly in philly. hope you are keeping warm! the news says flights are delayed because of the amount of snow. final note, today was strom thurmond's birthday. he is 100 years old. and he is still south carolina's senator. and he was originally elected into the senate in 1933. can you believe it! and he has all of his abilities intact after so many years. well, you know, pretty much considering his age. makes you think about what he does to keep himself so fit! what i'm currently listening to: portishead's dummy and live at nyc. both brilliant! and on constant repeat to annoy and/or depress my work neighbour. hah hah.

      Thanks for the bathroom story mac, that entertained me all day. by the way were you blotto when you wrote that last blog? it seems to go from one topic to another...haha....I used to listen to a lot of tooth and nail stuff, but they whored their orginal artists out too, mabye they are getting good again. new wave friendships have to work both ways if only one is doing the work than something is wrong. Christmas shopping blows big time and I haven't even begun, and for that matter I'm not even looking forward to it. My office asked if I wanted to be a part of the secret santa and I said no, they kept bugging me about it so i explained to them that I would probably end up getting someone I don't know. From there I would have to go somewhere near them or talk to someone they know in order to find out what they like. so the lady in charge said and whats wrong with that? I answered with the great line from office space....."Its not that I'm lazy, its just that I don't care" To which she laughed and said, okay I see your point I won't bother you anymore. I figured out about how much time I spent in traffic this year, it made me sad....very very sad......

      currently listening to: slow coming day - when time stood still  where is everyone?  random thoughts.  the holiday season is cool, just the part about shopping for gifts is not.  getting locked in a bathroom is not fun, but it is funny.  i have no idea what to get people, or if i even should get some people gifts.  tooth & nail records has some good bands.  vagrant records whored their bands.  bill is lame, ted is cool.  mr. t is always cool.  i miss old cartoons, the new ones are lame.  this holiday season is going to be expensive, but i'm going to try to make it inexpensive.  man-wah should definitely be the next person in the vaseline ad.  eight crazy nights is not a good movie, but it made me laugh, because it had a lot of random things that came out of no where.  my hair is long, i look like a fob when i play basketball, but it looks cool and keeps me warm when i'm snowboarding.  i'm going to bed.

      currently listening to: watashi wa - all of me  new wave, if these two people are long time friends, shouldn't they both make the effort to make sure the friendship stays in tact?  i understand what you mean about the one party being the one that keeps in touch, but i think that it should be both ways.  i don't think the one friend is being stubborn, but maybe that person should try to resolve it with the other friend, and let them know what is going on, especially if they are old buddies, and what not, the other person would understand, being a real friend and all.    okay, so funny story.  i got locked in my own bathroom today.  it was excellent, because the door hinge was messed up.  so i had to call my mom from work to come home and try to open it from the outside.  but she couldn't open it.  so i call up hector and he comes to help, but once again it wouldn't open.  awesome stuff.  so finally i get some tools under the crack of the door and start working on the door knob, and i break it open.  it was fun stuff.  you know being stuck in the bathroom for about 1 1/2 hours may seem like it's fun, but it really is not.

      my gosh it is already december ... time flies when you are working .... i remember us moving into the house around july or something ... nick edney i'm not sure if i want to kick juwanna man out of the house just yet, he has some things going on but eventually i will  work blows ... sorry for talking about it but seriously what else am i doing with my life and i rather not think about all the time i spend in traffic because then i would be super depressed  okay so here is a thought: if two people are long time friends and one friend is always or most of the time making effort to maintain the friendship and then that one friend decides it is tried of doing that so he/she doesn't try anymore and then a third party mentions that the one friend should try to keep in touch with the other person don't you think the one friend has a right not to ... after all the one friend was maintaining the friendship before and got tired of it ... or do you think the one friend is being stubborn and big headed about the whole situation .... just a thought to stir in your brains.   music to my ears:  social distortion - down here with the rest of us  "no ones immune now, to a world of problems" "no ones exempt now, from world of pain!"

      hope you all had a happy thanksgiving.  pigern, i once calculated how much time i spend in the car per year and it's really really scary.  you all should do the same if you're bored one day.  the number will scare you.  just thought i'd share that with you.  anyway, my weekend was pretty laid back.  i finally saw "the ring" which i thought was not scary AT ALL.  but i must agree with everyone and say that naomi watts is pretty damn fine.  even my mom thought so.  ha ha.  the rest of the weekend i spent xmas shopping...yes xmas shopping for those who think it's way too early for that.  do you realize there are only 22 shopping days days left???? new wave, i think you should kick juwanna out of the house.

      ok i guess it depends on the meaning of known....does that mean you still talk to the person every so often...or what.  Cuz I know ppl from kindergarden that live in the Philippines and when I go back I talk to them or whatever, but I wouldn't call them good friends.....I mean if I never went back to the Philippines I probably would never speak to them again....so yeah.  the oldest friend that i semi-keep in touch w/ although we've had sort of a falling out is my friend Lance from high school.  I was thinking lately about reconnecting w/ some of my girlfriends from hs but...well i'm out here so that would be hard to do taht 3000 miles away(not 25k miles away as the whore from meet the folks said).  the redhead has kept in touch w/ ppl from elementary school....which i think is kinda cool.  I can't really keep in touch w/ ppl in elementary school cuz i moved around a lot....*shrug*    i had a crappy day at work....sleep would be relaly good right now......  listening to: the gentle hum of my computer.

      so one of my coworkers is leaving for a better job and i asked if he would keep in touch with people in the office. and he said of course... apparently he has kept in touch with people he's known since elementary school. i find this kind of unusual. so i will pose this question: what's the longest friendship you have had with someone? mine is high school. two friends i've known since high school. it's so easy to stop the lines of communication. but i wonder if that's part of our american culture. one of my comm professors said that his wife from japan still talks to all her elementary school pals whereas he said he hardly remembers any of his school mates. does it reflect poorly on a person who doesn't maintain such long standing relationships? just a pondering...

      on sunday i went to see coldplay perform for the jimmy kimmel show over at hollywood and highland. since there's no parking in that area, my friends and i actually took the metro! it's not bad… kind of reminded me of the tube. anyway, the crowd was pretty large but we somehow managed to find our way near the stage. although it was in the back, i had a perfect view of chris playing his piano. the network only aired their performance of ‘clocks’ but coldplay did four more songs (yellow, politik, shiver, and in my place). funny moments… girls throwing their bras and hosiery on stage (ewww) and when tampa bay players were flown in, raiders fans were booing and getting rowdy. that was kind of scary actually because the security was so lax. oh also when all those football players walked on stage, chris martin looked a little shaken. celebrity sighting: darth’s favourite actress gweneth (supporting her man). did anyone see joe millionaire tonight? brilliant moments were mojo’s puzzle that read ‘i choose you’ and melissa’s use of the word mercenary in which she said ‘i would like to go to third world countries and feed them… but that ‘s just me… i’m a mercenary.’ wait a minute, the last time i checked mercenary meant ‘working or done for payment only’ like a soldier for foreign country. idiot. and of course joe millionaire himself is such a wally he doesn’t even realize her misuse of the word.

      Hey everyone, hope you all had a nice weekend. This saturday went to the nfl experience with nkotb and his bro, it was a lot of fun, the only problem was the stupid nation was there in full force, i hate them so very very much. my intense hatred came into play more this weekend when someone was kind enough to stick gum on my bronco logo i have on my car, raider fans are ghetto and I hope now that they got their asses handed to them on a platter they will shut the hell up......i love how their fans were also rioting.....dumbasses you lost, you got killed and you riot? are you stupid......if they had won it would have been a thousand times worse.....god i hate them and i hope they die a horrible death.....haha.

      Oh yeah, new wave, Ryan Seacrest is already THAT gay, he's practically a woman. any of you hear kevin and bean talking about how gay he is? He actually admitted during an interview that he tints his eyelashes. Come on people! that's GAY!! it's so dumb how he gets all defensive when people call him gay.

      For those of you not interested in watching the superbowl this sunday, there is an Audrey Hepburn marathon on AMC. They will be playing Funny Face, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sabrina, My Fair Lady, Roman Holiday, and How to Steal a Million.  Today I had the day off so I rented The Good Girl and The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys. I liked both, but I think I liked the latter better. There is just something about coming of age stories set in the 70's (kinda like Almost Famous?) that appeals to me...and the animated sequences (Todd McFarlane) are great too.  Pigern, actually i went to target yesterday. thought about getting some new sheets (since they were on sale!). they were light blue and white, kinda polka dotted. in the end, i didn't get them though. have you seen the Swell vintage carry-on? it's navy blue, kinda airport-ish, and the inside is striped. very cute. i got the striped luggage strap....You picked up this month's YM with my future husband on the cover? Thanks!!..oh yeah, it would be a dream of mine to decorate my own place too. I was recently working at the CA Gift Show where you can pick up all kinds of great stuff for your home. I think I would go with a vintage French (toile) theme...

      All right everyone in the LA area or for people who will be here on Feb 16.  Nike is having a 5K/10K run, and it costs $20 to register.  Here's the catch it's called the Nike Run Hit Wonder.  What that means is that at every mile there will be a one hit wonder band playing.  The likes of  Flock of Seagulls, C&C Music Factory,  and last but definitely not least,  GERARDO !  So hope you people are not busy and make it out there.  Here is the link  urlLink Nike Run Hit Wonder  so go check out the details.

      oh my goodness ... am i in the right house. all you peeps blogged .... cool beans :)  american idol is classic right now. i know it is going to get boring once they pick the final 30 some people, so i'll just watch for now. highlight moments for me were the tall guy with the little voice and the guy who didn't know and couldn't sing the star spangle banner. there seemed to me more sob stories in this ep, like the boxer lady and her son and the girl with the mom who doesn't support her singing.   yea so superbowl weekend is coming up ... blech to the raiders, actually i don't really care because eh to sports for me. i just hope the lakers don't make it to the play offs, so tired of them always winning.   yes dorkus i think ryan can be gayer, he is SOOOO LAME.   yea there is so much reality tv out there it is sick and fun. kinda of a overkill but eh. a lot of good shows are waiting till feb. sweeps to get the viewers back.  so i learned sad news today ... my coworker is leaving, she gave her two weeks notice. she found a better job and i'm super happy for her but i mean no more work buddy :(   on the beat box:  home - pet shop boys

      wow so many blogs.  pigern you expressed what i wanted to say and so much more articulately than i could and that's why i didn't blog about it(re: Affirmative Axn). hehe.    i'm too am a reality junky how sad.  AI was hilarious but I'm not seeing any real talent w/ the ones they picked...so we'll see if it keeps my attn for long. that enrique guy was just disturbing.....i think he is on crack--and not the good kind hehe.   i stopped watching joe millionaire b/c the guy annoys me....i'm just waiting for the last ep.  i was flipping btwn bachelorette and AI...but more watching AI.  Bachelorette is getting kinda boring.  Anyone see Man vs Beast?  The red head was telling me about it.....yeah pretty bad.  I also have been watching H.S. reunion....pretty interesting.  I am wondering how that one show where america will set up two strangers to marry each other.  I think it would be hilarious if some really bored ppl just voted for the two most incompatible ppl to get married...that would be sad/funny.  oh and on AI...what was up w/ that one guy's voice?  Sounded like he was going through puberty but he was like this huge guy!  ok that's about it from here...take care everyone.

      Hey guys? I know it?s been a while since I last blogged.  I read regularly, but am too lazy to post my own.  Let?s see?Ok, so american idol is seriously the funniest show ever.  That Enrique guy was too hilarious.  And that one girl with the braids, ghostly white face, wearing the blue cardigan with a tie and plaid skirt?I love how they tell her she didn?t make it, and she?s like ?NO!? in a whiney voice.  Ha ha.  Good times.  Oh, and has anyone heard of that new reality show called bridezilla?  Or something like that.  It shows real brides preparing for their weddings?going  hysterical, whining, demanding?.some good quality tv. So, I?m gonna pick the raiders to win the super bowl this year.  I don?t really like them, but I know darth and juwanna hate them, so all the more fun for me. Yes, houstons was fun last weekend.  And why do you guys wanna see me and squirrely kiss so bad.  Kinda scary, cuz squirrely actually seemed into it.  Ha ha..just kidding.  But no, I can never imagine myself kissing another girl.  I just don?t see why guys get turned on by that kind of stuff.  Seriously.  Can one of you guys explain that? Already folks, gotta get back to work (or as new wave calls it?doing nothing).

      sorry ahead of time for the long rant. feel free to just ignore this... okay. so i was running the issue of affirmative action in my head... it has been a hot topic of late. and i can see darth's point. affirmative action on the surface seems to be reverse racism. in fact, in high school, i thought it was unfair. but it's really more complex than just giving 20 extra points to a person of color for consideration in college admissions. the reality is people are on an uneven playing field. what do high school students need to get to go to a good college? right now, good s.a.t. scores and a high g.p.a. pretty much. well, the s.a.t. test has been found to be racially biased. plus, those who are privileged to afford kaplan, etc. can achieve higher scores. then there's gpas where colleges are trying to compare students from different high schools and judge them the same. it can't be done. so you have the higher, priveleged students on an elevated plateau and the disadvantage students on a lower one. and even if we decide to forget all this and say, judge them the same. it still doesn't happen anyway. people who have a privileged background and money and connections are more likely to be accepted into a good college, especially ivy leagues. i'm not even talking about dubya... look at the celebrities. we need to develop an education system that gives everyone a fair shot... otherwise the people who are disadvantaged are almost guaranteed to stay that way. and that's what's really unfair.

      hey everyone. sooo much junk tv on tonight. but american idol was pretty brilliant. did anyone see the guy who acted like enrique? and sang his escape song. it was hilarious. he was screaming the lyrics at this awful pitch and refused to leave. when it narrows down to just the talented people, i think it gets kind of boring. the weirdos and attitude-y people make the show interesting. that's why simon is so great.  and meet the folks was good tv too. i especially liked it when they quizzed the girls with simple trivia like... how many states are there in the u.s. and this ditzy girl says 52. how can people not know how many states there are in the country they live in? bizarre. okay, so i've officially become a reality tv junkie.

I have been studying for my GRE lately and I have discovered something that i already knew, but its still painful...my vocabulary is very very uh...er..um..small.....haha.....okay those are my thoughts for the day and i won't wait so long to blog next time....peace

      so FTC brought this topic up earlier about affirmative action and u. of mich. thing .... well on the current cover of newsweek it reads do we still need affirmative action. i think by making that statement it is answering its own question. if we didn't need it then even ask a question like that. do i think affirmative action right now is perfect .... no not by any means, however at least it is something for people who have disadvantages.  houston's this past sat. was cool except for the TWO HOUR wait. so stupid. oh and the fact that nick edney and shirley would not kiss. what a rip. they would have gotten 20 bucks if they just did an open mouth kiss ... come on people ... ha ha.  man reality tv is the best, it makes you feel so much better about yourself. perfect example - joe millionarie and meet my folks ... WOW where do they find these people and now american idol will start up again.    on the beat box:  sparks - royksopp

      Hi everybody.  I'm out of it I think, so I don't know anything that's going on right now.  Why?  I have no idea.  I've been listening to a lot of music lately, it's pretty relaxing in a way.  Here's a short list of bands that have been going into my ears.  U2, Junction 18, Dave Matthews, Pop Unknown, NOFX.  I really have nothing interesting to say, how sad.

      did anyone watch the golden globes? it was kind of dull. but most award shows are i guess. i haven't seen a lot of the films nominated actually. and i am indifferent to who wins so maybe that's why i find it so boring.  i agree with you hedwig... i can't believe kangaroo jack debuted at number one. when i first saw the trailer i thought, "who the heck would want to see that tripe!?!" but i guess i overestimated the mentality of the american public. hah hah. my only other explanation would be that people saw it to see how bad it could be... my guess, pretty bad. anyway, dorkus the tribute concert sounded fun. lots of good artists. i'm not a elton john fan though so i would probably sit there dumbly, not recognizing any of the songs. has anyone been to target lately? cynthia rowley and ilene rosenzweig have come out with a cute collection of housewares. and it's all on sale. :o) take care all!

      last night i went to the Yamaha Elton John Tribute Concert at the Pond, featuring Vanessa Carlton, Ray Charles, Bruce Hornsby, Jewel, Norah Jones :), John Mayer, Brian McKnight, Randy Newman, Rufus Wainwright and a couple others. It was a cool event to go to, but needed to be a little more organized. Eric McCormack (Will from Will and Grace) was the host, and he sang a song too. (the company i work for produces the NAMM show, so we got free tickets.i don't care that they were nosebleed seats, tickets were going for $75-$300 for charity) i would have to say the highlight was Ray Charles (and his standing ovation), and Nora Jones' rendition of Tiny Dancer (favorite elton john song!). after the show, Vanessa Carlton and her people walked right by me, and i missed the chance to trip her. damn! shoulda done it! (she deserved it for ruining 'Don't let the sun go down on me' with her whiny nasally voice!)  SO glad Harry Potter 5 is finally gonna be out in June. the last one left me on the edge of my seat! (yes, i am a nerd like that). anyway, for you HP fans who don't already know yet, you can reserve your book at Borders and get 40% off! (such a deal!). OR if you are a walden books preferred card reader (like me), you can also do the same.  yuck no Monday off for me either :(

      so this is a three day weekend but not for me since my boss is cheap like a mofo and doesn't/hardly gives us time off. ha ha sad part is after awhile you just get us to it. at least traffic that day won't be bad.   wow the harry potter book is FINALLY coming out. sheesh how long has it been.  yes t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y dubya is a retard but the sad part is he might win in 2004 and become our president again because the democrats don't have anyone good running against him. how scary is that ... another four more years of his bullcrap ..... what a sad, sad world we live in.  does anyone still read this ???? hello hello is anyone here (calling out in the empty house) i was just wondering. i mean no one blogs anymore. at first i thought it was the holidays but nope i was wrong. eh oh well ... i guess all of you have lives. man i have no life. how lame am i :(    on the beat box:  in space - royksopp

      ok, so im watching this thing on affirmative action on tv (stemming from the issue at u of michigan).  anyway, the devil spoke his opinion on the issue (george dubya, of course)  and of course, like all republicans, hes against it.  ( urlLink here's the story at abcnews.com ) but the entertaining part was when a reporter asked one of his people (didnt catch who it was) if the president thought it was fair of him to receive a preference by yale for merely being the son of a graduate.  of course the question was avioded.  funny how people only like things that will benefit them (e.g., tax breaks).   what a sad, sad world

      just a quick rant on joe millionaire...i liked how last night when he was explaining why he chose certain girls....he said something about one girl, "She's cool, but I'm not sure if she's really into me, but she's hot so I picked her."  Duuuuuuuh.  Geez!  I dind't really watch the show intently last night b/c i was on the phone, but this guy seems to have like no personality...is it just me?  So I assume that these women are seeing him for his money......and well, isn't that the premise of the show?  Such a shame.  hehe.

      okay... my last rant on excess. a new book has been released titled 'fat land: how americans became the fattest people in the world.'  yes, what an honor.  oh and before i forget! on the travel channel, they featured the 'battle of the buffets' in which two 400+ lb. men attempted to eat a full course meal in a matter of minutes. they used shovels rather than utensils. it was weird... i was horrified but powerless to change the channel. speaking of t.v., joe millionaire is great. joe himself --evan-- is classic. my favourite line, "she looked like a million bucks. not that i know what a million bucks looks like."  yes, we get it.  you are poor.  geez. what an idiot. but this idiocy satisifes as a brilliant form of entertainment. ahh, the irony.

      i went and saw me some  narc:  it is a really really really good movie. should everyone see it ... NO. the movie was very dark and grim, which was fitting but most likely you will not leave with a good feeling inside. the movie makes you think and it sort of distrubs you.  random thoughts:  - i have to go to the dentist tomorrow which i am not looking forward to. see i haven't been in awhile, hence my bad breath all the time, anyway yea i'm just worried he is going to find all these things wrong with my teeth and i'm going to have to have all of them pulled out. ack. - how do they greenlight such bad movies out there. i'm mind boggled by that. i saw the preview for the movie "the core". oh my goodness that looks so bad i don't even know where to begin. i also like how i heard that the new j. lo and ben a. movie "gigla" or something was SO BAD that people walked out ... ha ha that is great. - staying on the topic of how bad some movies are let's go to how bad some music is. i like how the new music week on mtv is made up of bands like the donnas, new found glory, good charlotte and the used ... WTF. they all suck so bad oh my gosh where do i even start ... and talking about the used i like how that guy bert who is with kelly osbourne was wearing a midtown and good charlotte shirt on one ep ... man i sincerely hope he was mocking them and not admiring them but i have a bad feeling it is the second one ...

      yeah i saw joe millionaire...it's friggin hilarious and kinda sad to see all those women gawking at his riches.  the guy didn't seem that dumb...but yeah..i. wonder if it's ALL an act...or like did they really pick someone who's a good person and all that.......but from what i read in this article :  urlLink Joe Millionaire   i hope that link works.....he doesn't sound too great a man.  i also watched the bachelorette on abc.....i think it's awesome hehe...a girl calling the shots.  but i lost a bit of respect for her since i found out she dropped a career as a physical therapist to pursue a TV career.  i guess she's just capitalizing on her "fame."  she's really pretty though. :)  when i was watching it...and she picked the black dude who wasn't even really that cute....and the not so thin, but funny personality guy...i coudln't help but wonder if she did that for a "reason."  Just my conspiracy mind turning some wheels.  Also I was upset that the only 2 asian guys weren't even all that cute and she didn't spend any time talking to them.  They coulda put some russel wong looking guy on there man...that would have been cool.  anyway, see how lame I am?  no life.  MUST SEE TV IS ON TONIGHT! :D  listening to: 1983-John Mayer

      man i've so been MIA, sheesh .......  just to let some of you know the blogger page isn't always the best. i know some of you have tried to post before and then checked and nothing happened. well the site sucks sometimes but can you really get mad considering this service is free. one way to make sure you post is to hit the post & publish button at the right top corner.   nothing much to talk about ... i'm back to full weeks of work which scares me. i don't have a day off for at least 95 whole work days. i try not to think about it or i will kill myself.   i hung out with jane and dorkus melorkus this past friday. it was good see jane since i haven't seen her in seriously like AGES. ha ha. it was funny going back to the inland empire aka the ie. i saw bakers and all the white trash people i could handle ... it was great (okay not really) ha ha.   what is with this whack weather people. first it is hotter than ever then it rains and then it is cloudy then super windy, sheesh will they just make up their mind.  did anyone see joe millionarie on FOX. man that guy is dumb and i mean DUMB. he is a perfect example of why people should go and get an education and he's not even good looking. blech ... i like how he is milking this for all it is worth. i guess everyone wants their 15 mins.    on the beat box:  retro - new order ... okay this isn't a song but actually the new order box set that came out this past tuesday.

      hi everyone. haven't blogged in awhile... because i'm antisocial (note the imood). hee hee. it's pretty weird to get back to a full work week after the holidays... difficult to get back into the swing of things. the weather in l.a. has been strange lately. suddenly it feels like we are in the middle of summer.  an annoying coworker thinks it's great... i'm bet it's global warming. i hear migratory animals are changing their flight patterns because of it.  hedwig, no idea where you can get that jack in the box commercial. i remember one of my old college mates really liked that jack in the box spoof one with the meaty cheesy boys. hee hee. dorkus, my friend is going with me to the friday bk show! yay! i'm seeing him twice! btw, i've been looking to buy my own copy of naked and can't find it... strange. well, i've only looked at three locations but i didn't think it would take more than three. currently reading: the best american non-required reading, edited by david eggers. ab fab read ;o)

      happy new year!  hope everyone had a safe night partying.  (or starting an x-files tradition :)) i have a ton of new year's resolutions, and i'm hoping that i'll be able to keep at least 1 of them.  so here they are: 1.  stop biting my nails 2.  stop being so lazy 3.  be more organized (stop losing things) 4.  do one active thing a day (running, lift weights, etc., play golf, etc.) 5.  be a better friend to those that really matter 6.  stop living a routine life (be more spontaneous) 7.  live a happier life (stop worrying so much)  i think the biting nails one can be accomplished...might be the only one actually.  if anyone sees me biting my nails, please yell at me.

      so tired. this has been a LONG WEEK for me. work is beating the living crap out of me. i always feel like i don't have enough time to do stuff. ugh. oh well. i got to clean up my r & b cds a bit so that was good. i came across my aaliyah i care for you cd and SERIOUSLY aaliyah will be missed :( ... she was so great and had so much going for her. i think God likes to be surrounded by wonderful people :) ... that's why God took Mr. Rogers as well.   ha ha pigern yes your book blog page is very deck. ha ha it is so deck, it is not fin at all. okay okay enough of the hipster talk. btw ucla blows ...  mac the knife so your new place at sd is pretty deck huh. cool cool. it must be nice to move out ... sometimes i wish i did but then i remember how much money i save and i get over it.   anyone down for cradle 2 the grave. i'm going to see it on sunday so if anyone wants to join ... ha ha i'm a jet li fan all the way ... good times   on the beat box:  missy elliot - back in the day

      hello all. it's been awhile since i've last blogged. i've actually started another blog page for a book club i formed with some friends. it's pretty deck (hipster version of "cool"). :o) it will be like i'm in school again... having my discussions in english class. seriously though, just cause i was an english major, people usually want me to proof their stuff. kind of weird since my classes weren't about grammar or anything. anyway, looking back, i wish i did more fun things while i was in school. took more chances and studied less. i guess at the time you think grades are super important (and they do matter) but then once you graduate, you kind of regret what you didn't do. or at least i kind of do... there are all these great events at ucla coming up. one, mcsweeneys v. they might be giants - a type of music v. written word thing. two, david sedaris. and three, the annual l.a. times book fair. i wish i went last year. i lived right in the neighborhood! so i wouldn't have to pay for parking like i will now. ((sigh)) but i hate how filthy the campus gets. thousands of people on campus makes for a big mess. okay, i have a query: if you recommend someone for a position and the company decides to hire her but she backs out kind of last minute and decides she doesn't want the position, does it make you look bad? like, the company will think, why did she recommend this girl when she doesn't want to even work here? just a little concern of mine at the moment.

      So I moved into my new place in San Diego.  It's pretty neato burrito, but it's very boring.  Well at least my neighborhood is.  I was excited though because I found an Arby's while I was driving around.  I was craving it so I guess it was a treat.  Other than that the only form of entertainment I have is my local Blockbuster.  Yep good times.  Anyways I start work next week.  My 7 month vacation has now ended, and now I have to join the working world.  What a shame.  So if you're ever in SD for some apparent reason drop on by.  So NKOTB i'll see you when you want to go to Barona, and Darth i'll be seeing you when the Chargers play the Broncos.  Then we'll go eat at Seau's after!

      i went and saw me some  old school:  and man was it funny. ha ha i mean it is not great but pretty funny. i really liked vince v. 's character. will f. was just as good though. yea you guys should all go see it .... earmuffs :)  as for the whole coldplay thing ... don't even get me started. when they first came on the scene with parachutes i thought eh okay. that song yellow was killed by the radio but their other songs like shiver and spies were actually really good. then they came out with a rush of blood to the head and everyone loved them even more. i actually thought that album was weaker. personally i think coldplay is more of a media darling because chris martin is way easier to talk to then strange and weird lazy eye thom yorke. but seriously RAIDOHEAD is brilliant. if you have ever seen the live you would know what i was talking about. so so so great. as for comparing them to U2 that is crazy talk, not even in the same league and i don't even like U2. ha ha.  as for good music mac the knife ... honestly there really isn't anything good. if anything i say pick another genre of music like jazz, hip hop, r and b or electronica beacuse at least you will have another sound to listen to.  working is really wearing me out. with my cowoker gone and the new chick doing only half the work i am so feeling it. oh well .... got to keep doing it ... i hope i get a raise though. that would be great.   on the beat box:  massive attack - special cases

      well it wouldn't sound very intriguing if they called it "Has-been" shows now would it?  and about the U2-coldplay comparison......HELL NO they will NOT be the next U2 if I have anything to say about it.  I'll pass along what my friend was saying the other day: they are Radiohead-wannabees.  it's not that i hate their music...they're ALRIGHT...they are NOT U2.  I think that's what's wrong w/ music today...everything is just "alright."  Much like how Simon and Randy view the American Idol finalists: I'm not blown away or anything.  And the media or whatever totally overrate all these artists.  Take for example 50 cent....not centS but CENT.  wtf.  Anyway, seriously, what's the big deal?  If he didnt' have such fresh beats which are prolly thanks to the producers...his rap would be crap.  He sounds like Ben Stein rapping....MO-NO-TONE.  And his face looks about as excited as someone who had overdone the botox.  Again, it's not that i don't like his music, cuz the beats are nice, he's just alright....but....if i remember correctly, some dumbass vj on mtv said he was to the rap world as the beatles were to pop or whatever. WTF????  same thing goes for ashanti.  *shrug*  ok i'll stop my ramblings..... listening to: outkast--and the whole world..........loves it when you don't get down......bapapada!  GOING TO NY TO CLUB TOMORROW! woohoo  oh and i forgot.....what's up w/ the club tragedies?  it was so depressing today to hear about rhode island....:(

      Darth what's wrong with the French?? Man they gave us pommes frites America's favorite food.  Damn reality t.v. sucks.  But I hope Robin Leach gets off that show before he exerts himself too much and passes out or worse.  And why do they title these "Celebrity" shows?  I have yet to see one legit celebrity on any of these shows, well minus the Gary Coleman Stardates or whatever, where his date picked him up, haha.    Why is Coldplay getting so much publicity?  They aren't that good, today I just heard that they could be the next U2???  What the heck is that?  I'm not saying that they are bad, but they aren't that great either.  Radiohead.......  Anyways I was just wondering once again why music sucks so bad now.  I've resorted to K - Earth and it's oldies.  I'm waiting for something new to sound good again.  Suggestions anyone?  Hedwig, Pomona has lots of places with cheap rent and should be fairly easy to find.  The only thing is that it smells really bad out there because of Cal Poly's damn farm animals.  I don't really know where you will be working or what you'll be doing but maybe try to live in Montclair/Claremont? area, it's a lot nicer.

Oh that AI best/worst thing was a rip off...they didn't show any real new ones.   i am bored at work...what else is new.    well about the marriage and kids...i'm lookin fwd to that....and i'm not done w/ school yet so i have that to "look forward" to.  i just can't wait until i find out if i get into med school...then i can rest easy for a while and have a set agenda instead of wondering where i'll be in the next year.  hopefully it's pomona.  anyone know where there is cheap rent over there?  3 more months in this city...i'll miss it but i can't wait to be home for real.  :)

      eh about the whole french people thing ... who cares ... ha ha  i went and saw me some  the life of david gale: not a bad movie but not the best. it was pretty good though, i can't really complain considering i paid nothing for it. kevin spacey was great in the movie but isn't he always. kate winslet was good as well but kinda of forgettable, i think just her character was. i think it is one of the better movie out there for people to go see compared to other crap like daredevil.  yea dorkus sarah supposely gave joe stupid a bj ... nice huh. ha ha. the best of the worst from AI was one giant clip show. it was okay, i didn't watch all of it. seriously what happened to eden's crush ... oh i know i think their label dropped them and all those girls had such huge egos they killed each other. ha ha great if that were true.  anyone going to coachella this year. i wasn't going to but i think i am now because blur is playing ... man they are so great ... but who knows.  random thought: so basically we have nothing to really look forward to as we get older expect getting married and having a family. we can get those master degrees and advance in our jobs/careers but that's pretty much it huh. hmmm i miss being a kid so much, so very very much :*   on the beat box:  grinding halt - the cure (old cure)

      reality tv, is hardly reality yet we all continue to watch.....why? oh i know cause its funny.....haha.....joe millionaire was kinda a let down ending cause i wanted someone just to go off on him, that would have been way cooler....i read that joe had a good size number of men in its demographics for ratings, whereas the bachelorette was mainly female....why is this since they are basically the same show? I think its cause men were hoping that the girl would dump him for not having the money thus men being able to say all women are gold digging whores.....thats just my thought.......at work right now, my office looks like a bomb went off, i need more space......did anyone else see the married with children reunion special this past sunday? i loved the show but aren't reunions usually many years down ther road not just a few? but hey its fox so what can you really say? ...in closing am I the only one here who hates the french? just checking

      the bachelorette was SOOO much better than shmoe millionaire.  so much more romantic and magical.  i won't say who she picked but it wouldn't have mattered b/c it was still better.  anyhow...that's all i really wanted to say hehe.  :P

      are we in the UK .... are we british ...... what is with your post pigern ... all proper and formal and the usage of "u" in words like favorite. ha ha i mean i know we aren't the greatest country out there and we have this need to "help" aka control other countries smaller and weaker than oursleves but we are still in america. yea they are way more liberal up north .... not like LA folks where their biggest concerns are how nice our clothes look, how great our skin looks, and the nicest car to drive. i hate LA .... darn superficial people.  as for joe dumillionaire i didn't watch because i was trying to catch up on my jacko news. but i did see the part about zora's life and seriously was this lady for real. her name should be saint zora, she seems WAY TOO KIND to be on this horrible horrible fox show. oh well. the reality tv is getting kinda of crazy, all these people wanting their 15 mins.   on the beat box:  harold and joe - the cure (i'm so madly in love with them)

      last blog on joe millionaire (really!) hee hee. my favourite part of the finale was when sara mouthed to melissa about her little bj with evan. hah hah. i imagined fox producers sitting around reading her lips on camera so they could provide the viewers with subtitles.  i'm happy zora won and she got half a million but i definitely think she is too good for evan. he's idiotic. alright, that's all for now.... until the next good reality television show!!! married by america perhaps? hee hee.

      hi everyone. just got back from my trip to berkeley. the trip was a bit of a nightmare... in terms of the airport. i can't believe the amount of security for my flight, which is only an hour and in the same state. a terrorist wouldn't make as much of an impact on that plane. i don't know... i just wouldn't think a local, small trip like that would require the level of precaution the airline took. there were even signs that read 'don't joke about terrorism.' anyway, besides the ordeal of travelling, i really enjoyed being up north. people seemed a lot more aware of the situation in iraq. you couldn't turn anywhere without seeing signs for peace and ones reading 'no war in iraq' or 'no blood for oil.' people even sewed on their own sayings ('drop bush, not bombs'). in san fran there was a huge peace rally and 200k people showed up. people donated blood and received a symbolic tin of oil.  the last night i was there went sour though because my friend and i were forced to wait outside the fillmore... her roommate got backstage passes to see interpol and we were her ride. she made us wait for an hour and then decided she was going to the after-party. let's just say that negative experience made me harbor hostile feelings toward interpol. tossers.

      Wow everyone is really into this reality T.V. craze.  Anyways I just wanted to mention that I saw my reality T.V. hero yesterday at Amoeba, Johnny Knoxville.  I was in awe, that's only the second time I felt like that, well after Gary Coleman, errr I meant Slash from G n' R.  Oh and sad news was brought upon me yesterday by Darth, with  the passing of Kurt "Mr Perfect" Hennig.  Sorry wrestling fans....

      yes joe millionaire was terrible yesterday. what a bunch of rubbish. they kept playing all these bad flashback scenes. was it just me or did it seem like a college film student edited that entire ep. what was with the cheesy white fuzzy border around each flashback and the lame font choice below. geez. and i really don't like sarah, what a whore but you know who knows if zora is as nice as she seems on tv. she could be a crazy witch. ha ha.  did anyone catch american idol today. it was pretty dull overall but ruben was seriously the best. he can honestly sing unlike the other people on the show. i voted for him :)   man my life has offically become so lame that i'm actually voting for this stupid american idol stuff. i use to never care. oh well. i feel like i'm totally out of the loop on cds and dvds. i don't feel like buying anymore because i hard listen to or watch the ones i have right now.  just a random note to NKOTB RULE! - GOD is wonderful and everyday i thank HIM for all that HE has blessed us with.    on the beat box:  zwan - endless summer

      i was very annoyed as well about last night's episode.  and in the tv guide, it said he was going to pick one of the girls last night.  oh, and hedwig, i've been thinking that the "twist" is exactly what you said.  cuz the butler kept saying, if you think you know what's going to happen, you're in for a big surprise.  So i think the twist is that the show is fooling the viewers.  but that would be stupid cuz then what would be the point of the show.   i usually love the rain, but today i hated it.  and my biggest pet peeve is when the news stations have "storm watch" for their lead-in story.  so stupid.

      i TOTALLY agree w/ you pigern....man that pissed me off...b/c they kept saying..."next, evan has to blah blah blah"....and you expect him to pick the girl at the end...i wanted to sock that butler when he said, "OH but you'll have to wait til next week."  A two hour freakin production of the 25 girls telling us what they think of Evan and his "lie"....WHO CARES?!  just get to the good stuff.   i have this theory that he really is a millionare...Marriot....think about it.  i wonder if that's the "twist" they keep talking about.  maybe the twist is that he's really gay.  haha.  he's a neanderthal....spelling?  OH and that clip of Melissa(is it?) saying that she was a "mercenary" classic.    i hate work...but most of all i hate the fact that i lose heat every weekend.  i'm fighting my landlord/boss really hard about it.  i'm sure they're getting annoyed w/ me asking...but damn!  fix the F****ing heat already!    application update:  i got an interview for Drexel U Med school and Touro Osteopathic Med Coll.  woohoo...AND i get 2 weeks spring break because of my Touro interview---HOORAY for me!!!  listening to: the boring silence that is work(better than having a customer asking for money w/ no collateral bleh)

      hey everyone. okay, who's upset about the rip-off joe millionaire episode tonight? who's with me? it was a clip show. a bloody clip show! and i thought at least they would reveal the girl he picks in the end. but noooo. man, fox is milking this for all its worth. hey hedwig, i'm with you. i hope he picks zora. sarah bugs. although evan himself is no catch. for all you reality tv fans, i saw simon cowell at the century city mall. he was stopped by an enthusiastic man who claimed he loved the show. this made me think that simon probably thought the confrontation was odd since in england, people whisper when they see a celeb. not outright talk to them. anyway, i had a crappy day at work. it's pretty bad when you wish for the weekend already and it's only monday. and a coworker almost blew up in my face... not my fault. he was just having a bad day and was throwing attitude to everyone. but i was upset because that's so unprofessional. and very uncalled for.  oh! dorkus. lucky magazine is sponsoring a shopping spree for our company at the grove. we get lucky bucks and get to buy whatever we want (and keep it!). and then we go to dinner at madame wu's and they award prizes to those with the best lucky buys. i can't wait. new wave thinks it's both boring and lame. hah hah. i'm superficial.

      Hey guys?I?m here to do my monthly blog.  It?s been a tiring week.  And it?s only Wednesday.  Wild bill?s was interesting.  Piling ribs and chicken in a bucket is not too appetizing, nor was the soup that looked like beans in a pail.  But fun was had by all, although I would?ve gone to medieval times any day over wild bill?s.   About the whole friendship thing?.longest friendships for me are mac and eric.  I don?t really think the duration of your friendship really says anything about the friendship itself.  Some people just don?t find the person that they connect with the most until way later in life.   I?m planning on a week long vacation for the summer.  Somewhere near the water?mexico, florida, whatever?does anyone know where I can get really cheap deals on vacation packages or things like that?

      hi everyone. i just got back from wild bill's with new wave, darth, nick, etc. it was... interesting. semi-entertaining. i feel really sick from the food though, which was served in buckets. it's weird, they don't even try to make it appetizing. they just pile on the food and expect everyone to eat like pigs. and the drinks come in pitchers, not a cup at a time. i imagine the kitchen is filled with vats where they cook huge amounts of the soup, the ribs, etc. anyway, the show was v. cheesy but sort of entertaining. if you like song and dance numbers, while eating mass amounts of food, then you would enjoy it. so the mc announced that there was a group from japan. i bet they were really enjoying themselves. can you imagine what they were thinking being served allll this food? and at such a cheap price? only in america.  oh, i was reading this article and it told the amount of calories in a starbucks venti vanilla latte. mind you this is not even the frappe but just the latte (espresso, milk, and vanilla flavouring). it was 870 calories! i think that included whipped cream. it made me think about that mcdonalds case where those people sued the fast food chain for making them fat. it's true that the restaurant can't be held responsible for their bad decisions but there should be some sources readily available that tell people the nutritional content of food. i had no idea a starbucks drink has that many calories... and a whopping amount of fat. i remember being interested in knowing the amount of calories in a latte (since i consume them so regularly) and could not find it anywhere on the starbucks site. and i bet everyone thinks the drinks are zero calories since it's just "coffee."

           HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR      i know this is a day late. it is the year of the goat/ram so it is our year people :) well people who were born in 1979.  man it sucks being sick. i can't eat anything good and i'm all weak and tired :( i had to miss out on two get togethers because of it ... blech. oh well.   i stand by my theory that all celebrities are messed up but can you honestly blame them. they are always being looked at and judged that you have to think that will warp someone's outlook on life. i think just being an average joe is good enough in the world.  btw nice blog mac the knife. i like how you could hardly type. ha ha. being blotto is great.  really sad about the columbia situation. these people were young and had families, it just seems so sad ... :( no matter how advanced man becomes there are forces out there that we can not figure out.   on the beat box:  nothing

      hey so the rep from lucky mag came to the office to present a few days ago and while we were waiting for everyone to file in, she was sharing her anecdotes from when she was a celebrity agent. she basically was responsible for a certain group of celebrities... meeting their every needs. and my coworkers and i were like, wow that sounds so fun. but she told us it was horrible and how warped/bitchy the celebrities were. one of hers was minnie driver and she told us that minnie knew all about the breakup with matt before he announced it on oprah but she claimed she didn't so she could get sympathy and make him seem like a jerk. and how ashley judd was really "wacky" and demanding even though we all countered how nice we thought she was. so i guess new wave's theory re: celebrities is right... they are warped, self-centered and have a superiority complex. i bet even elijah wood isn't as "down-to-earth" as he claims. i guess when everyone treats you like a god, you kind of think of yourself as one.

      Currently listening to:  My Heart Will Go On - Celine Dion  jk.  Celine Dion is crazy....good voice or not, she's insane.I mean come on, who would make a song solely for a car?  "I Drove All Night" that's just crap.  Anyways that asian boy from Stanford sounds like he needs a reality check.  Even though there are white people that do have the Asian fetish, it's not all of them.  The guy is probably just mad because he can't get a girl because he's a pompous ass, not because the w.p. are stealing them from him.  Also if he opened up his narrow vision then he can see that some Asian guys have the same thing, they like white girls, cause it's their fetish.  He's actually probably mad because he tried to go for some white girl and she rejected him, and is a bitter, bitter being now.  Date whoever you want to date, for whatever reason it may be, I mean if two people like each other who cares?  If you are happy where you are and the onlookers have something to say, they obviously have a chip on their shoulder that they sorely need fixed.

      haha funny blog dorkus.  yeah hearing about that CD show alone is bad enough.  why would you put yourself through that misery?  i think she's finally cracked....like before she was going downhill...but now it's like at the bottom of the hill there is a cliff and she finally fell over it.  interracial dating...speaking as someone who has never gone out w/ asians...i agree w/ dorkus.  not that i would never go out w/ an asian guy...it's just the opportunity never presented itself and i'm more attracted to non-asians.  maybe i'll get my chance at an asian guy soon hehe.  speaking of dating...i miss the red head.  and paradoxically(is that a word?)...i'm not ready to talk to him just yet.  oh well....this too shall pass.    listening to: slow motion--3Eb

      I am seriously traumatized and damaged for life because of one silly mistake I made while in Vegas. I thought it would be funny to vistit the Celine Dion store while at Caesar's Palace. Boy was I wrong! I will never regret anything in life as much as I regret this:  Imagine walking into a store full of Celine Dion (CD) freaks. "My Heart Will Go On" is blasted on the speakers, so you immediately cover your ears upon entering through the doorway. You don't care if you are offending the CD freaks. They are freaks so it doesn't matter. They are probably just as crazy as Celine Dion herself. You realize you've made a mistake by going into the store, but you can't get out because there is a CD freak to your left, and to your right, and in front of you, and they are holding the latest and greatest CD merchandise in their grubby paws, like CD jewelry, clothes, baby bibs, spoons, mugs, lighters, tampons (kidding i hope). You dart out of their way, but you can't make it out the door - your ears are starting to bleed, you eyes are starting to tear. You can't see so you try to feel your way out, with the hopes of possibly knocking over some CD merchandise. After what feels like an eternity, you make your way out and realize you will never be the same again. A part of you is lost and gone forever. You are no longer naive and innocent. You have seen the horrors of the world. You are ready for anything.

      okay, the interracial dating topic is probably going to spark a good conversation / debate since i think some of us here have dated people outside of our own race.  new wave, i went to that guy's blog page as you had suggested. he pissed me off, so i replied:   You sound a tad (understatement?) bit bitter about this whole Asian Girl Dating White Boy thing. Seriously, chill out. Yes, some white men like to date Asian women that fit the traditional subservient, submissive wife stereotype. Yes, some Asian women will gladly fulfill this role and look for white men who will dominate. But is this always the case? No. Please don't generalize. Have some faith that for some interracial couples, race really does not matter. It's not always a "fetish" like you think!  You want some pointers? I'll give them to you anyway! 1. Please don't play the race card. It is not always the case.  2. Re-read some of your posts. You sound like a pompous jackass. "...It was an announcement about empowering Asian American women or some bullshit like that." Oh, I'm sorry, maybe I didn't get the memo. I didn't know empowering Asian Women was not allowed!!!  3. Drop the whole "I go to Stanford hardy har har" schtick. Just because you have a good education and have a upper middle class upbringing does not give you an advantage over black guys or any guy in the whole love department.  4. Please don't use the phrase "find me a wife." Phrases like this make Asian women (or any woman for that matter!) feel like we are objects or prizes to be won. Come on, who really says stuff like that anymore? Perhaps only men who are looking for the traditional wife of the 1950's...It's so archaic! 5. Get over it.. Like you said: "If you like someone, race shouldn't matter." End of story.    I don't care so much about the topic (heck I only date non-Asians, but don't tell this guy!), it's more like I wanted to say something to this guy because he is seriously one of those people who thinks they are alway right because they are super smart and rich or whatever.

       hey girlfriends  ha ha i think only darth and dorkus will get that one ...  vegas was cool ... i got my faith back in the 5 cent slot/slut machines. hey nick you are going to love this, i put 2 bucks in this one machine and won over 30 bucks. nice huh. so that covered some of my meals for the trip.  ripped this off another website but i thought it was funny:  "You know the world's gone mad when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the USA of arrogance and the Germans don't want to go to war!" - Anonymous  i just finished watching the becoming american: the chinese expericence on kcet (i taped it). it is really good and i'm considering buying the dvd. it was funny because the last segment was all about asian americans today making it ... like ABCs (american born chinese) like myself, and i could totally relate to what they were talking about. eh moving on ...  okay hedwig you can join dorkus in the i love justin timberlake song fan club ... ha ha. have fun guys.  i was reading some person's blog page and came across this one entry called "asian fetish" and it got me all thinking because he was some asian nerd guy who got pissed because he noticed asian girls, esp. HOT asian girls are always with white guys and that really irked me because seriously he seemed as if to say asian women perfer the white race over their own or some stupid sh** like that. honestly sometimes i think asian women turn to other races because of the insanely stupid expectations asian males might have for asian women .... like the size 1 or 2 waist and size AA or A bra and the submissiveness because gosh forbid us women have thoughts or opinions, oh and of course asian women should always be made up to look nice and make sure the male never loses face in front of his family or friends and don't disrespect the males in public. i know some of these are outdated but honestly and sadly i think some of them are happening today with a few expections ... okay i'm getting mad ... i'm out.   on the beat box:  the cure - cloudberry  ... i love the cure always :)

      so i'm starting to like...*hangs head*...the justin timberlake song "rock your body."  i didn't like it at first b/c it sounded boring and redundant....but now it makes me want to dance....i don't know whyyyyyyy....i just wanna dance when i hear it, or choreograph or something.  maybe he has some kind of subliminal msg in there.  "you will like this song...DANCE!"  i'm really hormonal right now...i feel like i'm 16...like celeb guys i'm like "he's HOT!"...anyway so yeah, if you guys happen to bump into justin timberlake send him on over :P

      ok, new wave was curious about what happened at the lunch w/ redhead's mom.  i guess she just missed me and wanted to see how everything was going.  she didn't even tell the redhead that she was having lunch with me.  turns out the redhead hasn't talked to her about what happened w/ our relationship...and her reasoning was a)she's waiting for him to talk to her about it, also she doesn't know how to bring it up and b) she knows he isn't talking to her about it b/c he knows he wont' like what she has to say.  *shrug*  but it was cool she bought me lunch at the great old spag fact!  she told me he was sad...and that he doesn't like himself too much and that he's been staying home lately (but i don't think this is the case this week since he is on spring break).  so that's aobut it...kinda anticlimactic there but there ya go!

      dorkus i totally know what you mean.  i work at a place that gives out loans....and people call in asking about the loan service....and they'll tell you the whole story of why they need a loan...."i just got out of jail and i need to get my phone turned back on"..."i was in the hospital for 2 weeks and my mom's bf's sister's cousin stole my car"....those aren't true but you get the gist.  so annoying.  and THEN when you tell them you cant' give them a loan b/c they dont' have the requirements...i.e. they don't make enough money, they don't have a phone, a bank acct, a JOB or social security.....they try to talk their way into getting a loan.  HELLO!!!! i can't give you a loan if you don't have these things...now hang up already!  so yeah.  that sounds harsh cuz i know ppl out there need money....but once you've heard it 100 times it gets pretty freakin annoying.  so i feel ya there!  listening to: nobody wants to be lonely--christina "slut" aguillera and ricky "gay" martin

      You know what I hate? When people give you unnecessary details. Please get straight to the point people!  Example phone call:  What the customer said : Hi I was at the XYZ show and I ordered furniture and carpet from you guys and I have my credit card statement but I don't have an itemized invoice. Can I get an itemized invoice detailing the breakdown of the charges?  What the customer could have said : Can you fax me my invoice for XYZ show?  Okay, so it may seem like I'm being petty, but trust me! After you go through a 100 phone calls like this, you just roll your eyes and wish you were somewhere else where people aren't wasting your time. They just ramble on and on and don't ask real questions. Like I'm supposed to understand all the words that are coming out of their mouth. I have literally asked, "So what's your question?" Gosh, I really hate people sometimes.

      so darth tells me that kroq said the new radiohead album is to drop may 27th but i read june 9th (in the uk, 10th in the us) on the official radiohead site .... who do you think i should believe ???  nice list of books there mac the knife ... didn't know you could read ... ha ha. as for your random thought. hello thinking like everyone else is the cool thing to do ... duh. if we never had a political thought in our brain but now everyone is talking about the war then ... duh we should be having a voice as well, if we never cared about any social issues or concerns but suddenly it is the new thing then ... duh we should care as well ... hellooo we are all sheep right ... bbbbaaaa bbbbaaa. ha ha. but i think i KNOW who you are referring to mac the knife and all i have to say is ... bubble world where it is safe.  man i was hoping to go to china/hong kong this oct. but like what hedwig said due to the war there is not way i'm going now. well i guess i could but i rather not you know. and a congrats to ftc on his achievement ... good for you homie.  blah blah blah blah blah ... vegas thurs night ...

      please excuse this blog but this is me standing up on a soap box ranting:  just finished watching part one of the becoming american: the chinese experience on kcet. it was a really good ep filled with history behind why the chinese came here and why they kept coming. it made me realized how lucky we all are because of the freedoms we have here today that our ancestors had to fight for. yea sure we can complain about all the corruption and lies in corp. america and capitol hill but sometimes i think we take for granted how lucky we really are ... think about all those peoples back in the 19th century who came to america hoping for a better life for their families ... of course i'm not trying to paint some picture perfect view america, i have a lot of problems with our country but at the same time i rather be here then anywhere else.

      listening to: When the heartache is over--Miss Tina Turner i'm back in philly....weather isn't that bad.  just don't want to work/school.  Cancun is pretty cool....i did the "partying" stuff--it was for senior trip.  I didn't get to see the cultural stuff.  They've got ok clubs...the beach is nice.  I'm sure you'll have a blast Nick.  Speaking of vacations....I wanted to tour Europe this summer.  My cousin went on Contiki tours for a pretty good price.  But...a. no money and b. war.  *shrug*  I also wanted to go back to the Philippines this summer but, I doubt that will happen, esp cuz of the war and tension over there.  I guess I'll just have to settle for going to camp in Idyllwild--Camp Ronald McDonald!  Should be fun and tiring...and I'll get toasty dark! hehe.  now listening to: Almost Paradise......but i forget who sings it.....it's an old song...i think it's from the movie Blue Lagoon *shrug*

      Running on Winamp: A variety of 2Pac songs.  He's dope.    This is a short list of books I want to read and purchase.  LAbyrinth, Darth I really want to read that.  Perfect I'm Not, should tie me over til Jose Canseco releases his book.  Pickup Artists, a book on streetball and streetballers.  Yes not very intellectual type stuff, but stuff i'm interested in nonetheless.      Cancun?  Psh...that's weak, you have to go to the brighter spots such as Tijuana and Tecate, that's the place to be in Mexico.  Hey Nick I hear that Mexico has this really cool donkey show, you should go check it out, oh wait NKOTB isn't going, nevermind.  Actually i've never been there myself, but I hear it's nice, so have fun, and drink lots and lots of tap water, you know cause it will be so hot and you'll be thirsty.  Random Thought:  You know what's annoying to me, people who can't think for themselves.  They never have their OWN opinion, and just go with whatever they are used to.  It pisses me off to think that you were born with a brain, so use it!  Aargh!!   I want to hear what your OPINIONS are, or just things that annoy you people, whether it be from friends, family, work, etc... please entertain and enlighten me.  Don't be "sheep" as new wave likes to say.

      so excited. where to begin ...  NEW RADIOHEAD ALBUM DROPS JUNE 10TH IN THE US  and is titled, of all names, "hail to the thief". 14 wonderful new tracks. i can't wait even though they might not tour in the us.  also expect a new album from blur, althouth i think only ftc knows this, called "think tank" to arrive may 6 in the us. finally some good music is coming my way. i was getting so tired of my good charlotte and arvil cd. (rolling my eyes) yea the freak right.  the oscar's yesterday were alright, nothing interesting or special. it was kinda of like most of the winners were expected. i've already given my long rant about the ameoba workers so i just won't bother. does anyone here watch six feet under ... that show is really really good. not as great as x-files but i still enjoy it. and it is not as good as 24, which comes back tomorrow ... finally.  okay nick here are some cool things to check out in cancun (i know, i know ... new wave girl actually went to cancun where there is sun, how scary is that). try to catch the bull fighting show, if you are really sensitive to animals being abused you might not like it but it is worth seeing. there are bus tours you can take outside of cancun to other cities which is so worth it, just to explore and stuff. oh and go to the myan ruins site, not sure about the spelling. that is really really really worth it but it will be hot but so worth it, seriously. then there is jet skiing, scuba diving, looking at fish, hang gliding over the water, and boat trips to islands around cancun. there should be more than enough for you guys to do in 6 days. oh and don't forget the shopping, it is really good there and you can always bargin over the price, which actually ends up being pretty fun. oh and the food is really good, all you have to do is order an entree and you get unlimited drinks .... UNLIMITED ... so sweet.   on the beat box:  radiohead - a wolf at the door

      hiya!  i went to amoeba and the worker who helped me was nice... as nice as a snooty amoeba worker can be.  hah hah.  i told him my prob and his mouth made a little "o" of shock and then he gave me back my credit.  sweet!  anyhoo, they are mostly aspiring musicians.  last time i was there i listened to this guy tell his mate, "yeah, i've got a gig at this guy's house in santa barbara.  we've been really busy."  hee hee. cancun!  sounds fun nick.  never been so not much to suggest.  i'm going to sac this weekend.  not expecting much though... and i guess you concur.  alrighty, take care all!

      Hi kids!  I know I haven?t been around lately, so I apologize (especially to new wave who I know is just about to kick my ass).  But anyway, it was weird cuz I had a dream last night about finally blogging after all these weeks/months.  So it was definitely a sign that if I didn?t blog, something might happen to me J  so I?ve been pretty busy at work (pretty hard to believe since it?s usually so laid back) but it?s finally starting to slow down.  You know what I really hate about work?  When you?re in a really important meeting with very important people but  you have absolutely nothing remotely interesting or smart to contribute to the conversation, so you just sit there like a little idiot and everyone?s wondering why the heck you were even in the meeting in the first place.  And to top it off, your boss is sitting next to you in the meeting and keeps looking at you thinking ?why the heck did I bring her to the meeting??  well, anyway, just a thought.   So I?ve finally planned my vacation to cancun. I have not been on a  vacation in like 6 years.  Unless you count vegas and sacramento (which, last time I checked, isn?t very fun).  So I am sooooo excited!  Has anyone been there and can tell me some places to go?  Places to eat?  Things I HAVE to do?

      pigern, i know what you mean about the amoeba workers.  they're so lame, they pretend like they're something else, because they work at a record store.  (wait do i sound like the kid from empire records?)  nevermind, anyways they think they can be snooty and stuff because they are the "hollywood" types.  those people blow.  most are all wannabe models or musicians, when everyone can see that they are hacks.  haha remember darth, "if he misses this kick, he's a haaack."  anyways if they lecture you on how to care for or handle a cd tell them to go kiss off.

      so i bought some cds from amoeba and one of them is scratched.  i so don't want to deal with returning it.  the workers there are all snooty and have major attitude.  last time when i returned a cd that was cracked, the guy was semi-lecturing me on how to handle a cd.  "you press down on the center of the cd holder and hold the edge."  so now they'll probably be like, "do you know how to put a cd in a cd player?"  argh!  anyway, i guess that's why used cds kind of suck. speaking of music, i have heard the anthem tune by good charlotte... as well as the all-american rejects' swing swing song and they both equally suck.  but the bowling for soup song, the girl all the guys want, is pretty terrible too.   so, who's watching the academy awards this year?  i wonder how the ratings will do... hey, i just caught beyonce's pepsi ad on tv.  okay, she's really 30 right?  man, she looks old.

      another week .... it is almost the end of march, insane.  biggest pet peeve of the moment: when you fwd something to your friends and they have the nerve to fwd it to their friends and their stupid friends hit REPLY ALL and all my friends end up getting these fu**ing mass e-mails from people they have no idea who they are .... what the fu**. people how many times do i have to stress ... use REPLY and not REPLY ALL if you have something to say ... sorry to some people in the house who have been getting mass e-mails from people they don't know :(.  hey hedwig congrats on finally getting your car, i'm sure you have been waiting for that forever. i think you are on your way back to philly now ... man the two weeks that you were here in cali we didn't kick it once. what a bummer. well when you come back in the summer we will def. meet up okay. as for your red headed boy's mom story ... how did the lunch end up going. she sounds like she really likes you and i doubt she would bust some crazy meeting with the two of you .... but yea tell me how it went.  as for the war ... too many thoughts and emotions to write about. i guess like mac the knife i rather not comment about the issue.  man finally T.W.I.F.O.S.L.Y you are back in the mother fu**ing house. ha ha. it felt empty here without you :) yea no worries about my b-day thing which was ages ago, we'll just have to go out again some other time.   on the beat box:  was listening to the part III album from 112 ... they are so good.

      am i being petty if i'm annoyed that there's nothing else on except war coverage?  i don't cable so all 13 channels were showing the war.  so this morning i had to resort to watching teletubbies....u know how BAD that is???  hehe.  i swear those things are on crack...an evil ploy w/ subliminal messages telling your 2-5 year olds that crack is good!  :P  ok so tell me if this is weird.  the red head's mom left me a message yesterday b/c she heard through the red head that i had gotten a new car.  so i called her back this morning and we chatted it up a bit...caught up w/ each other's lives(i didn't really ask about her son or how he was doing).  so she calls me like 20-30 minutes later to ask if i was free for lunch tomorrow and i was.  so we set a date for lunch.  is that weird that she would want to have lunch w/ me after we already like caught up w/ stuff?  i mean granted, the woman LOVES me and prolly misses me....but i'm wondering if there are ulterior motives.....does she have something to talk to me about?  is she gonna ambush me and have kyle come too?  what if she told us BOTH to have lunch w/ her w/o each of us knowing?  i may just be paranoid...she's not manipulative like that.  i was just wondering if you all would agree that it was weird.

      guess who's back in the mo'fo house?! yeah, so i dont really have much to say.  war: inevitable.  although ive caught the oprah episodes where she tries to enlighten the american audience, and she is doing a better job of informing the people than the government is.  i ESPECIALLY love how she has people come on and talk about all the bad things the US has done in the past, and why other people dont like our government.  which leads me tp ponder the question: why the F**K did dubya say in his speech that the US has done nothing to deserve an attack?!  and they say saddam is crazy for suggesting bush and blair resign. anyway, hedwig: congrats on the car.  are u gonna make it the official white knight rescue vehicle?!  HAHA ftc: sorry i missed ur b-day thing, i TOTALLY forgot it was friday, meaning i didnt remember what day of the week we were on until it was too late.  we'll have to get drunk another time...  yeah, and ur x-files trivia is unbelievably frightening, but its all good. guess thats all my ranting for now.

      ha ha pigern mocking me about my x-files geekness ... well ... you are correct (pushing my glasses up) i was excited ... after all i get to talk about the x-files :)  the ep you saw hedwig was all souls (ep. 5x17), which is in the same season as christmas carol (ep. 5x05) and emily (ep. 5x07). please note the eps were not run in order because david d. was filming "playing god" at the time. christmas carol (ep. 5x05) has scully visiting her family, which is now just bill (her brother) and his wife and her mother for the holidays. she receives a strange phone call during dinner, which sounds a lot like melissa (her dead sister) to go to a house and investigate a murder. she end up getting mixed up in the case involving a family and their little adopted girl name emily. when emily is given to child services, scully tries but unsucessfully fails at adopting her. at the end of ep she learns after some DNA testing that the girl is her daughter. in emily (ep. 05x07), scully is trying to deal with the fact that she is the mother at the same time helping emily with her disease .... not to give too much away the little girl dies and scully has to try to understand why for a moment she was given the chance to have a little girl of her own only to have it taken it away, which leads to all souls where i personally think scully comes to term with her lost.  okay that was pretty x-files nerdy of me but can i say that ep brings tears to my eyes (sigh). i mean that one is so touching and gillian anderson gives a great performance. another great ep is closure (ep. 7x11) about mulder and his coming to terms with his sister samantha ... man that one made me tear up so bad ... (sniff)

      hello! happy st. patty's day. i woke up remembering and wondering if i should wear green but then i thought, i'm not in elementary school. no one at work will pinch me! and no one did. whew! no one wore green either. i think my office just doesn't celebrate holidays. it's like they're a world to themselves.  anyway, the abc party thing sounded very surreal darth. there you are, a nobody, surrounded by somebodies. hah hah. just kidding. i bet it was a smashing good time. today it was really hard for me to work. beside the fact that it was a monday (happy mooondays new wave!), the whole crashing reality of war made me depressed. ((sigh)) but luckily it's been super slow at work and i left at 530. yay! i ate dinner at 630, not 8. it was weird! so, hedwig you opened a pandora's box there with that xfiles question. a real can of worms. trust me. you'll never hear the end of it from new wave. her eyes got all big and overly excited when she read your question. "the xfiles!" she squealed. uh-oh!

      Happy St. Patrick's Day to All!!!!!!  What better way to celebrate st. patrick cleansing the land from snakes and converting the heathens than to down a frosty one!!! haha....So last night I went to the ABC 50th anniversary celebration....basically it was anyone who has ever worked for abc (actors, crews, producers) and then there was me...haha....you know you are in for an evening when you walk down the red carpet right behind john tesh (!!!!!) and head of the class's simone (the red head for all your who forgot that wonderful show). Anyway walking inside was werid cause you'd look over and wow its carol (tracy gold) from growing pains, then walk a little more and there is d.j. from rosanne. Waiting for the show to begin was okay for a while but the lobby soon grew over crowded, but i did get a chance to see winnie cooper, john madden, and joe nammath. The actual show was entertaining all the big names were out, john travolta for welcome back kotter, barbara walter,oprah, tim allen, but the one that brought down the house and floored me was muhammed ali. Words can't express just how amazing it was to see him. After abc had run all their montages and everyone had spoke, I headed over to the after party which was cool, but weird. I sat down to eat only to notice gold medalist carl lewis was next to me......went to get dessert and whos there? zack morris..haha...a dream come true to say the least. The two highlights of the party other than the free alcohol and food was, having a drink with jimmy kimmel, who was really drunk, and then getting to shake hands and talk to dennis franz for a minute, just cause my mom really likes him and wanted me to say hi.....okay thats all about that.....and mac the anthem rocks!!! wow what a great song, c'mon throw you hands up!!! god i hate them and want to punch them in their face....real punk bands would beat the crap out of them and make them their bitches...i'd love to hear what johnny (lyden) rotten would say about them. did anyone else see the cartoon are you hot on snl on sat? that was fricking hilarious. i'm a bit irish btw, mostly scottish and english, hey its all the same island.....lates

      Good Charlotte SUCKS!  That "Anthem" song has got to be the worst piece of crap out there in music land right now.  How can a "band," yes I use the term loosely, make something so uninspired and awful?  They "sing" about being an individual and not following the herd?  Oh my gosh, what's wrong with this group, don't they know they should just STOP!  They freaking suck.  I had the privilege of watching their craptacular video the other day.  So are they supposed to be punk because they have mohawks and wear freaking eyeliner?  Honestly what the F?  I'm not a music critic/expert, but if it looks like crap, sounds like crap, it's gotta be Good Charlotte.  Avril Lavigne is not punk, and did anyone happen to read the Rolling Stone piece on her, they made fun of it on SNL this past weekend.   Simple Plan SUCKS!  There's much much more, I just don't remember all their names, because they all sound the same.  Oh ya and I think I speak for most guys when I say no bra.  =)  And HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY darth, i'm not quite sure if your Irish, but your the closest thing to one that I know.  Well other than that little leprechaun (sp?) Nick Edney.  haha jk.

           HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY        okay everyone, go out there and get drunk for saint patrick's honor. :P  man it is monday ... i HATE mondays so much. in addition, i had kinda of a crappy weekend. can't explain what it was, i guess cause on friday i saw this movie that was eh.. not that great. i should have gone to see slick shoes at the key club for 10 bucks. oh well. and then it was raining ALL DAY on sat. so i couldn't go out or anything. and on sunday i was on a emotion high then low ... too long to get into but let's say it involves MY LORD AND SAVIOR and growing up.   on the beat box:  whatever is playing on 92.3 HOT right now

      the ides of march ....   yea i'm not big in the whole fashion dept. so i'll skip that part. as for relationship advice ... well hedwig if you can't get over something that happened a year ago then yea i think it will affect the relationship ... a lot. the end conclusion just do some soul searching and i'm sure the right choice will come.  seriously when will freaks and geeks come out on dvd. so annoying. i loved that show. man. oh well.   rain rain go away come again another day. actually i don't mind it so much but it just hinders you from doing anything the whole day.    on the beat box:  nothing ... for now

      hedwig, i can't give relationship advice, but i sure can give fashion advice! (haha!). I don't think you should wear a bra w/ a backless top - it does look tacky. go bra-less (wear band-aids - i think johnson and johnson makes this kind where the sticky part is really thin and sheer - sorry guys, TMI?) OR get that strapless bra w/o a back, the kind that tapes on in the front. they sell it at places like windsor's or charlotte russe. hope this helps!

      so i'm bloggin b/c i need to ramble to someone..and this is a lot better than me emailing the red head....must...be...strong!  just missing him that's all...and also trying to decide if i want him in my life or not....like if he came back and was finally "ready"...would i/should i take him back?  i kno u guys don't really kno me or my situation but just wanted to put that out there.  if trust is breeched...even if it was like over a year ago and i'm still having issues with it....is there no hope for the relationship?  anyway that's what my mind's been wrestling for the past week or so.  still no answer.  *shrug*  but on to more important things hehe.  for you ladies....altho, new wave i know you wouldn't have this problem, but maybe some of you might? or even guys i'd appreciate the opinion/advice.  i bought this shirt...clubbing shirt..and the whole back is shear....so i guess it's like borderline backless.....should i wear a bra or no bra?  i mean i would be ok w/ not wearing a bra, but well....u kno, if it's cold, i don't really want EVERybody to know.  the bra i have looks ok w/ it...but is that tacky?...wearing a bra w/ something that i guess is meant to be "backless"?    so those are my two rants...hope everyone is having a good friday....i'm not a very good catholic....all i ate was meat today..i was a christian today :P

      hey all.  i had my interview at western/college of osteopathic medicine of the pacific(COMP) today...it was pretty cool.  Everyone was really friendly and nice.  The campus is reallly really small, but I kinda like it that way.  It's in downtown pomona by antique row.  so funny cuz the antique mall was painted all these weird colors like purple, yellow, blue...and I was like wtf?  cuz it wasn't like that before.  And our tour guide, the director of admissions told us that they had filmed part of the cat in the hat there last summer...so i thought that was cool.  Another cool thing I learned was that a DO graduate of Western is on the technical director staff for ER.  But besides all that "cool" stuff...the school seems really nice.  Their labs and lecture halls are relatively new...they're hooked up to ethernet...each desk in the lecture hall has access to the internet....so ppl don't pay attn in class hehe.    i hope i get in...and i really think this is the school for me...but we'll see...stuff happens and minds change...esp w/ the fickle one that i have.  so hope all is well w/ ppl....i feel much better than i did last week!  ok i think i'm gonna forage for some food....me hungry!!

      hedwig, i wasn't trying to make you feel bad for your "Planes don't stop for love" post earlier. i thought it was very poetic - the last line was great. i know i don't know you, but i hope you're feeling better :).....the overall mood has just been depressing, that's all....but how can it not be with all the ~crap~ that's going on?! for instance, i HATE my job. new wave already knows this, as i complain about it every five seconds. i will start looking for a new job, and hopefully it'll be at a place that actually appreciates their employees and doesn't make them work a million hours a week for no pay.  anyway, good advice on breaking up w/ a friend. thanks, guys. new wave, i am not as optimistic as you that "jane doe" will change her rude and demanding ways. i really don't think the old jane doe will come back. some friendships run their course, and this is one of them. i'm not calling her (yes, i would like to have my words w/ her, but it's a waste of breath and energy. nothing would change.) i will remember the fun times we all had, and just accept it. it's not a big loss for me. besides, one of my pet peeves (in the top 5) is people who FLAKE all the time. i just don't have the patience for that.  listening to: The Sea and Cake - One Bedroom

      not saying that john is better than dave or vice versa....i mean you're comparing a whole band to one person.  his voice DOES sound like dave's though.  i agree that johns stuff might sound redundant(sp?) sometimes, but he's still a great songwriter...and he WRITes his own songs which is more than i can say for some artists out there.  And he's great on the guitar....*shrug*...and his songs speak to me.  so I like him :P  you don't have to hehe.  :D

      so tired .. work is trying to kill me i'm sure of it now.  um random index card-sized ads of bands are pretty cool and yes i used cool ... isn't that so undeck of me. ha ha (go read the hipster handbook)  ohhh hedwig cheap is always good ... not sure i'm vibing with you on the john mayer. he sounds like dave matthews and they are so much better than john ha ha. all of john's songs sound exactly the same ... just my thought but cool about the periodic table, that's always neat.  as for the friend advice thanks to all, i'm not sure what we are going to do, i'll just ride it out ... oh and dorkus seriously that "rock your body" by justin timberlake is awful. ha ha no really and what is up with the video. okay it is offical the 1980's are back ... and don't get me started on good charlotte "the anthem" i think i'm going to be sick .... (barfing) man if this is what music is on mtv then please can i be disconnected ...  hey just a random thought for the guys ... do dumb girls turn you on more than smart ones. i mean do you guys like to look for dumb girls because you know they are easy and aren't smarter than you so they will bruise your precious ego. ha ha just a wonder ....   on the beat box:  out of this world - the cure ... :)

      OH and for you cheapskates(that doesn't look right...how do u spell that?) out there.  I went to Western U in Pomona...I'm interviewing there on Thursday for their osteopathic med school...anyway i went there to look at a book I need to read b4 the interview....parking was 75 cents(all day visitor parking) and the copies were only 5 cents a page!  I was VERY happy.  :-D  I got a 20 dollar book for a good price of 4 dollars and all i had to do was take 30 min of my time photocopying each page.  :)

      that justin song...hmm i only heard it once...sounded kinda redundant.  anyway interesting thing about that song.  the girl who sings(not the one on the video b/c i don't think that's her)...well the red head went to h.s. w/ her and supposedly was supposed to go to prom w/ her hehe.   her name is vanessa marquez...random trivia for you.  not really feelin the song tho.  sorry to hear about your job woes...there's a lot of things wrong w/ america right now hehe.  healthcare, econ...oh yeah and that war that no one is backing us on.  *shrug*  i was a john mayer consumer whore today hehe.  i bought his album(which i already had burned), and his live CD.  But let me tell you the geeky, retarded, bio major reason why i bought his CD hehe.  the sole purpose for me buying the "no room for squares" album was because he had a periodic table on the CD AND the squares on the CD cover and back actually made up the periodic table w/o the elements..just the squares and the colors.  isn't that cool?! haha.  He must have been a science geek to do that.  plus on one of his live songs that i heard my cousin play the other day...he was talking about taking out the cereal part of count chocolate cereal so that the girl would have more marshmallows...then he said, "I would increase your marshmallow:cereal ratio for you." haha...it's good to know there are dorks like me out there. :)  hope everyone is having an ok week.  listening to: john mayer--uh one of his live songs that i haven't heard and can't recognize...too...lazy...to walk over...and look at the title. hehe

      to start dorkus that justin song is craptacular......hope you are feeling better hedwig that plane story/poem was beautiful and depressing at the same time. sorry i haven't blogged in a while been super busy at work, what? a govt worker busy, impossible, right new wave? well this stupid lady who was scheduled to conduct interviews for me hasn't come in the past 2 weeks cause her shoulder is bothering her, hmm last time i checked one could still interview with a couple of aches and pains, anyway this lady is so stupid and dumb and keeps getting her "doctor" to write in notes saying that she can't come in....I seriously want to punch her in the face, she has but me a week and a half behind.....why can't we fire her right now you ask? supid o.c. union. This is one fo the reasons why i don't support some unions, they keep stupid people like this around.....arghh getting angry.....anyway i'm currently reading a book called LAbryinth...which basically links death row records and the lapd to both the deaths of tupac and biggie, its really sad to see how much corruption there has been and how much was never even brought up by the lapd higher ups.....and that these two murders are still unsolved basically becuase the cops in charge never want them to be :(

      i think there's only so much you can put up with, no matter how good of "friends" people can be.  there are probably many ways to go about handling this, but you really can't change a person's character or personality.  that is just who they are.  you can try to wait on this person to see if they change, but that probably won't happen.  you could confront the person on the issues that bother you, but they may take it the wrong way...then become upset, because they don't know that what they are doing is bothering you or even think anything is wrong in the first place, and wonder why would they have to change.  or you could just ignore the person, but in the long run you'll have to probably explain yourself anyways, so i guess it may be better to just talk about it with the "friend" and maybe there may be a way for the parties involved to remain friends, and if not, then oh well, at least you did something about it.

      sorry for the depressing posts dorkus...wasn't intentional.  anyway about flaky friends. i  have a couple of friends...who are actually a couple...and they have been shady on countless occasions.  i have no choice but to stay friends w/ them for the following reasons: a)the guy has a car and he is our only means of transportation for grocery shopping, going to the movies etc. and b) they're 2 out of the 3 friends that i have in philly that i hang out with...the other one being my roommate and c) well they HAVE been there for me sometimes but they're so damn SHADY or they don't know how to communicate or sOMething.  like once they were like, "oh hey let's go out tonight, what do u wanna do?"...and we decide to go to the movies...but then later on when i called them to see what was up, they said they didn't feel like going...WTF you invited us?!  Then this other time, we were in NY for a friends bday...they dropped me and my roomie off at the club and they were gonna park the car.  We were waiting for 15 min at the door...then decided to go in....still no sign of them.  Neither of us brought our phone into the club.  Then I use my other friend's phone to call them and they're like "uh...i don't think we're gonna go in"...at this point we had already spent 13 each to get into the club and get coat check.  And we had our stuff in their car.  Long story short, we told them to just drop our stuff off and we'd stay w/ our friend who's bday it was....I think they were on their way back to queens when I called...dumbasses.  So not only did they assume that we had a place to stay or a ride but they assumed that our friend could accomodate us.  So annoying.  I didn't really answer the question...but I would suggest just don't call them and ignore them.  And then if they make a big deal about you being distant, then tell them why they're inconsiderate. hehe.  ok that's it for me.  I went to SD this weekend and that helped a lot...so no depressing blog.  :)

      well i haven't really been saying anything lately but .... where is everyone. i know nick edney is extremely busy at work (supposely, hee hee) and t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y is doing interviews up north for med. school but what are you other people doing ... i'm looking in your direction darth bronger and NKOTB RULE ...   moving on some of you might not understand what dorkus melorkus was talking about earlier so here is the full story: earlier this year dorkus and i purchased a clipper game package from a friend name "jane doe". though we were unsure when we would receive it we were both confident enough to know it would be sooner than later ... BOY WERE WE WRONG. the game packaged was only good for certain games - 11 games to be exact of the entire clipper season. well when "jane doe" had sold the tickets to us in jan. at least 6 of those 11 games had already passed so first off the product was half used up. then getting the tickets from her became an impossible task. things were always coming up on her end and made it extremely difficult for us to ever get them. after all both dorkus and i do work a full work week and we don't have as much free time as people who don't. finally when we do get the tickets there is ONLY ONE GAME left that we can go to and dorkus is out of town that weekend and i can't go. so in conclusion the coupon book/ticket thing ended up being WORTHLESS. well naturally we both didn't feel it was right for us to pay for it ... to make a long story short i ask the same question dorkus brought up ... how do you cut ties with someone who you know is shady. after all if she is willing to treat us like this then i guess she really doesn't consider us good friends ....  side note: the house has become really depressing lately and i hope for everyone's sake there are some good things moving in your lives ... i'm not saying i'm the most positive person in the whole wide world (far from it) but i do believe to every horrible, rotten, terrible thing comes some good or at least something decent ... things in life just take time to work themselves out, even if at the moment you feel lonely, hurt, sad, depressed, worried or stressed.   on the beat box:  nothing ... just quiet :)

      all right you people seriously depress me! not that i don't care about war and love lost and sucky coworkers...you guys make me want to cry about something different everytime i read a blog (kidding). i will try not to be as sad and depressing....  my question for you is: how many times do you allow a "friend" (let's call her "Jane Doe") to flake out on you? new wave and i have this "friend" who has become very shady and rude and demanding and flaky recently..she has flaked on us at least five times - we wonder why we even put up with her...so what do you think - at what point do you "break up" with a friend? and how do you do it w/o exchanging cross words and flying fists? Do you just ignore them and delete their phone number out of your address book? Do you bring up all the things that bug you about this person? Breaking up surely is hard to do, but if I can avoid seeing this person again, I will. Let me know your thoughts on this if you don't mind.

      hedwig... your blog made me tear.  but i don't know how much that means because i'm very emotional (just ask new wave).  just the other day i saw some protesters on fairfax and this made me tear... thinking about their passion against the war and how little it means to bush because he is going to do what he believes is in the best interest of the people.  we are powerless. anyway, i hate most (if not all) romantic comedies because they just make me feel bad.  isn't that weird?  aren't people suppose to feel happy after they see the two people finally together.  yay! happily ever after right?  but it's usually just a fairy tale and not true in this sad, depressing world.   so, i'm listening to idlewild in my car on my way to work and one of the lyrics is "can you tell me ten words that you use to describe the world to people?" and this made me think... what could be the definitive ten words?  because the world is so complex and language itself is so limited in scope and meaning.  i mean how could you describe the world with words that could encompass what people rant about on this blog?  and everything else going on... the threat of war... the failing economy... heartbreak.  hm, bit of a tangent eh? okay, last thought: so my friend and i are venting about our current annoyances, which turned out to be both regarding lame coworkers.  and it's totally trivial because it's just work, "don't let it get to you"... but it does.  and i'm so petty but i think it's unfair that i'm not getting the cubicle i wanted after i got promoted. and instead it's going to the other guy i don't like. but it's so trivial and minor.

      hedwig, i don't know you, but hope you feel better, for what it's worth.    so i'm sitting here in Mexico.  the drive was kind of nerve-racking because it was my first time coming down by myself, and i was afraid i was going to get lost, but i made it.  so i get to head back up to la this weekend, i'm excited.  i've pretty much been keeping myself entertained by playing basketball at some local park with filipinos, hispanics, and african americans, and one white guy that thinks he's african american, much like darth thinks he is.  so i'm beginning to think that i may be the only asian person in chula vista, which i totally don't mind, but it's odd coming from fob city u.s.a. also known as alhambra and the rest of the sgv.  sorry this blog was me just rambling on about my life, it's boring, maybe i should have let you read this sentence before everything else, but too bad.

      anyway, i was gonna post this earlier, but i got a phonecall so i just posted whatever i had.  i wrote this on the plane over.  i was very proud of it when i finished...it's not really MEANt to bum ppl out, but take it for what it's worth.  for those of you that don't know...the red head and i are no longer together.....  "planes don't stop for love" Romantic comedies are what we hope our love lives will be like.  Boy meets girl. They seem perfect for each other, fall in love and all is well.  Boy finds tragic flaw in girl and girl leaves boy, all accompanied by a soundtrack that conveys the sadness and longing of the parties involved.  Girl decides to leave town and boy realizes that the tragic flaw doesn't matter anymore and he loves her.  Boy runs to the airport, pleads with airport personnel to stop the plane.  In a swirl of romance they stop the plane.  Boy finds girl and they kiss passionately...riding off into the sunset...happily ever after.  But planes don't stop for love.  There is no soundtrack for your life because while the joy may seem to last for a second, the pain will undoubtedly last longer than three minutes and thirty seconds of your life.  You don't know if the boy will come and chase you down at the airport.  And furthermore, if he did, would you even stay?    They never really show what happens after the kiss.  Maybe all the passengers get pissed and kick the boy and girl out; girl gets upset because she had a medical school interview and that flight was the last one out, ruining her chances of getting into her dream school.  It's real life.  It's hard, it lasts much longer than two hours, you can't control it and you never know what's going to happen.  So next time you watch a romantic movie, give yourself a reality check and think back to when you read the cynical ramblings of a girl sitting "alone" in an airplane with no music, for four hours, waiting for her pain to subside.

       currently listening to: ace troubleshooter - yesterday   it's nice to move out, but not when you have to relocate away from your friends and loved ones.  but it's something i had to do i guess, either that or i would've been a bum living at home with no job still.  well the new job hasn't been a job really for me.  i just sit on my butt staring at my computer screen, but today no one was at the office, so i ended up watching movies on my computer.  but i'll be working for real tomorrow, so don't hate.    regarding tears of the sun, it's supposed to be bruce willis' best action movie since the die hards.  but i dunno.

      Nick Edney, that is the most disgusting thing ever, maybe she just wanted to stick something in her mouth because she was hungry.  Tee hee.  I've been exhausted lately, I think a lack of sleep and too much physical activity is the culprit, but i'm feeling better now, thank goodness.  Something has been brought to my attention lately and I realized that no matter how much any of us complain about our little old lives, we really have nothing that significant to complain about.  This is not to say we do not have the right to be upset about circumstances, that is a basic human emotion.  I understand that all of us go through hardships, I have been through some myself, but still it's relatively nothing compared to what else is going on out in the world, away from our sheltered/bubbled lives.  I mean, think about the poor people in a war torn country, SARS taking away lives in bundles, and even closer to home, skid row, wrongful deaths, etc.....  I'm not here to depress anyone, but this is just a  friendly reminder  that no matter how bad things are looking we don't have it that bad.  It is just what we have been accustomed to, but if you take time to realize the big picture, we are lucky.  One last thing, in the end it doesn't really matter because God will take care of all things, so in the word of Bobby McPherin "don't worry, be happy!"

      oh my gosh people...have any of you ever seen a show called "the sunday night sex show"?  i doubt you've all seen it because it's on the oxygen channel.  Anyway, i happened to flip through the channels and came across the most digusting show ever.  This old lady (somewhere in her 70s or 80s) was giving sex advice to callers.  this one girl called in talking about oral sex and how to please her man because he's kinda big and she doesn't want to put the whole thing in her mouth (sorry, if i'm grossing you guys out).  anyway, the old lady grabs this big dildo thing and shows how to properly please your man.  she was running her hand up and down the shaft and was telling the caller to let saliva drip down his thing.....aughhhh!!!!!! it was sooooooooooooo wrong.  anyway, for those that are curious, it's on from 11-12 pm on sunday nights.  ok that's all i have to say.  soooo wrong.

      okay. has anyone watched fear factor lately? these people are crazy! and only for $100k? well, some of them say it's not about the money but the adventure, etc. i still think they are crazy.  anyway, went to coachella saturday. saw a lot more bands then i thought i would... south, idlewild, ben kweller, badly drawn boy, the music, blur, the hives, beastie boys... only drawbacks were the trash that littered the field, the porta potties ((shudder)), and the heat. otherwise it was good times. my VIP passes were lame though. couldn't really go backstage. one of my coworkers had all access but she hated the whole event. too dirty for her. i'd consider going again if the lineup was worth it. tah tah for now.

      coachella coachella .... alright time for my review: i'll make this short since i'm sure not everyone cares about this. it was not a big hassle like i feared it would be .... which is good. first band to watch was south but i must admit i was pretty unimpressed so i just sat that performance out. second was idlewild ... i've seen them before so it was nothing new. third was N.E.R.D. which i have to say was a pretty weak performance. fourth was the hives ... dang where do i even start ... i'm not a huge fan of their music but dang can they rock. they are so full of it and just so cocky ... it was great. fifth band to see was blur ... now this was the group i really paid to see at coachella and i have to say ... it was the damon a. show. i mean he was really working it ... i didn't feel like it was blur ... oh well. yea and damon was really trying to push the new album think tank .... (sigh) oh well. sixth in line was the beastie boys and all i have to say is i have complete newly found respect for them as artist. they are very very good live and i really enjoyed their set. that pretty much concludes my review of coachella. my only real regret was not watching queen of the stone ages ... eh.  i'll write more later.  sleep ............

      so philly finally got "better luck tomorrow" and i watched it w/ my friends last night.  i give it a B:  good story-telling, acting eh--but that could also be b/c of directing, the story had good intentions and made some good points.  as far as the ending...good climax, but nothing was resolved and it seemed like one of those stories you start writing and can't figure out to end it.  it's not like i was expecting the ending to be fullfililng or uplifting so i wasn't disappointed but i could see if someone was expecting more then they would be disappointed.  i agree w/ new wave's post about not being able to relate about the SAT's....one thing my friends had a problem w/ was that they didn't show any parents---and thus didn't explain the pressures the kids were facing.....but i told them that that was the whole point was that their parents DIDn't care what they did beCAUSe they got good grades...as well as the fact that parents are always away at work, kids don't get any attn etc.  overall i think it's a decent first step for Asian Amer. movies.....although just the fact that it was soooo disturbing may not have been the greatest message to put out there.  but i commend the writers on their um.....bravery? to show a different side of Asian Americans.  that's my 2 cents.  as for the cheating subject...i STILL don't know what my final verdict is on that...being that I am a Libra i keep giong back and forth.  however i'm leaning towards that it IS cheating.  but i think the greater majority of society agrees that as long as there is no physical contact then it isn't cheating.  BUT it is still WRONG and calls for some ass kicking!!!!!  another relationship question that one of my friends brought up:  if you had to choose......would you rather marry someone who loved you more than you loved them OR someone who you loved more than they loved you?  i personally don't like the question cuz i wouldn't want to marry anyone who wasn't equally in love w/ me.....but IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE.  bleh hehe  listening to: one more chance--notorios B.I.G. aka Big E.

      friday night and i'm at home blogging ... what can i say ... i'm sick ... or well trying to get better. so i was surfing the net like i always do and found blog sites like blogger. i thought i would list some i like in case anyone at the house wanted to create their own page:   urlLink Xanga  - my friend actually has a page here .. it is pretty cool.  urlLink BlogStudio  - much like Blogger.  urlLink LiveJournal  - this one is pretty good, there seems to be a lot of stuff you can do with it.  urlLink DeadJournal  - a rip on LiveJournal.  eh just some sites to check out.   moving on ... okay darth i think we have already covered the whole "how dirty is MPK and why we should not eat there" topic at the house so we can move on but i just want to state not everyone prepares food the same way. that's all i'm saying.  as for scientology ... yea not my thing but then again some people might not find christianity to be their thing either but that's cool ... oh hedwig to answer your question i have to say plain and simple if the shoe was on the other foot would you feel that was cheating ... just think about it that way. personally i think it is cheating because you can't have feeling for one person and be in a committed relationship with another ... not fair.    on the beat box:  nothing   on my mind:  nothing  on the telly:  nothing .. it's friday ... come on   i will close with this ... something i found on another person's blog page which i thought was funny:   "For all you boneheads, and you know who you are, that think you have to make a statement, let me clue you in on the real world.  Nobody cares if you leave or not. Nobody cares what your statement is. Nobody cares if you walk out having a hissey fit. Because, if you don't own your own business, you work for someone. That someone can get rid of your ugly butt anytime they see fit. If you are going to threaten to walk away because you don't get your way, be prepared to walk. Be prepared to say "Do you want that biggie sized?' because that's about the only job you will be able to get.  Like Martin Sullivan, you're not that big of deal. You're not that important. You're not going to stop the world or business. Get a life. Someone will be happy to jump in and take over.  If you don't like what your boss is doing or you didn't get what you wanted, so what? Either shut up and get on with business or leave. Just don't interrupt anyone else trying to make a living. No one is going to listen to you anyway."   - from The Cynical Curmudgeon

      I started reading this book called  Bruce & Stan's Guide to Cults, Religions, & Spiritual Beliefs .  It's written by those two guys, they are Christian, but they write it with a neutral perspective.  I just finished the chapter on Christianity, and it's an interesting read, but that's not my point.  Anyways so I skipped ahead to read about Scientology, because I was curious to know what it was all about, seeing as how a lot of celebrities participate in this.  The jist (sp?) the concept is the eternal spiritual nature of all people, and this part of humankind is basically good and divine.  The problem is that we are trapped in the physical universe through reincarnation and we keep inhabiting different human bodies, bringing the memory of emotional and physical pain with them each time.  I guess people can follow this concept, but the thing that confused me was that Trained Scientologists called "auditors" help release these negatives, and the only way this can happen is to make donations to the church, the amount being determined by the Church of Scientology.  I'm not here to judge anybody so i'll leave it at that, I just wanted to inform people of what Scientology really was, because it's out there.

       Disclaimer:   this is solely what my own thoughts are on the previous question, if you don't agree with it, it is not a verbal attack on you, some people may share my opinions, others may not, this is just my individual take on it.    **in this blog i use "you" as a general term/person.**  i agree with nkotb on the thought that it's not cheating unless you act on it.  but, if you are going behind your bf/gf back doing this, while he/she doesn't know what's going on, i think that is the beginning stages of cheating, and has the potential to get worse.  i also think that if you care about your bf/gf/(someone without the title, but everyone knows it's the same thing), and do have any romantic intention and think you might act on it, you should think about how your bf/gf would feel if this was happening, and maybe even tell him/her, so that everything is out in the open and nothing is hidden.  i don't know the outcome of what would happen after that, but i don't think that that could be considered cheating.

      first off i just want to state whatever is posted in the house is the opinion of THAT individual and SOLELY them ..... this is an open forum and all opinions should be resepected even if you don't agree with them. anyone in the house who feels uncomfortable about this are more than welcome to leave.  moving on i just want to say sorry to anyone who ever felt i was out there to tear them down, anyone who ever felt my only intention in life was to pick out all their faults and make them 100% aware of them. i never intended that and i'm sorry to any individuals who felt that way. yes i do say a lot of harsh things and yes i do pick out people's faults and who knows maybe it is just to make myself feel better ... (shurg) but i also know that people need to hear some harsh things at times to wake them up ... because they might not be aware of what they are doing. does this justify my actions ???? by all means NO. the most effective method for an individual is for them to come to terms with the flaws in their life and for them to make a change. so i would like to clearly state i will watch and be more aware of the words coming out of my mouth and make sure i am extra aware to people's sensitiveness and emotions.    on the beat box:  the sigur ros cd

      pigern, I completely agree with what you're saying. i hate it when people just talk about themselves non-stop and don't even ask you any questions about what's going on in your life. there are a couple of people in my office like that. you know how i deal with them? uh, i don't talk to them. i don't indulge them in any way or ask them any questions for fear of them rambling on for another 15 minutes about what they ate for breakfast that day. as far as the "all-talk" thing goes, i tend not to believe anybody anyway. so that way, when they say that they will (insert empty promise here), and they don't end up doing it, i'm not disappointed bc i expected nothing from them in the first place.   Was looking at the lineup for the Field Day Festival in NY. I would really wanna see: Blur, Ben Kweller, Ben Lee, The Roots, Liz Phair, Elliott Smith, and The Sea and Cake. and my all time favorite DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL. HAHA! Yeah right.

      okay. so i learned two new things today. well, not exactly brand new but just two realizations. one: people really like to talk about themselves. i was sitting in the lunch room with my coworkers and they went on and on about themselves and their lives. and when i tried to contribute to the conversation, they would nod and continue on. so then i just kept quiet. what's the point? two: people are "all-talk." see, if i say, hey you like this band? i'll make you a compilation cd of their music... i'll actually make them that cd. whereas others will say they do stuff and don't do it. if you aren't going to do it, why say it? oh, right... all-talk. thanks for the phrase new wave. it sums it all perfectly.

      hi hi everyone. gosh, i can't believe it's only monday. or rather mooondays. :o( hee hee. i played the alpha game. that was pretty hard. but it's interesting to think how recognizable brand names are...  so, let's have a blog party at the eighties club yeah? i just need to dig out my eighties clothes... and crimp my hair. anyway, sounds like the war is nearing a close. but what is yet to happen in terms of international affairs is yet to be determined. kind of scary. hm... i saw a free face to face show at cal poly. they were okay. i especially enjoyed hearing "disconnected" live but there were a lot of little kids running around and going crazy. bit annoying. not like a classic dashboard show... those kids are the greatest! hee hee. i was talking to a friend and he was saying how he is probably going to retire soon from going to shows. i mean besides the really great acts, not go to just semi-interesting, mediocre bands. i wonder when i will get too "old" for shows. i can see his point though. the last two shows i went to were solid but i was entertaining the idea of being at home reading/sleeping the whole time. okay, i'm off to bed... please excuse my randomness.

      my review of  better luck tomorrow  - right off the bat i'm not going to lie to you ... i didn't think it was great however i did think it was good/fair. i found it hard to care for any of the characters, none of them were redeeming. you just felt they deserved everything they got coming to them. the movie is much more relateable if i was still in high school and i guess a lot of that had to do with the fact it was set in high school. the typical concerns of sat scores and extra curricular actitives for your  application seems ages ago for me. another problem i had with the movie was the weak representation of asian american women. if there were women in the movie they were either prostitutes or angry asian girls. okay but aside from all the negative comments come the postitive. i personally thought the actors did a good job even if others didn't. i thought the director justin lin did a great job esp. with the camera work.  and i guess the biggest postive remark i can make is this will hopefully open doors up for an asian american market ... so we don't get lumped together with the white people in the pie chart. in conclusion i think everyone should see this movie .. it may not be the best but hey i would hate to think this is the last all asian american cast movie to be ever made ... there has to be a demand for this before they can make a supply of them. sorry if this review is weak, i can't express myself in writing very well :(  moving on ... okay nick what is going on with your mouth. i think you just dug yourself into a hole with that whole jaw/mouth thing ... ha ha .... darth and mac make fun of her yea. i can see your concern about your dad nick and the whole SARS thing however you do know that not everyone dies from it once you get it. sometimes i think people don't do enough research about stuff and rather follow the mass hysterical that comes with certain events.   oh and mac ... i wonder who that "someone" was who could not go to disneyland because she stole 3 pieces of licorce and had to miss a school dance on top of that. HA HA no no it couldn't be me right .... man brightwood was beyond lame. i miss the glory days when i use to get made fun of all the time because i was lame and never had a cool boyfriend to make out with behind the handball courts ... well at least we had golf as an elective and we got to go to catalina, space camp, europe, idlewild, washington dc, dana point and the list goes on ... ha ha darth.  i'll leave with this: "pessimists live in fear of their hope, optimists in fear of their fear" - james richardson   on the beat box:  get on the floor - the promise ring

      BWC 4 LIFE!  woo hoo! ok, so i'm back in the house...finally!   sorry to hear about your situation mac.  i feel for you cuz that totally would irritate me too.  but ya know, you just gotta accept that people can be like that and try not to let it bother you.  that's all i have to say about that.  ok, so i've been talking to my dad who lives in hong kong and am trying to convince him not to come to the states for my sis's graduation cuz he's gonna give us SARS.  does that suck that i don't want him to come?  i'm just trying to be on the safe side...is it true that someone in LA got infected last week?   dinner last night was pretty cool...kinda hard when they're are people that don't get along...how uncomfortable is that...but that was a classic moment when one certain person was talking about salaries and taxes again (ha ha...only new wave will get this).  that was classic.  but one bad thing did come out of dinner yesterday..i pulled a muscle in my jaw.  shut up mac and darth,  i know what you're thinking.  that's just dirty.  but i saw a doctor and he actually told me that i had pulled the muscle.  sucks...ok, that wasn't the best word to use.

      Went to an 80's club (Three Clubs?) in L.A. on Friday night. I never knew I could have that much fun in L.A. of all places. Besides the massive amounts of people I quite enjoyed myself. However, I think there are some general rules that people should abide by on the dance floor. 1) If you are not going to be dancing, please don't take up space on the dance floor or anywhere near the the entrance of the dance floor. 2) If you are a single guy, and you see single girls dancing, do not automatically assume you can butt in and start dancing with us. Ask first. We will probably say no. (haha) 3) If you are a single guy trying to butt into single girls dancing and they give you weird looks and are turning their backs to you, this means they do not want to dance with you!! (See #2) 4) Please stay within your own space. Do not do that kind of crazy dancing where people standing in your perimeter could potentially be injured.  5) Do not back up into others, Do not push your big butt into others and almost knock them down bc your butt is so damn big.  6) Wear lots of deodorant please. "Are you Sure?" I don't think so.   Sorry, just more things that annoy me these days..........................................  Hope everyone had a good weekend :D  Listening to: Nelly Furtado f/ Esthero - "I feel you" - great song

      darth and new wave drinks and dinner was good times.  the lesbian reference aboout the "golden #%$^@*" was the best.  i'm still cracking up.    so my weekend is almost over, now i have the wonderful opportunity to drive back down to san diego and work for another week.  man....  sorry if it seems like i hate work, i really don't.  just i like it better up here in la, because of the hollywood scene.  yeah right..  so this weekend i viewed "better luck tomorrow" and "anger management"  both were decent picks as it turns out.  i guess i'll write more about it tomorrow when i'm at work.  as for new wave's comment on the handball court thing, i have a few more memories to add.  sorry if you can't relate to this portion of it.  the far handball courts comment, i think i get it, but i believe i went to a different school (GO MARGUERITA whatever we were).  and no no, you got it wrong, the far handball courts were where the cool people did fake drugs, i dunno if you knew about that, but ya they did fake drugs there.  and isn't that one container next to the bungalow classes where chia pet broke chan-man's heart?  ya i think it was.  haha.  or what about when "someone" couldn't go to disneyland.  hahahaha.  man i don't miss elementary school at all.

      well i guess i'm guilty of that pet peeve...but i think if that person is a true friend it won't matter and they will be there for you.  yeah it's annoying, but at the same time maybe it's just something that should be expected?  you get lost in the whole love thing and each time I tell myself i'm not gonna do that again(take my friends for granted)...but in the end i do that and it sux.  but on the other hand i'm more understanding of my friends who neglect me.  *shrug*.  dobule edge sword.    anyway, work sux.    listening to: the prayer---celine dion and andrea bocelli.......i'm gonna switch it to the version w/ josh groban and charlotte church in a sec......

      waiting for something to finish dl so i guess i will blog ...  hey NKOTB rules you have not been blogging ... do you still want in the house ... if not you're out.  mac the knife and darth ... it was nice having dinner with you guys ... good conversation (wiping tears of laughter from my eyes)  bored bored bored ... not sure what to write about. one pet peeve i have this week is people who have problems in their relationship and then decide well i have my friends to turn to for comfort but it is like hello you hardly talk to us and now you expect us to care. oh and i'm really not into hanging out with couples ... i guess because i'm getting a freak image of what life is going to be like for me when all my friends start getting married. it is hard when you have friends who seem like married people and you are single to hang around that. it makes you feel left out like when all the cool couples would hang out in the far handball court at brightwood school ... ha ha only a few people will get that. yea but seriously i mean i heard when you get married that's pretty much it in the whole friend dept. thing ... in that you won't really have any unless they are other married people ... esp. if you have kids ...    on the beat box:  out of time - blur  ... THIS IS SO GOOD :)

      to finish the rest of those lyrics, sad to say i know it, it's "so i can spy on my girlfriend" or at least that's the wyclef version i remember.  also i saw i love the 80's not too long ago and i think that was what the lyrics were, either that or i have a hearing problem.  i'm easily irritated these days i don't know why, i think it's the damn weather down here in san diego, it's supposed to be nice, but it's stuffy.  oh well.

      okay, #874 on the LIST OF THINGS THAT ANNOY ME: People who wear sunglasses at night or indoors. Unless you have a medical problem that requires you to do this, I hate you. Do these people think they have to keep up the facade of being "cool" or whatever?

      currently listening on winamp:  Rise Against - Everchanging  (this song is kick ass) and  Jawbreaker - Accident Prone   better luck tomorrow is, despite the director saying it isn't, based on students from a high school in fullerton called sunny hills.  the characters and the plot line are identical to what happened there.  i've heard this from my friends that went there, so i guess take what you can from that.  so it's not an original story, i guess, because it's a true story, scary isn't it, that it really happened.  i'm still going to watch it, only because the MILF guy is in it, he's cool.  i'm gonna go with darth, and we're gonna go get some pho and boba after too.  right??  darth also told me he loves the invASIAN, because he secretly likes wang zhi zhi and chan ho park.  l.a. people are cool, i don't know what you guys are talking about.  who else can pull off wearing sunglasses at night?  doesn't everybody not like being able to see at night?  that's supposed to be trendy?  blech.  prfft.  sorry i can't control my orufices (sp?)    you know what's a sweet movie, slc punk.  haven't seen it in a while but i'm reminded of it because of the mention of the mod club.  anyways it's a good rent, for those of you who haven't seen it, plus shaggy is in it.  no not the boombastic one.

      about the main character---yeah it's stereotypical but i guess the twist is he has a dark side...he's in a "suburban gang" which i think is kinda gay but *shrug*.  The thing I think is somewhat cool about this movie is that ANYONE could play these characters...they could be white, black, whatever and the story would fit.  Granted, I don't know MUCH or think much about the plot but in that sense I think it's different.  Plus if it's getting props from sundance and toronto film festivals it cant' be all THAT bad.  and the UCI/UCLA comment about non-diversity.....UCR is fast approaching, if not already there. invASIAN.  IT'S SNOWING AND IT'S APRIL!!!!!!!! listening to: ll cool j--'round the way girl

      hey hedwig yea i have heard of better luck tomorrow. i've been getting e-mails about it. the movie plot sounds weak but the all asian cast is appealing. i'm not sure if i like the concept of the main character being all smart and set for some great ivy league college along with living in a nice upper class suburia ... doesn't that just encourage the whole model minority theory which is bullshit anyways ???? moving on the part about the pie chart is even more absurd ... nice to know us asians are lumped together with the caucasians ... dang we can't even get our own section. i'm with you hedwig ... stupid pie chart. i could go on about this but why bother ... no one cares and nothing will change.  see i would totally go to a club like Underground but then i remember it is in LA and then i remember I HATE EVERYONE. hello dorkus i thought you were like that as well, come on now. maybe i should go to century club or hollywood and highland because those places are BUMPING. (rolling my eyes) PLEASE ... those places are filled with such hardcore posers who have no idea what it is like to be an individuals ... bah bah bah goes the sheeps ..... however that place did play blur and they rock.  so i guess i should talk about my trip to davis ... it was nice, the weather was good. one thing i did like was the mix of people. i mean you saw blacks, whites and asians all hanging out together just chilling. see that's one thing i miss about college is the more diverse environment you are placed in .... except for UCLA and UCI which is segregated like mad. ha ha. oh and dorkus i saw tons of asian guys with their white girlfriends so ha to that loser guy from before. he is so stupid. i just like the part where he wrote he has been all over the nation and hasn't see too many of them .... please stupid guy they do exist you are just too stupid to see that. oh and i do hate my peeps sometimes.  there were these asians sitting near us when we were eating and they were SO ANNOYING. i wanted to kick them all in the face, they were loud and rude and just so typ. blech.   on the beat box:  rain - erasure (they are so flaming)

      anyone hear about the movie better luck tomorrow?  urlLink  link   i was talking to my friend who just came from an asian american convention and i guess one of the stars from the movie was tehre promoting the movie and talking about how hard it was to get this movie done.  anyway, he had told a story about when they were meeting w/ execs in hollywood or something.....and they showed a pie chart of moviegoer trends...it had caucasian, african american and latino.  and they were like, "well where are the asian americans?" and the guy said, "oh well asian americans tend to go with caucasian trends so they're put in the caucasian part of the chart."  WTF??   another incident was that universal was going to do the movie for like 10 mil or something IF it didn't star any asians..........so obviously they didn't go w/ universal. it went to sundance and MTV films picked it up.  so yeah...i read the synopsis, the movie sounds ok.  i can't go watch it when it comes out b/c it's not playing in philly cuz there are no asians here hehe....but check it out.  if it does well in theaters then it will help put us asians on that pie chart....stupid pie chart.  :P   silence.........

      Okay,  I went to Underground last night. For those of you have not heard of it, it's a Brit Pop indie / mod club in L.A. Let me just say, I hated everyone there. Darn kids with their stringy unwashed emo / mod combovers, vintage clothes, and skinny pants. They act like they are in the wrong time zone, like by some fluke of an accident, they were propelled from the 60's to the year 2003. What's wrong with these people? I think the only way you have fun at a place like this is if you go with a group of friends who want to sit at one of the tables, have a couple drinks, hang out, and listen to some music. Warning: Do NOT go onto the dance floor unless you want to be hit by a skinny swinging limb of a mod kid. Their swaying from side to side 80's type dancing can seriously be harmful to your health. As far as the music goes, I recognized Blur, Hot Hot Heat, Kylie Minogue (huh?), and some other oldies.   Currently listening to: Aaliyah - Miss You. Awww, the video is so sweet and sad.... :(

      hello!  i realized i have been MIA for awhile now.  well, two weeks... let's see.  i've been busy following idlewild.  hah hah.  my trip north was tops!  the venue in sac was so small, i was able to talk to the bands.  which makes me wonder, if a band member is hanging around after the show and you make chit chat like, hey i liked your set... blah blah.  does that make you look like a groupie or something?  i'm never sure if they like to be bothered.  but then if they didn't i guess they would stay backstage rather than sit in front with everyone else?  anyway, the sac show was so much better than the l.a. one.  first of all, the crowd was 21 and over up north whereas the l.a. one had teenagers.  then people were dressed very hipster... what's with wearing black sunglasses indoors?  can they see anything?  oh, and the 80s is officially back people.  if you didn't know, check out urban outfitters.  let's all pull out our off the shoulder shirts, neon colored tights, and plastic black bracelets.  plus, most of the people there didn't seem to be big idlewild fans.  with the exception of a few who were really rawkin', most people just stood there with detatched disinterest.  making it clear they were just there to be seen.  argh!  l.a. people!  which is why new wave would want to kill herself if she went to ucla.  hah hah. but overall i had fun because i was a bit tipsy.  oh, and dorkus you don't have to buy me drinks in the plural.  because i am an extreme lightweight.  one will do!  seriously.  but that's good because it's cheaper.  ;o) hey darth, did new wave tell you about the offer a rep gave us for dodgers' box seats?  hee hee.  there are several nights and he listed all the giveaways too.  our svp wants our team to go to at least one but i have NO interest.  sitting around watching a ballgame?  booooring! hm, last note to dorkus: i was reading an article on BK and he said he's psyched to play coachella because then he has an opportunity to see the other acts play.  hope i run into him.  he seems so interesting... in that weird, dork kind of way. oh, and congrats to everyone on all their good news.   i'm off to see idlewild in san diego.  should be a good show because (1) it's not in l.a.  (2) it's a 21 and over club cheers!

      Darth, I had my wisdom teeth pulled out two years ago, and one of them got infected. I like to think I have a high threshold for pain (but I really don't). Getting my infectious wisdom tooth treated was the worst pain I have ever been through. You know what a shot in the gums feels like? Imagine that feeling for an hour straight right at the back of your mouth, and you will not be a happy person. Good luck!   Oh yeah, I am quite interested in seeing "Fun Pigern" too. Let's all buy her drinks, get her buzzed, then sit back and be entertained. Haha jk.

      i wanted to post this last night but i was way too tired ... and kinda of in pain.  i went and saw me some  idlewild  at the el rey: idlewild was really good, they played a great set. the two opening bands however .... blew so hard. the first was natural history and the whole time i was thinking are you guys hot hot heat and their look was straight out of the strokes closet. ha ha. then the french kicks came on and i was even less impressed. darth thinks it was because i was so pissed from the first band that it affected my judgement for the next one .... i'm going to have to agree with him. the lead singer of both bands looked exactly alike, it was like the same guy went to the back and just changed their shirts. and what is the deal with bands being all skinny ... i'm going to start the help these sorry ass bands out with some food fund. ha ha. yea i like the lead singer from D.O.L.L. he was all fat and had a gap between his teeth ... awesome.  and don't get me started on the people there. i wanted to kick so many people's asses. okay it has been decided i hate LA shows and the people that go. shows for me now have to be 21 and over or at least 25 and over. ha ha. there were these freshman girls from ucla there along with other college kids .... some high school people ... this girl who really took the 80's are back memo to heart and was decked out in a tank top with a torn shirt off one shoulder and these pointy shoes with a big white bow on it ... and tons of hipster looking people. i truly believe that the environment you are around affects how you will enjoy the show.   i did learn something new .... pigern is SO MUCH more fun when she is buzzing ... WAY less moody. ha ha. she is like fun bobby from that one friends ep ... you know where he is only fun when he is drinking. ha ha.    on the beat box:  whatever is on 92.3 fm

      i was gonna blog tomorrow b/c i'm getting sleepy but i'll blog now.  let's see.......  backups:  I am not a fan.  I don't think I'd want to get married just for the hell of it/just because you're "supposed" to get married.  I want to get married b/c I found someone I want to spend the rest of my life with not settle for someone who is as unfortunate as me who hasn't found anyone yet either. no fun and a bit complicated.  employee of the quarter: i think i can imagine how you feel dorkus.  it would be like me winning the $500 scholarship at this research day i'm submitting my pathetically half-assed project to this month.  i haven't done ish all semester.  that would kinda cool actually hehe.  i hate research......hate's too strong.....let's just say i'm not a fan of doing research.  :)  separate subject-east vs. west coast:  this is an ongoing debate; forgive me if i have posted this argument before.  2 of my friends from NY i've noticed say "i'm waiting ON line at the movies."  I have done a very small poll of west coast people and they say "IN line".  My friend and I have a theory that east coasters say ON and west coasters say IN....but HER friend from Jersey says IN.  So it may just be NYers.  what do you guys say? and do you know any east coasters that could help in my lil "experiment"?  personally, i think "on" line is retarded but whatever.  Oh, evidence for the east/NY theory is that on FRIENDS ross says "on" line....altho the show is taped in LA, but the writers i'm assuming are NYers??  *shrug* just something random that bothers me hehe...weird NYers. :P  time to sleeeeep.

      Oh yeah, today I was awarded the Employee of the Quarter Award (I was one of 6 out of the entire company). First off, nobody decided to tell me. They just sent out a company wide email, and when I saw my name, I was like, "What?" And then I started laughing because it is just plain ridiculous. It would have mattered more to me had they given me the award when I was actually trying and putting forth effort. I've only bitched for the last three months about how I hate my job and then they give me the award now? How does that make sense? I think they are seriously out of the loop. I have two theories on how this happened: A) They went down the list of people in my department who haven't received any kind of awards yet, and saw my name on the list. B) The award had a typo and I am really the "UnEmployee of the Quarter." The last one makes more sense.

      Congrats to Hedwig! Will you be moving to Pomona too? Stay outta the ghettoes!!!  Anyway, just a random question: Do you guys believe in having a back up? You know, someone you'll "marry" and settle down with if case you don't have someone? (Yeah, like in the Friends episode.) I don't. I was just wondering if anyone here has one. (Don't worry - I'm not looking! haha) Two of my friends are each other's back ups, and their cut off is at 30 years old. That is, if they reach 30 and haven't found someone yet, they are going to settle down w/ each other. Maybe I am more optimistic than that; Isn't there still hope after 30? Shouldn't the cut off be at around 35 or 40? AND I'm wondering how that whole back up thing works. Like, does this mean you are going to be a real married couple with all that that entails? Or are you going to have a "husband" with whom you have a platonic relationship with? I just don't get it people!

      man dorkus it is so obvious you LOVE PEOPLE as much as i do ... HA HA. okay what did we learn today ... people are stupid ... how is this different from any other day ... it isn't. well we might have to confirm that people are stupid though ... so hmmm could i have a confirmation on that.  hedwig ... love the x-files reference ... i was watching my season 7 x-files dvd a few days ago, the hollywood a.d. ep, which is so funny. anyways i was laughing out loud. it was so funny but apparently not so funny to pigern who kept giving me strange looks. could be also because she thinks i'm a freak when it comes to the x-files.

      I hate idiotic people.  This is a conversation I had with one of our customers today:  Idiot: Hi, I received a confirmation for my order. I just wanted to make sure my order was okay. Me: So you already received a confirmation? (trying not to be a smartass) Idiot: Yeah, I just wanted to "dot my I's and cross my T's" Me: So you want me to..(pause, rolling of eyes) confirm your confirmation? Idiot: Yes Me: (thinking in my head: What the f**k do you think a confirmation is? Why would I have to f**king confirm your confirmation? Do you want me to confirm the confirmation of your confirmation too?)

Isn't National City more ghetto?  In and around there.  I think my cousin's old house is prolly a crack house by now.

      only a few more days and may will be over. dang 2003 is almost half over ... what the heck. i watched 24 hour party people yesterday ... good movie. well i liked it but honestly it is geared towards someone who cares about a. joy division and the happy mondays b. manchester, england and c. the whole new wave / rave culture. so you can see why i liked it. side note i think ian curtis is a genius ... well not as wonderful as robert of course ... or thom. moving on ... watching the movie made me really want to go to manchester and check it out. i need to get out of the states ... too bad sars had to happen because i would have been to china/hong kong in a flash. oh well. summer months are upon us soon which just makes me hate work even more. i'm cooped up in a building all day long and the sun is shining brightly outside :( ... not that i even like the sun but i'm just saying .. it makes you want to go outside and have fun and blah blah blah.   on the beat box:  more than a woman - aaliyah

      Woohoo. I have mastered how to edit my template and thus will keep this one for a while. I am now using frontpage to edit and then cut and paste the html codes. YAAY. i got my westernu email today. it's awesome to feel a part of something new. i'm really looking fwd to going to school. new ppl, new experiences. so i set up my emails and there were already a couple of emails out there about females lookin for roommates. so i emailed a couple of them back. hopefully they're cool ppl. i feel all busy like ihave so many things to do before i leave. but it feels invigorating. it feels like i'm alive and have purpose in life. it's great. we're going bowling tomorrow. woohoo! AND spaghetti warehouse. sangria. yum. hehe. tomorrow i have a bunch of errands to run. tying up loose ends here in philly. man it's only 10 and i feel like it's 2am. i think thats' what happens when you work all day. my roommate told me i was glaring at a customer today when she walked by. i feel bad now. i mean ppl who know me would not say i was a mean/rude person, but i think my job makes me that way geez. i feel so bad cuz i get annoyed at stupid/ignorant/slow ppl. that's not the way to be. i can't help it. :( hopefully i will get better with that as i get into my career. COMPASSION IS KEY! hehe. pray for me. i'm going home in 7 days and counting... listening to: Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds Live-Christmas Song oh and i know most of you don't care much for these two concerts but I DO!!!!!!  I'm going yay! John Mayer/Counting Crows July 18 in Irvine DMB July 29 in Chula Vista YEAH BABY!

      yeah i think girls have it harder for the reasons just mentioned, plus the whole biological clock thing...career...having babies--when does one have time?  esp for doctors who have a good 8 years of their life planned out...and lately i've been thinking, when the hell am i supposed to reproduce?  they say that having a baby after 30 there is an increased chance of birth defects.  i'll get out of med school at 28.....residency/internship another 4 years.....WHEN DAMMIT??  add to that periods, cramps, the whole estrogen roller coaster.....sigh hehe.  *steps off soap box*  so i had to blog about this.  some dude killed himself about a block away from my apt..it was actually half a block away in the next building.  he hung himself from the roof...but the horrifying part is...due to the force of gravity or perhaps the sharpness of whatever he hung himself with, or both...he was decapitated------RIGHT DOWN THE STREET!  And my boss told me that apparently he screamed when he jumped and then asked me if i had heard it......good thing i've been desensitized to loud noises coming from the alley.....how freaky is that?!  and with that last note i say......13 more days until i go back to sunny CA.

      i must admit, i like watching good day LA with steve, jill & dorothy.  they are comedy!  its much better than those "for-old-people" katie kurrick(sp?) shows. i must also acknowledge that it is harder for women in general.  having 8 sisters myself, i know how hard it can be. so yeah,   BLUR ALL THE WAY!

      new wave, i think girls do have it harder than guys for the most part. first of all, there is the glass ceiling in the workplace. then there are expectations placed on women regarding looks. if you watch the telly, women are expected to be v. attractive but men... less so. i learned in one of my comm studies classes that older men are considered wiser and intelligent. but older women? obsolete. case in point: the lame morning show on fox where you have two younger, attractive women and some balding, old guy. or look at films where they pair jack nicholson with v. young women (i.e. helen hunt) or harrison ford with anne heche. well, i better go get some rest. i'm feeling a tad under the weather. i'm currently listening to coldplay. i know what you might think - "overrated" - but i still think they are tops! excited to see them next weekend. yippee!

      sorry hedwig ... i mean i can't wait till you become a D.O. :)  oh my gosh ... T.W.I.F.O.S.L.Y just blogged ... stop the presses. ha ha. but seriously ftc it is all about that blur show. we just need to find out when tickets go on sale. BLUR !!!!   i think jennifer connelly is too classy to play wonder woman .. you need someone a bit more rough around the edges, with more spunk. way too much h & m talk but it's cool ... i'm learning to be a girl so maybe in a few days i'll be talking like you guys as well.  went and saw machomer at the UCI Barclay theatre with dorkus melorkus tonight. this guy rick miller does all these simpson character voices to the story of macbeth. macbeth, by the way, was written by shakespeare ... in case you are moron and didn't know that. honestly it was pretty impressive. it was a one man show so this guy was doing all the roles. at the end he did this little comedy thing that was really funny. i had a good time.   so i had a little conversation with mac the knife on aim about girls and guys and the differences and how girls have really low self esstem and blah blah blah. so asking the girls in the house ... don't you all feel it is harder to be a woman than a man. there are these crazy expectations and levels that woman seem to have to reach to get accepted into society. i personally feel that because i'm not femine enough i'm outcasted or detached (view my imood) from a certain degree of people and social groups. sometimes i think conforming would be just be easier ... but then i remember ... I HATE PEOPLE.   on the beat box:  why does it always rain on me - travis ... THEY ARE SO GOOD.

      just a disclaimer about H&M in NY...be prepared to wait in a long ass line for the fitting rooms where you can only take 15 items in.  but it's well worth it.  i took 11 items in and walked away w/ 9 :)  also something really cool about H&M is that their accessories are soooooooo cheap.  i bought sunglasses for 3.50...this silver necklace thing w/ a cross for 3.50 and a black military belt for 5.50.  My cousin bought hair accessories for $1....now tell me that ain't a great deal!  ok i'll get off my H&M soap box now.  i'm gonna be so sad to back to CA w/o H&M haha.  it's the best place if you're cheap--i mean, practical! listening to: Kelly Clarkson-Anytime

      good call with both of those dorkus!  i will be sure to relay it to my fellow HP fans about your casting.  i dunno about boston, but NY...hit the "tourist" spots if you haven't already...i mean you can't go wrong w/ NY.  Central Park was my favorite...everything was so pretty--this is of course if it's a nice sunny day out.  depending on where you're staying there should be an H&M nearby...there's one on 5th ave & 51st.  food....there was this pizzaria--John's Pizzaria on 42nd st...if you're going north on broadway...make a left.  I'm not sure if it's 42nd tho....:-\  What else.....there's this place called French Roast, it's a cute lil cafe dealie that serves breakfast anytime and they have good food...but I dunno where it's at.  My friend said it was near "the village"...so that should give u an idea.  Get one of those "street smart" maps...they work really well and it's laminated so you can do whatever you want w/ it.  but that's all my advice :)  hope it helps.  oh and i FINALLY watched the season finale of Friends...and i have to say that it was really good.  prolly one of the best ones they've done.  it was v. funny(and the show hasn't been all that funny lately-i think monica's hair did the trick), suspenseful and dramatic(drama like "ooh omg i can't believe that" or "KISS HER DAMMIT!"), and it wasn't all a big cliffhanger production...just good clean fun.  kudos to the Friends writing staff.  :)  and lastly, does anyone watch smallville or know any smallville fans that actually watch the show religiously? if so, can you ask them, or can you tell me HOW the hell did Lionel Luther, Lex's dad get his eyesight back?  just something that's been bothering me, cuz one day he was blind...then all of a sudden he can just see.  miraculous i tell ya.

      hmm, i think jennifer connelly would make a good wonder woman, and since hedwig asked, i think viggo mortensen would be a good sirius black, but only if he has the same long brown hair that he has in LOTR.  all right, so i'm going to boston/NY in june. any suggestions hedwig? i know you mentioned how you spent all this money at H&M. trust me, i am SO there.

Think Tank is really good, i love "ambulance", beautiful song.  looks like the elastica corner is making some noise, donna has her new band and justine is featured on a new single by pleasure (downloadable at  urlLink elasticated.org ) so not much going on, its starting to get unbearably hot, damn the valley! until next time.... ta ta clarisse

      hello... congrats hedwig on graduating! sounds like your ny trip was tops. i know what you mean about h&m. i'm conflicted though because then everyone would have clothes from there (if it was on the west coast). i too have spent quite a large sum of money at that store. i know what you mean... $100 is really not that much to spend there. not like anthropologie where you can buy one item for $100. sounds like everyone went out of town this past weekend. i was boring and did nothing. i think i cleaned my room. i forgot it's a three day weekend. does anyone have big plans? i (as usual) have none. wow. i'm starting to sound lame. better end here.

      Hey everyone Congrats to graduation Hedwig!!!   Thanks one more time to Mac, for the cool weekend in vegas...everyone disco dancing!!! it was a lot of fun, yeah i like the stupid drugged up lady that cost us all money, and the sexist dealer who was playing too. Bowling at 4 am is definetly fun, there needs to be more 24 lanes out here. The 1.95 steak and eggs combo, and .99 pancake sandwhich were also some of the highlights....I'm still kicking myself because i had been thinking about just throwing down 100 bucks on my first blackjack hand hoping that I could win an instant 100 and just chill the rest of the weekend, well i contemplated it and when i sat down, I backed out and only bet 5 bucks, and guess what, yep blackjack!!! damn i could've had 150 bucks, man i'm dumb sometimes. The star trek drink brought out fun brad which was entertaining but come sat night I think everyone was pretty much in "fun" moods haha....not sure if she was actually a teenage prostitute, but she was wearing a short mini skirt, a tight pink tank top, high heels and was knocking on the car window...hmmmm  Sorry Sac sucked so much usher, but then again it is sac....i'd like to know your scheme for getting into the casinos...did you want to borrow my i.d.? cause i think you could pull off looking like  a white guy. and make sure you stay at a hotel with a swiming pool cause then you can say its chlorine....dumbass  Fun weekend, looking forward to the 3 day coming up, need to catch up on sleep....Thanks again mac, and hope your car freshner is making your drive to work everyday that much better and don't forget....go to college a university........hahaha

      NY is so cool.  this last trip was prolly the best trip to NY i've had.  we stayed at a hotel for a night so that made the trip chill and not so rushed.  we got to see RENT on broadway.....and that Frenchie girl who got kicked off American Idol was playing one of the swings in the play...actually she played the soloist on Seasons of Love.  The performances themselves...like the group as a whole was just ok.  Some songs were really good and some songs they performed like bleh.  but it was still an awesome experience.  we went around central park and i got to see more of it than i ever had...soooooooo pretty and it was a lovely day.  I spent 130 bucks at H&M...and even tho it seems like a lot...I got my money's worth.  :)  Everything is so cheap there...I swear they need to open some West Coast stores cuz seriously I would just shop there all the time.  I'm starting to get really sad about leaving Philly.  :(    Listening to: Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride--Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu and the Kamehameha School's Childrens Choir(Lilo and Stitch)

      currently listening to:  solea - mercy was here   hedwig congratulations on your graduation.  went to vegas this past weekend with darth, new wave, and a few of my other friends.  it was pretty cool, even though i think i was drunk most of the time, and therefore lost some cash along the way, due to that fact.  don't know for some reason, when you're drunk, you're judgment isn't as good.  go figure.  i must say there are some interesting people that come out of the woodwork though in vegas.  darth and i had the great privelege of playing blackjack next to the craziest most F'ed up lady at Treasure Island.  or maybe she was just plain stupid.  i mean you would think that if the dealer had a 5 showing, and she had a 16, you're supposed to hit right?  well that was her theory, so she kept hitting on everything, doubling down on 12, and guess what, she kept getting her damn cards, and making darth and i lose along the way.  oh did i mention that she was probably hopped up on something, and seemed like she just came out of the looney bin?  the best i can describe her is as a crazy "cat" lady.  oh well, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  my friend johnney met this interesting, ummm, how do you put it, uhhh, drugdealer at a bar.  that was sweet too.  he kept touching him and calling him holmes and asked if he wanted to score some weed.  oh ya i wasn't there to see this one, but this is an account of what new wave and darth told me as well, i guess some teenage prostitute hit them up on the road somewhere to the hotel, i think it was just some girl trying to be friendly, haha, but let them tell you about it, cause i don't have all the info, and i wouldn't want to get the story wrong, might come off ignorant.  like i said, what dumbas.... i mean really cool people.    overall the trip itself was fun, i mean drinking, gambling, drinking, eating, drinking, lack of sleep, drinking, bowling, drinking....i hope whoever went had fun.  oh and finally, best gift of the weekend...........my Good Charlotte: Riot Girl Air Freshener, Spice Scent.

       Currently listening to: Alkaline Trio -  Good Mourning    hey what's up everyone.  Wonder Woman?  i think Chyna could play her.  or Lucy Lawless.  that would be sweet.  haha.  going to vegas tomorrow, i'm excited.  going to watch matrix reloaded tonight.  did anyone see the last dawson's last night?  (hanging head low) i'll admit i caught most of it, but what i really want to note is how awesome the ending was.  "i don't want to wait for our lives to be over"  hahaha that was the worst piece of writing ever on television.  hahaha, my stool can write better than that.  on a brighter note of television, one of my favorite bands Alkaline Trio was on Conan tuesday night.  did anyone catch that?   they played "all on black" and i must say that it was a good performance, they didn't sound as good as Good Charlotte, but i was happy.  haha.  and i was supposed to blog this long paragraph about how i miss brightwood, but i couldn't cut and paste it so i'm sorry new wave and other brightwood alum.  but nick if you still have the email i sent to you with it, could you do me a favor and post it or just send it to new wave.  thanks.  VEGAS BABY VEGAS!  Darth you are so money.  I think in order to prep for my trip I will watch Swingers tonight.  alright everyone take care this weekend, and God bless.

Just heard that j-ho, buffy, and sandra bullock are all vying for the role of wonder woman, i can't, nor do i want to see any of these three actresses as wonder woman, but at the same time i can't think of any one who could fill the role....Do any of you have any ideas? My coworker just let me borrow the matrix, so with any luck I should be able to finally watch it and thus be prepared for the sequel....vegas in one day....peace out

      feeling spacier than an astronaut... i have been so spacey lately. no idea why. not work related. not drug related. just distracted by nothingness. does that make sense? anyway, as an example of my distracted stupidity, i went out to breakfast with a coworker and rep. i parked in a metered parking space and proceeded to NOT feed the meter. why? i don't know. i guess because everytime i park near a meter, it's after six p.m. and it is no longer necessary to pay. then i sit outside the restaurant, as the meter police give me my parking violation ticket basically right in front of me. all i would have to do is turn around and see that i was being ticketed. durrr... luckily it was only $35. hm, actually, that is more than ucla. because i've been ticketed there and it was $25.  more of my hard earned cash blowing away in the winds of misfortune. another such incident? fantastic sam's. i went to get a simple trim. very simple. so simple that it took the woman twenty minutes at most to cut my hair. i just wanted a trim. but i had to wait an hour. there were three people in front of me. then when they call me next, the worker doesn't even bother to sweep away the last customer's hair. ewww. gross. i wanted to run out of there. horrid. in fact... why didn't i? always follow your instinct to run. and at the end of it all, they charge me $14. i can't believe it. what a rip off.  all i did today was make phone calls and harass people. what a day.

      Currently listening to:  NOFX - The War on Errorism LP  First off, Happy Belated Mother's Day to all the Mom's and Mr. Mom's out there, and to Mr. Nanny as well, right Darth?  Sorry I haven't been blogging, i've just been being lazy, plus I got stuck with this long and tedious project at work.  Not too fun.  So where is everyone?  Seems pretty empty these days.  Has anyone seen Mr. America?  The new guy on WWE, man he's great.  I'm boring right now, sorry I don't have anything really intersting to say.  Oh i'm turning the big 24, and we're going to Vegas.  Darth and New Wave are coming and it should be good times out there.  I recently made some purchases, first off the NOFX cd i'm listening to right now and also The Clash - Essential Clash cd.  I'm also looking forward to getting the new Alkaline Trio -Good Mourning that comes out this tuesday.  I will also be purchasing I Against I and Jawbreaker, those are kind of old, but it sure beats the crap out there right now, except of course for Good Charlotte.

      hedwig you forgot to put a link to your site so i'll do it for you:  urlLink A Day in the Life   ... go check it out everyone :) ...  i wonder who or where these threatening e-mails are coming from (shurg) oh well ... (insert evil laugh here).  saw x2 on friday and it was good. i didn't think there were too many characters like a lot of reviews were saying ... i personally thought there should have been more. oh and i got to hang out with t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y so that was cool as well :) ... FOR THE CHEESE.  nice long quote btw dorkus ... i esp. like the part about the moving from job to job bit ... ha ha. hmmm let me think who can that be that we might know.   so i went out with my cousins tonight and it was good times. i have to say family is important because they have a bit of your blood in them you know ... that's a pretty cool idea if you think about it.    on the beat box:  doves cds ... actually nothing but that was the last thing i was listening to.

      Yes, I too received a threatening email saying that if I didn't blog, I would be killed. So here I am, blogging, so that I will no longer have to fear for my life.  New Wave and Darth, this one's for you. It's an excerpt (sp?) from David Sedaris' Naked.  "I have known people who can quit one job and find another in less time than it takes to quarter a fryer. Regardless of their experience, these people exude charm and confidence. The charm is something they were either born with or had beaten into them at an early age, but what gives them their confidence is the early knowledge that someone like me has also filed an application......During episodes of unemployment I find it rewarding to sleep as much as possible - anywhere from twelve to fourteen hours a day is a good starting point. Sleep spares you humiliation and saves money at the same time: nothing to eat, nothing to buy, just lie back and dream your life away. I'd wake up in the afternoon, watch my stories on TV, and then head over to the sofa for a few more hours of shut-eye. It became my habit to pick up a newspaper just after five o'clock and spend some time searching the want ads, wondering who might qualify for any of the advertised positions: vault verifier, pre-press salesman, audit technical reviewer. Show me the child who dreams of being a sausage-casing inspector....." - David Sedaris, "Something for Everyone"  Hmm, the part about people having one job right after the other sure does remind me of a certain person we know................

      can i just say i'm addicted to six feet under ... i can't stop watching it and i'm so involved with the characters. the last time i felt this way was with x-files (the greatest show ever). if any of you guys have a chance i really think you should watch this series.

      i was just sent a threatening email saying that if I don't blog i'm going to be killed or something, so fearing for my life here is a post for you all to enjoy. Lets see so far this week I have cleaned a big portion of my office and put things in order, which is a rarity for me. I saw better luck tomorrow cause I'm asian....haha jk........i thought it was really good movie especially the stylistic directing. Still haven't seen X2 yet, but I think I'll be doing that this weekend, hopefully. Matix comes out shortly as well, which makes me think I should watch the first one, yes I think I may be the only person not to have seen the matrix. looking forward to vegas mac, i'm sure it will be quite a funny little weekend, looking forward to bowling at 4 am and you yacking on my shoes as you have earlier predicted doing. ......okay i hope this is good enough for now......go dodgers, and good luck to the ducks...show that you aren't a hack!!!

      hello everyone. my review of the postal service/jealous sound show... much fun. :o) the high schoolers did not bother me much. but i think i was just happy from my two drinks. i know i know. weak sauce. it was really fun dancing to the postal service but a fight almost broke out because it was so crowded and people were bumping into others. and this one guy got mad and shoved this other person... luckily it didn't get ugly. since xmen2 was so crowded this past weekend, i went to see anger management. ((shudder)) i forgot why i found adam sandler films so repulsive. and then twenty minutes into the film, i was like, "oh yeah! now i remember how i swore not to go see any of his movies after big daddy." i know what you mean hedwig about those japanese girls and their dire need for expensive brand name goods. when i was in paris, our tour guide told us that girls from japan would line up outside the louis vuitton store at five in the morning... and would cry if they didn't get the bag they wanted. wait, it's still just a bag right? did i miss something? it's very strange.

      dang okay no one has been blogging .... for shame everyone :( even myself.   hedwig ... the one good person in the house ... neat you were listening to RENT ... you got me hooked on that play, seriously. as for the japanese thing, it does not surprise me one bit. those people are strange esp. ones like nick edney. (insert evil laugh here)  moving on ... i went to see the jealous sound and postal service tonight. okay is something seriously wrong with me where i hate everything. ha ha. i was NOT impressed by them but then again nothing impresses me right dorkus. to top it off there were like these high school people there and it was bad. like ugly bad. (shiver) like someone made the lead singer of the postal service ask a girl out to their prom bad. (shiver, shiver) freaking way too high school for me. i'm how much older than these kids. i know i know you are saying hey new wave girl don't let these people get to you or don't go to the shows than new wave girl but i guess i do let these people get to me and going to shows give me something to do. better than going to fu**ing lame ass dinners with people you hardly know .... ha ha get that one mac the knife and darth bronger. :)  vegas next weekend. thank goodness. i think i'm getting the shakes from not drinking. ha ha. man and 24 hour bowling in vegas so i'm all over that.  well since i'm in the sharing mood i might as well tell everyone in the house about my first real car accident although it is more of a fender bender. on sunday while going to church some car starts reversing while i was behind him in a driveway .... so i'm honking like mad and honking some more then BANG ... he hits my car :( eh at least no one was hurt and the ins. company is taking care of everything but what a pain.  I WANT TO SEE X-MEN 2 :(

      so i was talking to my coworker who studied in japan for the past 3 months.  she was telling me about this "fad" that they have over there--i forget what they're called.  15 year old girls prostituting themselves....they have this website where you like put your phone number on and men contact them...take them to karaoke bars where they get piss-drunk and "have a good time."  She said that the girls never admit to having sex w/ these men but I think it's assumed.  And the girls do this b/c they need extra money to buy designer stuff. Then she asked a japanese friend of hers if she knew anyone that did that and the girl said yeah.  And she seemed to think it was perfectly normal.  When asked why she didn't do it....the girl said that she really didn't need the money b/c she wasn't into expensive stuff.  Isn't that weird?!  Weird ol' Japs hehe.  And she said that the really old ppl and our generation japanese are perfectly cool to foreigners but the middle aged ppl dont' like foreigners and they just want them out.  I thought that was weird too--well mostly about the really old ppl cuz of the war and everything.  so i thought that was an interesting tidbit i'd share w/ y'all.  listening to: Beatles-Across the Universe

      I heard someone on the radio refer to Mr. Personality as "Who Wants to Date a Mexican Wrestler?"  I think that's a sweet title, considering those people in those masks look ridiculous.  Reality TV really, really needs to stop soon.  It's getting really lame with the ideas and all.  Whatever happened to the good old days with shows like Different Strokes, Punky Brewster, Saved by the Bell?  Man I miss good TV.  I also hate watching the NBA on ABC, they need to bring it back to NBC so at least they have a cool theme song in John Tesh's "Roundball Magic"  I mean what else gets you pumped up more wo watch basketball than Roundball Magic?

      hi people.  wow what's with dissing all the great flicks?  haha.  i'm the king of crappy movies, so if you want a list of what not to see i'll post them up for you, i'll probably do it anyways, sometime in the near future.    new wave, i'd like to thank you for my testimonial, haha it's great.  haha.  i almost completed my set too, i just need 2 more for the brightwood 8.  that automatically gives me 10 bonus points i think.  as far as this friday, yes i believe that darth and i should be on the same team, since we are always on the same team in football and softball, ever since we started playing sports together.  oh wait!  that's right, nobody lets us play on the same team.  so we have never been able to do so.  please let us do it, please, even the Herlihy Boy thinks we should be able to.  one more thing to add, darth you are a great football and softball player, i commend you.

      i'm glad 28 days later was a good movie...a REALLY crappy movie i saw this weekend was Charlie's Angels.  and  i'm not even a picky movie goer!!!  no joke, Crossroads was a better movie.  Charlie's Angels ranks right up there with Dude Where's My Car and Rollerball.

      forgot to mention about vacation spots yesterday ...  man the best vacation for me was china / hong kong. oh my goodness ... the richness of the culture, the people, the history, the food ... you don't get better than that. i'm telling you. i really enjoyed myself there even if it was hot and humid. ha ha. hopefully going back this oct. (fingers crossed). some other good places are cancun ... it is actually really nice there even if there is sun, sand and water and then canada .... i liked it there. some places i would love to go are london and spain. i should have gone to berlin to see the CURE ... darn it. :(   ha ha hewig we are so going to find all the old E2E people ... you know it :) yea another point i mean person to add to my list .....   yes t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y ... ha ha you get to work at best buy and get all the nice discounts. awesomeness. i want to go and visit you now. i saw 28 days later this weekend as well.  i enjoyed myself. it wasn't super great but def. more enjoyable than some of the crap out there in the movie houses. ha ha. it reminded me a lot of a video game ... like resident evil or something but better. recently i've been really into my hk action films. i just can't seem to get enough. i watched fulltime killer on friday and thought it was excellent. oh and def. if any of you rent ... go check out chungking express ... good stuff.   blasting on the stereo:  clipse - ma i don't love her

       ok, so here i am chacking in. let's see....vacation spots:  definitely SPAIN!!!  it is a must. oh yeah, i saw  28 days later  on friday, and i must say that i enjoyed it.  it was entertaining and interesting.  im not much of a movie critic, so i dont know what else to say, i just know i liked it. sorry i couldnt meet up with you guys new wave and hedwig, but i got back from my best buy job interview at 8 p.m.   and yes, yes, i will be working at best buy woodland hills  (dun! dun! DUN!)  i have my orientation tomorrow, and i will be quitting in 2 months to move up to san francisco for medical school :) well, i guess thats about it for now. ah yes, and happy belated mr. spank-that-ass.    hahaha listening to:  "is this desire?" by  urlLink pj harvey

      looking for a new job sucks so hard. (sigh) i decided today would be start of me actively looking for a new job. i might as well considering there is no growth or wage increase at my current one. the only thing is ....  looking for a new job brings back all the bad memories I had about looking for a job. (shiver) so sad ... so very very sad. all the rejection and waiting and applying and more rejection. i can honestly say i'm not sure i'm ready for all of that again.     blasting on the stereo:  nothing

      figured i'd blog since i haven't in a while.  ditto on the shopping in NY Skimmy...def. the place to shop!  I heard they hiked up sales tax over there so that's a bummer.  i went to highlands @ hollywood and highlands.....it was OK i guess.  the crowd was diverse...only thing that sucked was that they had a stupid fashion show until like almost 12 so it was boring.  Good thing we got in for free or i would have been pissed.  Drinks were good, music good, people alright i guess....overall it was a good night.  so new wave and i went to BJ's on Thursday and we were thinking about going to that 80's club y'all speak of.  Prolly in like a couple of weeks or something.....that would be cool!  Any takers?  Alrighty I'm out.    listening to: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING b/c my computer is all f***ed up!  f***ing F***!!

      hello hello. i think i like this new blog format... anyway, nick -- yes, travelling is a very worthwhile experience. i plan to do it more often in the future. very near future.  well, i think everyone should do the "europe thing" and of course after graduating college, it is so cliche because that is when most students go to "find themselves."  but anyway i thoroughly enjoyed paris and of course the UK. oh london, can you wait? (gene lyric.)  i would love to live there for a bit... and not the month i was there.  more like a year+. warning to all - to not visit the alhambra target past 9 p.m. i went to browse the aisles after work and in the parking lot a man is yelling at a woman in the car. she tries to drive away and he jumps in the back and grabs the child inside... who starts screaming and crying. a passerby interferes and tries to get the man away from the child/car. then target security comes out... once inside the store, a woman is screaming on her mobile to kick some person's ass. i think all the crazies come out late at night...

      New York!!! The shopping is REALLY great there, and there's tons of stuff to do.  Did I mention the shopping?  The food is a bit pricey, and it's best if you know someone in the city to stay with...but I loved my trip there.

      I know it’s been a while…I’ve been, um, busy.  Yeah, busy.  So I just came back from my trip to cancun.  For those of you who’ve never been there, I definitely suggest you go at least once.  The place rocks!!!!  Unless you don’t like clear water, powdery sand, kick-ass food, cool bars, and super super super nice people.  I will never forget this trip..it was so fun!  And thanks to Shirley for being a fun vacation buddy.  After coming back, I realized I don’t travel enough.  I hadn’t been on vacation in like 7 years prior to this trip (unless you count san diego, vegas, san fran, sac….which I don’t count as real vacations).  7 years!  Anyway, there’s a point to this….my question to everyone in the house is “what interesting places have you vacationed?”  (I’m asking so I have some good suggestions on where to go for my next vacation).  Alright people, I’m out!

           HAPPY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY IN THE HOUSE !!!!!!!!!        sorry guys i would have done this on june 25 but blogger was updating our format on the page. can you guys believe it has been a whole fucking year since we started this thing. ha ha. i thought for sure it would have died out in 6 months but those warning e-mails i sent out sure helped and oh me nagging you guys. HA HA. oh well .... time sure does fly. well with the new one year anniversary comes a new way to post your messages. not sure if i really like it ... seems a bit too user friendly but whatevers.   nothing much to say ... i should be getting some sleep. i really want to leave the country. just a thought that has been whirling around in my brain. work sucks ... but then again when doesn't it. ha ha.    blasting on the stereo:  letter to elise - THE CURE hee hee can't help but listen to them. actually i was bumping radiohead earlier but that cd finished.

      hi and welcome, skimmy zo.  yes usher, him getting dissed was interesting to say the least, hehe.  new wave, ummmm that's not cool, it really hurts, and i don't think girls really understand the type of pain it is.  i cannot even describe the excruciating pain that is felt when hit in the sweet spot.  as for darth, what warranted being hit there over 10 times?  man....  so i'm still sick from and also sick of vegas, i think it's a sign.  i just received a bunch of my cd's i ordered, my list includes, zero down, wunder years, dead lazlo's place, trust foundation, and get well soon.  i like pretty much all of them, with the exception of get well soon, they are pretty emo, and i don't really dig emo, but at least i can say they are better and more original than good charlotte.  i mean good charlotte knows what they are talking about right?  all girls want are money and cars?  and all guys want girls like that?  or some crappy lyrics of that sort.  sheesh.  go away please, please go away.

      this past weekend was pretty kool....but Vegas isn't as great anymore...i know i haven't gone there as much as darth,mac,or nkotb has, but for me this past weekend was just enough. Too bad i gotta go back at the end of july! Anyways...Darth getting hit in the nads was totally not kool but in a way funny to watch........ oh and the one incident in the elevator was also retarded of me but then again the trip was boring and i had to do something stupid so we can remember...and the 23 yr old joke...was by far the greatest ever..i also thought Jason hong getting dissed by them girls in the beamer was pretty funny huh mac? hahah anyways....hope everybody has a fun week! Oh...Jenn freakin saw USHER!!!!!!!!!!!! YES USHER RAYMOND at the airport and she got a pic with him and then Shirley told usher that i look like him..sweet shit i would like to say.

      i don't think you look 364 days over 23 darth.  haha.  ummm not too many stories from this past trip, other than it seemed kind of rushed.  it was still fun though, as i didn't lose as much as i usually anticipate i will, so score for me.  these are the only two tidbits that i remember to be quite funny within the trip.    #1.  i almost saw darth puke, because someone gave him a full fledged punch to the groin.  it seemed a tad painful.  at first i was laughing, but it quickly faded, as darth did not look like he was having to much fun, can't imagine why not.  but i wish that pain upon no one, especially not myself, also i do not care to ever see that happen to another man, again. #2.  usher: "it's okay because darth is white."  haha, that was my favorite moment.  thank you.  these are random tidbits/grains of knowledge about going to vegas in general:  #1.  although i was lucky enough to hitch a ride out there, and able to just sit in the car, i believe that flying out there is so worth it. #2.  getting a decent amount of sleep is key, in vegas, and in life! #3.  the mgm buffet is cute, and i like it. #4.  dealers with no personality suck and make the losing money experience that much worse. #5.  waiting in line for an absurd amount of time to get into something is definitely not worth it.  this goes for outside of vegas as well. #6.  never hit the atm. #7.  drink lots of water. #8.  when leaving by car, leave vegas at 8 a.m., if possible (no traffic) #9.  make sure you know where the restrooms are located within the casino. #10. have fun.  overall it was cool, it was one of my more laxed trips to vegas, and i know for sure that i will not be going for a while, or at least that is what i hope.  it feels as though it is losing all of its glitz and glamour to me.  maybe because i have been there 20+ times ever since turning 21.  but it's fun when you're there.

       Intro :  NOFX - Glass War   The weekend is upon us and I am headed out to Vegas for the celebration of Brad's birth.  So first off Happy 24th Birthday sir!  Usually I am excited to go to Vegas, but this time around I am kind of scared.  Why?  Well because the aftermath of the last trip was simply not very sexy for me, just cause I became very ill and broke after the trip.  It was still very good times within the duration of the trip, and I expect it to be the same again.  Others from the house are going as well, so i'm pretty sure there will be some stupid stories of happenings, on the site next week.  Well everyone have a good weekend, and wish Darth a fun and healthy weekend.   Outro :  Solea - Punky

      "And I might as well just grin and bear it  Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument" - badhead by blur   this is kinda of old but this song was stuck in my head for so long. why am i even up now. well actually i know why ... cause i'm a vampire. i'm pretty tired but i'm waiting for my hair to dry a bit cause i don't like to sleep with it wet and i hate using the blow dryer.   nothing much to say .... friendster is cracking me up with all its randomness. people are finding people they have not  spoken to in ages. ha ha. but in the end it is just a popularity contest to see how many darn friends you can add.   the week is ending. okay june went by pretty quickly. eh. another month. i need to find a new job man. i actually really need to work on my resume. okay i'm going to do that now ... i'll leave you with these lyrics:  "When you see me Please turn your back and walk away I don't want to see you  Cos i know the dreams that you keep is wearing me" - no distance left to run by blur    on the beat box:  nothing but just a side note i am still madly in love with the cure and was listening to their paris cd today :)

      ahh yes, so i see that new wave and sluts like you has commented on the blur show so now i must do the same. i normally don't get too enthusiastic at shows - i think i might have learned the "I'm not impressed" stance from new wave; but last night at blur i had a really good time. they were really good live, and damon just can't get any hotter. man, if we got any closer to the stage i might have jumped his bones. haha jk. but we were pretty close, and it wasn't too crowded which was great. (and it was cool to hang out w/ sluts like you - whom i think i only met for like two seconds in college.) and now i know what the heck FTC stands for! ahahaha! the secrets of the universe are mine!   and yeah, like new wave said, some other girl was wearing the same exact shirt i was (white with little red apples all over). were were only a couple people apart in line, and of course we ended up standing rightnext to each other at the show. but good thing she put on her sweater. hehe.   another thing. americans do suck. or at least non-cultured ignorant people do. when in rome right?.......it's rude to disrepect the country you are in. those damn real worlders just need to appreciate the beauty and culture of paris.

       yes, yes, must love the "WOOO-HOO" song so yeah, last nite i went to the BLUR show with ftc and dorkus (who was a cool person, i had never kicked it with her before), and the show was amazing.  i had never seen blur before, and i didnt know what to expect.  some elastica friend of mine said they suck live, but i disagree with him.  they played an amazing set, some cool old songs ("to the end" - with damon fixing his suit and collar, did u like that ftc?, and "trimm trabb" was awesome!)  and some wonderful new songs ("ambulance" gave me chills), have new wave or i told u that THINK TANK is awesome yet????  oh yes, and the black backup singers (i mean, "the people") were cool, brought some grooviness to the show, hehe. we were on the floor, dorkus was on the rail and ftc and i right behind her (props to her for not being tall, cheers!).  and it wasnt crowded at all, which made the show much more enjoyable. so yeah, all in all, an exceptional night, i do hope they come back in the future.  man, i should have taken a camera oh yes, and about americans in france:  theres a reason europeans have the idea they have about americans, its not all totally myth.  oh well, as long as the US is on its own continent, it will be like that. (yes, i know theres canada and mexico, but does canada have any culture?, theyre pretty much american, eh?  and mexico is only good for beer and partying [in the eyes of americans]) background music:  "out of time" - blur (AMAZING live!)

       disclaimer:  this is me ranting about blur ... the band who did the whole "whooo hooo" song called song 2 ... (hear a bunch of ohhhh's going around in the house):  dang ..... where do i even start ....... BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR BLUR .... is that enough blur for everyone. hee hee. okay okay but seriously awesome, wonderful, great show. it is late so i don't want to get into too many details but can i say ... damon is hot and as charming as heck but he broke justine's heart so he is a bastard. will forever love no distance left to run. pretty much the same set list as the las vegas show with the exception of  ... (drumroll) TO THE END :) . loved it. freaking great. and can i also say my company was just as wonderful as well. dorkus melorkus was heck of cool even if some girl did wear the same shirt as her :( ... and my FTC HOMIE was there to jam with me ......... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEA. ha ha. but overall a great show. damon was all of seriously i think 5 ft from us. (sigh)  on a side note .... RADIOHEAD IS COMING. hee hee. just found out they are touring in L.A. sept 25 and 26 (i know i know darth bronger you were right ... blah blah blah) so if anyone wants to go with me .... let me know alright.   on my mind:  BLUR LIVE :)  i need some freaking sleep ........... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      warning: a ramble on the real world. okay. so the new real world is set in paris. and my initial thought was, 'a bunch of self absorbed, whiny, idiotic twentysomethings got to live in paris, france for however long real world lasts and i bet they did not even appreciate it.' so i turn on the telly today and a repeat episode is on... and a guy named ace (from georgia) says flat out, 'i hate france. i hate parisians. i hate their food. i hate their small cars. i miss SUVs. i miss walmart. i miss waffles.' omigosh. he IS the american europeans think of when they think of america and americans. wow. i was blown away by his hate. and one of their roommates is french (i think) and was v. critical of how the others did not bother to learn the language. they sit at a restaurant and ace orders an american type dish but orders it all in english. not even trying to say 'fritte' or something. BUT in the end he admits that he is being ignorant and only been in paris for a week. and he walks around the city and falls in love with its beauty. and makes a commitment to keep an open mind. ahh, a happier ending. paris is seriously a beautiful city. i loved it. and i was there for less than a week. anyway, that was my ramble on that lame mtv series. hah hah.

      BLUR IS COMING ... BLUR IS COMING .... finally after much pain and agony waiting and waiting to see if blur was going to play the wiltern .... FTC and i found out BLUR IS PLAYING :) .... so happy ... doing the happy dance. think tank is a great album and seeing them perform that live is going to be GREAT. i know i saw them at coachella but they had to share that stage and that sucks ... better to have them all to ourselves in one show. man i'm so fricking pumped excited.  sheesh i haven't blogged in a long while. and by long while i mean 8 days which is forever for me huh ftc. i guess mainly because work has been killing me. no joke ... ha ha. i'm so freaking tired when i come home all i want to do is sleep. i think i'm on auto pilot most of the day and night.  if you guys haven't checked the actually website page ... urlLink  742 Evergreen Terrace   ... there is a chat box on the left hand side where you guys can post little messages. i thought it would be kinda of neat and if people visit our site they can leave us messages. i guess it would be like a message board like the ones we use to have in the dorms. ha ha.   this is an old topic but spending money frivolously should only be done in caution. i'm just saying after you have taken care of everything that needs to be taken care of and after you put aside some money for saving then blow the rest. but this is coming from me the cheapest person alive ... ha ha.  and hedwig ... glad you had fun in vegas .. that place is great :) .... and E2E forever man. that was such a fun year then ... seriously ... good times had by all. we had fun as roommates .... :)   on the beat box:  brothers and sisters - blur .... second time listening to think tank .... SO GOOD :)

       Intro:   Me First and the Gimme Gimmes - End of the Road   The song I am listening to is a punk cover of the Boyz II Men "End of the Road."  It's really good and really funny, so anyone that has any slight interest in the song you can go to the  urlLink Fat Wreck Chords  website, download it for free and check it out.  Just click the link provided there.  I've actually been on a Fat Wreck kick lately, and have been listening to all of the bands on the label, most of the bands are pretty good, beats listening to the pop-punk stuff out there for sure.    Another band that I have been listening to is the  urlLink Minibosses .  I was introduced to this band through a friend, cause I don't want to take the credit for it just in case you don't like it, hehe.  They are a Nintendo cover band, they play theme songs from the original Nintendo games, such as, Contra, Rygar, Mike Tyson's Punch Out, Castlevania, Wizards and Warriors, Ghosts N' Goblins, etc.  Again free downloads are available at the site, actually all of their songs are available there.  I know they are a novelty act, but it's fun to listen to the way they arranged and rock out to the tune of those songs.   Worth checking out if you were a Nintendo fan, back in the days, i was a kid, i'm not a kid anymore, but some days I wish I was a kid again.  Those lyrics ring so true to my ears.  Actually I wouldn't really care to be a kid again, but it was fun back then, cause I didn't have to deal with any issues really.  Well at this point I really can't complain on my behalf, there's no trouble a brewin' so i'm pleased with that and for sure I will not be making myself any unnecessary drama.  Vegas in 8 Days, I am scared, no repeat performance will be staged by me like the last time I went, Darth this time you can take over the duties, since it's your birthday and all.  I think we should go hit up Lloyd for some free bowling though, what do you think?  I'll bring the parking lady as insurance.  Haha.   Outro:   Rufio - Decency

       INTRO :  Less Than Jake - Sugar In Your Gas Tank   Pigern sounds like you had a grand ole time at the sale.  L.A. people rock!  Actually it's funny that you mentioned that, because i've been listening to this song by NOFX on repeat for the past few weeks.  The lyrics of the song pretty much sums up the good people and city of Hollywood, and it's funny as well.   NOFX -  San Francisco Fat    hollywood is a breeding ground for assholes ego's get as big as billy corgan's  skinny girl eat some more food  muscle man you look like a fuckin freak  hollywood is a nice place for the weekend not a place for a nice person to live movie star no one likes you  how'd you learn to be so fuckin mean  take me home sweet west bay big women stinkey's peep show this thursday glamour pussy and some new york band. lets go los angeles uber alles or at least that's what they like to believe  take me home sweet west bay big women stinkey's peep show this thursday bobzilla flattens out dick tokyo. lets go!  For the people that don't like the "scene" what do you think about the lyrics?  I think the lyrics are pretty much kick ass.   Outro:   Millencolin - Penguins and Polar Bears

      okay, about the whole spending money on frivolous items topic. i think it's okay, but as long as it's not too out of hand. i make big purchases on items i know i don't need, but if it makes me feel good at the time, i get it. Retail therapy works wonders. but i think about it before i buy it: do i  really  need this? how about saving your money up for a big trip? or for tickets to a band you're dying to see?..i don't know..  on another note: i'm sorta bummed about the fifth HP book release. I'll be out of town when it comes out, and I won't be able to pick it up until July 1st! Boo! perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. maybe i'll be able to reread HP 3 and 4 before then so i can reacquaint myself. wishful thinking never hurt anybody, or did it?

      hiya. just got back from my first ever dodger game. it was alright. i don't think i'll spend another twenty to go again though. i was half paying attention/half reading but baseball IS slow so why not multi-task... the dodger dog was okay. not too yummy. i have a bit of a tummy ache actually. hm, i think the highlight was the random fight in the parking lot. that was entertaining. hah hah. as for the spending money on frivolous items discussion... i do it all the time. not a good thing but i don't think it's completely a bad thing either. because it gives me some enjoyment albeit temporarily. and sometimes money doesn't do any good just sitting around collecting dust. i went to a wherehouse sale today. it was so l.a. new wave, you missed out. not only were trucker hats majorly discounted, you could overhear conversations of people talking about their PR person, agent, or latest audition. go l.a.!

      stupid blogger...i just wrote this blog and it got deleted, i'll try again....  let me start off my saying that i agree with mac, that hedwig's analogy was the best and really broke down the discussion to its basic terms so that everyone could understand it.   next item: mac i don't think you should buy frivolous things like toys, Think about it you are 24 now, here's an example:, lets say you buy ummm i don't know action figures, and you keep buying them and it becomes like an addiction and you have to find that certain one....and oh wait....hmm let me rethink this, yes its okay to buy those kinda things everyonce in a while, it gives you something to do and it makes you happy, we all do it in some way, whether it be toys, cds, video games, etc we all buy things that we probably don't need, but we happen to want.   E2E my home away from home for a year......the porno pooh pics were the best, who eventually won the song game by the way? i can't believe you kept those papers....haha....i also you remember hearing this line a lot "I don't think i'm gonna go to poli sci, i think i'll go back to sleep" hahaha......keep hoping for that 5 dollar bill it will come to you....and if you stomach is still hurting i can walk back to my dorm to get that sandwhich still, unless my roommate ate it, man he was annoying.  Just moved into my new office, its much bigger, and i'm sure i'll make it look messy in a few days, just like my room at home which is getting so bad that it scares even me...haha....okay have a nice weekend all

      Hedwig that is the best analogy I have ever heard.  Haha.  Kudos to you.  Darth I agree that thinking too much about one subject for long periods of time is a downer.  You sometimes just become all wrapped up in a single thought and it just bugs you for some time until it is out of your system.  To answer your question though, yes I have had situations like you have mentioned and simply put it sucks.  It sucks because you are not supposed to know.  It sucks because you are not supposed to say anything.  Honestly though, if you overheard it, it's a done deal.  If it wasn't meant to be overheard somehow, then the persons responsible for keeping it hush, hush, are the ones that should deal with the consequences, not you.  So why not just relieve yourself of the anguish and do whatever is necessary to help you find your happy place.  Like Happy Gilmore, when he would see his grandma, Tubbs, and the midget.  I have a question myself to ask.  Do you think it's okay to every once in a while just spend your money on frivolous things, you know like things you really don't need, but you want, just so you can have it?  I guess a good example of frivolous would be like, my abundant collection of random toys and other collectibles.  Just curious as to see what you all think.  I'm just asking because i'm looking to purchase some items, that are quite pricey, but unnecessary, and it wouldn't really hurt me if I did not have them.

      Yes, I think girls basically want a nice guy who can be aggressive and will stand up for himself. (This has nothing to do with my benefit. I don't need a guy to defend my honor. I was just using that example for sake of argument.) I don't want an asshole cocky obnoxious boyfriend who has complete disregard for other's opinions and feelings. Does that make sense?   I'm more or less referring to one of the lame guys that New Wave mentioned in her blog. It's good to be opinionated and have a mind of your own, but I still think you should respect other's opinions at the same time. You shouldn't try and make people feel all stupid if they watch 24. OR you shouldn't make people feel like they have bad taste in music for liking Beulah (* ahem New Wave). Not like I rag on the Cure all the time or anything!

      i get what dorkus is saying...you want someone who is genuinely nice...deep down a good guy....but when the time calls, you want him to have the ability to be aggressive.  you don't want some completely passive guy.  i had it articulately put in my mind when i started this blog but my mind got sidetracked by...well nothing.  i had a brainfart.  :P  it's kind of like for guys....you don't want to marry a whore...you want to marry a nice respectable girl who is a good wife, etc etc.....but behind closed doors you want your wife to be a whore.  haha.  you get it now?? :D  I'M HOME!  listening to: john mayer-covered in the rain(live)

      dorkus i'm a little confused, your statement in a way seems to contradict itself, i guess I can understand what you are saying but at the same time, your second paragraph seems to retract from what you had said in the first. So you don't want so you don't want a cocky, obnoxious person unless it can benefit you in some way? so what would make that different from if they were like that all the time? Do you just not want them to act that way to you, but then still be able to show off how manly they are too everyone else out there? just curious....moving on....have you ever had something on your mind that bugs you a lot, but at the same time you probably aren't supposed to know, like you overheard something? Man I hate that, cause you aren't sure, but at the same time you can't ask anyone, cause you are supposed to be in the dark on the issue. So annoying, it makes your mind think, and thinking is never good, hence I try to prevent it with major doses of alcohol........with ty the other one and your old asian lady parking attendant mac....haha....i think they all miss you.

      Bravo! I am glad someone has called attention to this mind boggling phenomenon. Why are girls interested in such assholes? I honestly don't get it. Maybe it comes from low self-esteem. I would never for a minute even consider someone who is so self righteous, so cocky, and so obnoxious like that. New Wave, you're right. We ARE better than that. We don't need super jerk boyfriends who belittle our thoughts and opinions.  However, I will say this, I think that most girls (including me) are interested in guys with Asshole Potential. That is, girls are interested in guys who could have the potential to be an asshole  when needed  (let's just say he's defending your honor or something); who wants to date a Too Nice Guy with No Balls? I don't. Nice guys are great, but there is a thing as being too nice.

      thought of the day: alpha males suck. what is an alpha male you ask. any guy who thinks they are the shit, in a frat, obnoxious, rude, thinks they are so funny when they are not and the list goes on. basically an asshole 24 hours 7 days a week. wait but how is this different from any normal male you ask ... well honestly i guess there is no real difference ha ha ... no no there are differences but i'm too lazy to get into them now. and why am i bringing this up ... two reasons mainly 1. i found out my friend is semi/casually dating this guy who i found so obnoixous and rude i wanted to kick him in the face so bad. he would ask what shows or music i like and then completely mock and laugh at all my answers 2. there is this guy who all the girls seems to find SO FU**ING FUNNY when it is quite clear he is not but yet he is the funniest and most smart mouth guy they know ... i guess to them he is a laugh riot.   what really gets under me is how these girls are attracted to males like this. the sad part is it is so common ... this attraction to guys who are total assholes. i'm seriously mind blogged by that. so i say to any girls who are ... YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT AND YOU DESERVE SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MORE SUPERIOR.   on the beat box:  92.3 fm whatever is on the radio

      this past weekend was sweet.  first off, I didn't have to drive up to L.A. cause darth came down.  we drank quite a bit down at the gaslamp and since i was buzzed, just a tad, when we left to go watch the matrix, we started walking off in the wrong direction.  haha.  fortunately, darth figured it out.  so we bumped into hare krishnas instead.  the following day we went to go eat at Seau's, where we tried Mama Seau's Special Teriyaki Sauce, you would think Mama Seau would be his mom's teriyaki sauce, but nope, it's one of Brad's friends aunt's special blend that he uses.  you can't fool me Junior Seau!    after this went to the Padres game, where some old asian parking lady laughed at me.  as i was approaching her to purchase a parking permit, i asked if the game was sold out, and she smirked and laughed at me.  it's an honest question!  right?  haha.  then we actually reached the stadium and game.  we bought the cheap seats, but were upgraded by the Pad Squad about 25 rows from first base, i guess that was kind of cool since the game was high scoring and entertaining, also helped that these two people we were sitting next to, julie and her platonic guy friend,  were making fun of each other the entire time and arguing about random things, but they were cool.  darth and i even taught her to eat sunflower seeds, which was interesting all in itself.  back to the Pad Squad, it is pronounced Pahd Squad, not the way it is spelled, just to let you people know, k?  so good times were had.  and i think i gained about 10 pounds too.  oh and darth last i heard ty, the other one, are hanging out with the asian parking lady.

      Hello House. I had a pretty cool weekend that started off pretty crappy, the reason, I went back to UCR. Good grief was it hot and disgusting out there, and the smog covered the mountain so you couldn't even see the big yello C. I decided to go to pick up my diploma. NKOTB motivated me by getting his a while ago, after only 1 year, whereas i waited 2 years. Everything looked green and weird. the school is still a commuter school since i went at like 2 in the afternoon, and the school seemed like it was desserted. Anyway got my diploma and headed to S.D to visit mac. Thanks for the lodging mac, good times were had. Watched the matrix, (well most of it, fell asleep at one part, i'm sure drinking half a pitcher of beer had nothing to do with that) padre game and 25th hour. the padre game was one of the better baseball games i'd seen, plus the pad squad upgraded our seats to field level. San Diego was cool, good food, good people, fun times, and mac where is ty and the other one?

      Okay so here is the answer to the crazy lady's letter. She was trying to inform me that the United States Government has passed a law stating that they are going to build her a house that is the exact dimensions given to her when she followed her horoscope. The house is to be finished by the time and date given to her once again by her horoscope.   So there you have it folks, all of you who had guessed that give yourself a pat on the back for being able to read the secret language of crazy talk...haha  Oh i'm really mad at the Dodgers right now with their stupid ass trade for robin ventura.....he's our savior? wtf?

      Hello, hi, hot mike, hot mike......okay.  Hi everyone I would like to report the comeback of Mr. Sly Stallone.  As you all know he is currently in the blockbuster hit film Spy Kids 3-D, and it grossed the most money this past weekend.  To top off this great feat, he is currently working on a couple projects.  The first one as well all know is the 6th installment of the Rocky series, I forget the exact title of it, but I bet the plot has to deal with him being down on his luck, and coming out of the cellar and triumphing overall, all alongside with an awesome musical score.  I for one cannot wait til this flick comes out.   Now on to his other project.  I don't know how many of you have read the book LAbyrinth, I know Darth has, but Sly's next project is about the Rampart Scandal's regarding the deaths of Tupac and Biggie, and the role that Suge and Death Row played in it.  Sly is directing it, and is playing the part of Detective Russell Poole.  I do not know when it will be released, or when it is slated to start production, but I for sure want to watch it when it comes out.  I think the title is Thugz "something or rather."  That is my Sly report.  Thank you and good day.

      okay first off pigern ... i know lizzie is lame but i watched it for miranda and gordo (come on dorkus melorkus back me up on the gordo part yea) ... they were the real winners. lizzie was just some dumb blonde friend of theirs who the show happened to be named after.  as for the following your dreams bit ... DUH !!!! and what has this taught us ... like homer says never try cause you will just fail.  man i'm tired. why am i still awake. who knows. just to let some people in the house know that 80's night on friday was fun fun fun. too bad some of you guys missed out (looking your way mac and skimmy). i hope you guys come out next time we go. i watched Nicholas Nickleby this past weekend. it is a pretty good movie and the guy that plays nicholas is pretty hot. charlie h. or something. he was in that abandon movie with katie homles. funny thing is he was only good looking in the nicholas movie cause in the other stuff he is just avg. and dull. but the movie itself was quite enjoyable.   i have tori amos this friday which i'm kinda of pumped about. she is amazing live. the only bummer part is that we have ass seats ... (sigh) so she will be nothing more than a dot to us. oh well. okay i know all of you must tire of this but when is the cure touring cause when they do. i seriously think i will pay like a million dollars to see them. i have to have pit tickets for every night they play. speaking of that so pit tickets for radiohead is going for over 1000 dollars which is insane .. insane i tell you. the tickets that i got for friday nights show .. which is not even that good but i mean decent are going for at least 400 to 500 dollars. i would be making 4 to 5 times my profit back. sadly i think i could make even more as the date draws nearer ... but why would i. i like radiohead even though i harbor a bit of bitterness towards them ... ha ha long story.   thought in brain:  me need to sleep

      oh new wave. funny about the craig's list posting. this guy is creepy. but my friend and i would like to mess with him like in 'ghost world.' hee hee. anyway, so new wave was watching 'lizzie mcguire' (sorry, new wave but people should know so you can get the proper help) and the disney channel was spouting this message about "working hard because then your dreams can come true." and i was thinking about this because i had just read an article about hollywood. there are 45,000 or so screenplays registered to the screen writers guild yet 500 films are made a year. and that's just how many are made. just think how many are profitable! so we tell our kids to follow their dreams and they will come true but there are many who want to make it big as an actor or a screenwriter and never will. not that i'm saying we should tell kids, look you probably won't make it in this industry unless you have real talent. but i guess my end conclusion is that you should not watch 'lizzie mcguire' because it's all bollocks.

      for enjoyment ... this was posted on craig's list LA about radiohead shows, please note the bolded parts:  i bought two tickets for radiohead and am really hoping to find a nice girl to go with.  i really prefer asian girls  but would be open to anything if you were  really cute, and thin  please. i'm 27 and really love music, will probably go a bit crazy at the concert.i hope to find someone to be romantic with after the show so no girls with boyfriends/ husbands. gotta send me a pic, if you don't, sorry.    blasting on the stereo:  monaco - blue ... good stuff man :) side project of new order with peter hook

      Currently watching: the talented mr. Ripley….this movie rocks  Hey party people I have been out of the loop for a while, but back from Hawaii now...and here is my trip report, it will be long so brace yourself:  Got to the hotel we were booked for, and the hotel had overbooked itself by like 300 people!!! great start I know, anyway they were able to make arrangements for us at another hotel down the street, which we found wasn't as nice (two of the girls on the trip are lawyers and already in the process of writing letters and such in hopes of getting a refund or free rooms in the future) anyway after that fiasco met up with all our sister church members from Japan. Even though we didn't speak much Japanese and they spoke very little English we still found ways to communicate and had a great time just hanging out with them. I was put in a room with a 15year old Japanese kid, which at first i was very disappointed with as it was not who I thought I’d be staying with. As it turned out we were able to get along great and had a lot of the same interests, for example sleeping through any alarm clock even the one that was supposed to wake us up for morning devotions...haha.... Second day we headed out to the Polynesian center for a day of culture of the islands and a luau. Saturday was a free day, first I went to the huge swap meet to get knick knacks and random gifts for people.....hung out with this one kid who goes to my church and I’ve known for years but never spoke too, but found that he is really sarcastically funny. That night we had our big dinner and gift exchanges with the two churches. It was a great time. I think the best time was when the youths from the two churches got together to hang out. A big group of us played drinking games together on Monday night. I taught them pyramid (thanks  t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y. !!!!!) and then we played the hand signs game where you have to watch ones hands signals and if they call yours you have to do someone else’s and if you mess up you have to drink…its highly entertaining with big groups.   Other random things I did: Went to Pearl Harbor…yes I know its very touristy but its one of those things that I had to do and was very emotional for me. My grandmother had told my family not to come home without going there and thus it was number one on our priority list of things to do. Went to the beach four times, so I kinda have a tan, but being white its not a real tan. Rented the mighty geo tracker and toured the island on our own. Played a round of golf with my friend, at first i wasn't looking forward to it, cause it was a little pricey but i gotta say it was one of the best things i did, it was so nice out, i got to use expensive clubs and shot one of my better games!! golf is fun again everyone should go (nick edney looking your way)  Every night most young adults would get together for laughs and fun times staring at the female entrepreneurs and trying to guess which one would get a date first….it was highly entertaining. I even got a line from one of them when I was walking back to the hotel. One of the kids wanted to get their picture taken with one of them, so I took him out and when he asked one of the girls she responded with this ain’t Disneyland kid… haha…I nearly fell over laughing…  Sorry this is still long, if you have any other questions to ask me feel free or I can just tell you next time I see you. In closing Hawaii was super duper fun, great weather, great food, great people, I would love to go again. I also want to go to Japan because everyone from Japan kept telling me that my turn to go is next (every other year our church sends someone to japan to visit their church)   Oh yeah and I even got to see my boyhood hero Hulk Hogan, that makes the trip pretty much perfect….haha

      well, i was planning to blog on the kobe issue but everything i thought of saying was pretty much summed up by mac.  thanks for stealing my idea mac.  hah hah.  just kidding.  but yes.  celebrities/public figures are considered god-like. today i went with my coworker to wahoo's and heineken's are the beer of the month ($1.25) so my friend and i were like "hey, let's get a beer."  we actually had an out of the office (!) lunch for over an hour.  and then i was red and buzzed and it was bad.  hah hah.  but i'll do it again!

      i would like to be the first to say, who gives a rats ass about kobe.  this is only magnified because he is a celebrity, and to make matters worse, he plays for the hollywood lakers.  i hate that the media drills into the mind of people that all celebs are better than normal people so they are put on pedestals and others are supposed to be in awe in their presence.  all i hear is kobe this, kobe that.  big freaking deal, if it was an average joe, not even .000000001% of the population would know or care about it.  truth is it happens.  anyways, as far as him being a kind, caring, human being.  nobody knows that.  only the people he surrounds himself with.  whatever image he portrays from the media may or may not be his real persona.  if he is guilty of the crime though, i hope he gets a deserving punishment and not some gay ass slap on the wrist

       ha ha so true about celebrities and sports players being more important than the president FTC. i mean who gives a rat's ass about the leader of the free world ... after all the leader in dunks, assists, defense and blah blah is in trouble ... OH NO (hands over mouth in shock). but have no fear i'm sure the lakers will come out on top .... cause they are the lakers - the greatest team ever  (rolling my eyes) ... is it just me or has basketball lost all its competivness. (disclaimer: i know nothing about sports and i'm actually just talking out of my ass and giving my personal opinion.)  excellent news about elastica my friend ... sure they are gone but at least you are getting bits of news and interesting stuff and isn't justine doing a nice side project right now???   are you ready FTC to shake your ass to 80's groove :) side note FTC i found meng on friendster ... actually he found me ... your old roomie.  so i got radiohead tixs for both nights at the hollywood bowl. sheesh they were hard to come by ... thank goodness for presale. my tix for friday are quite excellent but i have to fly solo for thurs. night show. i'm actually pretty cool about going by myself once the show starts but the whole going there myself and waiting until the show starts ... let's just say it would be nice to have someone there to talk to is all. well at least i can say i saw radiohead three times, they are only my no. 2 band though following the great and almighty  CURE . IF THIS WAS   THE CURE   I WOULD GO ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THEM ... I MISS THEM SO MUCH ... THEY MIGHT TOUR IN 2004 (fingers crossed) oh please please please.

       hey all.  seems like im getting used to working at best buy, its a'ight.  i know i will like it better when i get my first REAL check.  :) ok, so it was inevitable that this whole kobe thing would happen like this.  considering how much coverage the clinton thing got, and we all KNOW how much more important celebrities and sports players are than the president. ok, so im pretty happy cos on the  urlLink elastica site  they posted a studio version of "operate" (which was previously only available on the 6 track ep, but in a live/demo version) and an alternate version of "da da da".  better yet, the tracks were contributed by the guitarist that replaced donna matthews, paul jones.  they are excellent songs, of course, as is expected from elastica :-D  and they have all the elastica fans yearning for more, although we all sadly know that there is nothing coming from them anymore :'(  oh yeah, ONE MORE WEEK!     80's!!!!   FOR THE CHEESE!    music to my ears:  "operate (studio version)" by the exceptional ELASTICA!

      nope skimmy zo i think it just means kobe is human. humans make mistakes and bad choices in their lives. sometimes we want to pretend or think certain celebs or athleles are above all that but they're not.   i actually find it more funny that so many people want to believe kobe is incapable of doing what he did. i don't think he raped the girl but at the same time i don't think he is as innocent as he tries to come off. i bet if it was anyone else and not kobe people would be so quick to tear them down and try to destrory their career or name but not in kobe's case ... people seem to adore him.   eh who knows in the end it could be just a publicity stunt to sell more laker tickets ... as sick as that sounds i would not be surprised.   blasting on the stereo:  *nothing*

      so kobe's charged with sexual assault.  i still think it was consentual, but the fact that he cheated on his wife is very disappointing.  i lost a lot of respect for him.  i really thought he was one of the most "upstanding" guys in the league.  even zo cheated on his wife before. . .so does every guy cheat?  or is it just athletes....

      haha, skimmy, you just described all the banana republicanasians out there.  that's funny.    hedwig, hmm i haven't been to that many places in the gaslamp, but if you like americanized mexican food, that place Jeff's on the southern end of F street is pretty good.  it is a bar/restaurant.  not too pricey either.  ummm if you want to drink some beer and a nice place to hang out, the place under the main mall at the south end of it is also good, called Hennesy's, dunno about the food though, cause i'm usually just snacking on fries and junk there.  there is also a sushi place that's pretty good, i forget the name of it, but it's on that one street that leads into the main parking entrance to the mall.  it's not the one directly across from it, but after you walk passed that one, there is this small little one on the right hand side, walking away from the mall.  it's pretty good eats, and the people are friendly.  one suggestion is to stay away from the pizza place, that's like CPK, right under the mall, the food is not good at all.  i felt jipped when i ate there.  if i find any other decent eats, i'll post em up.  oh yeah and darth would attest with me that Hooter's has some good burgers, as they are "more than a mouthful,"  hehe.  dude new wave thanks for the report.  i'm all over that.  haha, no prostate cancer for me!  pigern i know a good stylist, he lives in alhambra i think, his name is old man vinh, so if you need one go check him out.  nkotb and usher go to him, haha.  darth you a bitch.  have a fun and safe trip, and don't forget my stuff, and stay away from any black baraccuda's at hanauma bay, cause for some reason they aren't fun, not that one bit me and made me bleed or anything.

      today i went to happy hour with some coworkers. it was at a place on third and crescent heights (not the third in santa monica where the horrid incident occurred) called "el carmen." it's really original... mexican wrestlers decorate the walls and it's super dark inside. sort of a hole in the wall. anyway, the drinks were rather poor and pricey (11 bucks for my margarita) but i guess patrons pay for the atmosphere. random side note: work should require happy hours for coworkers to relax, socialize and complain about the day. hah hah. i wish... oh another l.a. trend i learned today -- stylists. so i'm sitting with a coworker and her friend and the friend tells her that his trainer and his stylist are almost like his best friends. "you have to get a stylist." and i'm like, omigosh, i need to get a stylist! okay. not really. but i thought it was kind of funny.

      CALLING ALL GUYS ... START PLAYING WITH YOUR DING A LING :)   Masturbating Lowers Prostate Cancer Risk -Study   LONDON (Reuters) - Frequent masturbation, particularly in the 20s, helps prevent prostate cancer (news - web sites) later in life, according to new research.  Australian scientists have shown that the more men masturbate between the ages of 20 and 50, the less likely they are to develop the disease that kills more than half a million men each year.  They suspect that frequent ejaculation has a protective effect against the cancer because it prevents dangerous carcinogens from building up in the gland.  "The more you flush the ducts out, the less there is to hang around and damage the cells that line them," Graham Giles, of the Cancer Council Victoria in Melbourne, told New Scientist magazine on Wednesday.  In a survey of 1,079 prostate cancer patients and 1,259 healthy men, Giles and his team discovered that men who ejaculated more than five times a week in their 20s were a third less likely to develop an aggressive form of the disease.  The findings contradict previous studies which suggested that having a variety of partners or frequent sexual activity could increase the risk of prostate cancer by 40 percent.  But Giles said the earlier research concentrated on intercourse, whereas his study focused on masturbation. Infections caused by sexual activity could account for the different findings.  "Men have many ways of using their prostate which don't involve women or other men," he added.

      skimmy the answer to your desire is just make any asian guy your best friend ... they are almost all females anyways. i mean sheesh i know some asian guys who dress better than i, smell better and look better ... but then again everyone really does dress, smell and look better than i do ... HA HA.  but in all seriousness ... make any asian guy your best friend and you are almost set. most are mama boys anyways so the female will have control and most of them care about their girly errr i mean guy-ish looks to maintain them so there you go.

      Man, the studies that are conducted these days are pretty lame-o. For instance, a bunch of scientists came up with the 2 second gay test (well, it's not really called this): (Females) Look at your hand (palm side). If your ring finger is significantly longer than your index finger (as is typically the case for men), this means you are raging lesbian. Their results showed that lesbians generally had longer ring fingers than index fingers.  Yeah right.

       ok, i dont think there is anyone who i would go see in a movie just 'cos theyre in it.  ok, i watched both mariah flicks just 'cos she was in it.  also maybe janet.  but i didnt see them all in theatres, so those dont count.  but there are times when i want to watch a movie just 'cos someone is in it, but i end up not watching them 'cos i dont frequent the movies as much as i would like.  these people include nicole kidman, julianne moore, christina ricci, ewan mcgregor, and i cant think of anyone else right now.  oh yeah, and if it comes from spain, hehe :)  oh yes, and by the way, since i live one block from ritchie valens recreation center, its my obligation to let u know that the line is "PARA BAILAR la bamba" sound waves in me ear: "the reflex" by duran duran

      this is my list of actors:  1)Edward Norton:  he kicks ass in any movie he is in, seriously, anyone see American History X, 25th Hour, etc? 2)Arnold Schwarzenneger:  he's not a great actor, but his movies are sure entertaining, especially Hercules in New York. 3)Adam Sandler:  he's a funny man.  also if you have him in a movie you get steve buscemi. 4)Keanu Reeves:  he's just so bad i have to watch it.  it's like a bad train wreck you just keep staring.  anybody see Hardball and Sweet November, it's so awful it's good! 5)Kevin Spacey:  he's a great actor and most his movies are top notch, Usual Suspects and The Negotiator is my favorite though, K-Pax, not so much.  honorable mentions:  anyone from Young Guns: 1)Emilio Estevez:  seriously i've seen all his movies, Mighty Ducks, Young Guns, Men at Work, etc... 2)Lou Diamond Phillips:  hello!!! how can you not love richie valens.  fa ra la la La Bamba! 3)Kiefer Sutherland:  Young Guns, The Lost Boys, Stand By Me, The Three Musketeers, yep he's awesome.  and finally... 1)Shaquille O' Neal:  Blue Chips, Kazaam and Steel, need I say more?  actresses: 1)Winona Ryder:  i have a fascination with her, i think she's really cool, and she's hot.  hey new wave don't knock Mr. Deeds!  but Heathers, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands are cool too. 2)Drew Barrymore:  she's spunky and cute.  she also has fun roles.  well i watch most of her movies, i had to stay away from Home Fries, even though NKOTB really wanted to watch it, just cause it had a cool name, or so he thought.  but then again he likes Michael Keaton and Steve Guttenburg.  haha, jk, well about Guttenburg. 3)Cameron Diaz:  i think she has entertaining roles and entertaining movies, and what are movies for?  entertainment.  i must say that she was pretty damn hot in Being John Malkovich.  haha. 4)Sigourney Weaver:  any lady that can kick ass is cool, so she tops the list cause of the Aliens movies, and she was in Galaxy Quest, didn't so much care for Gorilla's in the Mist. 5)Krista Allen:  small roles in movies, but, oh so pretty, want to touch the heiny, damn she's fine!  honorable mentions:  these people scare me 1)Cher:  don't like any of her movies that i've seen, and MASK is depressing, no more Rocky Dennis 2)Bette Midler:  same as Cher 3)Kathleen Turner:  that's not a woman, she's a man baby.  and finally: Jenna Jameson:  haven't seen all her movies, I think she has over 100 under her belt, but I hear that she can "blow" Keanu Reeves away in the acting department.  haha.

      why am i awake ... oh well. ha ha. so i had this really great conversation with a friend today and we both came to some cool conclusions. too long to go in the nature of the whole conversation but it was a good one. it basically had to deal with being real, stepping outside of what is safe and sensitive people.  so i went and saw me some  pirates of the caribbean  last night. my only complaint was it felt a bit long. there was some stuff they could have cut out and it would not have made a difference. orlando bloom is super duper good looking and it should be criminal to look that fine. :) but it was johnny depp who made that movie. he played captain jack sparrow and he was wonderfully GREAT. i adore johnny depp even more, if that is possible.  and speaking of johnny depp i should mention this list thing darth bronger and i have been working on. the basic idea is who would you go see a movie for because you either think the actor/actress is a. good looking b. resepectable enough or c. just admire.  Actors:                         1. brendan fraser - for the sheer fact that he is extremely good looking ... well to me .... and he is just an all around great guy. best movie he has been in is gods and monsters.                                     2. john cusack - good looking and i love the movies he is in ... well most of them but my fav. has to be better off dead. ha ha ... if you have not seen this movie go and get it.                                     3. kevin spacey - totally and absolutely respect this man. he is hands down a wonderful actor and he does great movies.                                     4. jet li - not a great actor but a great fighter and i have to admit i pretty much watch anything he is in :)                                     5. johnny depp - he is good looking and strange and good looking and does cool movies and rounding out the bottom are morgan freeman, steve buscemi and tony leung.  Actress:                        1. susan sarandon - completely respect her and love what she does. she is one of those older but still sexy in her own way types.                                       2. jodie foster - love her work and she is just so respectable ... a real fighter. i really liked her in silence of the lambs and contact and little man tate.                                      3. winona ryder - though her movies of late have been bad (shiver) ex. lost souls, autumn in new york and mr. deeds ... very very bad i love her 80's and early 90's stuff. love heathers and edward scissorhands                                      4. sandra bullock - good looking and super charming ... i will pretty much see anything she is in                                      5. drew barrymore - she is just so fun and cool and yea she is good ..  me sleep now.

      Intro:  The Samples - Feel Us Shaking   Hello everyone.  The sweetest thing happened today.  After work I went out surfing by myself, and I was waiting for my wave, I saw a fin come up out of the ocean.  First thought was, oh crap, a shark.  First reaction, poop my pants.  Second thought, wait sharks don't have curved fins and come up for air.  Second reaction, not stink up my pants, and realize the awesome sight i'm seeing.  Yes as I was out there, I saw a dolphin a mere 10 feet away from me.  It was one of those sights that's just pure.  I saw it come up for air and dive back under a few times until it was out of my view.  That's the closest I have ever been to one not counting Sea World and the likes, so I must say that it was good stuff.  Another guy told me there were 3 of them, but I only saw 1.    After this I caught my first wave ever on my board.  I have been going out for the past week and a half now, and I must say, the feeling was incredible, I felt such adrenaline rushing through me.   Just plain rad.  I failed horribly after that, but I do know that i'm making progress, and that's all that really counts for me.  Shortboards are so much harder than longboards, but after getting on my shorty, I feel that I reached a milestone, because it was one of those things I told myself i'd do before I died, and i've done it!  I'm not quitting now, but it's just a great feeling.  Sorry if this seems very focused on me, but i'm excited as crap right now.  Thank you have a good day!  Outro:  Pearl Jam - Yellow Ledbetter

      I had a really good long 4th of July break also.  I had Thursday off, so on Wednesday after watching Legally Blonde 2 with my co-worker I drove up to SF with Billy.  We left around 11:30 and got there at 5 in the morning.  I feel bad because I slept practically the whole way there. =)  We stayed with my sis who has an apartment in there until August...it's a little less then a mile from Fisherman's Wharf.  On Thursday we went shopping at Union Square and I was in heaven!  I'm not much of a shopper, not like most girls but I LOVE BARGAINS.  They had really good sales at Macy's and Banana Republic so I had a field day. =)  Anyways, that night we had dinner with one of my good friends and we met her new boyfriend and went to a karaoke place.  On Friday we went to Palace of Fine Arts, Golden Gate Park, swimming and to Fisherman's Wharf for some clam chowder and fireworks.  It was a busy day but lots of fun.  I decided that the Palace of Fine Arts is my favorite place in San Francisco.  On Saturday we did some more shopping and headed back home.  It was a great trip...San Francisco seems like a cross between N.Y. and L.A.  It's not as busy and crowded as N.Y. but they still have the "culture" that L.A.'s missing.  Does that make any sense?

      ok ok so I finally decided to blog about my 4th.  been too lazy to blog anything really.  anyhow, we had our family reunion this last week...it's my grandfather's side of the family..the Lims.  On Tuesday, my cousin Grace from Michigan came to hang out.  We went shopping, watched Legally Blonde and went to TGIF's w/ my other cousin and her friends.  Good times.  Then on Thurs my aunt/uncle/cousins from Canada came back from Vegas and I took the boys(13/14) to see T3 and it was a v. entertaining movie.  Like most action movies I went in not expecting much and i enjoyed it alot.  Friday was the Lim Family Reunion Picnic in San Diego(Bonita/Chula Vista area).  It started off crappy cuz we had to go pick up the food and that shit spilled ALL OVER my trunk which caused it to reek of...I think it was the shrimp paste...for the next week(I just cleaned it up yesterday and there is still a hint of that smell elch!!!).  Oh and we missed all the introductions so i totally didn't know anyone or where they came from and THAT sucked.  But the food was really good and i met my cousins from virginia, texas, michigan, maryland...and I forget where else...oh yeah L.A.  Supposedly one of my cousins spins for Black Eyed Peas....I'm not a big fan so I'll just give that a *shrug*.  Then my cousins and I went to Novette's house and swam, chilled, relaxed..  I swear it felt like I was on a resort cuz we were just lazing about.  There, I learned how to surf...in a pool...but it was still fun!  I learned the basics: how to balance on teh surfboard to paddle, stratling the surfboard and pushing up on it to stand/kneel.  That night we went out w/ the "younger generation" meaning teens and up.  The 21 and under kids went to coffee shops/wandered around at the gaslamp quarter while the 21+ crowd went into this bar/club called The Bitter End.  It was really fun.  I danced my ass off....where are my quarters new wave??  Saturday was the family party at Novette's house.  OMG!!! my uncle made the most tender bestest pork roast dealie.  SO FREAKIN GOOD.  I ate that for breakfast and lunch haha.  Kyle came down and we all went swimming for like 3 hours.  I also learned how to play this north-midwestern card game called Yuker(pronounced you-ker).  It takes about 45 min to learn---seriously haha.  Then I went back with Kyle and we went to his friends bday thing at D&B in Ontario.  His friend came across tickets coming out of that game where you try to knock the coins over the edge...and the tickets kept coming....and coming....and coming.  And they were free!  So all in all Kyle, his friend Justin and I all split 1400 tickets.  I got a D&B glass and a YO YO!!!!!  the yo yo is awesome hehe.    Sunday was my cousin Franco's bday party in Irvine.  Kind of like the reunion parties part 3.  He ordered food from this Hawaiian restaurant and it was yum!  After that, i took my cousin and aunt to see Charlie's Angel's.  Ok I had said earlier that I don't expect much from action movies....and I didnt going into this flick.  But I was actually a bit disappointed.  The plot wasn't v. well put together...the stunts were like so impossible that they weren't believeable...and in the end there were a few pieces to the story that weren't resolved.    So that was my weekend or week.  Pretty busy, which explains how tired I am.  But wait it's not over!  Wed is this gathering at my aunt's hotel/resort thingie...then thurs is a party at her friends house and it's also serving as a bday party for my sister.....blah!  I'm tired!!!  listening to: the cure-cut here(acoustic version)

(sigh) it is killing me. to be honest i think that is all i worked on this weekend.   blasting on the stero:  the cure - galore album ... i actually really don't like this album but i must admit they did put all their popular songs on this thing.

        "things dont have to be this way, catch me on a better day"  ("fix me now" by garbage is on) ok so last nite, i went to my first rave ever, and most likely the last one.  it was a very underground rave, well i'm assuming it was, cos there were like 100 people there.  we thought it was going to be in glendale, which seemed kinda weird, but it turned out that the glandale site was just a place to get tickets and directions to the actual rave which was in LANCASTER!!!! argh!!!  so i drove out there.  they played music called "happy hardcore"  which is really fast, and i just couldn't get into, guess it was due to my drug-free self.  i should have thrown some alcohol in my trunk *sigh*  anyway, i ended up spending 10 bucks to take naps in my car in the middle of nowhere.  oh yeah, and i got to see some e-tards sit on the dirt getting a light show, fun stuff (rolls eyes) to make matters worse, i arrived home at approximately 6:30 a.m., woke up at 9 a.m. and worked from 11 until 8 pm.  jobs suck MAJOR ASS!!  i used to do nothing, but at least i knew i did nothing but stay home and waste the day away.  now, i go to work, get all tired and sleepy, come home, sleep, and know i did nothing all day.  at least before i was just chillaxing all day long, and it was all good.  i guess i will feel differently when i get paid and actually have something to show for my pain. hehe, as if my job is hard.  but hey, sundays at best buy are BUSY!!!  we supposedly closed at 6 pm, but people were still coming in at 6:20 and i rang someone up at 6:45.   NOTE TO EVERYONE:   please!  dont go to a store after they are closed and try to do some shopping!!!!  its sooo annoying. ok, well thats all for now later lates ending with "hanging around" by the cardigans  oh yeah, dorkus, i wanted to ask u what 80s club that is.   thanks :D

So much fun! they played better music this time than the time that we went together. anyway, just wanted to let you know that they played not only one, not only two, but THREE CURE songs! The last one they played was "Go to Bed" I think.

      hello everyone. i'm back! not like anybody noticed i was gone. i spent 11 days in boston and new york, and although i did enjoy myself (sorry to disappoint pigern), it felt like a really long time to be gone. i won't bore you with the details of my trip. i just want to say that i did not hear one person say, "i'm waiting on line." then again, i was busy blending in with the new yorkers and not paying attention to anyone else. in short, my attitude problem got bigger, and i have a newfound dislike for tourists.   oh yes, one more thing. if you are ever on the east coast, check out the musical Urinetown. If you haven't heard of it, it's about a town in a futuristic setting where you have to pay to use the restroom. Sounds dumb, the title sounds weird, but trust me, it's very very funny. Very witty, tongue in cheek, Simpsons-esque even. plus Tom Cavanagh (the bowling alley lawyer from "Ed") played the lead character. I'm so in love with him.   (New York in June is absolutely disgusting. Smog, smoke, dirt, humidity, body odors, you name it.)

       depeche mode: somebody   hey party people, 4th of July is upon us...yes that means 3 days off!  where is everyone?  where have all the cowboys gone?  how come people aren't blogging?  i'm sitting here in the office counting down the minutes til i get to depart. my back kinda hurts, so i think i'm in good shape.  i finally purchased my surfboard, and went out the past 2 days.  one of my life goals is to be able to stand up on a shortboard, so wish me luck, and pray that i don't die.  so i'm on my way.  darth, i love that you almost yacked it, haha that's sweet.  that song is soooooooooooooo sucky, but it holds so true to all the kids out there in crappy music land.    softball should be fun tomorrow, i hope it's really hot cause that would add to the enjoyment factor.  oh and darth, i also hope that "the thing" doesn't come out, i mean i heard that he's pretty pissed about hulk having his own movie and wants to make a guest appearance, especially if the sun is out and about tomorrow.  seriously i hope not to see that happen.  so what's everyone doing this weekend?   coyote shivers: sugar high

      Hey everyone.....the blogger post looks different....neat i guess......Saw T3 last night and I have to say I wasn't disappointed like I was with Matrix Reloaded. It brought everything that you could hope for, good action, a story that held true to the previous ones, and of course lots of Arnold one liners. I was quite satisfied with the movie although sitting in the 3rd row did cause my eyes to hurt during the fast paced scenes.  Looking forward to playing softball tomorrow. Unlike playing with my work, we may actually win this time and the teams should be for the most extent competitive. Mac you too should be commended on your football and softball skills, although word out on the street is that the cobra kai is after you, be for warned.  I heard that boys and girls song today for the first time, as I was out and lunch and it was playing at the place I was eating and thus could not be avoided, oh my gosh, shoot me in my head, seriously it bad, like really really bad, i almost threw up in the middle of my meal. Poor mighty ducks, lost paul kariya today to the stupid colorado avalanche. I'm not a ducks fan, but I did enjoy watching him play for them and wished he had stayed his whole career there....oh well thats sports business for you.  Happy 4th of July to everyone

      question for the house.  what's an affordable, romantic type of place to go for a weekend.  somewhere semi-local so that one would be able to drive there?  So far we have SD and Catalina, but are there any other places?  Also if there are any tips to get the biggest bang for our buck would be great.  ok, your help/suggestions would be appreciated.  hasta!

      music to begin blogging:  trina feat. trick daddy - "off the chain with it"   ok, so im supposed to be packing, and as always, im waiting until the last minute.  i have a mere 15 hours left in so. cal, so looks like that will be spent packing and sleeping (hopefully more of the latter), before i move to san francisco.  im thinking about leaving at around 2 pm.  i am going to crash at my LIS homie, jose's crib tomorrow nite cos i dont move in to my place until tuesday.  bad part is that i have to go to the city of SF residential parking permit office at 8 am to get my permit, and i have to report at the school at 8:45, good thing that, according to mapquest, the permit office is only 7 minutes from campus.  as eric would say, "we'll see what happens"  i must say that i have had some good times before leaving.  dorkus' b-day was cool, and then, of course there was saturday, and from what i remember, that was cool too.  i guess i dont have much else to day, just wanted to drop a line before i left, also before i got kicked out of here :p   music to end blogging:  anita ward - "ring my bell"

      Sorry for the random blog, but this is what I blogged on my other blogsite and I just don't have the time to write another.  Either way it's an update on me so you can skip it or read on.  Btw sorry to sluts that I didn't make it to your going away party.  :(  i really wanted to go but i had to watch my sister.     when in doubt, go to a study group session   that's the lesson of the day.  i had a TOTALLY crappy day at school today.  I think it was a mixture of frustration, being overwhelmed, fatigue and brain overload.  BUT everytime I feel this way, and I think I'm gonna go crazy.....I go study w/ my group and I feel so much better!  There's this group I study with and they're really cool.  We discuss one subject and go over all the lectures to date and it really helps.  I also need to bulk up on my studying alone time.  I seem to find myself wasting time in my apartment.  So what I'm gonna try this week going to A.S.S.(alternative study spaces) to a. get me offline, b. away from the tv, c. away from the phone(sort of) and d. to studying!!  Hopefully it works out.  We get out at 3 tomorrow, so I'm planning on going to starbucks either right after or something like that.  Then tomorrow we're going to go to the HIP HOP class at the LA fitness in La Verne.  WOOHOO!  Dancing is awesome.  Can't wait.  Plus I think my cousin Novette is gonna go so good times will be had.  OK time to go night night...yeah i kno it's only 1130...but i'm getting old!  listening to: the whir of my computer

      hello everyone.  i heard some interesting information on the radio this morning.  apparently we will be able to see Mars clearer than we ever have sometime soon.  but that is not the news i am talking about.  what i heard was this lady talking about her belief that all Chinese people are Martians.  it was very intriguing she belongs to a special "club" a cult you might say that believes that Chinese people are decendents of aliens.  isn't that awesome?  so when asked what the culture of aliens were she responded with they have a very asian influenced style.  ummmm, k.........just thought i'd share this tidbit with the Chinese folk out there, apparently you guys are all aliens, and not the illegal kind either.    so yeah apparently someone has been going around defacing the names of innoncent folk, such as myself and chris carraba.  this is not cool people.  haha.  and i'd like to point out to darth, that i did not write, i like boys for you.  i have no idea who the culprit is, maybe frank stallone?  also one other thing before i leave, i'm really into texas hold'em these days, so if you guys ever play, please let me know, so i can get it out of my system.  haha.

      it's almost one but i had to type my review of "american splendor." it is brilliant. v. witty and funny but not the dumb type of humor (i.e. adam sandler). and the film is not shot in a conventional way. but it goes behind the camera, incorporates comic strip illustrations. i am so happy to have fin-nally seen a movie worth watching. i thought "swimming pool" would do it for me... but no. not really. i would watch "american splendor" again. especially since the guy next to me was one of those people who would say, "omigosh, i can't believe he did that!" or repeat the line just said while chuckling. okay. this is not your living room. hello? so annoying. anyway, this is a film i recommend!

      oh yeah new wave, i just heard that you're not making it on the 22nd for my bday because of some vegas trip. hmm, seeing as you never go to vegas, and going to vegas is an exclusive limited time offer, and vegas is going to fall off the face of the earth in two weeks, you are officially and totally off the hook. NOT! it's not like you already committed to attending my bday dinner, oh wait - you did! you officially suck! hope you lose all your money in vegas. haha. jk.  darth: good luck on your bowling tournament.

      wow. it's great to be back on American soil. to be in a real English speaking country again.   just got back late last night from my trip to Paris, France. it was a great trip: France is a beautiful country with so much culture to be had. not everyone is rude; we did some encounter some rudness, but we also met some perfectly nice people too. a lot of the time was spent with family we have not seen in years, and some of my parent's childhood friends. so during my two weeks there, we visited all the monuments and touristy spots (aren't we obligated or something?): Tour Eiffel, Sacre Couer, Place de la Concorde, Arc de Triumphe, Notre Dame, Louvre (where we saw the real Mona Lisa), Montmartre (Amelie-town), Chateau des Versailles, Champs Elysees, Mont St Michel. we drove through Normandy to get to Mont St Michel, and I fell in love with Normandy - it's what I picture when I think of France: the green fields and flowers, charming cottages with the yard gnomes, the local shops and bakeries. it's gorgeous. when I go back to France, I would like to either visit Normandy, or Monaco and Corsica.   we also spent a day in London, England, and another day in Brugge, Belgium. i loved Belgium! and London too! I'm thinking I want to spend more time in England next year (ahem, looking your way - New Wave and Pigern).  the bad thing about the trip was that it was a million degrees outside. the whole time i was there it was 95 - 105 degrees outside, humid, and NO air conditioning anywhere!! NO AIR CONDITIONING PEOPLE!!! NONE! So you are perpetually sweating, from the minute you get to France and minute you leave. You take a shower at night, and you have to hose off in the morning again. You sleep with all your windows and doors open, and you wake up several times a night because it is that hot. It's like you're living in a furnace. AND to top it off, you have to get on the bus and subway everyday to stand next to Frenchie who decides that they are too good for deodorant, so you must block off your sense of smell or you will die. you never feel shower fresh, it's quite disgusting. so there were some days where we were all just cranky because we couldn't take the heat. folks, i'm not kidding or anything, the heat wave was deadly: unfortunately, the French government estimated  that 3000 people have died.   oh yeah, I wish I could at least speak a little French - it would have made things easier, but the most i know is the standard greetings and how to count. i can figure out some things because of the years i took spanish, but really, the language barrier makes things difficult sometimes. so that's why i was kind of glad to go to england and belgium where they speak English! wow, i feel so...American. sad.   so overall, a great trip was had, but i'm glad to be home. i have several reminders of france: besides my souvenirs, i have the nastiest mosquito (?) bite you will ever see. something bit me - I'm not sure what it was - a mosquito, a wasp, a small animal - on my leg. it looks like a bug bite, but then it looks bruised and bloody (underneath the skin), so although i'm not actually bleeding or oozing anything, it looks gross! even i get disgusted everytime i look at it. that's just me though - i get allergic reactions to bug bites - anybody else would get a small bump from a mosquito, i get raised mounds with the diamater of a golf ball. hehe. i hope i thoroughly grossed everyone out, as i so enjoyed doing to my family members. hehe.  au revoir!  p.s. bonus purchase: a limited edition of the Amelie soundtrack (the French version), with four additional songs from Yann Tiersen.

      Darth, I am not joking but I am actually going to go watch it tonight.  Not by my choice since I don't really like scary movies, but with some of my coworkers and friends.  If you want to come you're more then welcome too!  Anybody else interested?  We're watching a 9:40 showing at The Grove.  Did you know it's $11.50 for a stinking movie ticket there for Fridays and Saturdays?  What the heck is that?

      music to begin blogging:  the cure - lullaby (that ones for u ftc, actually, its what made me decide to come and blog)   okay, so nothing especially interesting has been going on here.  lets see, i went to the 80s club with some of y'all forever and a half ago, and i must say, good times were had :D  my sister enjoyed it as well, i think she told her co-workers about it cos every friday since then she asks me what the name of the club is cos her co-workers want to know.  good stuff.  ok, the other day, i filled out the "separation" form for best buy (i.e., my 2 weeks notice).  :'(  how sad.  its not too bad working there, and the discount is hella nice.  this week, i bought the batman legacy for 42 bucks (reg. 69.99) and i got the best of molly shannon for 12 bucks (reg. 14.99), not to shabby.  (haha, remember that from vert lab, hedwig??)  i still havent made the one big purchase that i wanted to make.  i dont know whether to go with a digi-cam or a stereo for my car, hmmmm.  speaking of my car, the other day i went to get a tune up near by and i had a coupon with me for 34.99.  and the dude there told me that my '01 malibu would be $189!!! because my car REQUIRES the platinum plugs, im like, WTF?!?!  so i need to call somewhere else, cos i totally did not believe him, and i hope i dont have to shell out that much mula, cos if so, then my car will just have to settle for an oil change dammit! oh yeah, im off to sf in about 3 weeks.  my sister had said that she wanted to throw a going party, but we've yet to see that materialise, we might just end up going out or something.  oh yeah, ftc, i have the blender issue with thom yorke on the cover, if u want it. so i guess thats about it for now....   music to close:  bush - cold contagious   ONE MORE THING!   shirley's new studio diaries are now up at  urlLink www.garbage.com  for the reading...enjoy   music for editing:  shakira - donde estan los ladrones?

      Coming in With:  Street to Nowhere- The Parkman Ghost   The A-L-H??  Darth seriously....  haha.  Also i'd like to point out that our claim to fame is not a haunted house, but none other than the class of 1997's Adam Tate!  Hello, he is on the practice squad for the Green Bay Packers.  That means he knows that Brett Faverere guy.  So Freaky Friday seems like the popular movie choice right now, but the next flick I actually want to watch is a movie called Step Into Liquid.  I've been on a local music scene kick recently for some reason as well, well by local I mean local California bands, up and down the coast, there's some good stuff out there.  Oh yeah before I go there is a very awesome virus/worm going around for computers.  It's so very excellent, I have my home computer and my work computer infected with it.  It's really cool cause it pretty much locks you out of your own computer as it shuts down after it's on for a few minutes.  Apparently it is transferred through downloads or email and a lot of people are having this happen to them.  So just a warning to the house.  Oh yeah and make sure you have your stuff backed up, cause I almost lost all my files.  Not cool Zeus.  Going out with:   Dogwood - Conscience in a Cave

      wow blogging 2 days in a row!! crazy me....anyway last night i got to watch a reunion of one of my favorite cheesy 80s shows. "THATS INCREDIBLE!!!" Man that show takes me back. They redid one of my favorites from way back when, the haunted Toys R. Us store. They have photographs of the ghostly figure in the isles and such. Now I had always been told that this store was the one a few miles from my house, but checking on the internet today, I have found that its in Sunnyvale. Man that sucks.....I thought that was our claim to fame. I did however find that there is a haunted house in Alhambra, next door to the Home Depot, so i guess that makes the A-L-H, somewhat cool....doesn't it?

      another wonderful week of work ... it was so yucky hot this weekend that i'm actually glad i'm in the office where the ac is blasting. ha ha.   saw freaky friday with skimmy on thurs and it was great. i really enjoyed the film .. it was a total junk, brain candy, fluff type movie but honestly every once in awhile you need that. i mean who wants to watch serious movies all the time. i thought jamie lee curtis and lindsey lohen did such a great job ... loved them. i also found the reference to a lot of mainstream indie bands comical cause you know 5 years later these bands won't even be remembered like the vines, the hives, white stripes and so on. i wanted to go see the secret lives of dentist as well but the line for the movie theatre was insanely long so forget that ... oh well .. bummer.   good luck in school hedwig .. i'm sure you will kick ass in all your classes. :)  as for the kicking out of the house bit ..  no worries foolios .. you have to seriously NEVER EVER EVER EVER blog for me to kick you out. we are talking months and months ... and soon all you are doing is taking up space in the house.  so thinking about what mac the knife wrote a few days back ... skimmy and i were talking about that for a bit and although we don't look any different ... well at least i know i don't  .... i do feel like i have changed and i feel like skimmy has changed. yea i might still live at home and work at some tired ass company but my mindset, my outlook on life is always changing and alternating. i'm not one standing thought or opinion however i do feel that certain people have a certain way of looking at you that makes it seems like you are never changing.    blasting on the stereo:  drown - smashing pumpkins ... getting ready for seattle ... hee hee.

      haha....my stomach hurts from doing ab crunches and from the batting cages...i thought i'd tell that to hedwig so that she could offer me a sandwhich now....haha.  yes skimmy the book is going to be made into a movie with sly stallone as the lead cop.....its gonna be great!!   I had quite the problem yesterday with my late evening tv schedule, I found that Star Wars, Glory and Rocky IV were all on at the same time, needless to say my thumb is pretty tired from flipping through all the channels.  I wish I had the motivation to study for GREs, but i'm lazy, i can't believe i motivated myself enough to clean my room, i guess it finally just pushed me over the edge and i needed to do it. It does look nicer and bigger now, so i guess thats a good thing. I hope this blog prevents me from being kicked out of the house.  currently listening to: Pixies

      good luck hedwig with your classes, that sounds really exciting!  i can't imagine going back to school and having to deal with homework again...i'm studying for the gmat right now (well trying to) and that's already really tough.  just setting the time aside to study...it reminds me of why i wanted to graduate so badly.  new wave and i watched freaky friday last week too.  i thought it was pretty funny, and jamie lee curtis and lindsey lohan both did a really great job.  darth, i read the first 2 chapters of labrynth and it's very interesting.  i can't wait to go home to read some more.  you said they're making a movie out of it?

      hi there...just checking in cuz no one's been blogging and i didn't want new wave to have a shit fit and start kicking everyone out!!  So here I am.  I officially start med school tomorrow.  I'm excited but scared about starting.  Hopefully I will kick ass in all my classes.  Today I watched Freaky Friday today with my family.  It was v. entertaining...and also i'm a big fan of lindsey lohan so if she annoys you then don't go see the movie hehe.  I mean it's no epic movie or anything but it's fun and I enjoyed it a lot.  Other than that I haven't really seen any movies lately.  I still need to see S.W.A.T.(colin farrell yummmm droool) and 28 days later.    listening to:  the beeps of the red head's cell phone as he puts new numbers in....good stuff

       currently listening to:  millencolin - black eye   so i'm sitting here at the office right now, being bored.  i have work to do, but don't feel like doing it right now, so i'll let it pile up some, then be pissed later that i have work to do.  anyways i have random thoughts going on through my head, and thought i'd spill some of it out.    yesterday i met up with one an old church buddy that i have known since we were in the 3rd grade.  he came to san diego from atlanta for a conference.  i haven't seen him since a couple years back, but we caught up for some dinner and spirits.  the point is, that ever since i've known him, he's evolved/changed.  we are the same age, but he looks like he's about 4 years older than i, and has gotten his priorities straight.  he dresses in slacks, nice shoes, izod's, the whole nine.  then i look at other people i know, and everyone is still stuck in the same motif as however long i've known them, sure they've gotten jobs, have grown older, etc.  thing is they still look the same and act the same, in my opinion.  i'm not saying this is everyone, but a vast majority seems that way, and i'm sure i haven't changed either.  i don't know why this is, maybe it is because i see them more often, but still, i would expect at least some changes.  to me it is weird.  my goal right now is to just finish up my little tenure here in san diego, and get back into grad school.  after that there is a question mark, all i know is that i want to be running my own things, and not working for someone.  whatever happened to the "what do you want to be when you grow up?"  i sure as hell didn't want to be an accountant.  weak.  i feel like i'm in office space.  and michael bolton is a no talent ass clown.   out with:  no use for a name - redemption song

      no one blogs anymore ... BOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!  i hate having to be a closet radiohead fan. i have been listening to ok computer all day today ... over and over and over again and i'm just amazed at how stellar the album is. fucking amazing :) i mean ok computer came out in 1997, over 6 years ago, and it is still able to leave such a good impression. i remember when i use to dl all their b-sides and make cds of them and all this stuff. i really liked radiohead before they got all monster big and god like. sheesh.  and you know what is funny is how much radiohead wants people to love them ... they want to be accepted and loved and admired. i think thom feeds off of it but i'm still bitter towards the band for all that W.A.S.T.E mishap but it's all good. (sigh) i really do love their music ... and i guess now so does half the general public.    blasting on the stereo:  climbing up the walls - radiohead ... this song is so amazing

      i'm all moved in!  it only took two days so i'm glad that it worked out ok.  kyle's family helped me move my stuff in, along w/ darren.  then at night my mom and sis came over and helped me clean.  today novette came to visit me...my first visitor!  and she brought some thai food...yum.  it was really good timing cuz matess and i were getting hungry.  it's fun setting up a new place. your old things find new places and everything is like new.  :)  i feel like i have stuff to do...but i havne't organized my head to think about it yet.  perhaps i should make a list of things to do.  i know i want to change my sprint plan and phone number...and i have to cancel the gas and electric in philly....but amy never emailed me back.  then i just gotta get ready for school in general.  orientation is in two days...craziness.  then it's school like i've never had before.  8-4 everyday....WOOHOO!  i'm SO looking fwd to it.  bleh.  hopefully it will be fun...but when is studying ever fun.  *shrug*  alrighty i'm gonna continue to take my lil weave thingie i got from seaworld out of my hair...it's annoying. soundtrack: girl from ipanima--astrid gilberto

      i am driving and see a toyota sequoia SUV with the "no war for oil" bumper sticker. i stared and stared until i think it was obvious to the driver. how unbelievable is that? and it wasn't irony. because she had "world peace" stickers too. that's all fine and dandy if you believe in world peace but you are helping to fuel the country's greed for oil.

      A friend sent me this poem.  I thought it was funny.  Hee hee.  This Be The Verse By Philip Larkin They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra, just for you. But they were fucked up in their turn By fools in old-style hats and coats, Who half the time were soppy-stern And half at one another's throats. Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, And don't have any kids yourself.

      AMAZING ... that's how i would describe tonight's radiohead show. i know i sounded displeased in my last blog but scratch it. the setlist from yesterday was just alright but tonight's was mind blowing. it was sooooo good. they played some of the songs i wanted to hear like morning bell, no surprises and i might be wrong :) i think the real treat for a lot of people was (drumroll ...) they played creep. that was pretty fricking amazing ... WOW is all i have to say. dang. it was quite impressive. what would have topped it is if they played true love waits. that song is wonderful. the audience this time was really good ... they got into the songs and seemed really happy. only prob. was some girl walked down i guess from her far seats and basically crammed her way into my seats >:ol .... grrrrrrrr. that made me mad. oh and leaving the parking lot some lame girl in a jetta was too scared to move her car in fear she might hit another, cause we had stacked parking, so we were boxed in for a bit .... grrrrr. yea so now i'm in love with radiohead again. so goes my on again/off again love affair with them. ugh. they are just so good.   on a side note, in case you were wondering about my devotion to the cure, i raced home after the show so i could tape the cure on craig kilborn. they taped it last thurs but aired it today. so lame, i really don't like craig kilborn. oh well.    spinning:  kid a - radiohead

      pigern, SAVE YOURSELF. do not read friendster profiles or you will be pissed off by the number of dumb people out there. seriously. i've read a couple profiles, but then i stopped to ask myself why. do i care about these people? NO. do i have any intentions of sending a friendster message? hell NO. (oh yeah, a friendster pet peeve of mine is when people list various magazines as their favorite books. my message to people who do this: a magazine is not a book. if you do not have a favorite book or if you do not read, please leave the question blank.) blahhh. just venting, i guess.  i guess the internet connects you in an impersonal way. sorta. make sense?...email is cool and all, but remember the days when we would write actual letters?  listening to: The Rocking Hose Winner - steps in sand

      random thoughts ... went to see radiohead yesterday at the bowl. although i am trying to distance myself from them due to numerous reasons, i must admit they do put on quite a bad ass show (darn them all) ... and i want to put dancing thom in my pocket and just carry him around all the time. :) but to my point .... i was super annoyed at the show cause it was so L.A. ugh. i hate fucking L.A-ers. they just stand there caring about their self image and talking about who they know, what fab. job or life they are leading and who they had drinks with the other night or what stupid ass screenplay/production/director/(insert a ton of other stuff) they are working on. grrrr. so i was looking at the lyrics to paranoid android and one line goes "the yuppies networking, the vomit the vomit" and found myself laughing so hard. here are individuals who attend radiohead concerts and they are the types that radiohead sings out against but then again radiohead robbed their true fans by making us see their precious asses at the butt huge hollywood motherfu**ing bowl so go figure. end conclusion ... hate LA a lot a lot and secretly ... very very secretly love radiohead .... ha ha.   spinning:  paranoid android - radiohead  p.s. see not only do i despise "the OC" .... i loathe LA. hey that would be a great shirt, instead of i love LA it should read i loathe LA. ha ha funny stuff.

      do you ever think the internet makes you feel more isolated? everyone always raves it makes you more connected blah blah. but sometimes i think it makes you feel more alone. so this is another random observation about friendster: i think that people who are not classically attractive have an advantage in the sense that they have more time to develop their interests and tastes. you know, go to theatre, read books, and develop a sense of what is really worthwhile or intellectual. i came to this thought after randomly browsing through people's profiles and there is a high correlation between those who are attractive (at least in the photos they post) and dreadfully poor tastes and/or blank profiles. Example: a girl who likes both dashboard confessional, all-american rejects PLUS sweet home alabama. i could excuse some for "so bad it's good" but only some (i.e. new wave fancying cheesy 80s films). or their "about me" blurbs are so generic and dull. perhaps i am being snobbish.

      inland invasion sounded like a good time. with a bunch of old bands. ha ha. tonight i saw hot hot heat at the hob in anaheim. i got severely lost because i didn't know the hob was deeply embedded within downtown disney. i thought it was on the street, like l.a. and i found out that the lights really do take forever to change in the o.c. lame. and there are a lot of little skater kids running around. so after the show i hightailed it back to l.a. ha ha. the hot hot heat show was okay. i didn't pay for my ticket so what did i care. i did see kelly osbourne, yet again. she must go to every show known to man. geez. so at work today alllll these people were talking about the emmys afterparties and who they schmoozed with. which made me think of this andy warhol quote (i don't know it word for word) - Los Angeles and Hollywood are full of plastic people. But I like plastic. I want to be plastic.

      I'll start with the Inland Invasion...thank goodness we were in the shade, cause i would have died, being white isn't that great when you are in the sun, you kinda burn....fast...anyway......i enjoyed the time there most bands were somewhat entertaining.....violent femmes were fun and goofy....fountains of wayen were weak......interpool were okay, the guy has a cool voice i'll give him that much....now to the 3 closing.......hot hot heat i have to say i was a bit surprised by, not so much of their music but of their lead singer, its american idol's justin guarini...serious its him, he has the same goofy hair and smiles like him....haha....duran duran was cool, they seemed pissed at the sound system though, i would have liked to see them play a bit longer but its all good, they were a real flashback....then some band called the cure came on, i guess they are big or something cause people seemed to go crazy over them...they were quite good and played for 3 hours...someone was quite ecstatic (looking at new wave) anyway good times were had..........  now onto the real news....DENVER JUST KICKED THE CRAP OUT OF THE TRAIDERS 31-10....and honestly it wasn't even that close....haha..yeah that makes me feel pretty good....work won't be as crappy as usual tomorrow i guess..haha  and here is your second big news update...STAR WARS EPISODE 3 has finished shooting...now we just have to wait a year and a half for all the special effects to be added in and we will be good to go...better start lining up soon!!!!   okay i guess thats enough for me now....vegas...again in 4 days...alcoholic fest II

      currently listening to: REO Speedwagon - I Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore  hahahahaha.  man i'm so lame, why am i listening to REO Speedwagon.  i do wish i had a cool shirt like Billy Madison though to wear with a cool denim jacket.  so last week i was contacted by 4 different people through friendster that i had lost touch with.  it's been like 5-7 years since i last saw any of them.  we were really good friends back then too, but we never went to the same school, or lived in a close proximity, so it just fizzled i guess.  so thanks to friendster i am talking to all of them again, which is very cool.  weird how things work out isn't it?  and so life goes on.  darth please don't comment about the show life goes on, it was not a cool, but it makes me smile.  hahaha.  oh yeah i saw lost in translation yesterday.  bill murray is sweet, his humor is pure genius.  currently listening to: Saves The Day - Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven

      i wanted to blog yesterday but i was WAY TOO TIRED. so the cure concert was.....   well darth and i left around 1 to head out to lovely devore, ca and we didn't actually park and get out of the car till around 3:30. that's right people it took over 2 hours to get there and most of the traffic was getting into the place and parking the car. once that was said and done it was a good 20 min or more hike to the venue (cause we parked ass far in some dirt lot) in the freaking hot sun. it was so hot .... blech. once inside we were faced with a huge crowd of people buying food and merch. so we made our way to our seats which were 10th row but seriously so far off to the side :( that we got an angle view most of the time but we were close. the pit rail/fence was less than 20 ft from us.   when we got there we had already missed dashboard confessional ... sorry mac ... so we just got to see from fountain of wayne and on. yea i was so not impressed by fow at all ... after that was marc a. from soft cell who was alright, of course the fans went wild for tainted love, then interpol came on and played a pretty basic set, i don't understand why they are so liked. then the psychedelic furs came on ... who i am currently really really into now. though richard, the leader singer,  tripped and fell over some stage equipment i think they sounded great and seemed like such nice chaps. :) after them was the violent femmes and they were pretty cool but i'm not really into their music, then echo & the bunnymen who were really good as well. then it was hot hot heat, now put in mind i saw them at the troub. with dorkus on my b-day earlier this year and now they are the third act on the main stage for kroq's inland invasion. yea you can tell i don't think they are worth that position but i guess kroq thought they were. they played an okay set ...eh pretty forgettable. the only part i really loved was someone was screaming "you are not robert smith" ha ha ha. then it was time for duran duran and let me tell you ... as much as people loved the cure .. they LOVE their duran duran. the crowd went crazy for them ... crazy. they were really good and played a lot of the popular / fav. songs like oridinary world, save a prayer, come undone, notorious, rio, and ended with girls on film. while they were doing girls on film i raced to the front of the pit fence/ rail and squeezed my way in so that i would have a good view for the cure. all the security there was pretty relaxed cause i think they got tired of fighing people off. we has to wait about 25 mins till the cure came on but once they did .... it was so great. they opened with 10:15 sat. night which i had a feeling they might do considering they played that on the kilborn show on thurs and it was a sat. night around 10 pm :) i won't get into the rest of their set list but they played a lot of their more popular songs like 100 years, just like heaven, pictures of you, inbetween days, lovesong in album order. during the end of bloodflowers, the security people for the pit didn't even care anymore who was going in and out so i snuck my way into the pit and stayed there for the three encores the cure did ... :) it was soooooooooo amazing. i was so close to robert and the boys :) (sigh) when they did plainsong and disintergration i almost died. robert concluded the night by saying SEE YOU NEXT YEAR ... YOU HEAR THAT HOUSE MEMBERS .... the cure (my boys) are coming back next year :). all in all the whole night was wonderful and unforgettable.  however i can't say that about the audience. they were unbelievely ghetto, nasty and disrespective. some people around me had the nerve to heckle at robert and the boys and others were leaving the pit once they didn't recognize the cure's popular songs ... booo to them. the audience was so annoying and lame ... you could tell they were made up by stupid people who listen to kroq but only like linkin park, queen of the stone ages, incubus and other stupid acts. i was reminded when i went how much i despise kroq held functions cause the people that attend and the way kroq conducts themselves is beyond terrible. i do not remember having such a bad time or experience at coachella and that venue had more people and bands.

      finally saw 'lost in translation.' it was brilliant. scarlett gives an excellent performance as does bill murray. this is one of those subtle films where you must read between the lines. there are several scenes where both characters are for the most part silent. and you infer meaning from their nonverbal communication. dialogue is secondary. the cinematography is beautiful too. it's really rapid and fast paced... mimics tokyo. alright so this is the second good film i have seen lately. wow. finally!

       music to come back to blogging:  mariah - "clown"  ok, so ive been gone for a while.  since the last time i was on here, ive moved to san francisco and have begun medical school.  so far, i like sf (a.k.a. "the city", thats soooo hilarious to me).  i havent had a chance to do much and check things out because 1) i got here the morning that orientation started, and 2) the saturday after i got here, my sis flew up and drive my car home.  sometimes i miss my car, but then i remember how i had to drive around my neighbourhood for 30 mins every nite to find parking.  for the last 3 days my car was here, i did not move it, just so i wouldnt lose my parking space.  terrible. let me see, as far as school is concerned, all the people in my class are nerds, they never want to do anything other than study.  im hoping after the first exam they will calm down and have fun.  ive discovered an 80's club on thursday nites, which was pretty cool.  theres also one on saturday nites that i want to check out, and i want to check out "popscene", the britpop club, on thursday nites as well.  so much to do. anyway, back to school.  we dont have to do dissections, and i think thats awesome.  cos i was realising that other med students have to dissect their cadavers, which translates into MANY hours in the lab.  all our cadavers are already dissected and we just look at them and study the structures.   coolness, i must say. well, i suppose thats all for now. oh yeah, have fun at the show FTC!!  music to finish blogging:  the go-go's - "vacation"

      pigern you read my mind!!! i always hate the people that cut  into my lane to be one car ahead!  i feel like they're invading my space.  i also hate it when people honk at you when you've been signaling and slowing down to make a right turn.  these f***ing people expect you not to brake and just turn right!  and people who run red lights, not yellow but red lights to turn left, even though 3 cars already turned when the light was turning yellow.   i can go on and on about my pet peeves on l.a. driving.  the only time (well not only time i guess) that i have a real potty mouth is when i drive!

      i think my life is wasted whilst in traffic. saturday morning - driving to sunset in traffic. leave l.a. and drive back in traffic. but at least i observe fellow commuters' insanity. apparently, if you are stuck in gridlock, it is a-okay to drive on the shoulder. really. it is. also, swerving in front of the one car ahead of you makes you go THAT much faster. and never let the cars merging on the freeway have it easy. make them really work for it. ah, great.

      All right, I don't like Inviters much either. You know, Inviters are people who invite other people to attend the event they've just been invited to without asking the person who just invited them. People who invite themselves to events can also fall under this category. Inviters probably don't even realize they are being rude. I don't think there will be an easy way out of this situation, Skimmy Zo. I think you can politely tell your coworker that although you would like to vacation with her someday, this cruise is a college friends trip only. A reunion of sorts. Maybe that will help. Or you can tell your coworker that your friends got mad at you for inviting people because it's supposed to be college friends only. That way, you get to blame your friends! haha. Good luck.   Okay, onto another subject..Tonight I bought my sister a Simpsons Duff Beer Animated Wall Clock from Spencer's, and the cashier was dressed as.....drum roll please.....a Penis. Thank you Penis, you have made my day.   Listening to: Broken Social Scene - Lover's Spit

      okay, i emailed new wave about this but i don't know how to handle this without being rude... but some of my college friends and i are planning to go on a cruise in november plus our boyfriends.  so i called a travel agent to get their pricing.  anyways, i'm talking and when i got off the phone my coworker jessica was like i want to go too! so i was like "what"? and i told her i'm going with 10 people and we're all couples. so i'm like really, in a way i'm going with 5 of my friends and their boyfriends from school. so she calls her boyfriend and says "we're going on a cruise, sunny invited me". then she calls dina (another coworker) and tells dina to go and bring a friend. and she told dina, yeah sunny invited us to go on a cruise with her and her friends.  no joking...and i was just like um sure not wanting to be rude but not sounding very enthusiastic.  so she's asking me all these questions about how much is it going to be, where is it going, when is it.... what the heck? i didn't invite her!!! but she's the person i hang out with at work, and i don't want to be rude...but how do i nicely tell her it's my own thing?

      Hey hey hey, now, don't even say that I loved the Dashboard video, that hurts New Wave, that's the same as hitting my equivalnet, of Chris Carraba in the ovaries.  I did however tell her to watch the video, and I kind of forced Darth to watch it as well.  As I have said before PUrple and piNK do not = PUNK, or maybe it does?  That's a noodle scratcher.  Hey why is everyone making fun of KIIS, they play quality stuff (i.e. Good Charlotte) and the DJ's aren't annoying or anything.  I too, used to be the "everything except country" person, but upon further review into it a few years ago, I also stumbled upon the fact that they really are the songs that R&B artists cover, and a lot of the original versions sound better too.  To be honest though I have no opinion or expertise to say whether or not country is good or bad, so all I can really say is that it's around, and people do enjoy it.  Just like NASCAR, Horseracing, Curdling, etc....although Curdling should be catching on anytime soon....haha.  Blah to the full work week, the government should shorten it to 4 days or so.  This weekend is going to be fun, fun, fun as well.  Darth and I are gonna go visit our friend Ty and go watch the Chargers/Broncos game too.

      why me no sleep? ... too lazy to actually write whole sentences so i'll just list random thoughts in my head:  that party you went to hedwig sounded pretty cool, inland invasion tixs are going for a lot on ebay, i know some country songs can be good and most r and b songs are based on them but i still can't get into it, KIIS is the worst music EVER ... any station that openly plays hilary duff music should be shut down, hilary duff is ANNOYING .. go lindsay lohan,  if sex sells then doesn't it make sense that boobage would sell on friendster ... in this case meaning getting more friends, friendster is getting boring and old, where is skimmy zo cause she has not blogged in awhile, dodgers are winning and hitting, new dashboard confessional video sucks so bad ... only watched the video cause mac the knife told me how much he LOVED IT ... ha ha i'm kidding ... darth bronger really loves the video like SO MUCH, why is dashboard confessional so popular cause i mean he is not good at all, raveonettes rock, american splendor good ... the secret lives of dentist bad, the cure in 10 days :) ........... and i will end on that note.   on the stereo:  beat city - raveonettes

      I guess I'll blog or else new wave just may kick me out of the house. I don't understand the hating of the country music, I mean there are a few good songs, kenny rogers the gambler is really cool....you got to know when to hold em, know when to fold em.....etc.....great song....yeah i don't know what people have against the country....a lot of country songs i've found while in the car with my dad are R/B songs that are just redone....its kinda funny really.....oh and the booby pictures, those girls (or in some cases guys pretending to be girls) are trying to get attention, guys always send messages to the those girls. my friend had some glam. pics of herself up and she got a lot of messages of guys....so i guess its a self esteem thing. Now to the real issue at hand, the NFL season has started and Denver is 1-0!!! yes i know we played crappy but a win is a win. Going to SD this weekend to watch them play, so far i'm 0-3 in denver games i've attended so hopefully i can break the streak this year. Oh and the Dodgers are finally learning how to hit, so its may be possible that we make the playoffs....i got my ticket order form this week....who wants to go!??!?!!

      WELL pigern, I used to be one of those ppl(the country music thing not the booby picture friends correlation); BUT i have changed my story.  I actually really like country now.....ME a filipino girl!! I have a setting for KZLA on my radio.  So there you have it; those ppl who say that, have never really heard--strike that, LISTENED to country music before.  Most of the songs tell a story and seriously how many songs nowadays do that?  BLING BLING!  and even if i wasn't a fan of country music, I wouldn't put that I liked everything except for country music, cuz c'mon you don't really mean EVERYTHING.  Do you like heavy metal death rock? no...do you like Korean rap?? noooo.  So boo to the KIIS FM whores.  Country rocks!!!  btw, today was my first set of exams and i think i kicked ass...yay me!  next week is anatomy and at that time it will be the other way around my ass will be the one being kicked!  time for bed!  OH OH...and the 2nd years threw a party for us...and it was a costume party of sorts: you're assigned a character and you have to find your partner i.e. mickey finds minnie...etc.  so this girl showed up as wonder woman....she came in a leather jacket...then she took it off and all she had on was a red bikini, a stomach chain thing and a whip.  I gave her mad props for showing up in that.  It was crazy shit!  NOW time for bed...i wasn't even gonna blog....aren't you proud of me new wave??

      has anyone noticed that there is a strong correlation between booby pictures and the number of friends on friendster.com? this is probably a v. obvious observation but i was browsing through and noticed that girls with sexually enticing pictures have more friends (i.e. booby picture = 200+ friends). another random note: i have seen several people put for favorite music: "pretty much anything except country." why do so many people have beef with country? i mean, alright, i don't like country. but what does it really mean that they like everything but country? how can that really be true? alright, that's my little rant on friendster.com.

      seriously i sometimes really hate the company i work for. ("but if you hate them so much, why don't you just quit?" i know, i know, don't bite the hand that feeds you or whatever.) anyway, here's an email that was sent out to the entire company today:  "There has been some question in the past on what is expected of employees regarding their daily start times. In the past we have granted a so called "window" of up to 5 minutes after the employees designated start time for an employee to report for work without a disciplinary consequence. Unfortunately a few employees abused this window on a regular basis. Effective immediately the "window" is closed. There is no longer a "buffer" of which you can be late for work without a consequence. If your designated start time is 8:00 AM, you are expected to be at work at 8:00 AM. Any exception to this must be approved by your supervisor. Any unexcused, or excessive tardiness will result in disciplinary action. First action will be a verbal warning from your supervisor. Second action will be a written warning. Subsequent actions include the possibility of suspension or termination. We try to work closely with each and every one of our employees to develop schedules that work for both the company and the employee. If you are late, you are expected to notify your supervisor. We expect that the schedule you have worked out, or the job that you have chosen fits into your daily lifestyle. If not, maybe a change is in order.......see employee handbook page 27."  Um, isn't this a little harsh???? Especially the last line. It's almost threatening. Anyway, the thing that's so messed up is that they make themselves seem like the nice guys by giving us a five minute window. However, it's CA law that you can be six minutes late and not be written up for it. We're doing research on it so we can throw it back in their faces.   anyway, they forgot the addendum: "This email applies to anybody who isn't related or married to someone in the company. All four of you, you know who you are."

      wow what a weekend ... smashing all the way. i had such a good time.  :) quick run down of our weekend ...  sat. we got there and didn't do too much ... had dinner and took in some sights but nothing much ... we were in fremont, a city a little outside of downtown seattle. it was nice there ... really mom and pop store-ish which was rad. sunday spend all day in downtown seattle doing the tourist stuff like pike's market and checking out the waterfront and pioneer square and blah blah blah ... later that evening we went and saw radiohead. oh my gosh so good ... i'm pretty pumped about the la show now ... THEY ARE SO GOOD LIVE. ack :) man was i happy or what ... totally rocking out. the venue itself was alright ... the getting out of the parking lot was FU**ING BAD. (shiver) bad bad bad memories which i would like to erase. blech. monday we went to bumbershoot this festival they have in seattle every labor day weekend and just hung out. we went to the emp (experience music project) which was the brain child of paul allen ... one of the microsoft dudes. the emp was cool cause there is so much about music in there ... and a lot about nirvana as well. later that evening we stood in line for R.E.M. and got front row center .... you can't do better than that. oh my goodness ... R.E.M. ROCKS :) they are unbelieveable live and i'm in love with michael stipe .. he has such stage presence ... it was beyond wonderful. that had to be one of the biggest highlights of the trip.  tuesday we went and checked out kurt cobain's house and the park with the famous benches. it was nice but eerie at the same time. to think that kurt cobain lived in the house and use to walk the grounds less than 10 years ago ... very haunting. and so we said our farewells to seattle ....... until we meet again :)

      well, i just got back from coffee mecca (also known as seattle).  it was ab fab.  my three favourite parts were R.E.M.  ha!  but seriously.  we were able to get to the front of the pit and i have (and probably never will) seen R.E.M. so closely before.  plus they were in top form.  radiohead was also good.  it was a music filled weekend.  we visited the EMP (experience music project) as well.  good times.

      sluts like you -   GOOD LUCK   in SF!! I hear they're weird there. haha jk.   okay, so the other day (against my better judgement) i watched Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses. I like scary movies and I thought it would at least be decent, but i was wrong. VERY wrong. my goodness, that's two hours of my life i'll never get back.   anyway, i've been on an 80s movie kick lately. just recently purchased: can't buy me love (patrick dempsey - you're so dreamy!), better off dead, and breakin'.....sixteen candles comes out on dvd tomorrow folks!

      i know what girl you're talking about, she's the one in liar liar, right?  she was in days of our lives for a while.  she's hot but more of a slutty made up hot.  lana is more pretty, naturally pretty.  can the two be compared?  there's a difference from sexy hot and just pretty.  like in guy terms...it'd be comparing brad pitt and um...vin diesel?  no, that's a bad comparison.  it works better with women.  but anyways, my point is i think there's a different from hot/sexy and cute/pretty.

      no way, Luke Duke is the hottest, or was it Bo Duke?  actually the hottest person that was ever on that show was Krista Allen, muy calinte.  she was the one villian that married Lex and tried to get the Duke of Hazzard to kill him.  so hot.    oh and on a side note, i saw Lex in a Starbucks last year in Vancouver.  he seemed like a cool guy, told him I liked the show, and he wasn't a jerk ass, but was receptive and stuff.  i kind of thought he was gay though, cause he was with a guy friend, and they seemed a little close, but that may just be me.  anyways Krista Allen, hottest villian, character, ever on Smallville.

      i have decided to give new bands a chance instead of writing them off so quickly. so here are some bands i have listened to:  rapture - echoes: unimpressed, too much copying robert smith's sound action going on strokes - room on fire: unimpressed, album much like last one ..... and i really don't like them the stills - pretty good, decent clearlake - cedars: alright, not too bad rem - best of 1988 to 2003: great stuff, bad day is an awesome song travis - 12 memories: uneven album but still strong, more invisible band like  on a side note i really hate show whores. example is pigern's friend who goes to every show known to man for who knows why. i guess the sole purpose of being at an event. the most recent example is the elliott smith tribute show next monday at the henry fonda where "Each artist will perform at least one of Smith's songs, and the program will also include a screening of Steve Hanft's bizarro short Strange Parallel, which features the late singer obsessed with an infomercial where he can purchase a robotic hand that will make him the world's greatest guitar player." well this person is going because beck is playing and they like beck. um .... from what i can see all artists are only scheduled to play a few songs and this is an ELLIOTT SMITH TRIBUTE SHOW. come on people. geez. whatevers.    spinning:  clearlake - i'd like to hurt you

'wisk'=risk, barbitulates=barbituates, he says enema like enigma...*shakes head*  ok back to lecture.........

      hello rancid girl, i could insert some stupid comment about rancid here, but i'm not too sure about the background of the name, so i'll just leave it at welcome.  hedwing sweet about your group of friends, diversity is awesome.    so crazy weekend with all the fires and all.  i'm sure you weren't so lucky as to have one close to where you work though, let me see, oh wait, there was one called the otay mesa fire, that one was pretty close i guess, where do i work?  oh in otay mesa.  yeah my car is so clean right now, and the air is so fresh by my work, it's actually refreshing...........oh no wait it isn't.  yeah it pretty much sucks.  oh and i also had this monster pimple on my nose too, you know the ones that are underneath so you can't do anything about them.  i tried to pop it a couple times but i teared up and it looked like i got popped in the nose.  so i stopped.  i think it's going away though.  anybody have any suggestions on this type of thing?  it's really an annoyance.  oh well halloween is amongst us tomorrow, anybody have plans?  i plan on helping out at some church thing for kids and then staying indoors and not doing anything.  cause last year's west hollywood fiasco was definitely something not to repeat.  sorry for the random blog people, but i felt threathened by the return of new wave.  hahaha.  jk.  i think....

      them are really cool in their own little way.  and we are way diverse which i also think is really cool b/c u see cliques within our class...and they're mostly based on ethnic lines.  but we have 4 white ppl, 2 black ppl(2 out of the 2.5 black ppl in our class haha), one korean, 2 filipinos, one asian indian and one vietnamese--does that add up to 12?  i think so.  but isn't that great?  so i love my friends and they're hella cool, sweet and awesome!!  shoutouts to the 2nd and 3rd row on the (if you're looking at the lecturer) RIGHT!! woohoo.  :)  listening to: woman-john lennon  oh oh and what i thought was REALLY weird was...ok after dinner we were getting the bill togehter which came out to 58.02...so we tipped him like 8 and some change.  so one of my friends paid 7 bucks on her discover then gave him 60 in cash.  so he comes back and is like...."so you put 7 on card and i'm confused this is 60 but bill is 58" and i just told him "KEEP THE CHANGE"...and he was like so "8 buck tip?" and we were like uh...yeah.  and he kept asking and looking confused...and it's like ok dude....so lets say it was a 60 buck bill...10% is like 6 bucks....so we're giving you 15% tip...which is normal.  so my friends are like super nice and they pitched in like 5 more bucks.  the reason why i thought it was weird was that usually chinese or asian places don't really care about tip. i mean am i being ignorant or don't they usually expect like 10% tip?  so either he was complaining about the tip or he didn't understand what was going on....but i seriously think he was just complaining about the tip.  what do y'all think?

      sorry for the long blog about japan. per dorkus melorkus request it is in paragraphs :). it is just that when i get started .... eh.  the fires going on are horrible ... over 1500 homes have been lost and i'm sure more will be added to that list as the week goes on :( they estimate the fires will not be contained for at least another week. horrible horrible.  speaking of horrible what is up with gilmore girls being so weak lately. very very very disappointing. i did watch the ep but i was only half interested. it's okay though cause tomorrow the OC comes back and honestly that is all that matters. ha ha UM JUST KIDDING. i don't watch that garbage .... however i will watch skin. that show is actually pretty decent. ah good old fox ... their smut never seems to fail to entertain me (teardrop). and speaking of fox ... 24 IS THE BEST SHOW EVER. i know third season just started but man .... good stuff.   spinning:  nothing ... too lazy to put anything on.

      why are the fires so terrible. it breaks my heart. so sad. so freaky sad.  why is it so dark driving home at night now ... why oh why. boooo.  so i guess i should write about my trip to japan. so here it is in a nutshell, a long nutshell. got to japan at night and went to eat dinner at some random restaurant cause we had no idea where we were. it was nice but expensive. little was i to learn ... EVERYTHING IN JAPAN is expensive. the next morning got up and went to shinjuku which was a great way to see modern japan at its best. i went mad shopping there and i don't even really shop. they have these stores there called 100 yen shops which are equal to our 99 cent stores. they were pretty neat. i hit up a lot of random stores as well as tower and hmv. after that i took the subway to ginza which is the beverly hills of tokyo. there are tons and tons and tons and tons of fancy stories there like the Louis V. store, Hermes, and Gucci. really expensive stuff ... it was beautiful at night.   the next day we had a small half day tour which was cool cause they took us to the tokyo tower which is only a bit taller than the effiel tower, the imperial palace where the emperor and his family live although you only seen them twice a year - Jan 2 and Dec. 23, and the senso-ji temple in asakusa which had this interesting row where you could do random shopping. later that day we went to shibuya which is this totally youth oriented place ... very young and lots of teenagers. that was pretty interesting and of course more shopping was done.   the next day we went to harajuku which is a very young and trendy place. it reminded me a lot of melrose but the japanese version. ha ha. the best part of harajuku was SNOOPY TOWN. oh my gosh i love that place. how rad is that is, seriously now people. a whole store with all snoopy stuff .... so cute :) hee hee. we also went to akihabara but only for a bit. that is computer geek nerd central. everything you ever wanted for a computer or every thought about is there and more. sheesh.    the next day we didn't have time to really shop cause we were leaving for hong kong. it was raining the day we left which was funny cause the day we arrived it was raining as well but it never rained when we were actually there. i found that to be a blessing. we ate a lot of sushi and noodles in japan which tasted excellent but i must admit i'm a bit tired of it now. in addition, i had some asahi japanese beer which was very light but very tasty. i tried some of my mom's sake and i must admit i am not a fan. as for the japanese people .. man where do i even start. they are all very polite and friendly but they know VERY LITTLE english so sometimes it got hard to try to get around the city :(. ha ha oh well. the men ALL wear suits ... seriously ... they look like robots or something. ha ha. and the women are very femine and made up. nice outfits with a full face of make up and hair done. that was kinda of cool. as for the youth japanese kids ... they are a totally different breed. they are so into the western like hip hop, NY, brooklyn culture. it was pretty odd to see. the guys all dressed in backward baseball caps and baggy clothes while the girls had brown hair and like orange tan skin. some weird shite but the best part was how jacked up their teeth were ... ha ha wow ... that just blew my mind. cause i mean they would look all cute but then they would smile and it was like YIKES. hee hee.   moving on to hong kong ... man what can i say .... I LOVE HONG KONG. so very very much. not sure why and i know some people have expressed to me they did not enjoy HK and that's fine cause that is more hong kong for me to love :). yea we were there for two days and that mainly consisted of eating and shopping and more eating. the dim sum there puts mpk to freaking shame is all i have to say about that. the food there is soooo good. i'm sure a lot of you don't care too much about the HK so i won't go into detail but i'm slowing becoming a fob. (hanging my head in shame) i'm totally into the movies there. i got infernal affair on dvd there and i really wanted hero but it was not in the right dvd format. we are region 1 here and the uk and asia are region 3. i just love any movie tony leung is in though so go figure. okay better stop ... the fob is coming out of me. one thing i would like to note is the use of words there - bathroom = toilet, clubbing = disco and vacation = holiday. i love it. like you ask where the bathroom is they will give you a blank stare but if you say toilet they know exactly what you are talking about. and the disco part is SWEET. ha ha disco ... man that cracks me up.  hey dorkus melorkus you are going to love this .... so the day we were leaving they were having like an indie band festival in HK called rockit and guess who was playing on sat. ...... ELECTRIC EEL SHOCK .... awwwwwww yea. :) i loved that.

      one more thing i forgot to mention. went to the saves the day concert this past wednesday. as my friend and i were leaving, we noticed a table outside with a huge crowd around it. we thought it was another merch table until we passed by it and realized it was all the orange county kids picking up their studded belts that were being held by security. i mean, there were stacks and stacks of rolled up studded belts. ha. go figure.

      Wow, so today was my VERY first freak out breakdown in med school!! Congrats to me. As a result of my block-long procrastination I was completely overwhelmed w/ all the anatomy I have to learn in 5 days! My reason for procrastinating was b/c my professors sucked and I didn't want to study it b/c I didn't understand it or thought it was too much work. That is not, however, any kind of excuse b/c I could have learned it all on my own...which is exactly what I'm doing now. See how I sound very calm and relaxed? This was not the case 4 hours ago. At around 730 pm I had been reading a lecture for an hour...and was not retaining anything. I wanted to cry, I was frustrated and I still didn't know ANYTHING. Lesson learned: I cannot learn just by reading. I was too lazy to draw everything out. Solution: copy and paste diagrams from powerpoint onto word document and label that way. BAM! worked like a charm and now I'm thinking more like how I should, in the anatomy perspective and I am learning(hopefully). At least I feel like I'm getting good work in and thats' all that really matters. Another lesson learned: I MUST MUST pre-read and prep for anatomy lecture and lab the day before each lecture/lab. This is what they told me at the very beginning but I was sidetracked by the lack of organization/structure/GOOD TEACHING of this anatomy block. So now i know, NO MATTER WHAT, study for anatomy. And I knew this...which is why i was so frustrated with myself...but now i know it's doable b/c it only takes an hour an a half to 2 hours tops per lecture/lab. So I will do that next block.   listening to: Track 12 on the Michelle Branch album...i dunno what it's called but it has French in it.

      hey darth, funny how you couldn't figure out the line from the movie, and come right back with elliot smith who was nominated for the same movie it came from, good will hunting.    yeah vh1 i love the 80's series is probably the best thing vh1 has ever come up with.  it's just great t.v.  i like how it reminds me of some of my great childhood memories and the not so good ones as well.  has anyone really noticed though that all the cartoons and kid shows had some alterior message behind them.  these children's tv shows are what has corrupted us.  it's all about sex, sexual orientation, drugs and violence.  haha.  also in 1983, V the miniseries used to scare the crap out of me, i guess it had to do something with me being 4 years old at the time, but it brought back some bad memories.  i used to have nightmares about that show, damn you V.  oh yeah, and is october not the best sports month of the year?  honestly.....playoff and world series baseball, the middle of the NFL season, the beginning of the NBA and NHL seasons, just testacular.  well i don't watch the NHL, but the other 3 suffice for me.  awesome.

      With new wave away I have elected myself as dictator of the house, so you all better blog or i'll kick you out....haha.....  anyway i need some help i have this movie line stuck in my head and i can't seem to figure out where it is from, so if you know, please let me know:    "I will end you!!" Its seems to obvious but i can't seem to put my finger on it.   Everyone should be watching I love the 80s strikes back on VH1, i know mac is.....its more of the cheese we all grew up on and now seems really embarressing. I watch it sitting next to my computer so I can dl songs that they play clips of. I think i added about 20 songs to my collection last night. Plus you get to see all the cheesy tv shows and movies. Last night I got to relive fragle rock...how cool was that show...a bunh of hippie muppets who live in caves and get advice from a pile of trash...haha..simply classic.

      song in my depeche mode/new order mix:  "halo"    FOR THE CHEESE!   i cant believe ur arse is going to japan.  anyway, have fun.  oh yeah, and ask them how they feel about WWII ;-) let me see...columbus day was a'ight.  i ended up ditching my morning lectures (as usual), but i did go to my Contemporary Issues in Latino Health elective, 'cos attendance is mandatory, and i just like that class :D  sadly, i did not play DDR or watch pokemon :'( yesterday i finished reading "sarah" by j.t. leroy, it was a pretty good book.  i was amazed at how quickly i read it, it took like four days, i didnt think that was possible!  the reason i read it was 'cos garbage's "cherry lips (go! baby go!)" is based on the character "cherry vanilla".  anyway, it was a good read, and it gave me something to do besides study, and not feel guilty, 'cos at least i was reading. i really wanted to go out tonite, but 1) i slept for like 3 hours today, so i didnt think i should go (i should have studied instead)  and 2) i want to go to popscene, but i dont know anyone else here who likes britpop :'(  there were some peeps in my class going to a salsa dance thing, but i'm not into salsa, despite my latino-ness :-p  and i cant go out next week, 'cos our final is next week.  oh but then after that ITS ON!  i expect to get wasted on friday nite of next week.  its so funny to see the nerdiest of the nerds ("the queerest of the queer") of our class drink and dance.  good times, good times. well, im off to sleep.  i havent been to ANY morning lectures this week, and tomorrow i MUST go.  booooo! good nite all (or day, if u read this tomorrow) be safe FTC!  bring me back some sushi :)    music to groove to:  new order - "touched by the hand of god"

      wow darth you pulled that out of nowhere.  at the end of one of the back to the future's the newspaper said 2003 champions chicago cubs.  but that was wrong.  kinda sad, i wanted a cubs/yankees series, now it's going to be the marlins, and hopefully yankees.    so this past sunday and monday was a blast.  it started off in the morning when i went surfing, and an hour into some dude decides to drop into me and run the nose of his board straight into me.  the feeling of your hand and wrist going numb after a direct impact is great.  i thought i broke my arm again..........yes people it would have been the 3rd time if i had done it.  skimmy, darth, and new wave know about it.  haha.  anyways also getting hit in the tooth is really fun too, but since you are in too much pain, and trying to paddle back to shore with a gimp hand, it's not worth paying attention to.  anyways so i got back on shore and made a visit to the good ol ER.  yes it was as excellent as it sounds.  took them 2 hours to get me a room, so i was stoked.  anyways turns out i just have a bruised bone, which feels super sexy, even at this moment.    the next day i made a lovely visit to the dentist to check on my tooth, he took an x-ray, and said it looked ok.  but then he decided that i needed to do some scaling on my teeth.  what is that you may ask, it's pretty much cleaning them with the drill.  it sounds so good.  it feels even better.  so after he made my gums bleed he decides, hey look you have a small cavity lets drill it, and since it's small we don't have to administer novacaine.  yeah, it felt good when he finally drilled into it and hit the cavity.  oh yeah soooooo good.  i love the dentist.  i don't know why i don't visit more often it's not a painful or excruciating experience at all.  i think everyone in 742 evergreen terrace should take some time to go visit their local/family practitioner, it's just too fun to pass up.  i hope this upcoming weekend is as fun and festive as this past one, i have a basketball tournament so hopefully i can come out unscathed.  new wave and pigern, super fantastiche that you're going to tokyo.  it's awesome there, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.  hey and at least it's away from the good ol us of a.  and you're really traveling somewhere and not on some stupid weekend excursion that we pass off as vacations.  for me it feels as though the weekend excursions are more of a chore sometimes.  why am i still ranting?  get me off this thing.  one last word, kill bill is most excellent, or is that bill and ted's is most excellent?  oh no i'm right, kill bill is most excellent, please go watch it, and i'm not one to point out homosexuality in people, but if you're a guy and you don't like it, then i point at you.  the homage to all the different films is awesome.

      a couple of lines from the great american film Demolition Man:  Stallone: Hold it! The Schwarzenegger Library?  Bullock: Yes, the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Wasn't he an actor?  Stallone: Stop! He was President?  Bullock: Yes. Even though he was not born in this country, his popularity at the time caused the 61st Amendment...    -think about it

Stuck here at work right now, wish i were at home watching the red sox game right now. Got cable modem finally so if you have wondered, good gosh why is brad on for son long there is your answer. My cd burner isn't working right now which is pissing me off...darth mad!!! darth smash!!! haha......  okay well i guess that all for now....peace

      kill bill is a great movie!!! go watch it but be warned it is not for the faint of heart. there is A GRIP of violence and disturbing scenes and images. however it is still a very strong and entertaining movie. uma does a good job as does the rest of the cast. i can't wait for vol. 2 to come out.

      ok for the sports fans in the house...i RAREly take an interest in sports but this one caught my eye  the redhead and i were trying to figure out who we wanted to win the world series...because we liked the red sox and the cubs cuz they havne't won a WS in FOREVER.  in our thought process...at the time, we thought the cubs were just on a regular old losing streak....and we thougth the curse of the bambino is a cool curse and wanted to keep it going.  so we decided to go for the cubbies.  THEN i found out about the billy goat curse from my friend who is from chicago.  dork that i am, i did some research....  so i got the info on the cubbies.   the curse of billy the goat....billy the goat is/was(?) this famous pub/bar in chicago...the owner of the pub wanted to bring his goat into the game(world series 1945)...he bought a ticket for himself and the goat...and they were denied entrance.  so they escorted them out of the park and he cursed the cubs and wrigley field.  sooooo the strange thing i learned is...that the curse of the bambino....it TECHnically started in 1920 when the sox traded babe ruth to the yankees...but they haven't won a world series since 1918....if you do the math using 1918....the curse of the billy goat is on it's 58th year...while the curse of the bambino is in it's 85th year!! how crazy is that?!  yes i'm old AND i'm a dork!  :D

      almost time to go ... okay not really but soon it will be lunchtime, then a meeting and then home :) well except i'll be heading to the block to watch kill bill. man that movie looks so excellent. i read they use the same blood they used in hong kong movies. that is so great. much like hong kong films there is no story line but lots of violence. man i love my people :)  skimmy zo ... i would like to go to a game but i rather be there when darth and will are there so i can stare at amazement at HOW FRICKING MUCH THEY CAN TALK ABOUT SPORTS. wtf seriously. ha ha no lives. they just go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on .... well you get the picture and the whole time i'm stuffing my face with dodger dogs or in the case of basketball games just food.    japan in basically 6 days. OH YAY. i'm super duper hyped. the only bummer part is how short i will be there but to be fair at least i get to go so i can't really complain. i haven't really been thinking about it ... i guess cause i have things i need to do before i leave ... like find another J.O.B. ha ha. but yea i'll be more siked next week for sure, though i am dreading that plane ride. boooooooooooooooooo :(  oh mac the knife the guy that did ghettopoly is named david chang and you can e-mail him if you like. he might have been in GR. i would not be surprised. he sounds pretty cool for doing all this though. i like how there is a red neck one coming out ..... looking your way darth. ha ha just kidding.   spinning:  stupid girl - garbage ... oh yea ftc .... shirley is so awesome.

      okay so i just saw the royal tenenbaums extras dvd.  it has some cut scenes, trailers, etc.........all the good stuff that usually comes in the extras.  then i came across an extra called the peter bradley show.  apparently this guy is based in NY or something, but i think he may be the biggest tool ever, or worst interviewer ever.  i was watching him and just getting pissed off.  he asks the most asinine questions ever, what a dipshit.  i don't know if you guys know who larry merchant is, but he gives him some good competition on being a shitty interviewer.  maybe he fails to realize he sucks, or he's just a dick, but seriously people i think any one of us can do a better job than this guy.  i want to know if i'm the only one that feels this way, but can someone watch it and let me know if i'm being out of line, or if someone has already seen it let me know.  either way, it won't change my mind though.    and may i say, ghettopoly is probably one of the wrongest games ever made.  although i do like the basketball piece.  someone told me that the creator of the game is some famous underground artist, and he was featured in Giant Robot magazine.  but i maybe wrong.    have a good weekend all.  i know i will.  KILL BILL!  yeah....

I can't wait for the other editions he is working on.   Skimmy, I woudl be down to go to the game, but there is only one problem nov. 27 is thanksgiving and I will more than likely have some white family stuff to do. sorry..pick a different game to go to so that I can read up on all the basketball news, fantasy football, offseason baseball moves etc to discuss with will. hahaha

      sorry dorkus but i too am in shock you haven't seen the "i'm so excited episode".  they sing that cool song..."put your mind to it go for it, get down a break a sweat, rock and roll you ain't seen nothing yet."  it's a very inspirational song.  much better then when kelly, brenda, donna and that one crazy girl that liked brandon sang the one oldies song for the talent show.  mac, thanks and  i am very excited about zo's return!  people at work always give me a hard time about it, especially since my fantasy basketball team name is "mourning glory".  get it?  cheese . . . i know.  by the way, nets vs. clippers on november 27th.  if anyone's interested in going let me know.  =)  darth and new wave, no pressure but we can go again like last year.  darth, i'll tell billy to go too so you and him go talk on and on and on and on and on about sports....and on and on and on and on......

      dorkus you can submit your resignation from this house as I don't think I can be associated with someone who hasn't seen THEE episode of saved by the bell, that defines how great the show was. Find someone who has the dvd series and sit down and watch jesse in all of her glory. Do that and then maybe you can stay

      first off mac you are way lamer than me cause you know 90210 crap and sbtb crap...i only know the latter....but then again you scored a 1502 on your SAT much like zack did..haha  yeah as i was talking to mac yesterday arnold started speaking and i began to laugh uncontrolably as it finally hit me....oh crap he is our governor!!! It was like a big shock to the system, but at least I can where my governator shirt with pride (yes i do have one). What shocked me more than anything about this election is that for some reason 12000 people found in necessary to vote for gary coleman!!! seriously i expected maybe a couple hundred, but twelve thousand!!! c'mon now!!!

      wow, so he really did it, i was sitting at home yesterday night watching his victory speech and i was just in awe and amazement, john kimble, mr. freeze, conan etc.... is our governor.  darth called me a little later around that time and i think it hit him too, we just started laughing.  he is our governor.  well let's hope he does a good job.  now on to a more serious matter, haha, first off i don't know wheter to thank skimmy and hedwig, or to hang my head in shame.  and skimmy, i'm sure you're glad that Zo is back and he's actually healthy, as he too was once my favorite player in the League.  but what's this about 90210 being better than the best show ever Saved by the Bell?  i'm hurt.  i don't know what to say.  i'm dumbfounded.  haha.  this is more of a shock than when Scott shot himself while saying "hey David look at me!"  or when Donna couldn't graduate and all of her supporters came out with "Donna Martin Graduate!"  or when Kelly slept with Steve as we all found out when they were playing Skeletons in the Closet.  and seriously in a race i think that Brandon would get smoked by Running Zack.  so let's end this madness about 90210 being better than SBTB and just like David Silver once did, lets "Squash It!"  haha, i'm jk..  alright i'm the lamest person ever, right guys?  i'm so sorry.....so so sorry......hello?

      well arnold is our new governor ... the people got what they wanted. i understand why they voted the way they did but i'm not sure how much will change or improve. eh ... i did my part and voted but i guess it didn't matter all that much. ha ha but that won't stop me from voting. oh and if anyone in this house did not vote then you have no right to complain about ANYTHING that happens to our state.   as for the saved by the bell banter ... sad mac and darth ... and may i add super duper LAME ... YOU GUYS ARE L-A-M-E. ha ha. but seriously this election has been on everyone's mind ... like that one ep where zack ran against jesse for student council president cause he wanted that trip to washington d.c. (ha ha sorry darth beat you to it). and skimmy zo ... i  loved the early eps of 90210. it got pretty bad later on. like when donna's crazed boyfriend was all stalking her but i guess not as crazy as when emily set the homecoming float on fire cause she was mad crazy over brendon. see this is why nick edney needs to be back in the house.  i had other things to blog about but i'll do it later.    spinning:  in my head - psychedelic furs ... i'm so into them now ... :)

      WOW....for arnold becoming the new governor of california and for darth and mac's great ability to recall every single saved by the bell episode.  so did you guys get the dvd?  i loved saved by the bell, but what about 90210?  you have to admit that 90210 was better then saved by the bell???

      my friends used to wash mr. b's  car at the acura dealer in pasadena as well, but dinner, whew, that's something special.  that caught me by surprise, much like jesse's right cross that connected with her half brother.  kind of strange how so many people bump or know mr. b, almost as strange as when screech could be heard letting out a radio transmission through his mouth.  now that was an odd time wasn't it?  i guess it's not as odd as when zack and kelly had to have screech be their kid when they had to pretend to be married though.  i so wish i could get out of work right now though, work is no fun.  i want to come up with a hair brained scheme, maybe i'll invent a zit creme that can get rid of zits, like how zack sold that formula to everyone at bayside after they used it on crater face, so they could use him as a spokesmodel.  yep....darth is right............really long time.  hahaha.

      wow having dinner with mr. belding does sound pretty exciting, but not nearly as exciting as when jonny dakota came to bayside for an anti drug commercial....or when  bayside discovered that there was oil under the football field and they would soon be the richest school in the valley....haha....yep i'm lame too mac....haha see me and mac can go at this for a really long time, much like the prank war between valley and bayside high schools.....it was so mean how they stole screech.

      okay for all you saved by the bell freaks out there... the messenger at my office has weekly drinks with mr. belding aka daniel. he told me mr. belding is still popular with the ladies. ha. and ewww... mac - if my office starts enforcing those lame cover sheets on my TPS reports, i'll be pissed. ha. skimmy - your coworker is an idiot. first-class. hope everyone votes tomorrow. your opinion matters and participation is important! i am waking up early early to vote before lame old work. i really despise my j-o-b. bleh.

      Funny story .... my co-worker came in sad because she said her car was stolen parked in front of her street on Friday.  Her boyfriend picked her up from work on Friday and took her home on Saturday morning so she was expecting her car to be parked in front.  So she called the Sheriff, filed a police report and all the stuff you do when a car is stolen.  One of my other co-workers asked her to check the garage.  Well, she checked down in the garage and found her car!  How brilliant is that?

      Alright so i'm sitting here at work checking out the site when all of a sudden Darth has put me into this predicament of whether or not to reblog.  Guess what I choose.  So like Screech vs. the Russian Chess guy, I will have to put the Spatzki Bishop block on you.  Yes I know he is his uncle, but his aunt has bigger moustache.  So what up now?  Or better yet I will reverse it like the time when Zack yelled out, "Do the move you did at the MAX!!"  So now it's on you sucka!  Haha, damn i'm lame.    On a different note, Darth sounds like you had an awesome weekend of doing............  My weekend was spent surfing once again.  Nice swell moved in along the coast so I took advantage of it by getting crushed under waves, I guess I should have gone to Surf University to party with Zack and Mr. B, then I wouldn't have got crushed, like when Kelly broke up with Zack to go out with the manager from the Max.  The rest of the time was spent sleeping, eating, and hanging out.  I was supposed to go to a club for my friend's birthday as well, but really it is not my scene, and I am not a big fan of clubs/clubbing.  No way I was going unless it was to the Attic, but it wasn't, oh well...   The best part of my weekend was today though.  I love coming into work on a Monday morning to a pile of papers that is about a foot and a half high.  No joke.  Then I love having to work.  Sounds like I have a case of the Mondays.  If they start making me put cover sheets on TPS reports i'm going to peace out.  Oh yeah one more thing GO YANKEES!!!!!

      whereas dorkus's weekend was a fun filled adventure mine was quite the opposite. I had a nice friday off...yes i can sense all of you rolling your eyes at me....where i did nothing, absolutely nothing and it was everything i thought it would be and more!!! I did see the Rundown, which was entertaining hollywood fluff and nothing more. Saturday I yet again did nothing, all day until my brother came by with football tix to the Washington vs. the University of children with less ambition. It was good for a while, but once the washington gave up the lead we left. From there i went home to do nothing....sunday was another great day of nothing, actually a great day of sports.....all day long sports..it was great...although i'm still pissed at denver for losing a game they should have won.   Mac your saved by the bell blog was quite wrong.....like really really wrong, i'm talking wrong like when zack dressed up as a girl to give screech self esteem wrong. I'm talking wrong like when lisa overcharged her dad credit card and had to sell all her clothes wrong....haha....beat that!!!!  Tomorrow is election day and I hope you all rush out there and vote. Along with the recall vote there are also two props. you should look at.  I got a call from Arnold yesterday!! that made my afternoon, even though i'm not voting for him, how cool is it to pick up and hear: "Hello, this is Arnold Schwarzenegger, candidate for governer of california....on this tuesday oct. 7.....etc" it was great!!!  currently listening to Radiohead: A wolf at the Door.

      okay so i had a pretty busy show weekend. thursday night saw the raveonettes w/ new wave. great show, tepid response from audience. but what i really want to mention was how GAWDAWFUL one of the opening bands was, and i'm pretty sure new wave would agree although i did have to slap her hands when she was politely clapping after one of their songs (i was surprised she was clapping bc well, it's new wave, and we all know how she is w/ new music.) anyway, i think there are different levels of suck, especially when it comes to opening bands. this group, Kittens for Christian, fell into the "worst band ever in musical history, so much that it's making my ears bleed" category. really. the lead "singer" decided to mumble, whine, and wail his way through the entire set, and i didn't understand a single thing he said. i'm not exaggerrating either. from far, they sounded even worse, like they needed to be put out of their misery. or maybe it's us who needs to be put out of our misery. so yeah, if you want to punish yourself for being bad, or if you need to repent your sins, go see them. and you will be sure never to do a bad thing in your life.....(just for kicks, i got one of their CD samplers so i can play them for my friends so their ears too can bleed. it's all about evenly distributing the pain.)  friday night was beulah at the troub, and i can't even describe how much i love them and how great the show was. it was a pretty long set, and they played to a packed (very enthusiastic) house. it was so so great. i don't know, if it's possible, i think i'm in love with them.  saturday night, dressy bessy at spaceland. pretty good show. afterwards, a group called Electric Eel Shock from Tokyo performed. they were totally energetic and funny and so japanese!! man, can't wait until i get the chance to go to Tokyo.   yeah, that's pretty much it. waiting for belle and sebastian and deathcab releases on tuesday. yahooey.

      In with: Hot Sundae - Go For It!  Okay so this is an anomaly, but I am blogging again, because I was inspired.  First off to answer Hedwig's question, Dennis Haskins is and always will be Mr. "Big Bopper" Belding.  Next t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y dude all I can say is good luck on your exam and practical, but don't be scared, don't be scared, remember the time when Zach and Jesse went to go watch E.T. late at night and they were riding back on their bikes, they were scared, they got through it, just like you will, i'm sure!  Haha.  Oh and seeing as how you two are in med school, it makes me sad to sit here in my office staring at the computer screen as I am typing this.  Next year i'm moving to Korea to work for a year out there, and hopefully I won't be sitting in an office staring at a computer.  Traveling here I come baby!

      hey all.  so i'm sick and getting more and more behind in med school.  i think i'm going on borderline depression...blah.  maybe i'm just being a baby and should just tell myself to get my ass in gear....which is what i was trying to do yesterday but BAM i got sick and i couldn't focus for shit.  and i'm still sick...and will prolly be sick for the weekend.  but i feel guilty b/c i should study but all i want to do is go spend time w/ the red head and my family and not have to worry about anything except that.  and it's just not med school that is giving me stress...my mom's bf had a triple bypass last week and he's still in the hospital and no one is really sure what's gonna happen.  so my mom is worrying me b/c she's all stressed out and that is looming in the back of my head--which is why i wanna spend time w/ my family.  the redhead and i are still trying to heal from the whole break up and things of that nature and THAT's stressful b/c we only see each other on weekends...which is why i wanna spend time with him.  so i try to prioritize my life but it's hard when 3 of my top priorities are not exactly in the best shape possible.  yeah med school should be my top priority....but my personal life is important to...prolly much more important to me than my career.  I mean i kno i'll bounce back but man i'm behind!!  sorry for the random venting...but i needed to do it.  i SHOULD be in class right now...but i didn't feel like going....what i really want to do is just stay in my room all day.  :listening to: traffic report on star 98.7

      i should be asleep but hey tomorrow is friday and i'll just sleep at work ... hee hee. okay so saw the raveonettes tonight and they were great but what is with the lackluster crowd .... geez. booooooooooooo to them. but i guess the reason for the blog (thanks to dorkus's idea) is what i saw people wearing. my gosh the 80's are so back in full force. i know i know it has been going on for awhile but yikes. what drives these people to walk into a store and pull up a shirt that they know is trendy and all in fashion and think "hey if i put this on i'll be original and different", when in reality EVERYONE HAS IT. wtf. seriously people. i like how in this one article i read ... mos def and david bowie talked about how fashion and pretty much music are basically force fed down the throat's of people. think about ... MTV, Urban Outfitters, Hot Topic, InStyle, US Weekly or People, and so on all dictate how you should dress, what to wear, what is in, what is out, what to listen to, how to conform ... dang it people conform ... DO IT NOW is what these places are screaming which is sad. well i say enough but what do i know ... i'm just one of those ugly freak girls off to the side judging, mocking and scoffing and i guess in a way if these people did stop then what would i have to blog about.   spinning:  nothing .... it is late and i need sleep.  p.s. ....... yay FTC blogged :) ..... good luck on that test today okay ... i'm sure you will do fine and that garbage t-shirt will help you.

      playing on tha laptop in the library, comin thru the headphones:  garbage's cover of the ramone's "i just wanna have something to do"   ok, so i didnt get a threat, per se, but i did get a request from new wave to blog.  furthermore, i am at the ucsf library (ive been here everyday/-nite since friday, until they close) and i need a break.  i just finished reviewing my notes for blood cells and will begin reviewing the heart shortly, and i just needed something to do (hey, like the song im listening to!). so yeah, school is cool.  ive become one of those nerds that i always made fun of, you know, the ones that are in the library every day...how sad.  well, i have an exam & a lab practical tomorrow.  and since our curriculum is integrated, they cover EVERYTHING:  histology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell biology, and all that other good stuff.  its like MCAT madness all over again, the exam + practical are scheduled for a total of SIX hours!  oh well, what are u gonna do? anyways, looking beyond that, some classmates and i have decided that we need to make up for lost partying time that we invested at the library.  so we're drinking friday nite, and saturday nite: of course drinking, but i also want to go to polly esther's, which is supposed to play 80s (and i think 70s, hence the "polyester" reference).  but we'll see what happens, as my ex-roommate would say, who, by the way, called me randomly on saturday nite as i was in the basement of some bar here in SF, he was apparently in vegas with my other ex-roommate, darth.  dude, do u guys live there or something?!  i hope ya'll had fun.  now u might be thinking "how did he go out on saturday if he was in the library?"  but, fyi, the library closed at 8 on saturday, but was that enough?? apparently not for my study-mates, for we payed a visit to the anatomy lab afterwards, and at 9:30, i had to say that was enough, and i met up with a homie i met on the EAP program in spain, he is at davis med now.  then i took the nite owl bus home at 2:30 am,  fun times. ok, i guess that takes up my "study break" time. btw, i will be wearing my lucky garbage t-shirt tomorrow, so that i may pass my exams (we are on Pass/No Pass - or as the 2nd years say:  "Pass now/Pass later" - system)  after all, remember people:  P = M.D.,  oh yeah! oh yeah, and: FTC!!!!!! :p   music to return to studying:   peaches - "Fuck the Pain Away [Kid606 Going Back to Bali Remix]"  p.s., i kinda wanna go see peaches here on 10/24, but i dont know anyone else who likes her, guess she's too hardcore for peeps around here :'( p.s. part II:  hedwig, i think i remember punky saying that her parents deliberately named her after the sun and moon, and i also think her name has three parts: soleil moon frye, or something like that.  but yeah, i always thought her name was weird.   remember when she was on saved by the bell??  and speaking of saved by the bell: "no time?!  theres NEVER any time!  im never gonna pass geometry, im never gonna get into stansbury!  i'm so excited!  im so excited!   im so......scared!"

      i think i should blog, new wave gave me a semi threat, and asked why i haven't blogged in sometime, and dorkus you just reminded me.  haha.  so i'm in the midst of watching batman the movie.  it's so good, then they just got worse and worse.  except for mr. freeze cause he's haauugght!  but yeah, it's kind of nostalgic watching it, cause i haven't seen it in such a long time.  i forgot the quote "have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?"  i don't know why, but i think it's cool.  i have been in a funk lately, but now am out of it, i feel much better about things, and am ready to enjoy my life once again.  i think i just let too many little things bother me, but now that i've gotten them out of the way, i hope it's clear sailing from here on out.  yeah yeah, i know, right?  haha.  oh well, wishful thinking.  which reminds me, better go check the lottery numbers.  i hope, i hope, i won!  haha.  if that's the case, then house, drinks on me!

      how come no one's blogging?? i sound like new wave. no, if i really sounded like new wave, i'd throw in a death threat of some sort.    okay, i was wandering through borders the other day and noticed a new book that was being showcased. get this, it's called...."The Dewey Decimal System of Love" about a librarian who finds someone to light her loins on fire or something. The review on the front cover said, "If you love books and sex (in no particular order) this book's for you!" So New Wave, you know what you'll be getting for Christmas.   listening to: Beverly Hills Teens theme song (greatest cartoon ever)

      hello house.  the eve before the holiday season is upon us, and traffic is going to be sooo much fun today.  i'm so excited in a jesse spano kind of way.  skimmy, zo is no longer a part of the NBA as i'm sure you know, and it saddens me.  he was my favorite player as well at one point.  there's nothing wrong with country music, as a portion of the r&b stuff out there are covers of older country songs.  don't turn this house into a "everything, but country" place.  haha.  i just found out i get to leave in 10 minutes.  woo hoo.  hurrah for me.  now i get to drive up through sd traffic, into oc traffic, and finally into la traffic.  i think it's gonna be the time of my life.  new wave hopefully you ease in so enough, so that you can Cure your work place anxiety a bit.  rich girls sounds great, but i'm really looking forward to the paris hilton reality show, i'm sure she's just as dumb if not dumber.  i heard they're going to turn it into a porn show, oh wait.....wrong thing.  hahaha.

      has anyone seen the show 'rich girls' on mtv? i watched the idiot box because hey, it's hard to read when germy and congested. and these girls are fascinating in a sick, sad way. case in point, they talk about cargo pants and are like, "yeah, i mean cargos to me are like cute with stiletto heels and a cute top but people in the midwest wear them because they have lots of pockets. because they need the pockets when they are out in the field." ((scoff)) see, it's fascinating because they are so out of touch.

      Hedwig...why are you wasting a good blank CD by copying COUNTRY music?  Might as well put it into a microwave and hit the "easy minute" button.  But if you must burn country music, I would probably pick songs from the late Johnny Cash.       In- Rancid "and out come the wolves..."

      new wave, that is really nice that you took your mom to see the simon and garfunkel.  okay, so i just have to mention that besides you guys, everyone on myspace.com is a F*CKING LOSER. pardon my french, but not really. in one day, i received 20 messages from people who wanted to add me as their friend. look, you idiot, i don't know you, so why would i add you as a friend? also, i just love how no one knows how to spell (ex: "your hott") and how their friends consist of slutty porn star asian girls. what do you take me for??? i wanted to take my picture off, but then new wave is forcing me to keep my picture on so that we can be entertained by their dumb and corny messages. another example, "I liked your profile because it's different and not very cheesy. You seem like someone that doesn't fit into the norm, perhaps somewhat like myself. Drop me a message sometime." yeah right, you f*cking f*ck. sorry, i'm in a cussing mood lady, even though i know it's not very ladylike. all right, i'll stop venting now.

      mission accomplished.  i actually studied well tonight.  i didn't get all freaked out about anatomy...i just studied.  it was weird...i had this odd sense of calm.  well hopefully it keeps going this way for anatomy.  I want to go over some stuff tomorrow in lab so i think i'm gonna do that after we dissect.  i don't have many interesting thoughts to blog about.  The thought Christmas shopping is freaking me out.  I don't get out of school until Dec 19 and that's mad crazy test time for me.  So what am I gonna do?  I'm scared hehe.  What if I have to spend the 20-23 shopping in the madness of last-minute shoppers....with nothing left but the crap that nobody wanted to buy.  Ok i'm over-exaggerating that a bit....maybe this will be an internet gift year...I'm with Darth.

      i haven't been blogging just cause i have been sick and really haven't done anything worth talking about. Caught a nasty cold on monday and have been chilling since then, didn't get my wisdom teeth pulled out on friday because of it, so i'm kinda happy about that, but they have been hurting so i kinda want them out.   Christams is slowly approaching and its quite scary. Don't want to wait until the last minute to shop, but then again i don't want to shop at all so I really don't know what to do. I'm hoping for a nice ebay/online shopping experience this year. haha  Saw elf, its great i highly recommend it to you all. Matrix is okay, better than reloaded but not great. Also I was watching blackhawk down and if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it, its really good.....looking your ways new wave and mac. lotr special edition comes out tomorrow, gotta go pick that up. wait harry potter is in book form now? haaha....jk just never read any of them...which is nice when the movies come out cause i don't know what gonna happen.  someone wished me a happy monday today...thought i'd share that.   Random thoughts as I blog: My room is messy, i don't want to go to work, i have lots to do at work, fox makes bad shows, need to save more money, mr potato head seems happy, the broncos are gonna start rolling with the snake back, dodgers need to makes some offseason moves on and off the field, i want to rearrange my room, tori amos is soo good, usc better kill ucla and michigan better kill ohio state.  okay i guess thats enough randomness for me.   currently listening to: tupac "runnin (dying to live)

ROBERT SMITH  to be fair hedwig i have not been blogging as well, so i need to yell at myself. so has anyone finished their christmas shopping yet. my goal is to have everything done by dec. 1.   so this weekend i had to go to the block for my friend's b-day. I HATE THE BLOCK SO MUCH. it is bad enough i work in that gosh awful county but you make me go back there on a non work day. WTF ... SERIOUSLY WTF. ha ha. i really hate the block though .... (violently vomiting).  i'm so far behind on the whole harry potter thing. i'm still trying to crack open book 3 .. i know i know i'm lame. you can shake your fist at me later hedwig, dorkus and rancid girl. as for coworkers and the too much information bit ... i'm still a big fan of the sign in the front door of every office that reads ... WE DON'T CARE. SERIOUSLY WE DON'T CARE. that can work on so many levels by the way. ha ha. i dread mondays because that gives blockhead coworkers a whole fu*king weekend to come up with some asinine and tiresome tale about their less than interesting lives. UGH.  so lately i've been really really into dune. man the movie is good. i watched the 1984 verision as well as the sci-fi channel mini tv series. in addition, i'm getting the children of dune soon so i can watch that. soooooooooooooo goood. i also bought the book so hopefully if i can plow through lord of the rings (again) i can start dune :)  oh and dorkus ... the obsCURE band you mentioned. i'm not sure who it could be ... maybe THE CURE THE GREATEST BAND EVER AND EVER AND FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER :)   spinning:  watching me fall - the cure live in chicago

      hey pigern, thanks! i was telling new wave that if i put up a friendster pic of me wearing my glasses, no one would recognize me (clark kent style). but i guess that's not the case.  anyway, saw deathcab as well this weekend at the glass house. (insert BOOOOO here.) i hate the glass house. it sucks ass. AND some super tall guy stood right in front of me, and i got all bitchy at him and told him i was standing there for almost 2 hours so he needs to move. (he did.) don't tall people realize they can stand at the back of the room and still see? they don't need to stand in front of short people!!!! moving on, deathcab was awesome. too bad the crowd was lame. not a single person was dancing or even moving. it was like they were zombies i swear. but man deathcab was good. and they even played Love Song by some obscure 80's band I'd never heard of. by some sucky band called the cure. haha.   listening to: the sound of settling

      yes pigern i totally agree!  there are some people at work that tell you way too much information about their personal life.  at least your coworker doesn't talk about her sex life.  i have one coworker that tells me EVERYTHING or everyone she does during the weekend.  why are "bradleys" so um...what's the word, "friendly"?  just kidding, kind of.

      do any of you have those coworkers that impart too much detail regarding their personal lives? and expect the same from you? a new girl came in for an asst. position and she told us all about her background, her boyfriend, her life during lunch. then (as she is from out of town), she asked if everyone around the table could tell her why they moved to l.a. and what their goals are. wait, did i join a therapy session? too much information. anyway. people are weird.

      In with: Alkaline Trio - Cringe  Rain rain go away.  I was watching Fuse the other day, and they were showing videos of bands.  What's wrong with them, I know they all sound alike, but why do they have to dress alike, and look alike?  Whatever happened to originality.  I swear I was watching one group, and I walked away, came back after a while, and I was thinking, damn this is a long song, cause I thought it was the same video.  I was wrong.  On that note, I listened to the new Blink album, the prototype for all these craptacular bands.  It's a different sound, but nothing compares to the Cheshire Cat album.  I'm just bitter because i've been searching for a new sound, but all I get is the same ole shite.  Christmas is upon us.  Rad.  This is the best time of the year, cause even assholes sometimes are in the spirit of the holidays and it's just a pleasant time, well with one big exception.  Christmas shopping is the worst thing ever, I don't care if it be at the mall or regular stores, such as Best Buy, which is my haven, but the lines and people just suck in those areas.  Hopefully I will be done with it before the big rush begins.  Oh well good luck to you all, if you have to participate in the activities.

      WHY IS NO ONE BLOGGING ..... eh oh well. i guess everyone will just have to hear me ramble.  you are right dorkus, gg is pretty bad this season. what gives. i thought today's ep was ooookay at best ... two weeks ago was really bad. where is the drama .... on the other hand - 24 WAS GREAT. beyond excellent. you think something is going to happen and then it doesn't and then something else does. i love the drama but of course there are a few problems. i don't really care for the kim and chase or palmer and his presidency storylines because they lag.   in non tv related news everyone should go see elf. can you say FUNNY. great stuff. also, if anyone has the time check out the office season one on dvd. it is this bbc brit comedy about  ... well you guessed it the office. it isn't down right blow your mind funny like scrubs (love that show) but it is pretty entertaining and if you work in a office, like myself, i think you can appreicate where it is coming from.   spinning:  nothing ... going to go read now :)

      hey house, i had a random idea for the chatterbox.  new wave, sluts and darth remember that song game we used to play at good ol' E2E?? or in class haha.  basically the point of the game is to give lyrics to a song...the next person has to give lyrics to a song that contains a word or phrase from the last song lyrics given.  for example:  show me show me show me - The Cure next person.... ME myself and i- Easy E  so capitalize the word/phrase you took from the last song.  sorry guys i'm bored BUT should be studying...i'll put a song up and if no one plays then i'll get the picture ;)  i'm pretty sharp like that.    listening to: KZLA 93.9 YES country station!! haha go white ppl

      I'm sitting here at work, with a little over an hour to go, so I decided to kill it not working.  This is kind of late, but my view on trendy LA, is pretty much on par with New Wave's.  Bunch of fake people trying to impress other fake people, who think they are more important than others because they know someone that knows someone.  At least wearing sunglasses at night is cool, right?    I'm going to London for New Year's, i'm stoked.  Any suggestions on what I can do out there would be appreciated.  On another note it's November, that means snowboarding season is upon me again, i've been itching to get out there, sweet.  I have mixed feelings about it right now though, if it rains it kills the surf, but brings the snow.  So I don't know how to feel.  Especially cause surfing is free and I don't have to drive as far, but oh well.  I hope the pow pow is gnar gnar this year.  Haha, I hate when bros say that.    Darth is coming down this weekend to SD.  Should be good times once again, gonna go play some hold'em, and hopefully come out with some cash.  Probably not, but I can dream right?  Sorry I just rambled through this and wasn't really thinking while I was typing, I just wanted to kill time.  One last note, the Lakers are kind of good this season, I usually don't like them, but this year is an exception.  And no no, i'm not bandwagoning.  One final note, Kobe's tattoo is why people who get tats for stupid reasons, or just to have one to have one, should not get them.  Have a good weekend, and Godspeed.

      tears of joy ... tears of joy :) ......   AT LAST THE BOXSET!  FIRST THE PUFF... THE CURE: JOIN THE DOTS: B-SIDES AND RARITIES, 1978-2001 (THE FICTION YEARS) Offers Fans First-Ever Collection of Hard-To-Find Gems Career-Spanning Four-Disc Set In Stores January 13, 2004 As The Cure nears its third decade at the forefront of pop culture, Universal, Rhino and Fiction/Elektra are celebrating the band's remarkable career with THE CURE: JOIN THE DOTS: B-SIDES AND RARITIES, 1978-2001 (THE FICTION YEARS), a spectacular four-disc treasury of hard-to-find gems, never-before-seen photos, track by track breakdowns and extensive liner notes. "The first thing I ever did when I got a new single," remembers Cure vocalist Robert Smith, "was flip it over and play the other side. I always hoped the B-side would give me another version of the artist, something as good as the A-side but somehow different. I expected great B-sides from the artists I loved... " Come 1978, when The Cure released their debut single, 'Killing An Arab,' Smith expected no less from himself than he had from his heroes. It's evident from the very first cut in this box set, '10:15 Saturday Night,' that he intended Cure B-sides to be every bit as captivating as their better-known A-sides. Among the 70 original and digitally re-mastered recordings included on  JOIN THE DOTS are 'Another Journey By Train' (b-side of 'A Forest'), 'Sugar Girl' (b-side of 'Just Like Heaven'), 'Halo' (b-side of 'Friday I'm In Love'), a cover of David Bowie's 'Young Americans' and many, many more.

      i guess i'll blog basically cause i'm bored......for starters i'm sorry to shock you hedwig but i too have not seen the fish movie....not that much interest on my part. Not a big pixar fan for starters, and second....its about fish......thats not as bad as not seeing THE EPISODE OF SAVED BY THE BELL. lets see looking forward to another fun darth and mac in san diego weekend. most likely i'll be practicing my texas hold-em skills, which i have none..haha...by the way all i'm now on day #40 of being sober....its been a long 40 days..haha...matrix 3 just came out and i haven't hear any good reviews of it, which is kinda sad cause of the franchise behind it, but at the same time it had two things going against it in my opinion. 1) too close to part 2, not enought time for some hype to be built up and 2) it has keanu....and thats a really big thing to overcome....haha....getting all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled next friday....i'm so looking forward to that...i mean being in pain for my entire weekend!!! how cool is that!!! haha, i'm just hoping for some good drugs afterwards. bowling night, lets all hope for a 600 series for me!!!!

      yes, there are some parts of l.a. that are okay, and some parts that i actually like..but to clarify, it's the people of l.a. that SUCK. too many people trying too hard to look cool. and they don't even realize how lame they are. and if you think you're cool or if you aspire to be cool by pairing up your $50 jet rag poor man's t shirt with your unkempt "cool" hair as you suck down a latte and decide on which show you're going to next just because everybody else is going, then you suck. haha.   like new wave says, baaaa baaa goes the sheep....

      I think LA is ok....but everyone seems so fake and it's all about who YOU know.  For example, I have a friend who likes to party in LA.....she goes out like 4 nights a week and then complains that she's always broke.  And when I asked her why she goes out eventhough she's broke, her reply is "I have to get to know the promoter so she'll recognize me."   I say...who the F*ck cares about getting recognized by the promoters??  Anyway, it's so cold lately....granted it is November, but it's California.

      this weekend i went to la with pigern and was utterly disgusted. first stop was the sawtalle area where Giant Robot store one and two are. i like GR a lot but i realized half the stuff they sell there is the stuff i saw in japan. ha ha. and i found it odd a lot of white people shop there, like a lot. it was just strange cause you know they are thinking "oh look, nice novelity oriental crap to put in my million dollar home even though i have no idea what it means and i'm just buying it for the sheer fact of its oriental value." one good thing was i got to try crepe to go, this place that eric has been raving about. it was actually quite tasty but i think i ate it too fast cause i got a small tummyache.   next stop was jetrag on la brea. oh my goodness that store so irks me beyond belief. grrrrr. so let me get this straight, they sell poor homeless man clothing for 50 bucks a pop. WTF PEOPLE ... SERIOUSLY W-T-F. i don't care if it is "trendy" or "vintage" or whatevers. it is an entire store devoted to being cool without actually being cool cause that would be not cool if people knew you were suppose to be cool. i could  not stand being in there so i went outside where i sat on a .... A BENCH until pigern was done. it was funny cause while sitting there i heard a guy and girl talking next to me in japanese. so feeling bold and slightly bored i asked if they were from japan. they said yup. apparently they were in the states studying english at some school in sd. they come up to la to hang out and shop cause they like stores like jetrag. yea so i talked to them for all of 5 mins. that was neat.   last stop for the day was melrose. i actually really like melrose cause there are some good random shops there that spark my interest. however, they have changed some of the stores there, which kinda of sucks. in conclusion ... I HATE "TRENDY" LA.  on another note everyone should go see love actually and shattered glass. both very good movies but in different ways. love actually is more for girls but shattered glass is just more a thinking movie or it gets you wondering.   spinning:  pernice brothers - not sure what track but i can't wait to see them next month :)

      hello everyone, it's november.....this year is going by fast, once again, like every year is.  what do i have to show for it?  not much.  i still have 2 months to do something that will change the face of this world this year......haha.  halloween was cool, i didn't celebrate it in the traditional sense, i actually ended up helping organize and work at my girlfriend's fair at church for their preschool and kindergarteners.  it was fun and rewarding in its own way. this weekend i saw snoop dogg yesterday as well.  he was playing in a basketball game right before mine in the same league.  so when after his game was over, and his team was clearing the bench for my team, he walked past me and i said what's up snoop, and he said what's up homie, then we pounded fists.  haha, it was pretty cool to bump into him i guess so randomly.  oh well.  i think it would have been better if it was heavy d.

      Hello house, MERRY CHRISTMAS AND TO ALL A GOOD AFTERNOON....??  It's Christmas day and it's raining, "so don't forget to bring a towel," kind of puts a damper on things, but hey, we're here to celebrate Jesus' birth.  Anyways anybody get some cool presents?  I mean i'm sure nothing is as cool as the du rag because really I don't think that's easy to top, well actually one year I did receive a very special Steve Urkel Board Game, thanks Darth....haha.  I'm kind of late on the LOTR thing, but yeah it was cool, I wish they had an epilogue part for Gimli, and his kind.  Oh well, maybe the extended version will have something.  I'll rant and rave as well so here we go.  Rave:  London baby! going tomorrow for a week (plus the Married with Children, the one where they go to Lower/Upper Uncton was on yesterday, got me excited!), My week and a half off of work, Christmas time, rest and relaxation.  Rant:  Nothing really, I guess the only thing is having to go back to work, knowing there's going to be a big pile of crap for me to do.  Oh well, i'm going to enjoy my time.  Piece on Earth, did I spell that right?

Thanks again to mac for getting me my sweet du rag which i am currently sporting at work for a couple of minutes. Hedwig, it looks similar to the condom hat the red hed wore.....haha.....so i'm stuck at work today until they decide that i can go home...man thats never going to come. Anyway i'm doing stupid tasks to occupy my time..yes the office just gave us a christmas game to play....wow..thanks.....haha......yes lotr rocked!! it was really good and anyone who at least doesn't give peter jackson directing props is a moron. thats just my opinion. are there any other movies worth going to watch right now? Here is a quick rant and rave section: Rave: Broncos in the playoffs, finished shopping, good meals for the next 2 days, going to the gym more, no lingering pain from where my wisdom teeth are,  Rant: Dodgers doing nothing in the offseason, being tired all the time, clients who yell at you, my messy room, car and office (haha)   currently listening to: Radiohead "Where I end and you begin"

      well that was a nice christmas present from mother nature .... an earthquake and a big one for that matter. it was 6.5 and centered about 240 miles from LA and 200 miles from SF. it was strange cause the building kept rocking and stuff, i felt all dizzy. i'm glad more people went and saw LOTR - ROTK it is all about that movie BUT some people in my office seem to disagree. they found the movie too long, too homo and too overdramatic for their tasebuds. one person felt peter jackson was a terrible director .... go figure. i'm kinda of surprised to meet people who did  not like it just cause i thought everyone would like the last one cause it wraps everything up. a few of them prefer the second one to the third. i'm really disturbed by the whole homo thing cause i mean why is it that men who just really are loyal and loving to each other seem HOMO. so lame. that movie master and commander should be super homo then cause that is a bunch of men on a boat ... or what about all those war movies ... there are a lot of men there ....   spinning:  friday i'm in love - the cure .... ha ha

      Okay okay so I watched a bootleg version of Honey (yeah yeah yeah)...bc although I know it's gonna be bad, I love dance movies! ("Nobody puts Baby in a corner!")...Honey was SOO bad. Worst script ever, cheesy after school music. Lame-O!!! AND she didn't even say: "This is what I do!" That is my favorite bad line from the trailer. What a disappointment.

      Orlando Bloom is pretty boy hot.  In the 80's, he would be on the cover of Teen Beat ... like Kirk Cameron.  Do they still have those magazines around?  Anyway, I think he's hot cause he can speak elfish and is British. On a side note, I was driving to work yesterday and I saw this lady brushing her teeth in her car with an electric toothbrush.  I think that's really disgusting because where would she rinse?  I think brushing your teeth is almost as worse as picking your nose in the car without tinted windows.

      oh and i forgot to say....when i was watching lord of the rings...well this one part they showed legolas/orlando bloom and a bunch of girls around me started clapping and giggling.  So later on in the movie when Arwen/Liv Tyler came on...the guys around us-to be funny-started clapping and giggling.  fun stuff!  ALSO, i like orlando bloom...BUT i was wondering why the fascination?  like he's not all masculine or anything.  so I was wondering if there is a trend of girls liking "feminine" type of guys.  I.E. Justin Timberlake....Orlando Bloom....haha ok maybe not a trend but those are two big ones! hehe  For me, I tend to like pretty boys anyway--even tho the red head protests that he's a pretty boy.....i do.  I just thought the general public liked vin diesel and the rock.  *shrug*  sorry if my blogs sound REtarded but I've got a lot inside my head from exams...and can't really articulate at all right now.

RotK was awesome!!  about the last samurai blog....ok i don't think the girl should have gotten mad about tom cruise hooking up with a japanese girl if she's really all about being in the now.  i totally appreciate my asian culture and what asian-americans have gone through to get here.  yeah that was a wack ass idea about the "beautiful asian girl call" and i especially liked the first response's argument about Jews and Afr. Amer.  But i ALSO think some ppl just need to relax a bit about this whole asian girl white guy thing....yeah i dunno...i gotta go learn about some drugs or whatever.  last test tomorrow!!!

      before i get into skimmy's post i wanted to talk about LOTR: Return of the King. it was alright and if by alright i mean the best movie visually as well as storyline i have seen ever. the storyline part is all credited to tolkien and his genius, the man was incredible to come up with this entire world. i could go on and on about it but i'll just say everyone in the house should go see it ... at least twice. :)  as for the wb post ... i could go on about this matter forever ... and trust me i could. i'll just say this: i have learned to really embrace my asian hertiage and to understand and respect all the hardships and work it took asians to establish their life in america. personally i think many of the negative images and views of asians and their culture come from individuals who do not take the time to get educated. movies made in the 1920's depicted asians women, like anna may wong, as temptress, slave girls or whores.  asian men were often either villians, thiefs or side kicks ex. bruce lee as kato to green hornet. the key to stopping all this is for people to get MORE educated. ignorance spawns all these stupid perceptions.   spinning:  janet jackson - better days

      wow, i haven't read the blogs for a while and it's been very interesting reading everything.  i must admit, when i see a white/asian couple instead of thinking the white guy has an asian fetish i tend to think that asian girl is "white washed".  especially when you see that one asian girl with a whole bunch of white people.  i should stop thinking that way though, i know.   well, did anyone watch the last samurai?  i thought it was a great movie, it's probably similiar to "dances with wolves" new wave, but entertaining nonetheless.  i cried through half the movie too.   but, there's an email going around talking about how WB was asking for pretty asian girls to send a photo to get picked to wear japanese costumes to the premiere after party.  it kind of relates to what we're blogging about so i'm pasting the forward here.  it's long so if you don't want to read it, that's cool. =)  "Hi everyone, Here is the original posting from the "Last Samurai" casting call party followed by 3 different responses.

Perhaps you might do the same with a film about Jews where the after-party would have starved Nazi camp prisoners celebrating themselves "in character". Would you dare walk that ground amongst the blacks & Jews in Hollywood? (But Asians are always fair ! game? IF YOU THINK THIS THEN YOU'RE WALKING A VERY DATED PATH SOON TO BE PAVED.)  You are playing upon WHITE MEN'S racist novelty / fetish for ASIA WOMEN as docile import sex-furniture. (How convenient that you'd exclude ASIAN MEN as a COCK-BLOCKING presence amongst the white men at the party who rule Hollywood. Really hard for white fat-cats to leisurely hit on Asian "Geisha servants" when the ASIAN MALE "WARRIORS" ironically depicted in your film would stare them down during the party.)  AN INSULT AT TODAY'S ASIAN-AMERICANS LIVING NEXT DOOR TO YOU: (Particularly for Japanese Americans.) The recklessness of your advertisement reflects the very dynamic of racial power differential you practice in bias for white-dominated Hollywood. (Where Asians and only the chosen "subservient" women are for the good ol' boys of the white country club to smack on the ass.)  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? Are you this culturally st! upid despite your formal education which I imagine is culturally bias to white social power differential. Learn how to  live in California amongst TODAY'S Asian Americans who will be the future employers of your white children (spawned from your white male husband) after they go to college with them. Bare in mind that TODAY'S Asian American showbiz executives and creative authorities are on the rise in Hollywood. WE WILL NOT FORGET THE PEOPLE WHO STEPPED ON US ALONG OUR WAY UP THE LADDER.  So if you do not respect us out of deeper intelligence then perhaps you ought to apply your business sense.  TODAY'S Asian AMERICANS are a proactive force in America with a higher education mixed with sophisticated social awareness of a dual cultural identity. This includes life experiences of RACIAL tension inherent with the American upbringing. As new incoming generations of AMERICANS WHO ARE ASIAN enter the higher status of the Am! erican society they bring with them a vigilant pride fed by their multi- cultural sensibility.  So be careful that if not just for yourself your children will not not keep up with us. They may inherited from you a dated sense of racial social perspective that elevated their parents' social position "back in the day" but now serves only to alienate them in the racial future of America. PAY ATTENTION TO WHO WE REALLY ARE. As we are paying close attention to HOW YOU PORTRAY "WHO WE ARE".  -Wyn Ngo (An Asian American MALE in showbiz.)   -------------------------------------------------  RESPONSE #2   Dear Ms. Rave,  I am writing this letter in opposition to the casting call you recently sent out on UCLA's listserv. I have seen the preview for The Last Samurai and was incredibly disturbed by the romance between Tom Cruise and the female Asian woman. Granted, I have not yet seen the movie so I do! n't know how the relationship arose and how/if it ended at the conclusion of the movie, but the very idea of a white man going into an Asian country and sleeping with an Asian women is sufficient to spark my anger.  Historically in America, Asian women have been depicted as sex toys, commodified, exoticized, and hypersexualized in film, literature, and other mediums of art. Historically, white men have invaded Asian countries (such as Korea) with the facade that they are "helping" that country rise out of its third/second world status. Instead, white men have raped Asian women and robbed them of their dignity and honor. Hollywood is following suit by depicting Asians and Asian Americans as objects of commodification and hyper- or hyposexualization. Our women are too sexy and our men are not sexy enough. Our cultures are trivial and can be lumped together.  One example is when Pierce Brosnan [had sex] in a Buddhis! t temple in 007. If the producers of that film had done their research properly, they would have known that any type of profanity or indecency in a Buddhist temple is completely unacceptable and downright appalling in Asian cultures. Another example is in Mulan. Apparently she was a Chinese girl, yet she was wearing a traditional Japanese kimono. This reflects the little regard that Hollywood producers have for Asian cultures. Hollywood clumps us all together and it does not matter whether we are wearing kimonos or hanboks or saris. Each Asian country is a distinct country with its own history, cultures, values, food, and honor system.  However, that is not to say that when one Asian community is attacked, the other Asian communities do not rise to their defense. Having seen the preview for The Last Samurai, I fear that again Japanese women will be depicted as sex objects for white men - Tom Cruise sleeps with a Japanese wom! an. Regardless of how that relationship arose, the perpetuation of sexual imperialism by white man to Asian women is absolutely unacceptable.  Your casting call requested "beautiful Asian women." Again, apparently we all look alike too, correct? During World War II and Japanese Internment, Korean and Chinese Americans had to wear pins that said "Korean, Not Japanese" so that the police officers - white people - could differentiate between who to take and who not to take to camp. In this case, you don't care. Any beautiful Asian will do. Any Asian woman can dress up in village clothing to scamper about among Hollywood's toughest white men. I wonder why your casting call did not call for handsome Asian men? Are they not also part of the scenery in an 1870s traditional Japanese village? It is my understanding that Asian women (oooh, forgive me if I make generalizations, but as long as you're doing it, why can't I?) were no! t allowed outside their homes. It was considered  indecent for women to be outdoors among society. So if you really wanted to recreate a traditional Japanese village, you may want to change your casting call for ONLY men instead.  I also oppose the fact that you called the 1870s "ancient Japan." In the 1870s in America, Reconstruction was in full swing. The 17th and 18th centuries In England saw the continual rise of the Industrial Revolution. Is that your definition of "ancient"? Asian countries are responsible for many renovative inventions; for example, the printing press was invented in Korea long before Guttenberg. Asian countries are NOT backwards, are NOT primitive, are NOT "ancient." (i added this after i sent it to her)  The fact that you asked for "beautiful" women also raises questions. Whose defintion of "beautiful" are you using? Your western one or my Asian one? What purpose would the women serve? Were you als! o going to ask them to speak in "Ching chong cho" language to really get into character? Should they bat their eyes and appear docile, demure, servile and submissive? Would you like them to shuffle their feet? According to the character in your film, should the Asian women who respond to your casting call also sleep with Tom Cruise and the other white men who will be at the party?  You sold us the "American Dream" and we took the bait. We came to America. We built your damn railroads. We did your damn laundry. We sold you cigarettes in liquor stores. We fed you Chinese noodles and sushi. We grew your damn sugar and pineapples. We cleaned your houses while you worked in a real white collar job. We slept with you because you told us America and American men were better.  You did not offer any pay for this job of dressing up and mingling with Hollywood's finest. Apparently you consider it a privilege to participate in t! his party. You think we do not have anything better to do than get dressed up in costume to meet Tom Cruise. Think again. Did you not see Asians rallying against Proposition 54 in the election last month? Do you not see Asians with the highest enrollment in top-notch universities? We're your doctors. We're your lawyers. We're your judges and police officers and governors and politicians. We're your teachers and your librarians and your Hollywood filmmakers and producers. We're your classmates and neighbors and friends.  We are NOT free labor. We are NOT your servants. We are NOT objects of commodification or exotification or oppression. We are NOT your sex toys.  So in response to your casting call... NO, we are NOT interested in the role to play "beautiful Asian women." And get it right: Asian AMERICAN women.

I also read Mr. Wyn Ngo's letter castigating your advertisement.  I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Ngo's criticisms of your action. However, since I do not know who you are, what type of person you are, what kind of political and cultural sensitivities you may possess, or how open you would be to feedback from Asian Americans, I don't know what I could say to you that would be persuasive and meaningful.  Are you the type of person who would read the letter . . .  * and immediately realize the serious mistake you made and acknowledge how insensitive it was,  * or try to cut the losses and issue an "apology" even though you don't mean it and deep down think people are being too thin-skinned,  * or say, "Tough shit. This is Holly! wood and I'm a Tinseltown hack. I need to make the party FUN for the guests,"  * or you couldn't give a shit about Asian Americans because you don't like slant-eyed slopes anyway. "So, call me racist. I'm proud to be one!"  Whatever your response, I think you ought to make it clear, unequivocal, immediate and widespread.  I can assure you your casting call and Mr. Ngo's letter are already circulating broadly through the world wide web, and across the country. Already, in the eyes of MOST in the Asian American communities, Cheryl Rave joins the ranks of Senator Trent Lott, Rep. Howard Coble, baseball executive Bill Singer, baseball player John Rocker, golfer Jan Stephenson, Al Campanis, Jimmy the Greek, and on and on. In deed, not good company! Most of them were dismissed or forced to resign from their jobs and/or became interminable targets of protest and embarrassment.  I hope you have the courage and the wisdom to see ! the error of your ways, take it to heart and do something to correct the immediate situation and to do good for human kind in the long run.

      ok so i think that whole vaginal canal thing is a myth, which i've never really even heard of.  so if i'm understanding it correctly, you're saying that asian's vaginal canals are positioned opposite to the rest of the worlds female population.  a. if that were even possible, it could only be caused by some kind of developmental defect and would not affect ALL asians...b. how does this make it more pleasurable for guys?  if anything it would make it pleasurable for girls right?  ANYWAY so to answer your quesiton it is possible but its NOT possible to have the whole asian population to have this magic vaginal canal hehe

      on the subject of the "fetish," i think it's harder for the house and myself to understand the other point of view.  it seems like a decent amount in here has dated outside their race, so it's okay for us.  i know some people that see the asian/white dating and say oh it's a fetish.  i just think, man you're dumb, but i wonder why they think the way they do.  maybe it's cause there are guys that do date because of the stereotype, and the people that think that way have been exposed to it or their social background disagrees with what they perceive as to be bad.  also with the people i know, if one of our friends is dating outside their race it's not considered a fetish.  so in order to judge a person you should have to know them right, but that does not hold true, how lame is that?    i know about the whole unspoken rule thing as well, my mom is of the old school.  i think it's stupid and i never cared to listen to it, ironically enough, currently i'm with someone of my own race.  dorkus, thanks for the new info of the asian vaginal canal, wow that's news to me.  hahaha.

      color blind societies do not realistically exist. established.  people should not be penalized for what they think or feel. i'd prefer if we recognize the racial differences and not necessary assume guy or girl dates said person due to their race. if an individual is confined to those standards, it is a sad thing. but i only have control over my actions and thoughts. not theirs. truth is a subjective word. true friends are honest with each other. but tact and consideration of sensitivities and feelings are equally important. optimism or giving people the benefit of the doubt does not necessarily equate to ignorance or self enforced oblivion.

      Just my opinions..... 1) i think if a white guy is dating an asian girl, it does not necessarily mean he has a "fetish." however, maybe if all he dates are asian girls, then maybe he does have a fetish. and yes, it could be considered a race thing. you don't know how many old perverted white men check out young asian girls. it's disgusting. and mac, maybe you won't understand bc you're male, but trust me, there are a lot of white guys who want to date asian girls bc of the whole stereotype. plus i heard one time that black guys want to date asian girls because their vaginal canal goes sideways. WHAT???? i don't get it! 2) sorry new wave, you asked a question that will have no right or justifiable answer (about the double standards of girls being sluts). that's just it, you see, it's a double standard fostered by society. there's never going to be an answer to that question. it's just unfair is all.   3) who gives a f*** what you do anyway? do what you want, as long as you're not hurting anyone else. 4) if you think i have a white "fetish" because i have mostly only dated white guys, then so be it. i don't care.  listening to: lisa loeb and elizabeth mitchell - "donguri" - traditional japanese song

      1)  When I see an Asian girl with a wite guy, I don't automatically think that the white guy has an Asian fetish.   But if he only dates Asian girls, then...yeah... it's a fetish!!!  But I also think it's a whole mind set that people get when they think of dating an Asian girl.  I think most white guys would consider that Asian girls are more subservient than the rest of the other races.         2)  I agree with what Hedwig Potter wrote.  When you are raised in an Asian family, there's an unspoken rule that if you are seriously dating someone, then the guy better be either the acceptable Asian race or maybe white.  I know it sounds shitty but I think it's true in most cases.

      man i want to live in gumdrop land with lollipop lane, better yet i want to live in the land of chocolate like homer, where there are chocolate posts, chocolate rivers, chocolate dogs... hehe, that episode is sweet.  anyways, i know that people aren't color blind and that the many perceptions exist, i was just giving a take on what i think.  i agree with hedwig, that if you're happy it's all good.  if other people have trouble accepting that, that's their own problem, to sound kind of selfish, i belive a person should benefit themselves if it is worth it to them, and not care about what others have to say or think, that is if it does not do any harm to the other party.  it's not your fault that you are happy and have what you want.    i have a few manwhore friends myself as well as a few female friends as well, but hey it all goes back to if it makes you happy, to quote rocky balboa, "go for it!"  yeah the truth does hurt, actually i take that back, i don't want to live in gumdrop lollipop land if it is used within that context.

      OK perfect time for me to blog.  i just finished w/ an exam...and haven't started studying for the next one yet.  SO, as an asian girl(yeah i'm asian, some filipino's don't consider themselves asian--yeah they're dumb) dating a white guy here is my take on it.  I'm just gonna ramble cuz my brain is a big blob.  In H.S. all i went out with were black guys...there are many factors that contribute to this...maybe b/c there were no asian/flip guys, or any good looking white guys...there were 43% latinos in my h.s....so i dunno why i dind't go out with any mexicans.  ANYWAY, for me, I pick and choose.  I met a cool white guy that i LOVE...and I guess if we broke up or whatever, i would probably go out with a white guy again b/c I'm used to it and that is what I"ve been accustomed to for 6 years.    I think one of the reasons why so many asian girls go out with white guys is b/c all the other races (Mexicans, Indians, perhaps other asians, and let's not forget the number one African-American no no) are off limits.  Yeah you can do whatever you want, date whoever you want...yeah sure, gumdrops and lollipops.  So i think that's why asian girls go out w/ white guys...they're "safe."  That's just a theory I have...not the reason why i'm with my bf right now haha.    As for white guys and asian girls....I think people have a tendency to like certain features.  I myself, if I were to like girls...I would go for the darker haired, more ethnic looking girls lookswise...although i don't really like typical asian females for the most part personality-wise...that's just me.  My bf has never gone out with a white girl.  He's been with asians and latinas...that's his type.    And my third and last theory...sometimes people just don't like the opposite sex of their own race.  I don't like Filipino guys...not the typical ones anyway--they're wack.  My bf doesn't like the typical white girl.  I haven't really met any asian guys that have interested me.  Hmm...maybe i'm just a self-loathing person haha *shrug*  Maybe people want something new aside from their own culture---cuz you know white ppl don't have any kind of culture hahahahaha kidding only kidding...and asian girls wanna get away from their asian culture that is sometimes being shoved down their throats by their parents.  Who knows?  Who really cares?  Get with who you want to....as long as you're happy it's all good right?  it's allll good.  as for the guys=stude girls=slut thing...that's just another double standard that will go on forever.  it's only guys who think that.  girls think guys who sleep around are sluts too...who wants to go out with a playa?  not any girls i know.  listening to...myself telling me to go to sleep.  nap time!!

      ha ha okay mac ... i heard the song on kroq while driving home and had to rock out to it. i mean hello it is good charlotte. hee hee. okay in response to your reponse .... that is nice that we all live in magically color blind society in gumdrop land on lollipop lane but seriously ..... you know people are NOT color blind. i don't think it is a bunch of bullshite that some white male looks at asian women at a submissive, china dolls to do their bidding. i actually think it is a very real and true perception on asian women from certain types of males, even asian males. personally i don't think you understand cause you are a male yourself. i do agree though that a lot of asian males do have a white woman desire ... ha ha much like in undercover brother and the whole black men desires for a white woman ... i think it exists for the yellow man as well.   as for the second part ... joke all you want but i talked to some guy who i know has been around the block a few call a girl who slept with some guys a slut and that irked me. sheesh.   oh and people don't like the truth cause it hurts. people don't like to get hurt ... in a way i think it is some times good not to know the truth cause it can really mess some people up bad when they do find out. let them live in gumdrop land with lollipop lane.   oh and sweet about milli vanilli :)   spinning:  electronic

      whoa, new wave, i have to ask, why or how you even know that song by good charlotte.  i didn't know that existed.  haha.  and to answer your questions, remember people this only my own opinion, and if you don't like it that's cool.  oh and darth, fetish is used in the context of new waves question, i agree with your opinions on what a fetish is.  1) the whole asian fetish thing is stupid.  if a person likes another person, and vice versa, i don't think the race card has anything to do with it.  and if they like only a certain "type" of person, fine it's their choice.  i think it's stupid that people even have this idea, i mean, really, who said that asians have to date asians, whites have to date whites, etc....  also the only people that i've been around that say "ooh that guy has an asian fetish" is usually an asian person.  "it's a subservient thing, they want the asian girl to act coy and serve them, so that they can be/feel dominant,"  that's a bunch of bullshit.    as for the asian girls and their white fetish, i don't think asian guys, who usually are the ones to bring this up, realize that maybe, just maybe, it's the other way around, and that the asian girl wanted to date the white guy, and it's not always the guy persuing the girl.  that's why there is no so called white fetish.  one last note on this, i'd like to point out that a lot of asian guys have a white fetish as well, but they just don't follow through, it may be harder on them to persue a white girl, so they don't do it, and i think that role reversal leads to jealousy, and that may be why the idea of the asian fetish is around.  2) i could insert joke here, but i.... must.......... refrain.....;)  i can't really give a good explanation to this one.  i don't agree with the thought processes of this concept either, but i can't explain it, so i won't.    i would like to ask my own question though.  why is it that when you voice your opinions out loud and they do not agree with what others think, you are a dick if you're a male, or a bitch if you're a female?  i mean you are being truthful right?you want the truth, you can't handle the truth, show me the money, bear driving car, what that mean, that no make sense.  (sorry that was from clerks the animated series)  but i do believe that jack had a valid point in a few good men.  one last thing, this is off the topic, but my friend met fabrice morvan at some bar.  who is he, well see if you can guess, cause girls you know it's true.  he wants to go out with her.  hahaha.  yes i live vicariously through my friends, especially when they meet cool celebrities.  still don't know then check it out  urlLink here.   the link was emailed to her.....good times hahaha.

      question:  1. if white guys who only date asian girls have an asian fetish, then shouldn't asian girls who only date white guys have a white fetish (i know darth fetish is not used in the right term here but just let me have this) 2. if a girl who is lonely and horny sleeps with guys why is she a slut but when guys do it, it seems acceptable. so are all the women on that show sex and the city sluts then ... cause they sleep with a lot of guys.  just your thoughts   spinning:  feeling this - blink 182 on kroq

      all right, so last night was my company christmas party. i really didn't want to go but the christmas party committee (yeah, there's a committee) was hyping it and everything. last year's was pretty lame (small ballroom, low turnout, buffet style appetizers) but i sorta had fun because i got drunk w/ my coworkers. this year however, there were so many freakin' people that i didn't get to really talk to everybody. it was done casino style, which was cool because we had all kinds of tables and dealers and everything. i felt like such a retard bc i don't know how to gamble at tables so my coworkers had to teach me. (they were telling me to double down which totally reminded me of that one scene in Swingers.) it was in a nice big ballroom this time w/ a nice dinner and everything but it was SO boring. maybe i was bored because i didn't drink all that much this time. not that you need to drink to have fun at a company function. oh wait, YES YOU DO. so no more company christmas parties for me.......  side note: my sister told me it was so cold in boston last week that her hair actually froze. that's right. wha???

"are u sure thats enough? should i just make it an even 1000?"  OMFG!  im like, uhhhhhh, i dont really need that much money.  so she compromised, and i will be getting a check for $850 on monday.  fun times will be had, thanks to the ucsf school of medicine.

IT IS ALL SHITE. ha ha. you can try to find that job that will make you happy, that will fulfill your "enjoyments" or "desires" but see once you get that you will be quickly dissatisfied. why you ask. because it is human nature to always strive for something else. once we have attained what we wanted we get bore and want more. ain't we grand like that. i would like to end with a song from a "great" band that i think should lift your spirits mac :)   HOLD ON  This world, this world is cold But you don't, you don't have to go You're feeling sad you're feeling lonely And no one seems to care Your mother's gone and your father hits you This pain you cannot bare But we all bleed the same way as you do And we all have the same things to go thru Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know Your days you say they're way too long And your nights you can't sleep at all (hold on) And you're not sure what you're waiting for But you don't want to know more And you're not sure what you're waiting for but you don't want to know more But we all bleed the same way as you do And we all have the same things to go through Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know Don't stop looking you're one step closer Don't stop searching it's not over...hold on What are you looking for? What are you waiting for? Do you know what you're doing to me? Go ahead...what are you waiting for?

      in with: the buzzing of my computer  please do not read if you do not want to fall asleep, i'm just writing out my thoughts, and since i have no other forum to do so, here we go.  does anybody actually like their current job or workplace?  what happened to our dreams and aspirations we had in our wonder years?  wow, why am i rambling on about this stuff?  i know it must be friday, and i must be bored in the last hour of work i have left.  i guess the questions above are actually just thoughts i'm processing through my head these days.  i feel that i have wasted a lot of time doing something that i probably won't enjoy doing later on, it's just for the money.  bah to that, i'd rather get paid less and do something i enjoy, hopefully i am leaning towards the right direction.  out with: the buzzing of my computer..................

      we had our movie premiere for "love don't cost a thing" and it was actually a lot of fun.  because i was expecting the movie to be horrible, i ended up being pleasantly suprised.  we got to walk down the red carpet and see the stars in the background get interviewed and take pictures.  we took a picture with john sally and was sitting next to a table with the asian guy from american pie and better luck tomorrow.  at the after party there was free dinner, coat check and FREE ALCOHOL!!!!    new wave,

      well, new wave. at least you get a christmas party. one of the new coworkers asked me, so what's the holiday party like? oh, we don't get one this year. we can't afford it. lame.  you know they have to save money for the gifts they give to employees after they have been there for a year. oh wait. they don't do that. they just give you a card. my company sucks.

      Not trying to push religion on anyone, or not trying to offend anyone...just thought i'd share.  Have you guys heard of the Mel Gibson production about Jesus Christ's life?  You can watch the preview on the second link...but i think u can watch on the first one too.  Anyway, lemme know what you think of it.  Supposedly it's ALL in Latin(looking over to New Wave....translate??) and/or Aramaic...with SUPPOSEDLY no subtitles.  So all the images and score basically carry the movie.  And i suppose if you're of the Christian denomination then you can probably infer what the character's are saying.  I thought it was interesting though.  Mel Gibson has an intro on it...and he addresses the Harvest Christians.  What are Harvest Christians?  I've seen the stickers etc...but never knew what they were about.  So yeah....edumacate me if you can.  :)   urlLink The Passion Official Site   urlLink The Passion Unofficial Site  watch the 4 minute one.  p.s. i was just reading the unofficial site...the guy that wrote it is kind of dumb haha so don't take him all that seriously.  example: The cross is on the edge of Matera's canyon, and since for Jim Cavieziel, playing Jesus, was impossible to be on the cross for hours, they built a robot  looking exactly like Caviezel. The robot is moved by remote control by Mel Gibson. maybe he just can't speak english properly??

      hey mac that's an interesting take on the situation...never thought of it that way.  sux to be her.  the avg joe guy was on STAR 98.7 today and some girl asked him out to new years...so it's like he has his name out there...and girls are gonna go for him, so technically he wins.  not only did he get to be on TV and go out with a "hot" girl...he gets to go out with hot girls that he prolly would have never gotten a chance to go out with.  and the hot guy who she chose just gets her....hehe

      first off, darth, why did you watch that?  secondly, again, why?  wasn't the average joe guy a millionaire or something, that's what i caught from a commercial i think?  if that was the case, either way she would have been shallow, right?  kind of sucks for her in my opinion, because it was a lose-lose situation, had she chosen the average joe, then people would have said she did it for his money, but now she's shallow because she went for the good looking guy.  just my two cents.

      Hmm i just finished watching the nightmare that is average joe. And guess who won? No!!! not the average joe but instead the good looking guy. The so called "evil guy" that we were all supposed to root against.  And the poor good average joe gets sent home. What does this show teach all of us who aren't former miss america contestants or model/actors? Well I'll tell you "Evil always wins because good is dumb"  Thats the lesson I learned.

      in with: alkaline trio - old school reasons  that sucks skimmy that he retired right before your game.  that's a bummer.  oh and i went on the carnival cruise.  it was the first one i've ever been on, but i enjoyed it very much.  i had 4 meals a day.  yup that's right 4 meals a day.  i thought to gain about 5 lbs after the trip, but it was weird instead i actually lost a few.  man free food where you don't have to pay rocks.  what's this pay for you food crap they have on land?  haha.  t.v. has taken a turn for the worse.  but i'm so happy for ashton kutcher's fame and fortune, oh no wait, he's an idiot.  paris hilton.  idiot.  trista rehn.  idiot.  they make ben affleck seem intelligent.    hedwig, i totally agree with you.  how is it that illegal immigrants can go out and get a drivers license?  oh i know, because california is run by idiots.  except for arnold because he's haaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuught!!!!  nofx - idiots are taking over

      Hi Everyone!  It’s been a while but I enjoyed reading all the blogs that I’ve missed since November 17th.  Not like New Wave has been keeping track though. =)  Mac it does suck that Zo had to retire again.  It sucks more that he announced it 3 days before the Clipper game I bought tickets for just to watch him.  It’s okay though, the game was fun even though the Clippers lost and I wore my Zo jersey since he was there in spirit.  I also came back from a cruise to Ensenada not too long ago and the swaying is normal.  The first night back when you’re sleeping you feel like your bed’s swaying and you feel like you’re moving when you’re looking at the computer screen.  I felt the most normal in a moving car, but it only lasts about 2 days, right?  Did you go on Carnival or Caribbean?  I went on Carnival last year and Caribbean this year and overall I liked Caribbean more.  The ambiance and food was better on Royal.   I watch Rich Girls and yes they are pretty dumb but I can’t help but watch the show.  Just like I can’t help but watch Newlyweds.  I was laughing Pigern when I heard them talk about why people in the Midwest wear cargo pants.  Remember when Alley said her father invented them?  Why do we watch these shows?  I don’t know, just like Jerry Springer people have a fascination with dumb people I suppose.  But did anyone else watch Celebrity Poker?  I was rooting for been Affleck because I didn’t like that Willie guy.  But it sucked that David Schwimmer lost with Pocket Aces.  Hmmm…I don’t gamble much but talking about it makes me want to go to Vegas.  Vegas anyone?

      watched a charlie brown christmas tonight ... okay if that part where linus explains the meaning of christmas to charlie brown does not bring a semi tear to your eye than YOU ARE DEAD INSIDE. seriously. for me the meaning of christmas is the birth of Christ ... Our Lord and Savior. not to get all churchy in here but tis the season and before you get sucked into all the commericalism, stress, worrying and more stress just take a moment and remember what the meaning of christmas is to you :)  on a totally different note ... while waiting for my 24 (it was slow in the beg. but so very very good at the end) to start i watched part of a simple life and flipped over to mtv for rich girls. WHOA is all i have to say. i want my brain back. ha ha. the simple life is just bad cause you feel sorry for the arkansas family for having to put up with the two stupid girls. as for rich girls you just want them to get all fat and jewish and destory the lives of their future children. okay i spent way too much time on this.   darth you are so lucky you got to see tori ... *sniff* i would have so gone. i bet she looked so pretty. she always does. too bad i'm in la now. ugh la sucks. the streets are confusing and hard to get through, there is a lot of traffic and the drivers are jerkfaces. oh well.    spinning:  christmas time is here - instrumental from the a charlie brown christmas :)

      Hey party people, just got back from my day at the Tower Records in  Brea to watch Tori Amos live. It was well worth me taking a vacation day, and yes dorkus and new wave i know i have about a thousand of those. Anyway I got there around 7:30 am, and was 12th in line. The tower people were really organized and cool to everyone waiting. They kept us all in line and issued numbered bracelets out so that if you were first in line you would be the first one in to see her. After getting my bracelet I slept in my car, saw Bad Santa (insert laughter here mac) then slept in my car a little more then went to lineup. I spoke with a few other fans and watched as the Star 98.7 vip winners went in to meet her got their stuff signed and then left before she sang....wtf??!??!?! yeah about 10-15 people didn't stay for the show.....that wasn't annoying or anything. We were eventually walked into the store and lined up, we were told to stand behind the vip winners who were sitting. So i was about  5 rows back, but still really really close. She did a five song set of: Silent all these years, take to the sky, Winter(my personal fav!!), Angels, and Seaside. Really cool and enthusiastic crowd of mostly died hard tori fans so that made the setting even better.   Thats all for now, i'll blog other stuff later.....

      it's just like if you ride the elevator up and down a lot...or if you're on the plane for a long time...or after riding the treadmill...it's normal.  your body got used to compensating for the boat swaying back and forth...and so your muscles, etc are just used to that...it will take some time to adapt back.  gotta get your land legs back.  ;)

      hi everyone i just got back from an awesome cruise down to ensenada and back up yesterday.  i'll spare you guys the details, but i would like to share that good charlotte is taking over the world.  on this ship all the kids, and i mean all the kids were the little minions of good charlotte.  i think i must have seen over 20+ spawns of benji and/or joel.  i don't think i've seen so much good charlotte paraphenelia worn at one time as i did on the ship.  it was scary and disappointing all at the same time.  i was so annoyed that while i was playing craps this 18 year old benji wannabe had a hot roll going that i stuck down a $25 chip on the don't pass line just so he could roll a 7.  to my disgust he hit his point and pissed me off even more.  haha....damn clone...  oh yeah, i still feel like i'm rocking back and forth from the ship, i wonder if it threw off my interior balance or something.  is that normal?  med students or non meds, any ideas?

      happy belated birthday on the blogger new wave.  skimmy's post is funny, a bunch of "bradley's" hahaha.  the post was cool, at least it had a message and it wasn't complaining, like most of mine are.   haha cheesy, perhaps, but not nacho cheesy and snickers, hehehe, jk.  hurrah for the weekend has come once again.  although nothing comparable to the feast and festivities of MEDIEVAL TIMES!!!!!!! is planned, i'm just glad this week is finally over.   work has been a lot more hectic this past week than has been in let me say, oh the entire 11 months i've been there, but that's a good thing, makes me productive at least.  now i get to enjoy some nice surfing, and r&r.  as far as the superbowl goes, it's going to be a shootout....actually i don't care to watch it.

      hope you had a good birthday new wave!!!  and have fun at the travis concert tonight!!!  that is funny that they thought you were 21 or 22.  they must've been "bradleys"  because they can't seem to tell what age us yellow people are.    it's been a somber week at work because we had some layoffs.  3 people, but with our film side only being 20 that's 15% of our staff!!!  but it sucks because one of the people that got cut was my coworker i was closest to.  but you know what suprised me?  when i found out there was a possiblity of layoffs, instead of being worried about my job i was wondering how much the severance was and if it was good, i think i would've been kind of happy getting laid off.  but of course when i wasn't i was relieved...but what does that mean?  it means a) i dislike my job or b) i'm a lazy ass that wants free money.  i guess both to a certain extent..hahaha!    but it did make me realize that we're in a good position right now.  we're young with no major liabilities like a house payment or kids, so if we did get laid off we won't be as bad off as someone who was married with children and a mortgage.  you know how we look back now and wish we were kids again because life was so worry free?  well in 10-20 years from now, we'll be thinking the same way about ourselves now.  so, i guess my point is that in whatever stage of life you're in, cherish it.   this is a pretty cheesy post huh....

      hello to the house. well, this past weekend i went to san fran. it's interesting how cities are built so differently. the architecture there is so beautiful. my friend's apartment building use to be an old victorian house and still maintains much of the character from back in the day (i.e. servant's stairs!). plus everything is much more compact than l.a., which is a common out-of-towners' complaint ("l.a. is so spread out. you have to drive everywhere."). it makes more sense to walk or take the public transportation in the city. i like the idea of walking and having everything nearby. but i would still miss driving (even though i'm sitting in traffic most of the time). but i guess there are always pros and cons.

      today is not my day .... warning: sorry complaining will be done now ....  i wanted to get the cure join the dots box set today. see i actually pre-ordered it but it was not going to come until after jan. 27 and i was like forget that. so i cancelled my pre-order and decided to get it at best buy because it was at a good price.   well i drive all the way to the westwood one (on my lunch break may i add which takes way longer than i thought due to LA FRICKING TRAFFIC) because it is closer to my office and of course THEY SOLD OUT :( so then i call to see if the other best buy near pico has it and of course they have like 5 copies (sigh) but oh well i had already used all my time up.   i just put my box set on hold at the tower near my house and i'll go there after work. but i so wanted to listen it today at work .... man i'm irked, pissed and annoyed. i guess on the plus side i got the new no motiv cd and it sounds okay.   spinning:  independence day - no motiv

      i wish i watched more of american idol but i only caught the last half of tuesday's episode and yesterday i was watching the apprentice.  i'm so glad sam got kicked off because he was freaking annoying.  that's true that the women flirted their way into getting the gold, but the men were pretty stupid.  who pays $50 for a leg waxing?  and they were just really unorganized and considering they went online they didn't do much research.  i thought the men should've won the first challenge with the lemonade stand.  only because i thought the men worked better together as a team.  but of course the women used their sex appeal to sell the lemonade too.   don't you think american idol should do some kind of mental screening before they decide to broadcast some of the auditions?  only because i think keith from the last season, although i was busting up laughing, seemed like he might have a couple screws loose...really.  and the guy that sings "she bangs" looks like he might be mentally handicapped.  it seems wrong for fox to broadcast that.  well, maybe they're really not.

      so much fun to be on the phone with the phone company for an hour.  this is the 4th or 5th month in a row where i've done this.  the best was my 3 hour phone call.  whoa happy days.  at least this is the last time i have to do so, unless they screw up again.  okay so american idol is sweet.  my favorite was the military/rap korean guy on monday.  i think that is the moment that defines why i am korean.  it brought the level of my pride up another notch.  haha.  oh yeah and just thought i'd burst some bubbles, but hong kong supastah is my friend's cousin's friend, follow that, and he really isn't a fob.  haha.  does anyone watch the apprentice?  the guys team is getting their asses beat in, but seriously, they were the better negotiators, what the girls did was not negotiate, they were flirting.  i thought that was pretty weak.  oh well they still won, i guess.  damn reality t.v.  at least american idol is almost over for me, i never watch past the auditions.  hey anybody see that one guy from hawaii in the clips that sings she bangs, he reminds me a lot of nkotb rule, hahahahahha.

      so american idol is back to grace us again.  hehe.  i SAID i wasn't gonna watch it this season....but...well i've been with it since the beginning so i can't give up on it hehe.  and everytime i ask...why do people who can't sing THINK that they CAN?!  and to make matters worse, they diss on the judges, who have made millions doing what they do.  i think that the judges know a little bit more than any contestant.  ANYWHO...time to study.    listening to: pretty baby-vanessa carlton

      are we not supposed to be eating meat right now? oh well if you gotta go, go eating something tasty....so yeah this "scare" has not made me stop and i haven't died yet everyone just wanted to let you all know that. vegas was fun times, didn't lose as much as pretty much everyone else there, which is good, still lost, but not as much. i'm feeling pretty good right now i had a client come in earlier this week, who makes me feel really good about the job i do. i know i bitch and complain a lot about stupid tenants and their stupid request....but when one comes around who makes you smile and enjoy your job its all worth it. I'm also feeling really good at work cause i'm ahead of schedule right now and everything is neat and orderly which is really rare for me, can i do the same to my bedroom? fyi: dorkus/new wave i have another review in about 15 minutes, where they are going to give me another week off. hahaha.......  crappy that i'm listening to mostly cause they get stuck in my head: Ian Van Dahl - Castles in the sky the liz phair album (this one doesn't annoy me as much) Evanescence - Hello (stop laughing) NOFX - Liza and Louise (its old but still good) Welcome to the Jungle - the BMC connection (its way better than GNR.....haha)

       i was told by a good friend this weekend that our blog page is just filled with us whining and complaining ...  i mean if we had a phone number for the house it would be 1-800-we-bitch. ha ha. which is fine because that is what this page was created for :) but we could talk about other things. so this year i'm going to come up with ideas and topics that we can discuss (let's see how long this is going to last ... ha ha).    i've been kinda of in a dry spell with music aka i hate everything but the CURE. :) so i am trying to expand my music taste ... after hearing this suggestion from pigern that her friend does i thought i would bring it to the house .... basically make up a list of songs you are currently listening to for the month so that others in the house can dl it and see if they might like it.   (this list is subject to change as the month goes on) raveonettes - remember cure - to wish impossible things  get up kids - overdue charlatans uk - love is the key & you're so pretty - we're so pretty the network - money money 2020 alsace lorraine - dreams i can't control pixies - wave of mutilation kylie - fever & burning up  saw lord of the rings tonight ....... so good. i think i cried more this time than the first time i watched it. i love sam .. he is so good and pure and loyal ... (sniff).  oh and does anyone in the house like foreign films ... i'm all about the hong kong ones :) just wondering.   spinning:  nothing

      haha, darth you're an ass, your 3rd resolution will never come into fruition.  i'm against conformity so i will not conform to the views of you and the likes, i will always love dashboard and good charlotte.  man real world is in san diego?  i should of auditioned.  i would be the boring one that doesn't do anything, but i'd annoy the rest of the cast by having a big bottle of kimchee in the fridge to stink it up, even though i don't really eat it much.    hedwig to answer your question, why grad school?  cause either way i go right now for my career plans i have to go back to school.  if i stick with what i'm doing, they want me to go to grad school and they're paying so why not, if i decide to go do physical therapy, i still have to go back to school.  so that is the reason, also it gives me more time to mess around and go on vacations and stuff, hopefully.  i want to go to vegas :(

      elimidate and 5th wheel make me want to punch myself in the face over and over again. I caught some of real world san diego last night, wow what a bunch of winners...mtv certainly knows how to pick them. i can't believe how fast 2003 went, kinda weird thats all.   new years resolutions  1. get in shape - yes i know this is typical, but i've been going to the gym a lot and hopefully i can keep it up. 2. get a new job 3. get mac to stop listening to dashboard confessional and good charolette 4. save more money 5. get a new car.  rave: having two people look at my resume right now, getting ahead in my work, working out, playing the sims, vegas this weekend rant: the broncos losing, the dodgers signing a crappy player who they don't need, waking up early, traffic starting again.

      i hate elimidate and the 5th wheel...they're so dumb!  i was stuck at Pep boys and I had to watch BOTH SHOWS!!  on Elimidate there were these ghetto ass girls on there and they spent the whole time dissing on each other and not even really getting to know the guy.  i didn't get to see who he picked tho.  oh well.  i do like blind date...that is funny as hell sometimes.  question:  what are you going to grad school for mac?  new years resolutions: 1. study more efficiently---or stop procrastinating....this won't last 2. blog more...well on my own blogsite 3. work out at least 3 times a week(i started this before break, but Christmas came and it went out the door) 4.  Be more aggressive and speak out more--CONFIDENCE!(work in progress...it's on my list every year)  and that's really all I have time for.

      has anybody been watching the celebrity poker challenge?  well i caught an episode yesterday, and super star rock musician scott stapp was on yesterday.  you know from the crossover christian mega band creed.  well first off he sucks at texas hold em, but the moment of the night came when he lost all his chips and he stood up and as he was leaving says, "I got F***ed."  haha that was funny, but not as funny as when he got arrested for drunk driving.  man he's my new Jose Canseco for the 21st century.  new year's resolutions:  1. figure out what i'm supposed to do with the rest of my life, i'm almost there...i think...i hope 2. get better at surfing 3. not make fun of people as much, key words (as much), it won't last, i'm an ass. 4. read/learn things that will blow my mind 5. study for whatever test i'm going to have to take for grad school

      tune in: pennywise - the secret  hello all, hope everyone had a safe and fun holiday last week.  got back from london on friday.  trip was awesome.    highlights of the trip: virgin airlines is awesome, the saatchi exhibit by the london eye, all the usual sight seeing, portobello market place at notting hill, watching big ben hit 12 on new years at trafalgar square and it starting to rain at exactly the same time, phantom of the opera at her majesty's theatre, seeing and saying hello to jennifer love hewitt at lax (she was on the same flight), i think she wanted me haha yeah right, seeing winston from married with children on a different tv show, and more...  duds of the trip: the airports on both ends were really "fun" to get through for the holiday season, i thought the food was bland for some reason, never got used to the time difference, some of the rude people.  overall it was a great week.    watching the news there and coming back and watching the news here is very depressing.  i just love the american press and media compared to other countries and their mediums.    oh yeah, coming back to work after a vacation sucks.  tune out: afi - brownie bottom sundae

      happy new year everybody. hope everyone's new year's eve celebrations were festive and fun. mine was sort of lame. i went with some people around the hollywood area and found that losers and lame-os hang out in the hollywood area. basically people i would rather not talk to, be in the same room with, or have to interact with in any shape or form. i guess it would have been better if i was pissed but i wasn't because drinks cost money and i have none. anyway, next year i will either stay in and ignore the holiday all together or select one place/party that does play host to l.a. losers.

      I think the controversy is good, the reason behind all of it is that the film sheds a raw light of the last hours of one of the most prolific figures in history.  Religous leaders, mainly Jewish, seem to denounce the film, from what I can gather.  There are obvious reasons for that, but I think the general public will go see the film for what it is, a movie.  What they get out of it, is left to them, whether it be an epiphany, a new view on Jesus, pure entertainment value, and so on.  As a believer it has sparked my interest and I will watch the movie, but not solely for that reason.    I'm not sure the intent of which Mel Gibson had for producing this film, in any case I think it is a breath of fresh air from Hollywood, seeing as how everyone in Hollywood seems to follow Scientology.  This is an irrelevent point, but there was no controversy when Battlefield Earth was released, it sucked, yes, but it was based on the ideologies of Scientology.  There was no religous uproar.  What's my point, no point, I just had the urge to restate that I, against my own will, was forced to watch this movie, and am bitter for wasting 2 hours of my life doing so.

      tonight i went to a short film festival held by RES. it was pretty interesting... kind of reminded me of the events that the film/tv department would hold at ucla. basically, we got to watch some music videos and short films and directors/creators of them discuss and answer questions after the show. the best part was a lot of the music videos were from artists that i liked. anyway the event is held every month so check it out:  urlLink  RES   how do you think nader will affect the democratic election? only marginally? or significantly?

      went to a RES screening today. they showed some interesting video / graphic stuff. my faves were invisible skateborads by rick howard and spike jonze, madvillain - all caps by james reitano, ween - transdermal celebration by adam philips and the japanese tradition: relationships by namikibashi. the last one, the japanese tradition, was hilarlious .... so good.   hey rancid girl .... i heard that sharkees place is suppose to be pretty happening but a bit on the ghetto side and anyways you know slutty girls and creepy guys will do anything to get into some tired bar. ha ha.   sadly i don't watch surreal life so i can't join in that conversation. i'll just spend this rant reviewing stuff cause i'm bored -    movies:  dickie roberts - former child star: 4.5 it was fair ... i think the best part of the whole movie was seeing brendan fraser. i love him :) hee hee. i didn't even know he was going to make a cameo so that was a treat.   starsky & hutch: 5.5 it was okay. no where near as funny as zoolander for me but it had its moments like snoop dogg and vince vaughn.   shows:  no motiv: 6.0 they were solid though they only played less than 10 songs. that was a bit disappointing but they weren't the headlining band so understandable.

      Oh man, I watch the Surreal life too.  For whatever reason that show is pretty entertaining to me.  Talk about a diverse cast of characters (Ron Jeremy, Traci Bingham, RealWorld LV Trishelle, Vanilla Ice, Ponch-Eric Estrada, Tammy Baker)....Boy, I never realized how damn ugly Trishelle and Traci Bingham were.    Anyway, Eric Estrada will always be the shiznit.  It was cool when Vanilla Ice started singing his own song at the karoake bar after Trishelle and Traci were killing the song.  It inspired me to wanna sing the song when we went karoaking saturday night but the damn place didn't have it in their song book!

      Dorkus you are so lucky you get to go to Hawaii for work…that’s awesome!  It must be cool to have a job that allows you to travel.  My job keeps me tied to a desk doing journal entries, spreadsheets and analysis.  Fun stuff, blah!   Anyways, I’m excited about my trip to Asia in May.  We’re going to Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Seoul. I have to admit I was a little worried about the Bird Flu at first, but I think it should be okay. Hedwig, TWIFOSLY is it something I should be alarmed about?  But I’m planning to buy a karaoke machine while I’m there so when I come back party at my place!  =) I know how much you love to karaoke New Wave and Darth!

      I was having dinner in Hermosa Beach on Saturday and right beside Sangria is this club called Sharkees.  I guess it's a pretty good club/bar because even though the pouring rain.....there was a line of people waiting outside!!!   They were all drenched and looked miserable.  It was a funny sight.

      Don't you just LOVE it when you're sick?  The aches, the pains, and the chills! it feels WONderful.  Not to mention the incessant coughing and runny nose, which can only be topped by the resultant headache!!! Then going to urgent care to get it checked out and waiting for 2 hours?!  only to find out that i could have diagnosed myself.  AWESOME!  woohoo!  I love today!

(sigh)  i added a rating system to our blog page so we can let other people in the house know about certain movies and music so please start using it. :)   watched:  these are some movies i have watched recently:  party monster - 4.0 not so good but not so bad but really not so good. i found it dull and dragging at certain points. however seth green was good and no i'm not just saying that cause i like him as an actor. thirteen - 3.9 straight should of been on lifetime type of movie healing hearts - 6.0 granted story not that great but hello tony was in so it made up for if :) hee hee.

      Woohoo!!!  I'm going to Reno today for Vday.  I've never been, and despite the fact that I've only heard "not so good" things about it when I do mention Reno, I think I'll have a blast anyway.  The red head and I are gonna learn how to play craps, I'm gonna teach him how to play Pai Gow and HOPEfully we can win some good money!!!  Another WOOHOO!  for Europe!  My cousin and I are in the process of closing up our itinerary for Europe.  They just need to confirm this one promotion for 50% off the flight.  I'm so excited and yet so guilty about spending so much friggin money, but it's ok.  I'm sure it will be a totally worthwhile experience.    See Friday the 13th isn't so bad.....*knocks on wood*(as it is only 918 in the morning haha)

      okay house here is some big news concerning me.......after much soul searching and deliberation I am here to announce that I will not be retiring from competitive bowling this upcoming season. The team was not ready to call it quits and requested my return. so it turns out this march will not be my ride off into the sunset as I had earlier reported to some of you.

      is it just me or are the days just flying by. i've been pretty tired everyday coming home from work ... ah work ... it will be the death of me. i just feel like i have no time for anything but it's alright cause i'm learning a lot and keeping busy. i've only been there for 2.5 months now but i'm not kidding it feels like 6 or 7. who knows maybe i'm just being a baby about this.  so here is a work/weird horror story for you guys - i was in the kitchen making my hot cocoa and oatmeal when i heard three i would say yuppie mid to late 30's white people discuss the grammys. so the woman goes what is the difference between rap and hip hop and the two males gave her the most educated and well thought out answer i have ever heard. it was something like "rap is spoken poetry set to certain rhythem and hip hop is more just dancing" and the woman goes well why does rap have to be so angry and the men said cause it is coming from the streets  ..... WOW ..... weird.  did i mention i'm really into chinese movies now. i feel bad that i use to make fun of my one friend about it when here i am watching them all the time. :) hee hee. or at least when i can. okay serious tony leung is so handsome to me. not dreamy cute like johnny depp or hot like brendan fraser but like handsome even if he is super short and kinda of skinny. he has this quiet thinking looking which is cool. the best known movie in america i know he did is in the mood for love.  so any plans for those couples out there for valentine's day aka if you are single kill yourself now day. ha ha.  nothing much for me but like that should be a surprise. i know hedwig is heading to reno and that's about it.   i'll post the music i'll listening to later but quickly ...  prefuse 73 - plastic  no motiv - where did you go air - venus low - dinosaur act missy elliott - i'm really hot radiohead kid a album   spinning:  uprock and invigorate - prefuse 73

      hmm i guess I should blog since I haven't for a while and I may get kicked out if I don't. I just got back from Kentucky tonight. Fun times hanging with the Hutchins side of my family which I rarely get to do. Seems like get togethers only happen for weddings now, which got me and my guy cousin arguing as to who was next...fun times. In other news I have gotten a new job which i'm pretty excited about since I will actually be using my degree!!! Scary isn't it? I am leaving the housing authority to become the executive assistant to the chairman of the board of supervisors. long title i know. It should lead to bigger and better things in the future if I show quality work, so i really need to get myself going everyday. It will be kinda sad to leave my office since I have been there for 2+ years now and I feel pretty close to a couple of people there, but its for the best that I leave. New job....new car...am I actually growing up? wth? no i didn't think so either. In other news I have been so tired of late, i have trouble making it past 8:30-9:00 some days.....scary isn't it...could my months of lack of sleep finally be catching up with me? Baseball spring training starts next week...who is excited??!?!?! oh yeah just me...haha....

      hey rancid girl, the yeah yeah yeahs are great. they only have one full length out right now (fever to tell) and two eps. i would describe their sound as kind of screamy and punk rawk. the band is fronted by karen o who is amazing live. they are playing two nights at the henry fonda next month. i rec them. check 'em out! the coachella lineup is out now. i'm pretty excited... although most of the bands i want to see, i've already seen before. some of them several times (i.e. death cab for cutie 4x). but nevertheless, the pixies reunion should be brilliant. as well as the cure... as always. ok. so i'm at the pharmacy the other day and they sell at home drug tests for cocaine. it seems a bit strange that they sell this but maybe that's just me.

      hedwig, the 80s club is called club thriller (www.clubthriller.com) in Orange. you don't have to dress 80s but it's suggested. i would say that most people there were part of the indie/mod crowd. however, there were some old people and some teenyboppers too. if you go with a group of friends you'll have a good time. it's $6 cover.

      first off i'm sorry about the blog page and the colors and everything ... i screwed up royaly and i'm going to try to fix it but who knows when :(  the other day my friend said "hey i like that crazy kooky band postal service," because they heard that overplayed tired "such great heights" song. okay let me explain to you what i remember of postal service when i saw them at the palace. the show started off with the jealous sound ... why is that band even existing ... THEY BLOW. then postal service came on and gave an alright performance. nothing mind blowing. the highlight of the show had to be when some teenage kid asked a girl to go to the prom with him. he passed a note to ben gibbard to read out alond and the girl accepted (insert all ahhhhhs here now) i must adimit i was pretty choked up ... WITH VOMIT. and speaking of ben gibbard what is with the huge I HEART BEN GIBBARD fan club. i swear the guy has all indie kids' panties in a bunch. sheesh he is their freaking messiah. he's got postal service, dntel and of course the great and almighty deathcab for cutie. what indie kid would not be complete without the new 'transatlanticism' album shamelessly plugged on that O.C show. ha ha. granted i did buy the postal service cd but eh. me tired of talking of this ..... moving on .......  i have this calendar by my desk that shows different world scenery / locations and i decided by 2009 (5 years from now) i want to have gone to all the places listed on the calendar. the ones with stars next to it mean i've been. what about you guys?

      hello everyone. well if you go to the actual link of the  urlLink  blog page   you will notice a difference. bascially i was up late at night and was messing with the page and BAM !!! i messed it up. so yea ... it is a bit ugly and bland now. i put the chatterbox back up but i got rid of the imood stuff. i'll be adding links to it as time goes on. let me know if you want me to change anything. i'm in the process of working on some other things for the page.  on an interesting note if you notice the archives go all the way back to when we first started so if you wanted to know what you posted a year ago on this day you can. it is strange to see the different people who went in and out of our house as well as the different places we are in our lives now ... YIKES.

      This is me complaining:  Okay okay okay. I know I did this to myself and shouldn't be complaining because we have all been forewarned, but I watched Gigli. And this is where I start sounding like I did awhile back with my blog about the Celine Dion store in Vegas. Anybody involved in the production of this movie should have put out this disclaimer: "We are SOO sorry you watched this movie. We will pay you back in form of therapy because we are sure that after watching this movie, your life will never be the same. You will be scarred for life, and you will wake up day after day wondering why you did this to yourself."........So Gigli is definitely not one of those "so bad it's good" type of movie. More like "so bad you want to poke your eyes out and rip off your ears and stomp on them bad." Don't see for yourself, just take my word for it.   Okay, Best WORST Line from Gigli : Jennifer Lopez: It's Turkey Time. Ben Affleck: Huh? JL: (motioning for him to go down on her by opening and closing her legs) Gobble Gobble!!

      6 years ago on apr. 1 i went and saw radiohead on tour for their ok computer album .... wow.  got the new janet cd but i'll reveiw it later after some listening. i will say through the album did not receive the best reviews (i don't trust RS anymore because they gave britney's new cd 3 stars ... wtf) but i don't think that will stop fans from getting the cd and supporting janet.  got this fwd from skimmy today about  urlLink  asian males  . personally i was not offended by it like i usually able about asians and their protrayal in the media. why? well i think the article was trying to be clever, and i use this word loosely, with their stereotypical writing "shrimp balls or shaved balls" and "study hard, grasshopper". however, i can see why they made the whole asian or gay assumptions though. have you seen some asian males ... yikes they take better care of themselves then most girls but i think the real point here is who reads details magazine anyways .... oh i know the metrosexuals ..... but i should move on now ...  yay baseball season has started, hot dogs and nachos here i come.   spinning:  like you don't love me - janet jackson

      so i'm sitting here at work drinking some jarritos tamarindo soda, and it's very tasty.  feels like there's  a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.  i dunno, it's the first time i've had it.  on the other hand i'm eating a stale muffin.  janet jackson is cool, i'm not a big fan per se, but she's talented.  i mean she was on different strokes, that speaks volumes to me.    baseball season has officially begun.  and the yankees are tied for first right now.  man this season is going to be great.  viva la yankees!   basketball is officially winding down and the lakers are gonna tear it up.  i'm not a laker fan, but seriously who's gonna beat them?  people are saying the twolves, but the kandiman on shaq?  and the kings will get worked again in the playoffs.  except for Vlade, cause we all know that he is the man.  and there is no stopping the Yugoslavian Assassin.

      hm... sometimes i don't feel like a real music fan because i know that if i were to listen to janet j's new album, i wouldn't like it. something about r&b that makes me unhappy. there are a few songs of hers (or r&b in general) that i think are ok. i don't know what it is though. anyway, i decided recently that i'm not going to sell any more of my cds. well, besides the fact that you don't really get back what you actually paid... when i play an old cd it pretty much always reminds me of a certain time/incident/person. for example, i played this uk band called easyworld. they aren't great and won't do much in the grand scheme of the music world but the album reminded me of when i was in london and saw their set in camden. and some of their songs/lyrics are kind of ridiculous (i.e. you make me want to drink bleach) in a kooky way. : )

      ok you guys know that Damita Jo by janet came out today right?  if not WHY NOT?! HAHA so i have to rate it.  let me start by saying that I read 2 reviews, one was a rolling stone one and the other was a random one off of the internet and both said she was "trying too hard" and they didn't give very good reviews.  They said that it sounds confused like she's having an identity crisis.  The album is pretty much trying to convey her 'real side.'  The reviewers criticized that this 'real side' is really fake blah blah blah and that she's trying to encompass all of pop by having all these styles on her album.   As a fan, and perhaps I may be a biased and unconditional fan even though i consider myself as a pretty fair judge...but i digress.  I feel that this album is much like her other albums, in sound, layout, expression etc.  The subtle difference is that she has other funky beats in there but it still stays true to herself and her style.  It's not her best album, but it's good.  I also like the fact that she doesn't have as many interludes in this one.   Damita Jo-Janet Jackson: solid-excellent(7.9-8) Tracks to check out: Thinkin bout my Ex, Island Life, My baby...those are the three that stick out to me right now...i was studying while listening to the CD so yeah hehe.  But I found myself bobbin my head to a lot of tracks...you know what that means??? lotsa dancing on the tour!!!!  New Wave, Darth...you got quarters for me?

      i am not a dork.  long live star wars.  so darth don't go about how we are all dorks.  saved by the bell rules.  i resent that i am clumped in this dork category.  i wish i could live in the city of men, from LOTR........  oh wait that last one, um....  haha, yes i agree that everyone has dork in them.  i reign supreme in that area as well.  work has been hectic, with all this moving offices business, but hey april is my last month.  woo hoo, i think.  then i get to go back to school, woo hoo, or not.    launch has past much time for me in my office.  and the 80's station does rock, i don't what this business about crappy music is.  it's pure enjoyment.  right now on my launchcast video station, is Only You by 112 with NOTORIOUS BIG and Mase.  oh i long for the days when bad boy entertainment was good as was Death Row.  i miss tupac and biggie.  i don't listen to much rap nowadays, but from what i do hear, it stinks, as jay sherman would say.  except of course for Lil Jon, WHAT????!!!

      yes dorkus and hedwig you are dorks....but we are all dorks to some extent.....i was just reading about star wars episode 3, yes i am aware that the movie doesn't come out for another 13 months and 22 days 15 hours and 10 minutes but thats practically around the corner!!! haha....see good times  so my friend works for GSN (thats the game show network for all you not hip and with it kids out there) anyway she thinks she can get me on either the evan marriott (uh elder?) dating game or the word show Lingo.....I think I am going for the latter. Anyway I'll need a partner who is good at word puzzles...new wave and skimmy you are automatically disqualified as you are becoming fobs more and more each day. haha....Being on a game show has always been a life long dream...I was so close to win ben stein's money...so close!!!   today is friday which basically means its me and my coworker who is a year younger than me, and then the 2 interns...yeah we are going to be productive today, i know it!!! haha....well i do have some work that needs to be done, but it shouldn't take to long...well I hope not.   if any of you have speakers at work or want some music to listen to that you haven't heard in a while I would highly suggest launch.com big 80s or big 90s stations here is a kick sample 80s: pour some sugar on me, every rose has its thorn, take on me, don't stop believing (amongst other journey songs), bon jovi hits, its soo bad its good....then i flipped to the 90s station to get: what is love?, informer (yes snow!!!) groove is in the heart, bed of roses (bon jovi goes 2 decades!!) november rain, ice ice baby just to name a few......trust me your'll be laughing your ass off cause you'll know every crappy song it plays. brings a tear to my eye...sniff

      ok i've consulted another nerd cuz i don't actually have a book and here is our convo: PSUCoyote: pg 418   PSUCoyote: Hermione was not teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept callin her "Hermy-own"   rent79br8t: oh yeah? PSUCoyote: "Her-my-oh-nee" she said slowly and clearly   PSUCoyote: "Herm-own-ninny"   PSUCoyote: "close enough, she said, catching Harry's eye and grinning"   so there you go.  i guess i have finally proven that i am a super super dork.  wish me luck at stateline this weekend...i need the money.

      Ahh Hedwig, I think I fall somewhere in between a fan and a freak....bc do you remember that in Goblet of Fire, when Hermione is explaining to Victor Krum how to pronounce her name, she says it's "Her-my-knee" not "Her-my-o-knee"?? Haha. I swear that's how she pronounced it, in that one scene when they are at the dance...Yeah just some nerdy minutia for you.  Harry Potter nerds forever!

      so...ok let me explain something first.  as you all know i am a harry potter freak.  and i say "freak" because there is a great distinction between freak and fan.(CAUTION: spoiler for the 5th book if you haven't read it yet.  and if you havne't read it yet why the f*** not??!) haha    fan: OH I LOVE THE BOOKS and/or MOVIES!! freak:  So, did you notice in the first book where Ron saw himself winning the Quidditch Cup in the mirror of erised....don't you think it's weird that in the 5th book he gets to play Quidditch and they win the cup?!  fan: Yeah I've seen all the movies.  or  Yeah i've read the books and I love them!!! freak: Yeah, I just finished rereading OotP(Order of the Phoenix) and now I'm rereading PoA(Prisoner of Azkaban) before the movie but I think I'll finish it way before the movie comes out!!!  When is the next book coming out?  ANYWAY, being a HP freak....I only know of one other HP freak....I was rereading PoA and realized OMG! Cho Chang(harry's love interest) is introduced to us in this book.  In a very slight and foreshadowing kind of way, but she's in it!  And I was liek OOOOH she's gonna be in the movie!!! I wonder who they cast.  I rush to the internet to do some HP research and what do I find out?!  they're not even gonna PUT her in this movie!!!!  they're waiting til GoF(Goblet of Fire-4) to introduce her.  HOWEVER, they have started casting for GoF but still no news of who it is.  I can't talk to potter fans about this...cuz well, they dont' really care or remember.  hehe.  So I'm disheartened.  OH another reason I was disheartened by Potter fans.  This woman who is in my bf's class was talking about the next movie....and she pronounced Sirius Black as "Cyrus"...wtf now.  And she claimed she "loves the books/movies."  Granted, I used to pronounce Hermione as "her-me-own" instead of "her-my-o-knee"  BUT c'mon...that's a hard one right?  Ok i'll get off my ranting....  listening to: lonestar-front porch looking in

      just returned to the states tonight. not sure if i should sleep or not, as it's mid morning in london. the trip overall was fab. i got to go to some local pubs and gigs. i also saw jerry springer: the opera. it's a big musical in london right now. and the guy who plays jerry really looks and speaks like him. the best part was the theatre handed out "slut junkie" and "crack whore" pins as you exited. also, i learned the french got it right. you don't need to bathe everyday. i only showered 3x during my entire trip. i admit i was a bit smelly but it's easier to not bathe in hostels. also took the train to manchester. it's a lovely city. i prefer it to london. good atmosphere, amazing music scene, high culture. london is overly congested and crowded and frankly, makes me mean. i got impatient and snippy even though i had no particular place to go. but maybe staying in hostels and barely sleeping (shared a room with a loud snoring bloke) also added to it. tip of the trip: go to the tate modern near the thames river and eat at the 7th floor restaurant. it has a spectacular view of the river, st. paul, and the city.

      yeah i don't care either, but given the two choices i guess i'd say camille is hotter....but still no clay...he is dreamy. haha.....yeah fun week of work is coming to a close....oh wait it wasn't that fun....but its better than what i used to do so i ain't complaining. baseball season is almost here....finally....had my first fantasy draft, that always makes baseball more entertaining. Anyone watching the Sopranos here? I also watch the shield when i remember too...missed it this week, i'll catch it this weekend hopefully. Vegas trip this past weekend was fun, didn't lose as much as i thought i would so thats always a good thing, didn't bowl very well at all, so i was kinda pissed about that. oh well next time...haha.......for all you legitimate theater fans alhambra high school is putting on little shop of horrors this weekend, my favorite play, well next to planet of the apes the musical. I'll be going friday night, come on down its gonna be fun and you can all laugh at me as i recite all the lines and songs with the actors...haha....i have no life. to answer your question new wave, "say yes" is so hauntingly good becasue its elliot smith and everything he writes is haunting in some way. to answer your question dorkus i would date a tomboy cause its the person not the outer person.....and who is the metro person you speak of? i think i know who you are talking about but they weren't anything like that before or anything.....hahahhahahaha.......and seriously what are you thinking about right now? whats on your mind? too classic. and wait a minute you watched miss match? so you were the one viewer, thats always fun to know. haha......hmm what else can i ramble on about. New south park was really funny last night.....that show is so much more clever than what a lot of people give it credit for. The old eps were stupid and were just trying to be different now there is a point to each ep that is usually true. Okay i guess thats all for now.....and mac  in case you didn't hear tivo got thought the lesbian in 50 first dates was funny...yeah i couldn't believe it either.....haha

      Alright, so I'm beginning to get death threats from a certain person in the house, so I suppose this means I should start blogging. And I thought my blog about the 3 headed frog was gonna hold me over for a couple of weeks. I guess not.   Anyway, question for ya: If you're a girl, would you consider dating a Super Metrosexual? If you're a guy, would you consider dating a total tomboy? I ask this because I hung out the last coupla days with my (totally platonic) super metrosexual super gay gay gay gay gay gay but straight friend (hehe, some of you know whom I'm talking about), and I figured I'm much more like a guy (in the mentality sense) than some guys are. Like when I get asked, "What are you thinking about?" I get all annoyed, and I'm like: "Um, nothing. I'm thinking about nothing!" And I don't want to sit around and talk about my feelings and analyze everything all the time. And if I'm dating someone, I don't want to define and analyze the relationship right away, and wonder if this person is "the one" before we've even had our second date. Get what I mean?...I'm reminded of an episode of Miss Match (yes, you read right) where the character Kate dated a metrosexual who stabbed her in the back. She said, "He gossiped like a girl, but then rationalized it like a guy." Er. That's too difficult to deal with for me.   My answer: Um, no metros for me. NOT someone more fashionable than I am. And NOT someone who takes longer to get ready then I do. If I wanted to date a metrosexual, I'd just date a girl. Haha.     (Listening to: Paris Combo...good French stuff.)

Main band: elefant 6.5 - us mood rock band, i thought they were solid however i know pigern will disagree with me. i just liked the way the band had a kinda of f you all attitude. sometimes you like a band to be cocky even if they know they are shite.   the audience 0.0 - the people there were terrible ... just thinking about it makes me shiver. girls cutting to the front (i really hate that), a guy moshing (how do you mosh to mood rock music), same guy taking his shirt off and swinging it in the air (?), way too many young people, annoying guy in the back with a laser point (annoying), overall pretty bad.

WOW   the main thing i need to blog about is the Passion of Christ which i saw this weekend. at first i thought the movie was just good but after thinking about it some more it was actually really good. i have a few problems with the movie itself, mostly with the flogging scene and how good looking all the actors seem to be. ha ha. was it just me or was that one hansome looking Jesus. i just expected someone more homely looking.   the message within the movie was the strongest part - Jesus Christ died on the cross  and rose from the grave. He paid the penalty for our sins and bridged the gap between God and people.  For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus - 1 Timothy 2:5 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us - Romans 5:8 For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God - 1 Peter 3:18   spinning  holy roman - get up kids

      Tonight is the beginning of the 3rd season of The Shield.  It's a great cop show if you guys haven't been watching it.  Speaking of new shows to watch, I've also been watching Keen Eddie on Bravo and Tough Crowd with Collin Quinn.  I've been watching TV non-stop because of Tivo, which by the way is the shite.

      hi folks. ok. i'm going to rant. i hate the gym. why do the televisions have to play mtv videos all the time that show half naked women and make you feel worse as you are trying to work out? or play horribly tedious, annoying programs? and the news shows that are on are never captioned so you can't read what's going on. the only good time was when they played spongebob squarepants. ooh, that was good. or when the simpsons are on. last friday i went to a smiths cover band gig. it was fun and i was the minority. soo many greasers and hispanics. there are some really diehard smiths fans. moz must be scared. haha! ok. take care everyone. i'm off to london in a few days for some tea and crumpets. cheers!

      I saw The Passion on Sunday and it was a very good movie.  Even though I read about Jesus dying for my sins or heard sermons about it, this movie really had me visualize the amount of torture and suffering Christ went through for us.  The scene where he is being whipped was the toughest part of the movie to watch.  Although the movie is a bit graphic and violent, I still think it’s a movie worth watching.  I can’t usually watch violent movies, but the amount of blood and gore doesn’t overpower the movie and the message as a whole.  As far as this movie being anti-semitic I can empathize with why Jewish people feel this way.  I think I was watching Dateline, but they were saying that historically, it was the Romans that ordered for the death of Jesus, and that King Heroid (?-is that his name) isn’t as compassionate as they portray him.  That he also wanted Jesus to die, not only because he felt pressure from the Jews.  But I just don’t think that this movie will cause people to have a feeling of hatred toward Jews.  Especially if you go to church, the Bible predicted that they will deny Christ, and it always writes about how the Jews are still the chosen people.  I guess that’s not really a point…but even if people don’t go to church or are not religious, I don’t think people would feel hatred towards the Jews, considering that throughout the movie Jesus is asking God for their forgiveness and trying to teach people to love their enemies.   But at the same time, people that are Jewish are seeing it from a different perspective, and I can understand why they feel that way.  On a lighter note I’m going to the Britney Spears concert tonight and I am a little excited.  I know, a lot of you guys despise her, but it’s not like I think she’s a great singer…but I went to her last concert and it was a lot of fun.  I admit that I like a lot of her songs and the girl can dance!  But I can’t believe how much I paid for it, and if I had to purchase the tickets again…I might think twice.  What was I thinking when I thought it was a decent deal?  Let’s just say I saw a roundtrip plane ticket from LA to Chicago for the same price as I bought my Britney Spears ticket.

      I thought I should share this with you guys. A customer sent this letter to my coworker. OMG. Too funny. And disturbing too!    Nice to meet you online! Good place gives me to talk with you.  Per our conversation, oh! This was second conversation between you and me. I think, you are very very kind to me and give me great help and support I needed. Because it is the first time for my company to attend the Glass, Window & Door sponsored by GlassBuild America, I received a CD about Exhibitor Service Kit from NGB but so many pages enclosed made me confused, and further more I am very busy that no time for me to read them carefully and just scan what I need when I will do the things. Therefore, I usually phone Freeman for help according to my need and what I scan in the Kit. That was the reason that God gave me two good chances to meet you in the phone. Meanwhile, in our conversation, your melodious voice gave me perfect acoustic enjoyment. Your accent is pure, sweet and soft so that it attracted me very much and gave me enjoyment. How I wish to talk with you for so long time! From your sweet and beautiful voice, I guess you must be a beautiful girl, and an active and lovely person as well. This time I phoned you and you immediately recognized my voice and named me Pat Power Kim, at that time, I was so excited by your naming me that from the other half globe there is one good and beautiful girl knowing me. At that right time from my inward feeling, I did thank you very much indeed and meanwhile like you and love you. Would you mind my favor and love? I just want to say out what I feel to you in my heart. Please don¡¯t mind my like and love to you. If God knows my feeling, maybe he will love you as well because you are one of the helpful and kind ladies. I eager to see what lady you look like, in my imagination, maybe you, charming face, middle height, and are blonde with white color skin, blue eyes with long lash and high bridge-nose. Those are my judgment according to your sweet and beautiful voice. Would you mind sending me your photo by email? Ok! Those are what I feel to you.  I appreciate your kindness and great support & help.  Looking forward to your early reply.     Very Best Regards,     Pat Power Kim

      Hmm i can't help but feel the threatening email statement was pointed at me, therefore i guess i'll blog.  seeing the passion this sunday after church...so comments to come.  First off my boss was running for state assembly but lost :(  its good cause i have job security for 3 years now, but bad cause the lady he lost too, is as i've been told quite nasty, and really hasn't done anything to validate her being an assembly member.   Second, I like my job, its actually fun.....i know this could just be because i've been here a week and everything is still new, but I think its fun just being around government officials everyday and doing work that changes day to day. who knows maybe i'll hate it all tomorrow...haha  I'm excited about the giligan's island reality show. I think it was cbs who bought the rights to put a real skipper and his first mate, a millionaire couple, a professor, a movie star and a girl from kansas on an island to see if they can get off of it. If that doesn't sound like quality tv i don't know what does!!!! haha...i hope the globetrotters stop by, and the monkeys, and some weird tribe that tries to marry their princess to gilligan....good times there  thoughts: kerry and edwards could be a scary duo i want an ipod, but i'll wait a bit sean penn is a really good actor having lotr win everything is cool, but the show itself was boring driving in the rain sucks my ass.  almost baseball season, and even better fantasy baseball...draft tonight to entertain mac, la sports guy and myself vegas next week, excited cause i want to bowl really well, which means no alcoholic fest 2004, but gambling wise don't want to lose.  touching the void: i would give it a 6.5, it was quite solid as far as a documentary goes, and the direction of the recreated scenes was quite impressive.  the pianist: i finally got around to seeing it, 7.0 it is truly a great acting performance by adrian brody....when he plays the piano for the guard...amazing  william hung's last performance on AI: 0.5 he is entertaining, but it is going to his head and he has used up pretty much all of his minutes of fame....but on the flip side, he still have his moves.  haha....okay i hope this saves me from not being kicked out of the house for at least another couple of months. and props to peter who gave me props on his blogsite so i'm repaying the favor......although i couldn't help but think he was really making fun of me......hmmmmm

      first off ... passion of the christ i have not seen but when i do i will put up my thoughts and views.  next i feel terrible for not properly introducing a new member to the house .... LA sports fan will be staying with us for a bit. he's cool and he won't bite.   also it has come to my attention that  SOME OF YOU  have not been blogging. i guess you people want me to start sending out those mean e-mails. oh i will ....   other thoughts: kerry for 2004 ??? everyone and i mean everyone should get an ipod :) forever eden has to be the worst reality show created (i have not watched but the previews look bad) work sucks and i want to quit lord of the rings with 11 wins .... long live the nerds :) i want the new get up kids cd really into the peet's coffee ice chai choc freddo rain + la traffic = cut my wrists open only a month and half till SPAIN :)   movies:   touching the void - 5.9 almost a 6.0 ... amazing amazing true story about joe simpson and simon yates, two climbers who did the impossible. good stuff man but a bit techinal and drawn out on some points.   curb your enthusiasm: season one - 4.2 i had problems with it, i personally think seinfield was funnier. larry david is just being larry david and that got old.  clockwatchers - 5.5 i only watched this cause it was recommended to me. it was alright but i don't see how it is better than office space like my one coworker felt. toni collette was the best thing about the whole movie, i mean parker posey has spark but after awhile it got old.   spinning:  nothing too tired

      so i too saw  The Passion of the Christ  and i agree whole-heartedly with your comments Mac.  I cried twice and almost cried once it was so powerful.  An hour into the movie I just felt like stopping it all because it was so painful to watch and I didn't want Jesus to suffer anymore, despite the fact that I knew it was going to get much worse.  as far as the "controversy" goes, i can see why the jewish community would have some worries about the film possibly sending the wrong message.  especially at the beginning of the movie, some might have thought, "why are the Jews so pissed at Jesus? why can't they just leave him alone?".  To impressionable, narrow/close-minded, dense people this alone might have made them miss the whole point of the movie.  So in that sense I can understand the concern.  the movie is set out of context and if you don't know the history, then you might have felt lost or have taken the wrong message away from it.  i'm curious to see/hear what non-Christians who don't know the story of the Passion think about it; if they felt lost or confused or mad.  i think a couple of my friends who aren't Christian are seeing it next week so we'll see.  At any rate, I think it was an excellent movie and it was told very well.    And that's my 2 cents....

      These are just my opinions/beliefs/views, everyone is entitled to their own:  This past saturday I watched  The Passion of the Christ .  It was the most intense movie I have ever seen.  It is very graphic, but done in a manner where it is justified.  To see Jesus put through that kind of  torture was an eye opener.  I already had knowledge of what had happened going into the movie.   I know Jesus died and shed his blood for our sins, but to actually see an interpretation of the events was humbling.  It has impacted me spiritually and personally.  This is my account of the film, and others may or may not share the same sentiments.  It is very powerful, well done, and influential, if you let it be.  Regardless of religous beliefs or non-belief, I think everyone should make the trek to watch it.  Has anyone else seen the movie?  I would like to know what other people think of the film or what they took from it.  This topic is different from our regular banter of how bad Good Charlotte and Dashboard Confessional are.  If not, then it is understandable, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and keeping their opinions.  If you have no qualms, then please share.  I'm interested.

      Hey all, I finished work today.  It's kind of bitter sweet.  I thought I would be overjoyed by it, but I still have not gotten the full effect of it.  I'm going to miss my coworkers and San Diego, on the other hand i'll be closer to my family and friends.  Tonight is the last night down here, i'm just getting together my odds and ends stuff.  As I was cleaning out my fridge, I realized that I wasted a lot of food.  I feel guilty for doing so, hopefully I will make more of a conscious effort to not waste food anymore.  I have the month of May off to do whatever I please.  Hopefully I will be in Hawaii.  Then I start school in June.  I wonder what it is going to feel like to be a student once again.  I think this time around I will be more focused, as I know what I really want to be doing.  Hope all of you have a good weekend.  Oh on another note.  My friend's girlfriend told me that she is going to wax his face.  I told her that sucked and that I did not think it was appropriate because he is not thrilled with the idea, but she kept insisting that she wanted him to do it.  Anyways, I guess she is doing this concurrently as I blog.  I feel bad for him, but then again it is his own fault too for not standing his ground.  Am I the only one here that thinks this situation is messed up?

      so when you drink alcohol, what kind of drink do you like? do you think that you like beer more then mixed drinks? if you do like beer, what kinda beer do you like? light? dark? why do you think you like dark beer? because dark beer has more alcohol in it and you feel that you must get drunk to escape your depressed life? why is that? huh? why?

      So you are probably all sick of hearing about Spain, so let me just go on about Spain some more. It is far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined. What is not beautiful however is going on an 8 hour flight, then a 2 hour stopover, then an hour delay, then another 5 hour flight only to find out that your luggage is missing. And still missing. Oh luggage, where art thou? I miss you.

      ok. so for you sports fans, i suspect a conspiracy... that the lakers threw the game tonight with the rockets so they could have their victory win in l.a. am i right? it's all corrupt. anyway, i've found that i have adopted the office space mentality. i want to do as little as possible at my job for the same pay. you know how when you first start you're all, sure i'll stay late! oh i'll take on that extra work. and all eager to learn. me, not so much anymore. i'd like to surf the net as much as possible. maybe get in an hour to two hours worth of work. does that happen at any job after a certain amount of time? or just the ones you hate? hmm... hey mac, so funny you mentioned the high school thing. i was at the gym and ran into an old classmate i haven't seen in years. at least five! it was so weird. but i liked her so i didn't mind that she wanted to hang out or something some time. most ahs-ers i dislike though. morrissey tomorrow. i think i might cry. (sob) ok. i really need to work on my article. procrastination. bah.

      dang it darth, down with the clan.  hey so i'm moving most of my stuff up this weekend from san diego.  since i'm a nice guy, i'll let any of you come down and help out.  haha.  i was thinking about it, and i'm going to miss san diego, not really the city, the work, or the people, but i like living alone and away from alhambra.  on the plus side i'll be in close vicinity to my friends.  also i will be starting another journey for my career.    i was back in alhambra this weekend and i saw a lot of people i knew from high school.  i tried my hardest to avoid them, because i did not want to have the usual small talk.  i succeeded in doing so, i think i avoided at least 5 conversations starting with the, "hey, (insert name) how ya been?  blah, bleh bluh, eat my shorts....." you know the usual banter.  i did not care about you before and i sure do not care what you are doing now.  i guess i was rude, because they recognized me and were about to say something, but i just walked the other way/avoided eye contact after, hahaha.  do i feel bad about it, nah.  i haven't exercised in a while, as i jammed my fingers thus putting my basketball playing days on hiatus, and i have had no time to surf.  i'm gaining weight again.  i think i should go on the swan.  or not.  sorry darth i bet watching that was the worst 30 seconds of your life.    hey for all you people in espana, have a safe trip back home, and if you get home early, i'll let you guys help me move too.  haha.  tunes for april:  Jaw, Knee, Music - NOFX The Power of Moonlite - Tiger Army Close My Eyes - Break the Silence Sad Girls Por Vida - Pretty Girls Make Graves

Whether it's a professional choice... or whether it's a personal choice. In the end, it's about integrity. And it's about chasing after what you really want. ...Even if that means showing you both care a little. And sometimes...well, sometimes you just have to do what's right for your friend. ...Even if it means sacrificing your own happiness. When it comes down to it, you just have to be proud of the decision you make. "  "Josh and I could school them" - haha  "Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny"   If any of you are really bored as mac was earlier, i invite you all to check out this site  urlLink click here   fun times!!!  hmm what else can i blog about. oh i know, yesterday i downloaded some footage of the taping of the climatic fight scene from star wars episode 3. It looks really cool!! I caught about 30 sec of the swan the other day and i think i wanted to die, my sister was flipping through and stopped on it, good gosh it was downright unwatchable...worst show ever! I want to go bowling, havent been in 2 weeks, which is long for me cause i was going at least once a week for about a year...its a tough layoff. why are people so dumb? like if you are dumb do you realize that you are dumb? same with crazy people.

      Glad to hear that you all made it there safely. I actually understood your message pedro, so to feel as though I am in Spain, here is my return message:  Soy sí muy celoso, pero en el mismo tiempo sé que usted los individuos va a conseguir me algo realmente agradable.

      i did my first interview in a looong time and i was pretty nervous but i guess it went well. it required a lot of research and formulating the questions to sound more like a conversation than a Q&A session. transcribing is such a pain! and do you ever notice how weird your voice sounds in the tape recorder? the entire time i'm like, i sound like that? anyway, wish i was in spain. (sigh)

      currently in san diego, at mac's computer, waiting for him to come home...haha...this morning i got up to mtv's made, it was about this girl who wanted to be a beauty pagent queen. she was really dork and unstyled to what society would deem as normal, and did they get her all this plastic surgery like the swan? no they simply redid her hair and clothes and gave her some self confidence...i guess fox doesn't think that would be worth a whole series so why no just make them over without the self esteem...yeah that will work...haha.  yes NOFX/Alkaline show was pretty good, the white wedding part was dope, but they seemed to drunk or tired to really get into it. i knew i was going to hear some crazy liberal speak which i did, and its nothing that i haven't heard before, so it wasn't any eye opening experience and to some extent i think over dramaticized, but thats just me. NOFX was pretty dope I saw them briefly many years ago, and they haven't lost anything....great show and rep with the audience for Fat Mike and El Hefe.   Sorry I was never a big Jem fan, i remember it being on, but thats about it....but your review was freaky, thanks dorkus.  Oh the reason I am at Mac's computer is i am in san diego, cause we went to the dodgers padres game last night. Another great victory for the dodgers!! go blue go....we even got to meet the dodgers owner frank mccourt, who slapped us some high-5s....a great highlight for me!!!  for the record....mac it was you who used to go out with her, not me, you must have us mixed up. so good job with that.   for those of you who are going to spain, buy me something cool......like a matador hat or running of the bulls costume....that would be sweeeeet!!!!!!!!! oooh and some spanish fly..for the ladies.....oooohhhhh yeah!!!!!!!!  oh back a few blogs ago hedwig had asked about parental communication. I have to say that me and my parents are not close at all. Growing up in a very strict asian household we do not talk except when we are spoken too. anything personal is never discussed and is kept private, or else we are beaten. jk......honestly though, I talk to my parents but never fully open up and tell them everything, they would be scared i think...we just don't do that, I'll answer their questions but for the most part they respect my privacy and talk only when they think that i am comfortable with the topic.

      I'M SOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!  That's all I have to know about the Swan from the commercial.  I refuse to watch it, I refuse to hear about it.  It's just wrong, who comes up with this crap, and I don't believe they get paid to do this and where can I apply?  Dorkus that Jem review was awesome.  Haha.  I felt the same way when I purchased the Transformers Season 1 set a while back.  Cartoons were so much better back then, now I feel and sound old.    The Rock against Bush Tour was pretty cool.  NOFX was downright awesome.  Fat Mike and El Hefe were funny and Eric Melvin played his accordion, that was sweet.  I was disappointed in Alkaline Trio, which added another guitarist for the show?/group?, anyways it is unwarranted.  They were boring to me, maybe because they played a lot of their new songs, which are not very good in the first place.  So it was a lackluster set, they did play Cringe though and also they played a bit of Billy Idol's "White Wedding" during the middle of a The Damned song they were covering, that was cool.  The other 2 bands I didn't care for, or was I even around to listen to them.  2 things about the show that annoyed me.  First off OC idiots running rampant and moshing and looking at the mosh pit and not paying any attention to the show whatsoever.  Second, I heard some moron talking and he said that Fat Mike was too political when he was talking about his stance on the president and our government.  THE ROCK AGAINST THE BUSH TOUR was the name of the show was it not?  I mean you don't have to be there and support the cause, and I know that Darth didn't, and you are there to enjoy the bands, but what do you really expect?  Seriously folks how stupid,....... grrrrr.........sigh........., they were probably there just to "happy mosh pitting" anyways cause the talking goat told them to.......anyone that knows that reference is cool.    Finally, you people going to Spain........lucky bastards........I say that with the utmost respect, i'm just jealous.  Well in your face people, you know where I get to go to in 2 weeks.  ALHAMBRA, yea that's right.  Now i'm sad, I think i'm going to go listen to some Dashboard Confessional and cry.  On a real note, have fun in Spain and be careful out there.  Oh and New Wave, forget sight-seeing, it's all about the food and shopping when you go to foreign countries.  Duh, didn't you know that?  Hahaha.  I can't believe Darth used to go out with her..........sigh.

      wow dorkus. you really analyzed that Jem. i was more amazed by the adult themes the cartoon dealt with - i.e. embezzlement, love triangles, blackmail. i guess that's why us kids enjoyed the show so much... or maybe we just didn't know what was going on. i enjoyed watching the first few episodes but after awhile the show made me sick. and their songs really do sound the same! ok. enough about jem. i've decided that since i'm so unhappy with the mind numbing monotony of work, hobbies are a nice distraction. i'm looking into doing more freelancing and my friend and i might take weekend classes. probably language. ever notice that in other countries, it's common to be at least bilingual while in america, it's common to be monolingual? that's just my observation. today some coworkers were talking about the documentary "supersize me" and then after much discussion decided that they were craving mcdonalds. so they went out and bought a mcgriddle. ew.

      Best Worst line from Bring It On Again (yeah yeah): "Why suck when we can NOT suck?"  First Runner-Up: "Oh yeah, well you wax your butt!"  (Note to self: Why oh why do I do this to myself??)   Moving on...I recently purchased the Jem and the Holograms: First and Second Complete Seasons DVD Set...omg it is SO "truly outrageous"!!!!! I love it. You are automatically transported back in time when you watch this cartoon. After watching a couple episodes, I have figured out that there are various "rules" the cartoon follows. For instance:  1. Rich people appear out of nowhere. Example: Jem and the Holograms are performing at a Battle of the Bands, and out of nowhere, a rich producer offers the winner of the battle of the bands a movie contract, $$$$, and a mansion to live in. Second example: Jem and her crew are at the mansion and out of nowhere a rich French countess appears and invites them to her yacht party. (The same goes for villains. As soon as one exits, another appears out of thin air.) 2. Bad animation. I'm pretty much convinced they hired several different artists to draw the cartoon, and then they piece it together. Example: In one scene, Jem's pink eye shadow disappears, then appears again, then disappears. Second example: Rio (Jerrico/Jem's bf) eyes change from blue to purple. Third example: There's two different theme songs; you can never guess which one they're gonna play. 3. Lack of security for any of the villains. Example: A bad guy gets onto the set of Jem's movie and knocks over a gargoyle off the top of the building. Second example: The Misfits find their way onto the yacht and ruin the party. Well, they ruin everything actually. (If however, there happens to be a security guard, the Misfits use their conniving way to get in, and they ALWAYS do.) Funny side note: One security guard says to the Misfits: "Who do you think you are? Duran Duran?" 4. When you are angry, knock over furniture. Every single time the Misfits get angry which is pretty much all the time, they knock over furniture to show how angry they are. 5. All Jem songs sound the same. All Misfits songs sound the same. 6. Rio must always save Jem from sort of physical danger, causing Jerrica (who is Jem) to get jealous. Um yeah, Jerrica is jealous of herself. She crazy! 7. Nothing should ever make sense. Example: Why would Jerrica's dad leave her a hologram machine (Synergy), a closet full of rockstar outfits, a cool car, but not enough money to take care of herself? I don't know. Don't try to think about it either. Things not making sense if probably the best thing about the show. You are sitting there most of the time going, "Huh??"  Okay, I can go on and on about the show. Bottom line: I love this dvd set. It's truly addicting. Oh yeah, The Misfits rock, Jem and the Holograms suck!

      i don't think there are any good karaoke places in alhambra, the closest place to go next is probably k-town.  there's vermont karaoke and cafe but i think they've gotten pretty ghetto since i've last been there, but they have great song selection in all languages.  i think a room is $25 an hour.  there's also orchid and palm tree.  palm tree is pretty nice and a room that fits 8-10 people is $20 an hour, but their english song selections aren't too great.  they have some rap songs and linkin park but that's as current as they get.  i don't remember the rates at orchid but they have good song selection and and it's pretty nice there.  ok...i know way too much about karaoke places.

      i too liked eternal sunshine.  i had no problem with jim carey, i actually think he is a good actor and can pull off serious roles, but he's just type casted as a comic.    anyways, almost done with work, and back to school for me.  kinda scared, anxious, happy, i guess a bunch of mixed feelings actually.  as far as the asian parents go.  i guess i got lucky, it's really easy for me to communicate with my parents.  and i can talk to them about anything.  they are traditional koreans, but i guess not in that aspect of hiding feelings.  i am an only child though, so that could be a factor into why it's easier for me to communicate with them, since they gave me all the attention throughout my life.  one last factor i may mention is that they are not together anymore either, so i guess that may have some impact as well.  but i do know in the traditional sense, that asian parents keep hidden their feelings, but deep down i guess as an american/asian, you just have to realize that they love you no matter what.  it's a hard place to be in when you have 2 different cultures to learn, but you live and grow with them, and hopefully you can have a better sense of what to do with your own kids in the future.  well that's just one man's opinion.  next wednesday Alkaline Trio & NOFX, so sweet!!!!!

      monday's are so freaking hard for me :(   so i came back from SF yesterday. it was a good time, it was nice to see FTC even though i'm going to see him in two weeks for SPAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. we went to the golden gate bridge, fisherman's wharf pier 39, union square and castro. it was all relatively quick since we only had one full day there. after the trip i realized i would really like to move up to SF but the cost of living there is insane :(. i'm just not a fan of LA or "the OC" (insert california song here) for many reasons. SF seems more like something i can vibe with because of the public transportation like the bart and muni, the huge asian community there, and the history behind the city. let's face it ... LA has some good history as well but it is too trendy and icky here and the oc i think is still fairly new. eh who knows all just wishful thinking.  oh in case you were wondering, i have been to SF before. i was actually taking a friend who had never been there before even though she lived in cal. her whole life BUT i found out while up there, there were some people from SF who have never been to LA. how strange is that. eh go figure.  as for your question hedwig .... yea forget the lines of communications with asian parents. i think it is really hard for most asian people esp. traditional type to be very open about their feelings because we are a pretty passive culture. you can't really be too hard on your mom because i'm sure she is looking at you thinking all this stuff as well. sometimes i get really bummed at how americaized i have become but then i remember this is freaking america ......  here's something i don't get. how come asians are so quick to assimulate into american culture yet hispanics and blacks still remain very rich within their culture. many hispanics i know still speak fluent spanish and keep up a lot of the old traditions. however some asians are so quick to make themselves seperate from their culture ... like many don't know how to speak their mother lanuage (like myself), are quick to pick up american or british type cultural behavior, have never been to any asian country and don't plan to go because either (i) it is too dirty (ii) too far or (iii) they are not interested and they can't speak the language, and mock other asians who are more fob like (even i do this one). what's the deal??   spinning:  the truth about johnney - raveonettes

      yes, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is brilliant. although i found jim carrey a little distracting. my weekend was filled with mindless action. i'm finding that to be more and more common nowadays. i went to aron's parking lot sale and bought 12 cds for $20. v. good deal. and of course, i like to observe the psychos who bring in their own crates and fill 'em up with cds.  as for hedwig's question, i think asians do not openly discuss certain issues (i.e. asian families do not have the 'birds and the bees' talk). it is a weird balance being an asian and an american, especially the various levels of how deeply ingrained you are in either culture. i sort of find myself more deferential to authority and passive than typical americans. but also more open minded and resistant to patriarchy than typical asians. now to go off on a rant: this reminds me of my colleague who was laughing at an article that reported a group was creating a fake society that would grant scholarships to whites, if they wrote an essay about their white culture. "white" doesn't really exist as a culture. there isn't a whiteland where this white culture immigrated from. it's not a double standard for asian americans or african americans to write about their dual culture experiences. they are identifying with how they marry the two and whether there are compromises in the process.

      hey house.  I have a question for the asians in the house.  It's kind of personal but I think it would be an interesting discussion.  How close are you to your parents and are they big on communication?  I ask this because I recently tried to open some lines of communication with my mom concerning issues I have with our relationship...i guess it was a step in trying to become an adult and gain some autonomy from my mother, but at the same time form some sort of DEEPER relationship with her.  but it  backfired and she viewed it as disrespectful and that i was being "too american" and she says that my bf who is white has influenced me which is dumb because I grew up in America and THAT'S influenced me, not my bf.  ANYHOW, she said she didn't want to communicate anymore because it was just making things worse.....which sux because I am a firm believer of communication.  then i talked to my friend who is also filipino and we realized that communication isn't big in the asian culture.  is our theory correct?    so i'm stuck in that endless see-saw between the obedient, passive asian daughter and the american woman that speaks her mind; raised in america but expected to act "asian"....

      I finally got to see the preview for Kill Bill 2 and I can't wait to watch the movie.  I also bought the new Switchfoot cd (instead of downloading) just because I always feel the need to support my San Diego musicians.  I grew up there so I feel that there's a bond.  Anyway, it's actually a really good driving CD...especially in the 405 traffic.

      have you noticed how society nowadays has an attention span of two minutes (or less)? it's really sad. i feel like i'm part of the mtv generation. anyway, i've been catching up on movies because i haven't been to the theater lately. and then i remembered why. tickets are so expensive. it's about $9/film. even with a student i.d. so most of the time i'm thinking, is this worth about $10? (including parking fees) and most of the time, no. i saw "shrek 2." and it was ok. it was funny but most of the gags relied on references to other films or jokes. so it felt like recycled humor. or a mockery of something else. like 'not another teen movie.'  then "saved." and that was funny. but then the ending got too teen movie-ish. with the whole prom scene and confessionals. ok. last note. i really think proper grammar and punctuation is undervalued.

      memorial weekend is upon us.  woo i really needed this break.  oh wait, i am still peter from office space.  what have i done for the month of may so far.  ummmm well i saved the world, went to an awesome yankees/angels series (well the first game was not so fun), surfing, basketball, baseball/softball, napping, poker, sitting around doing nothing, and now i'm currently trying to become a jedi, well a good one.  yeah i'm an ass.  oh well kudos to me, i'll be starting school in a few weeks, and if i can not add my class then i guess i'll be doing nothing for another month and a half.  haha.  skimmy after reviewing your blog on retirement, i guess i am screwed for the time being.  haha.  on the bright side i think i am due to win the lottery soon though.  then i will treat everybody to Blogger Pro!  and to answer your question darth, about how i can do nothing all day, it is actually very simple, you just do all of the activities listed above and kill time and enjoy it while the ride lasts baby!

      Hi. Here's a depressing note for the weekend.  If you are in the 25 year old age range and would like to plan for a comfortable retirement ($120,000 income/year equivalent to a 1.5 mil lump sum retirement fund), you would need to save $714.00 a month based on $0 savings. Based on $10,000 savings, you would need to save $680.00 a month.  Um, unlike New Wave who likes to hoard bags and bags of gold in her backyard, I think most of us can't afford to save that much a month. If you started saving $214 a month, you would have an annual income of only $45,000 a year.   I LOVE 401K meetings that make me worry about my future and my unborn kids and grandkids.

      okay i have been meaning to blog for a while, and have just been busy, then last night i blogged and then my computer crapped out on me and the internet went down. so annoying. So here is something for all of you to read whether you are working, in school, or in someone's case, saving the world. oh wait i was notified yesterday that the world is safe again, thanks mac...ass. sorry i looked for tradewinds but i couldn't find it, know what i do want though? pipe dream!!! how great was that game, i need to find that today actually. anyone doing anything exciting this weekend? i think i'm playing baseball/softball sometime this weekend, thats exciting isn't it? haha. work last week was incredibly bad, busy pretty much every day, stayed OT and got it all done, big-ups to me, so i rewarded myself with vegas. ahh vegas, where have you been....i didn't actually win anything, not like some people who win 9000 pennies on a penny machine, but it was fun nevertheless, and the room was kinda nice, thanks skimmy and la sports guy. Here are 10 random thoughts to ponder and if you are bored enough, answer...haha 1. Why is the Sopranos sooo good? The look in adrianna face in the car....priceless. 2. Why do the dodgers frustrate me so much? 3. How cool is New Orleans going to be in November? 4. How does mac prevent himself from going insane with doing ........... all day? 5. Why do people like to get in other people's biz at work? 6. How disgustingly hot is it going to be this summer? 7. Will I ever be able to keep my room clean? 8. Does anyone still care about American Idol, when you have the magic of WB Superstar USA on? 9. Why do bad actors continuously make movies, and why do people see them? 10. Why do we all still have to wait a year for episode 3.  Yeah i'm bored..........

      this happens everytime. you like a small band. you like their accessibility. and then they suddenly start getting popular. and instead of the el rey, they play the wiltern. and you're surrounded by people who don't know their early songs, only the hit single. and it's good for the band. i mean, they need to eat. but at the same time, they don't have to stand near these pseudo fans. although they might be sad if they actually met them. "you like our music? hm. well, you bought our cd at least. wait? you didn't? you just burned a copy from a friend? man!" anyway, i went to see death cab for cutie last night and it was one of their best performances. and they played several classics. but the audience only really cheered for the transatlanticism tracks. transatlanticism is not their best album. it's mediocre compared to the photo album or we have the facts and we're voting yes. but fine. whatever. cheer on dcfc newbie fans. yesterday was also my last day at work. while i was typing my goodbye email, i was actually a little sad. very very minutely, but still i felt a little sadness. i guess i've been there long enough to miss... something. but there was no way i regretted leaving.

      omg omg omg gilmore girls is soooooooo good, so very good. tonight's ep was great for a number of reasons the main one being lorelai and luke finally share their first kiss :). oh and lane was in the ep and rory and dean do it, which was actually quite a surprise. okay but enough. i just have to say i can't wait for season five.   here are some movie reviews - (since my ratings are gone on this new site i'm just going to use stars, so 5 stars is good and 1 star is bad.  win a date with tad hamilton: 1.5 star and the 0.5 is due to topher grace and kate bosworth. topher grace is great, he is just so ... funny charming in the dorky way. as for kate bosworth i thought for sure i would be annoyed with her but strangely i found her quite charming as well. go figure. good pick orlando bloom.  something's gotta give: 3.9 stars ... i would almost give it a 4 but eh. diane k. and jack n. are great in this movie, their chemistry is real and the dialogue between the two is actually really believeable. of course the ending was very predictable but i liked that it wasn't a young couple getting together where the movie ends on this note of they are going to get married and have kids and grow old together because well diane k. and jack n. are already old so they are just going to get married and love each other.   hero (to be in limited release in the US Aug. 20th, orginally released in Dec. 19, 2002): 5 stars. wonderful film, i loved the color, the acting, the background, the music, all of it. just superb. tony l. and maggie c. have great chemistry together and let's face it ... tony is so hot :) and wonderful. hee hee. jet li is great in it as well, everyone does a great job. i would like to see it in the theater though because i think it would give the movie a different feel.    ituning:  cheat - the clash

      read this  urlLink story  about Michael Moore's new movie while on my lunchbreak. the part that really got to me was this:  "Moore talks with resident Lila Lipscomb during her daily routine, hanging an American flag in front of her house. He returns later as Lipscomb heart-wrenchingly reads the final letter from her son, Michael Pedersen, killed in action in Iraq. As her patriotism turns to bitterness against the federal government, Lipscomb journeys to Washington, D.C. Near the end of "Fahrenheit 9/11," Lipscomb stares at the White House and says, "I finally have a place to put all my pain and anger."   do i love america? yes and no. do i hate america? yes and no. when t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y, dorkus and i were in spain ... t.w.i.f.o.s.l.y and dorkus said i love spain, it is so much better than the us. i didn't say much to that.  am i pro american?? yes and no. sometimes i think it is too easy to say "oh i hate america ... it is so stupid and they think they are better than everyone else". of course there are horrible horrible things that america has done and is going to do but why did my parents, and for that matter many of the people on this blog page and friends you know, come here if they didn't think they could have made a better life for themselves and their children??? i don't get that. i think back then america had better values and standards. if anything the fabric of american society is the one that's all messed up.   in the end my feelings towards this country won't make any changes ... there will still be some evil white male in the white house and the rich will continue to be rich and the poor will continue to struggle and people in southern california will find the need to purchase a suv and buy more crap. so basically i'm saying i'm just apathic towards whether i love or hate america.  oh and side note last night's simpson was very insightful and pretty much discussed this very matter. i know people think it is some stupid cartoon but if they paid attention they might find out it is pretty fucking clever.   playing:  whatever is on indie 103.1

      Hey everyone. Yesterday I went to see Ben Kweller at the Henry Fonda. When I go to certain shows like that I feel so old. Literally all high schoolers or even junior high schoolers. And all their parents are waiting for them at the back of the venue. The venue didn't even stocked their bar. They had weird beers I've never heard of because I guess they figured no one would drink. Anyway, BK was good but work makes me so tired that I went upstairs and kind of took a nap in one of the chairs. Geez, I feel old. Ok. No more whining. The mag that I'm freelancing for was in the L.A.Times Calendar section. In an article on LA based, counter culture publications. It's pretty cool.  I've learned any publicity is good publicity. I mean look at Gigli. It got such horrible reviews but people still went to see it out of curiousity.  On a random note, I bought a bag that looks like a keyboard. I like objects that resemble another object. Haha. Of course New Wave thinks it's hideous. Always a sign that it has a stamp of approval.

      random why thoughts:  why does seeing old hs people always have to feel so awkward. why does everyone who works in accounting HAVE to get a BMW. why do rich kids who get everything they want complain about their life sucking, wtf. why does everyone know at least one person from Alhambra High School, dang that place is too big.  movie review:  mean girls: 5.0 i guess .... i'm honestly not sure what to think of this film. it was interesting to say the least. the good - it did show how messed up and hard it is to be a teenage girl. it hurts ... all the stuff girls do to each other, the janitor from scrubs plays lindsay lohan's dad, a lot of SNL cast members in it, tina fey did write it, tim meadows is cool, lindsay lohan is cool .... now to the bad - the film took place in illinois but i'm sorry those girls looked like they stepped out of santa monica or something, way too materialist for me to handle at some parts that i wanted to vomit,  lindsay lohan is not cool sometimes, lots of stereotypes, far-fetched at some points that i rapidly lost interest.   ever after (i know this movie is old but i watched it again the other day because i was bored): 7.0 yea i know it is totally make believe but i like how strong drew barrymore's character was ... and drew barrymore was quite charming in the the film so that was a draw. of course there are some huge unbelieveable parts like da vinci and stuff but eh. oh and i really like angelcia houston, she plays the best villian type roles .... the best.    ituning:  hope - r.e.m

      i saw this review of the movie new york moment and started laughing hence my posting.....dorkus if this movie isn't calling for you then i don't know what is, as you are the master of the train wreck movies.   "People in movies tend to fall into two categories. Some are actors and some are movie stars. A few are both. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson are not actresses and they are not movie stars. What they are is a brand. If their videos and television shows were food, they would be a Happy Meal. That makes this movie the supersized version, reliable and reasonably enjoyable, but of questionable nutritive value and possibly leaving you feeling a little queasy."   sweet........i may blog again later......could be a slow day  ............bronger out

      here are a few ratings for you all since thats what people have been putting up.  Elephant: I dl this one the other day and finally got around to watching. Its very artsy and its attempting to be different and just out there. I did like however how the characters were all linked together and everything that you see in the background comes back around another time. It leaves you wondering what now? well at least it did for me. Its is somewhat slow as everyone knows what is going to happen, but it takes forever to get to that point, well not really forever as the movie is only an hour and fifteen minutes. Anyway I would give this movie a 7.0 in that its an interesting subject, keeps your attention. Could have been stronger with more character development. Anyway if anyone wants to watch it let me know.   The Girl Next Door: I dl this one a little while ago. It was pretty bad, but not as bad as i thought it was going to be. I mean its pretty unbelievable, but there are some humorous moments. Overall I would say that its a decent movie to watch if you have about an hour and a half to kill and want to laugh. So basically its like a 5.0. haha.  Star Wars Episode III bootlegged footage: Yeah this gets a 10.0.....its basically the anakin and obi-wan practicing their lightsaber duel. Its looks pretty cool to me, and i'm a dork hence the ultra high rating.   Anyway tough and long week so far. Kinda messed up at work yesterday which sucked and i ended up slicing my thumb on glass in two different places (don't ask how). Can't wait for the weekend to get here. I so feel like sleeping in. Also not having your car (its in the shop for accident repairs) sucks really bad. Question of the day: Why do people turn off their cell phones? I can understand putting them on silent, but why turn them off, isn't the point of having one is to have others reach you? It boggles the mind........bronger out

      something i've been meaning to post ....  The Cure: "The End of the World (Live on The Tonight Show)" 12 years ago, Robert Smith composed what surely would have ranked among the greatest goodbyes in rock history. Sparked by the guitar-heavy shoegaze movement, he concluded 1992's Wish with the furious fuck-off "End", which begins, "I think I've reached that point/ Where giving up and going on/ Are both the same dead end to me/ Are both the same old song." It's now quite obvious how literal the song was: Smith checked out over a decade ago. Fans have only themselves to blame for expecting anything more than his trademarked "'Q!" after every song. Last Friday, Brent DiCrescenzo and I picked up a six-pack of Stella and sat down to figure out what "The End of the World" could possible add to a story beset by cloying, incestuous pap like "Cut Here", "Want" and "Maybe Someday". I'd given Bloodflowers a pass for the excellent opener "Out of this World", but most of the record was garbage, and as time goes on, it's aging about as well as Smith himself. Which brings up The Cure's crucial problem-- one I addressed in my review of Join the Dots: When you sell smooth skin and twentysomething sexuality, you're going to hit a major wall when your looks go. Simon Gallup's still got it, but the rest of the band melt under the lights; as Brent pointed out, unlike Bowie, The Cure never changed: Smith's look is such a trademark that he can't evolve. And so, he disintegrates.  Jaws on the floor, we watched as Fat Bob-- who in his defense doesn't look much worse than he did in 2000-- phoned in his Tonight Show performance, wielding a matte black nu-metal Telecaster knockoff and playing one-finger drop-D barre chords to a grating Moog line. By the time the band got to the "Oooooooo-weeeeeeeee-oooooooo" bridge, we couldn't even look at the screen. "Maybe he's just been listening to too much Alex Harvey," I offered. "You know he's recording a version of 'Faith Healer' with the band." Brent shattered my desperate search for a credible explanation, cracking his last beer and laughing, "Maybe he's been listening to too much Get Up Kids." At the very least, we can say Ross Robinson and Blink 182 have exposed The Cure to some dire American music from the last five years, and, much like Smith's credibility, it has rubbed off. [Chris Ott; May 3rd, 2004]  darn pitchfork and their snobbery ... ugh.    ipoding:  gleaming auction - snow patrol

      hee hee just sent 10 or more e-mails to kroq requesting the new cure song "the end of the world" :)  i'll send maybe 30 more tomorrow at work when i'm bored. can't wait. :)  thanks for mentioning the whole movie thing dorkus ... here are some of my movie reviews:  love actually (now on dvd): 4.5 not awful but pure fluff, there were some highlights ... personally i think alan rickman and emma thomson were too good to be in that b rated movie.  mona lisa smiles (saw on the plane back from spain): 1.9 and that's me being kind. the only thing that saved that piece of crap was the two minutes tori amos was in it. dang that movie blew, no storyline, no character development, you don't care for ANY of the characters and why should you .... what a stinker.  kill bill vol. 2: 9.0 though not as violent as the first installment a nice ending for the film overall. strong marks for that whole chinese old school kung fu movie bit part ... with uma and pei mei (?). made me think of when i was a litte kid watching the jade channel.  moving away from movies ... how great was gilmore girls today. oh my gosh that show rocks.     ituning:  a night like this - my cure coachella playlist :)

      aw poor new wave.  yeah i don't like the heat and most of the time i don't like people...so i'm kinda glad i didn't go...but it's not like i would have been in the crowd.  i would have been attending to those ppl who passed out, broke something, etc.  so i just stayed home and watched movies all weekend haha.  here are my short and simple ratings.  man on fire-7.5; it's been getting mixed reviews but i liked it.  denzel and dakota fanning did a good job, it may have been a little slow at the beginning but it's all exposition so it was somewhat necessary.  mean girls-8; i liked it because it was sort of weird and it was funny pluse lindsay lohan is in it :)  tina fey wrote the movie...talented woman  13 going on 30---yea yea it was chick flick day for me on Saturday...anyway i give it an 8.5 partly because jennifer garner was so charming in it and partly because it was just a cute goofy movie.    Love actually...i've seen this before but i bought the DVD so haha i would say it is a 10.  it encompasses all emotion that comes with love.  the story is great, the collection of actors are awesome and it's not all sugar sweet at the end...it tells the truth and there's not a happy ending for everyone.    ok back to lecture!

HOT, HOT, HOT AND I HATE PEOPLE EVEN MORE. and no not because they rub their sweaty bodies over me i can handle that ... or that they all have to smoke weed all the time ... or that they are just dumbasses ... no no see i hate people even more because they ARE NOT FUCKING REAL CURE FANS. so i'm in the pit, i'll say like 5 ft from the barrier part, unable to breathe, see or even stand. i kid you not. i know now why people have died in those things. long story short before the cure even came on i had to get out :( .... it was just too much and i knew it would only get worst once the cure got on stage. it was like a crushing force on my body, i kid you not i could not beathe and i thought i would break a body part (sigh). and to top it off the fuckheads around me were not cure fans, they were the "hey i'm at some stupid big event and i want to get to front so i can say i was at the front of this stupid big event". fucking coachella and the whole sold out-ness. pigern and i both agreed last yr was THOUSAND times better. :(   but don't pretend to pity me yet ... though i did get out of the pit i did find a nice much more relaxing spot to watch my boys and i know you won't believe me when i write this but don't worry rancid girl and pigern will back me up ... the cure were amazing. they are seriously a wonderful band to see live. they played all their hits and i mean all like lovecats, boys don't cry, just like heaven, push, inbetween days .... even i was surprised. they also intergrated some new songs which let me tell you are really good. i think this new album is going to kick both bloodflowers and wild mood swings out of the water. much darker and yet poppy. i'm loving it already and can't wait till june 29th :)  oh and a funny story to me getting out of the pit ... i had to go over the fence part so some security guard had to help out well ... well while coming down i guess i did not get a good footing or i let go too soon cause the next thing i knew i came crashing down on the floor on my ass/back with EVERYONE in the pit and the security guards staring at me most likely thinking "wow look at the chubby asian girl with glasses take that fall" and laugh. gosh i'm such a fucking loser, like honestly i'm a fucking loser ..... (shaking my head) .... (sigh).  okay must sleep but i hope all you have a great day at work ......

      hey all i have not blogged for quite some time.  i started school 2 weeks ago and i have only had time to study for the most part.  i have no internet connection at home right now, so i have very limited opportunites to use a computer, but i do not miss it much.  i do miss my beautiful fantasy baseball team though, but i get to check up on it every once in a while.  i do not watch the tube at all anymore, and i can gladly say that i do not miss any of the craptacular shows.  tv is evil and horrible.  i am keeping up with some current events though.  for instance the last beheading.  i feel terrible for what happened to him, he was not even a military man, he was just there to help out, but he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.    diclaimer:  i do not point this fact out because i am korean, but i do so because i believe it is morally/ethically wrong to force someone/thing/country, to do something they do not want to do, but are forced to do so out of a necessity for their own safety.  okay so here is what pisses me off, the president of the U.S. stated, to quote loosely, that he is sad that this happened, but will not be deterred by these acts of violence and will continue on his mission, and that these threats do not scare him.  i know that the previous 2 beheadings were of american citizens, but this last guy was a korean citizen.  so why was this korean guy beheaded in the first place?  oh i know why, because the president decided to tell (threaten) the south koreans that he would start pulling troops out of S. Korea, (12,000 out of 36,000 and then subsequently more) if they did not help by sending in korean troops to a war that they should not even be involved with.  this is a bunch of b.s.  obviously the south koreans need the "protection" from the u.s. military, because of the threat of north korea, but the president is using it as a "strategory" piece to have another country supposedly be on their side.  this is some major B.S., if south korea would have helped with free will, then so be it, but it should not be because they were pretty much imposed on (forced) to do so.  those of you who will say, that S. Korea owes the U.S. their gratitude for helping them in the Korean war, are right.  but remember the U.S. was not forced to bring their troops over to Korea, they were asked for help, and they   offered  their help for more than one reason.  one being to actually help out, but the other to gain a foothold in Asia.  this is totally different from that, and i cannot cover all the bases by blogging, but  please feel free to post or leave a message on anything that i may have left out, and i will try to answer to the best of my capabilities.

      I agree w/ Sluts like You. I don't want the page to be shut down. Where else are we going to rant and rave about falling down stairs and having your friends laugh at you? Or complain about how much work it takes to rave across America? My arms hurt from all that glowstick twirling. Anyway, jokes aside, it doesn't take that much time to moderate this site does it?   Is threatening to shut down the blog page a game? Is that a game?

       ok, so i know i havent posted in a long time, but i just feel the need to express something right now.  WTF is up with these teen girls covering 80s songs???  ok, so it wouldnt be so bad if they didnt butcher the songs and would actually do them justice.  britney's "i love rock & roll", jessica's "take my breath away" and i just saw the (horrible) video for hillary duff (& i think her sister) "our lips are sealed"  AWFUL!! :-X ok thats all i have to say right now. cheers oh yeah, and is recording terrible covers of 80s songs a game? is that a game? is that a game? one more thing:  new wave, i dont think u should shut us down, where else will i be able to vent about stupid things in the world and know that i can get at least some support???  FOR THE CHEESE!

      to start off .... happy birthday darth. you are old like the rest of us .... blah blah.   okay i didn't really want to say anything because well .... i didn't but has anyone noticed this house ... the blogpage ... is basically dying. i'm tempted to put it out of its misery soon. no one blogs anymore ... at all. what gives. okay granted i don't even blog. what is going on ??? give me some feedback people. should i just shut the house down????? let me know.  nothing much to report on my end. i'm going through a bored out of my mind crisis where i'm attempting to find something that will peak my interest but if any of you know me i get bored with things quickly so eh. i mean i ran my head around certain hobbies to pick up - guitar (from my friend pete), cooking, computer programing, drawing, real estate, trying to get my series 7 (though very unlikely ... ha ha) and so on. yea i've been coming up with blanks. i don't need some huge life changing thing ... just something to kill time till i die. ha ha i mean till i have work on monday again. okay enough i'm done.    listening:  to nothing but my crazed thoughts .......

      Weird and sad. They found a dead body in the field across from my workplace today. So the rest of the afternoon was spent staring out the window in binoculars trying to figure out what's going on. Bunch of cop cars and CSI trucks. Turns out an airplane model flyer found it. The cops even came to our building to ask if we had surveillance tapes for the surrounding area.

      Wow, could this week be going any slower? seriously, i thought yesterday was a friday, but alas, friday is still a day away...yikes. Lets update us all on whats been going on. saw harry potter last friday, it was alright, not as good as the previous one in my opinion. Watched all the reagan funeral ceremonies. I guess it was like what a royal funeral would be like, very dignified with many dignitaries, and very emotional. when nancy held the casket one last time and whispered "i love you" it was heartbreaking, to know that she spent the past 10 years in full care of him..all you can say is wow...and if you haven't read part of the letter he wrote to her, read them, that is what love is. on a lighter note i passed by the santa ana school of arts today, wow dorkus, if you ever wanted to find your emo man/boy go drive by..plenty of skinny kids with lots of hair sitting on the grass, doing whatever it is that kids do....i just found it funny how they all had the same look. i really want to go home right now, have i mentioned that? well i do...haha....softball team starts this coming tuesday, i really don't have any high expectations being that we haven't practiced as a team, and just kinda came together to say yeah i guess we'll play. summer tv schedule is back, which means not a whole heck of a lot...except more time playing playstation 2....i'm not saving the world like mac did, but i am helping the dodgers to win their first world series game in more than 15 years!!! Lakers lost...will they be dismantled now and look more like the clippers? probably not, but it would be interesting to see what would happen if the starting players were slava, rush, george, fisher, and shaq....somehow that doesn't equal championship to me..call me crazy. good gosh 20 more minutes, i can't do this....haha...oh well. i'm entering a dead pool draft tomorrow, in case you don't know what that is, its when you all draft 3 people that you think are going to die soon. everyone gets different people, so whoever dies first the person with that person gets the pot...any random suggestions? i know johnny ramone, i hope to have the first pick, cause then thats basically money, but anyone know of anyone else?

      Greetings Everyone!  Wow, it's been a very long time since I last blogged...so long that I forgot my username and password! :) I think the last time I blogged was BEFORE my trip to Asia.  I'll spare you the details but I will say that everyone should try to go to Beijing if they ever have an opportunity.  The Great Wall and Forbidden City were awesome!  I'll try to post some pictures up as soon as I have a chance.  Even though there were 7 of us traveling, for the most part there was no drama.  Everybody got along which since 6 out of 7 of us were girls is pretty amazing. One girl though was interesting and made one of my friends cry while we were at the Great Wall.  Pretty funny huh...but my favorite quote from her was while we were at this makeup store in Korea, and almost all of us were in line to buy makeup.  It's a store that's known to sell inexpensive makeup that's pretty decent quality.  So while we were in line we asked her if she was going to get anything and she said "No, that's like putting Loreal on my face." Thanks for saying that while I'm buying something!  Anyways, I'm a bit nervous about the game tonight (Lakers vs. Pistons).  L.A. has the worst fans ever!  I listen to Laker talk in the morning and all these "Laker fans" were calling in talking about how we're going to get swept in this series.  It was one game!  Don't even get me started with ghetto Dodger fans.

      Hey you guys, just wanted to let you know that I got served last night. I'm okay, even though I got served here and here and here. Seriously though, this movie is so horribly bad it's great. I mean, come on, one of the characters (played by Steve Harvey) is named Mr. Rad... Mr. Rad!!! And his best worst line goes something like this: "Okay, you guys, after the dance off, we're all going to shake hands and be friends because friendship is the most important thing." Oh, excuse me while I vomit. Thanks. I'm back now. Steve Harvey is NOT funny - he is like the black Rick Dees.   Also, another character is named Beautifull. "with two L's." Please. You ugly.   Bad script (laughable though), nothing makes sense, random things happen, the OC kids are annoying - too bad they didn't have a big white raised truck, really good dance moves (you have to give them credit for that - those dancers have some crazy moves), best worst lines ever.  Best scene: After the OC kids get served, everyone joins in with a "Served! Served! Served! Served!" chant. Really.  As far as dance movies go, I have seen way worse (Honey, Bring It On Again). At least this one was entertaining in a good bad way...Really though, wouldn't I just be in heaven if they came out with Not Another Dance Movie??? I'm in!

      Another note. Today, my cousin got a silver mercedes for her 18th birthday. This seriously disgusts me. Her mother probably thinks of it as a great display of her love, when in reality it is more of an attempt to show people how much money you have. And a poor way of teaching your kids the value of hard work. How about putting that money towards college?

      I went to pick up medication at the pharmacy today and got lectured by my pharmacist.  She asked me how old I was and based on my reply, she told me that I better be married soon...before it's too late.  Who does she think she is....my mother???  Even my mom isn't that straight foward.  Well, it turns out that my pharmacist got married at 37 (yikes) and is spending $15,000 to do invitro fertilization where she'll only have 30%-34% chance of success.  If I'm 37 and childless...I'm opting for adoption.

      does anyone know why coldplay has a  urlLink book  out after two albums ?? i know they always put out books about bands but come on. the author of the book was on kevin and bean this morning and he spoke of how coldplay was up there with U2 status. what ?? after two albums.  i read some random message posted on  urlLink Insound  on how good bands are being played on bad radio stations. in this case it was the massive hit "float on" by modest mouse on some pop station 92.5 fm. i have noticed a growing trend towards embracing this cool new "indie" music. in the july 9th issue of entertainment weekly (michael moore on the cover) they do an entire article about "the return of (good) alt-rock. the article goes on to list must have albums for any indie loving kid - franz ferdinand (too poppy for my taste), death cab for cutie (lead by the indie kids messiah mr. ben gibbard), modest mouse (how many albums did they have out till they got popular ... like 6), yeah yeah yeahs (pretenders wanna bes), interpol (joy division copycats though their new album i think they are trying to find their own sound which is good), the postal service (see death cab for cutie), the shins, and the killers who sold out all three of their LA shows in seriously 10 seconds. i find all of this relatively funny because ... well it is just another trend passing through until the next big wave of music cool comes along ... after all at one point limp bizkit and linkin park were once the coolest bands ever. enjoy the time in the spotlight indie bands !!  speaking of indie ... i got to see a one day in advance (since the film opens in limited release tomorrow) of garden state, the new zach braff movie, hosted by indie 103.1 fm. i won't go into long detail about the movie but i will say for a directorial debut zach braff did an excellent job. i liked the way he shot the film and how quiet some scenes were. the plot is simple and the pace of the movie is slow but it works. natalie portman is good, her role in this film was different from her other work. i personally think zach braff is better comically then as a dramatic actor but who knows. the movie reminded me a lot of punchdrunk love, simple with a love story and a comic actor (adam sandler) playing a serious role. just my two cents. grade: B+       ituning:  this morning - the cure :)

      Pigern, I can't believe that guy said that to you. Some people are so ignorant and will never know any better. You should have told him Chinatown is right around the corner from his house in Asshole Alley. Pffttt.  This weekend, I&nbsp;saw Steve Burns at Spaceland. For those of you who don't know, he is the ex host of Blue's Clues. I went bc my friend wanted to go and so I tagged along. I had never even seen a single episode of Blue's Clues. Anyway, the crowd was sooo random. Spaceland is in Silverlake, so you expect trendy l.a. hipsters right? Wrong! I think the 909 was sponsoring a field trip bc everyone there looked like they belonged in Fresno or Fontana. Some people looked like they were supposed to be at Dublin's. Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, I think Steve Burns was attempting to come across as artsy and abstract (he had a projection screen behind him w/ audiovisual images and video clips), but it&nbsp;was just plain annoying. He was trying too hard.

      Oh my racist. I'm getting ice cream with my friend and a man intercepts us and asks, "Where's Chinatown?" So I pause thoughtfully and tell him, "Well, if you take the 110..." And he laughs and says, "No no I'm just kidding. Get it? Haha." Because my friend and I were both Chinese. My friend had walked away ignoring the man while I was trying to give him directions. I guess I'm just gullible. I told him, "That's not funny" with a dead serious expression and he replies, "Yes it is!" as he walks away. I'm always shocked when I experience something like that.

      dang i'm pretty sleepy but tomorrow is friday so i'll just blog ... and i'll do it in list form:  1. work is the same except i got into a little "agrument" with my boss, that was ugly.  2. parents gone for a few days ... how will i fend for myself :(  3. getty's photo exhibit will be ending this sunday .... and i still have not seen it  4. i want to go on vacation ... oh hk and spain i miss you  5. six feet under season 4 is so weak right now  6. they came out with new ipods .... 5 more gb than mine and the same price, but alas i already have one ...&nbsp; hmmm but i could always use another, hee hee 7. dodgers are playing their little hearts out  8. i love carpet, i love desk, i love lamp .... which leads me to my second part of my blog   movie reviews (due the hour and time i won't write up huge reviews ... sorry):   anchorman: the legend of ron burgandy - one word ... random. another word ... weird. that movie made little to no sense AT ALL. it had its moments of humor but it was quite strange.&nbsp;after all the movie&nbsp;had a 30 sec animation scene and subtitles. wtf i know. but it does have great characters ... my personal favorite was brick tamland because he ate a big red candle. ha ha. grade: C+   napoleon dynamite - okay, not bad but not great. no where near as good as some strange people seem to think it is. nothing original being done or said and you never know if you are suppose to like or dislike any of the charactes.&nbsp;two things saved the movie for me .... 1. tina majorino who played deb because she is so cute and she was the little girl from corrina corrina and 2. when napoleon dances at the end of the movie .... WOW i can watch that 50 times over and over. love it. grade: B-   muriel's wedding (netflix) - more serious than i thought but good. brenda (rachel griffiths) from six feet under is in the film which is cool but toni collette is awesome in it and i LOVE the abba songs. grade: B-   the station agent (netflix) - good strong character movie. nothing much happens but you get a chance to know who these people are and actually care about them. peter dinklage who played finbar gave a great performance. i wish i had a chance to catch this movie when it was in theatres but no harm done. grade: A   triplets of belleville (netflix) - great animation, story a bit odd and kooky but it works. the triplets are great and the music was wonderful. i thought it was funny how i was watching it while the whole tour de france thing was beginning and stuff. ha ha. grade: A-

      I heard on the radio and then read online today that some of the spectators at the Tour de France were spitting at Lance Armstrong as he rode by. Hey way to go classy french people, lets spit at someone who happens to be an american who is winning your race. The man was on his death bed at one point and&nbsp;has overcome to become one of the greatest atheletes today. The millions of dollars he has raised for cancer research and the&nbsp;thousands of cancer patients he has visited in hospitals i guess just doesn't mean so much anymore. Way to go frenchie....good gosh

      It's been horribly hot these past few days. You know it's bad when you sit still and still feel sweaty.   Dorkus, I read your brief summary about your Philly trip on myspace. It sounds like you enjoyed yourself. : ) And it just heightens my desire to go travel somewhere. Preferably somewhere cooler than here. Ack. Too hot.  As for films, yes, Darth would see both Anchorman and Dodgeball, which seem like the same film with a few costume changes. They're all cookie cutter comedies. I mean let's see something with heart. Like Cinderella Story. C'mon people. Haha.  If anyone wants to check out a great live band: Monday night, 7/26 The Blood Arm plays Spaceland. Oh so much fun. And it's free so you can't argue about the price.

      Hey Party People whats up? I'm bored at work today so I guess I will blog. I was on vacation last week and I'm sure all of you missed me right? Nothing big just drove up to Santa Cruz to spend time at our old cottage which i haven't done in a few years. Got off to a great start as I got a nice speeding ticket on the 101...apparently you can't go 96 mph up there? odd i know...haha, but yeah i'm waiting to see what the damage will be when the bill comes, anyone want to take any guesses? Went to see a Giants game at SBC park in San Fran too, I really liked the stadium, it felt small and very close to the field, which i enjoyed, I highly recommend everyone to check it out, I liked it better than Petco in San Diego. Quick movie reviews:  &nbsp;  Dodgeball: 7.0 its pretty funny and gets the usual cast of characters together. Its somewhat predictable but is still very entertaining to watch just cause Vince Vaughn gets to play a challenging part....himself..haha  &nbsp;  Anchorman: 7.0 I laughed harder for this movie than I did for Dodgeball, but it didn't have much of a story, but movies like that are usually based upon the funny one-liners. Will Ferrell is great, and the cameos had me busting up.....I love lamp.  &nbsp;  Went to the Espys last night thanks to my friend, had great seats, so good that I actually got to sit in back of a huge star..Lebron, nope, Denzel, nope..tom cruise..ha you wish, i got to sit in back of Jenna Van Oy, thats right Six from Blossom, I so wanted to yell WHOA!!! when someone won, but i didn't, darn.  &nbsp;  Softball season is off to a pretty sad start, we easily could be 2-0 but instead we are 0-2. Last week was quite depressing, as one of our team members was illegally run over by the other team and the correct call wasn't made which set off lots of yelling and swearing and thus the attitudes dropped as we did the game. We have a rematch this sunday so you can all come out to watch, i know you are dying too!!  &nbsp;  Anyway thats about all for me now. Hopefully I can put some pictures up soon. Hasta

      Well, Hedwig, New Wave did her Cure squeal upon seeing your post. Ha. That's a pretty good shot though. Your trip sounds amazing. I wish I could experience all that. At the risk of whining, I went after work to run some simple errands and the whole trip turned into an ordeal. While in line at Target, the woman in front of me was on the phone and would not put it down ... even as she had to enter her pin number. She just kept talking as the screen prompted her. Hello? People are waiting! And then at Coffee Bean there were five people working that shift but only one person making the drinks. Does that make sense? The drinks took forever as the other four employees shifted around and took up space. Anyway, it was all just a waste of time.

      Hey New Wave, I just saw Dodge Ball this weekend!  I thought the movie started slow but it got better when the characters started their "training".  So i went to my first office party.  It was on a 3 hour cruise around Newport Harbor.  30 mins into the trip, I decided I really didn't want to be stuck on a boat with people from work.  I think it's because most of them are either too old, too old and single, or just too boring...even with drinks.  Anyway....can't wait till the Christmas party.

      so the cure wasn't at the warped tour rancid girl ??? ha ha. excellent about the wasted girl and the bj. class act.  so not much to report ... but when is there ever. ha ha. i'll just make this a blog about movies i've seen:  dodgeball - not as funny as i thought it could be but still some good stuff. vince vaughn isn't really acting in this film so much as just being himself, it is almost like he is saying hey can i have my paycheck for reading these lines. ben stiller was good but after awhile his character gets tiresome and repeative. it was good to see stephen root (the guy who plays milton from office space) in there, the dodgeball battles, and jason bateman as a commentor. ha ha. grade: B+  spiderman 2 - better than 1 but that's not saying much because i was not a huge fan of the first one. much like most sequals this one went right into the story and didn't spend the first hour explaining all about the characters and their relations to each other. i must say i'm still not a fan of kristen dunst or her work but she does pull off mary jane. i never was a huge marvel comic fan aside from x-men but spiderman 2 is entertaining. grade: B  fahrenheit 9/11 - go see the movie, form your own opinions and have a good discussion with other people about how you feel. grade: B  frida (dvd) - a biography movie about the artist frida kahlo, good movie, strong characters and all around great acting from salma hayek and alfred molina. grade: A-  bad santa (dvd) - nothing clever but still entertaining, the characters are all hatable yet you root for them esp. billy bob's character, the young boy who befriends billy bob is sweet ... ha ha and fat. if anything the movie is a good for the anti christmas message it brings. grade: B-  chocolat (vhs) - slow, very very slow and slightly long, judi d. seems to play all the same roles, juliette binoche was good but seriously the movie is so misleading because johnney depp was hardly in it. boooooo. and what is up with carrie-anne moss looking all lady-like. hello that is trinity. ha ha. anyone noticing an alfred molina thing going on here. grade: B-  i'll see more movies later ....  my computer is broken so i've been using whatever computers i can get my hands on. in this case my dad's. (sigh) i really don't want to buy a new computer but i'll have to. wtf. oh well.

      sorry i haven't blogged.  i'm in europe...amsterdam to be exact.  yes i went to a coffee house and yes i had a space cake and then some.  all in good fun.  just wanted to write a quick hello and give greetings from the land where bikes always have right of way above everything including people, where you can go window shopping for women 24 hours/7 days a week and where the MJ is tolerated/legal.  here's one interesting part of my tour; last night i watched a live sex show. and that's exactly what it was....it was live, there were people having sex on stage for show.  pretty crazy.  i watched people on stage having sex; different people....for a whole hour.  there were strippers also.    highlights of the trip: white water rafting in austria, staying on top of mount pilatus in switzerland-the view was awesom, Paris-all of it, Italy-all of it, the friendly people in the Netherlands  sucky things on the trip: shnitzel(me no likey), veal sausage(blech), all french food that is bland as all hell, walking an hour to find a crappy place to eat, paying for water and getting irritated at your friends cuz you've been on the road for 21 days.   going home in 2 days! take care all

      I went to the Warped Tour on Friday and it was okay.  The line was really really really long to get in.  I waited for about 2 hours!  There was this drunk girl infront of me who served as comic reflief.  She was totally wasted.  At one point, she proceeded to give her guy friend a blow job!! It was great!  There were actually a lot of parents at the warped your which made me feel old.  My "groupie" moment was shaking hands with the lead singer of Stretch Armstrong.  I wanted to buy their cd, but why bother?  My friend has their cd already; I can just burn a copy.

      to answer your question dorkus - wero8opbjlatyfajklewiguvjlaek. i hope that helps. ha ha.  hedwig i want to see all your europe pictures ... rad.  vegas was fun mac ... for the few hours i saw you and hector. too bad you guys couldn't have stayed longer and kicked it with us. some people from the house went to lost wages aka las vegas as my cuz likes to call it. didn't gamble much or drink ... boooooooo but i did get to go shopping. wow my favorite activity next to getting a paper cut. the only plus of the trip was seeing the blue man group, the drum and bass for that show is awesome.   rambling: my uncle and two cuz came down from toronto to hang with the family this week, i'm getting OT at work which means money, jude law is suppose to play ian curtis the lead singer of joy division who committed suicide in 1980 (can't say i'm a huge fan of this idea),watched freaks (1932) movie and found it to be very odd and cool at the same time, summer is almost over ... then fall and winter and christmas ... dang, thinking of places to travel to .. so far i have thailand, singapore, greece and hawaii on my list .. any takers, my cuz just came back from brazil and loved it .. i want to go, six feet under season four is getting a bit better but not much, when will good fall tv be back on, trading spouses a whacked show, want to get a new tat but that cost money and i'm not sure what design to use, applebee's food is nasty, and lastly ....  cure news: so i'm not sure if the whole house knows but i'm going to three cure shows - SD, LA and SF. the SD one is with rancid girl and LA is with pigern and the SF i'm doing the solo bit. the best part is how everyone keeps telling me they are going to play the same songs. WRONG. so far the cure has played a different setlist every night. how freaking awesome is that. OH YAY. granted about 70% of the songs will be the same but there is that 30% that will be different. ROCK.   LOVE THEM !!!     ituning: so what - the cure

      Hurrah for Vegas, Vegas has stuck it to me again.  Taking my money and all.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.  Wish I could of hung out with you guys more, well the ones who were out there.  Anyways, I guess I have been on hiatus for a while from here.  We finally won our first softball game.  It only took us 7 tries.  My pitching was downright unimpressive too, so it was nice to eek one by.  My chemistry class is pretty easy considering I did not pay any attention in high school and it has been like 8 years since I have taken it.  My lab partner is 17.  I feel old now.  Oh yeah, La Toya Jackson looks like Michael now.  That is creepy to me.  My rambling ends here.

      Tonight I saw the Hives at Henry Fonda. It was sponsored by Kroq. Ew ... My face fell when I saw their van at the venue. Anyway, I was grossed out because while I was standing in line, the older men nearby were checking out every girl who passed by. "Nice curves." "Ooh, I'd like that." Blah. And the first opening band Reigning Sound...well, my friend pretended to slit her wrists. He he. But Sahara Hotnights were awesome. Style! Sexy! Rawk! And the Hives also put on a good show. Sooo good. And they know it too, which makes it even better. He he. Luckily, I wasn't on the floor but upstairs with all the parents. That should give you an idea of the audience.

      I bought the latest Dashboard Confessional album today (A Mark, A Mission...). Wait! Before the ridicule...it came with a bonus DVD of the Album Covers show with Michael Stipe. I basically paid $12 for the DVD and got the CD as a "bonus." Anyway, it's pretty uninteresting for me to hear DC sing the REM tunes...but it's really great when Michael Stipe sings "Drive"--and bores the young kids who probably don't know who the heck he is to tears. Stipe also sings "Hands Down," which is a mediocre song but ah, Stipe does a great job. I never realized just how high and squeaky Chris Carrabba's voice is until it's paired with Stipe's. Anyway, all in all the DVD is primarily for DC fans. I like how in the bonus features there is an interview with Stipe that lasts all of three questions and one of them is "Where does 'Automatic From the People' come from?" Durrr! And then DC's interview lasts...well...I don't really know. I got bored and stopped watching it. But if Stipe at leasts respects them, then I guess they're okay. He he.
