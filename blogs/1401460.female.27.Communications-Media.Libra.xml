      Sappiest thing I ever got via e-mail:  "Don't cry and I hope to get this back..........    *In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one.    *In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls.    *In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully.    *In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus.    *In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nick or Smelly Susan.    *In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you.    *In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nick or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed.    *In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had.    *In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears.    *In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only freshman there.    *In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch.    *In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the prom.    *In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college/university, assured you that you would get into that college/university, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go...    *At graduation your idea of a good friend was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you.    *The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for university and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to give you reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved.    *Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the  better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly loves you!   Pass on to those friends of the past, and those of the future...and  those you have met along the way...[crying yet? oh there's more]    Thank you for being a friend. No matter where we go or who we become, never forget who helped us get there.   There's never a wrong time to pick up a phone or send a message telling your friends how much you miss them or how much you love them.    You know who you are, pass it on to someone who you want to remind.    So send this to all your friends and maybe those who aren't but just  watch and see who sends it back.    If you love someone, tell them.  Remember always to say what you mean.   Never be afraid to express yourself. Take this opportunity to tell  someone what they mean to you. Seize the day and have no regrets.    Most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today and are what it's all about anyway. Pass this along to your friends. Let it make a difference in your day and theirs.   The difference between expressing love and having regrets is that the regrets may stay around forever.    Within 1 hour you must send it to other people. Within five days you will have a miraculous occurrence in your relationships. You will find new love or have an old love rekindled. If you do not send it, you will have once again passed up the opportunity to do something loving and beautiful and continue the trend that gives you problems in your relationships. If you've received this it is because someone cares for you and it means there is probably at least someone for whom you care.    If you're too busy to take the few minutes  that it would take right now to forward this  to ten people, would it be the first time you  didn't or that little thing that would make a  difference in your relationships? [oh the guilt!]  And the better you'll get at reaching out to those you care about.    Here's the deal: Forward this letter to at least 10 different people;  within 1 hour of receiving it.  People who care for you and that warm glowy feeling that comes from loving others.    THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT TO YOU  BECAUSE YOU MEAN SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY.  PLEASE SEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS AND  THOSE THAT YOU LOVE. GROWING UP,  YOU WILL TRULY MEET THE FRIENDS  THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME AND WILL  MEAN THE MOST TO YOU.***AND NO MATTER WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU.*** "  All this at a time when my heart feels that it will never heal because the one I love will never come back to me.

      We have a saying in Filipino:  Ang hindi makuha sa santong dasalan, maaring makuha sa santong paspasan.   It translates as "If you can't use prayer to get what you want, then it's high time to start putting on the pressure!"   Very  applicable in a case like mine, huh?

      It has been 180 hours (seven and a half) days since my partner and I last parted ways.  This, however, does not mean that I am surviving.  Heck, only the Saint-John's-wort I take with my meals thrice every day is keeping me together.  I am just grateful that I have so many things to do and am too often occupied for moping and self-pity.  Unless it's a Sunday, of course.  I am beginning to dread Sundays.  Palm Sunday left me incredibly apprehensive because it was the first day he didn't pick up his mobile phone.  Easter Sunday left me jumpy and uneasy, as if I was slowly getting ready for the tempest of the following day.  My blood pressure skyrocketed to 140/90 that day; I was terribly rattled and it didn't help that the day had been sultry and sweltering, the summer heat at its worst.  Last Sunday found me all alone at home and in tears by one in the afternoon.  It has definitely been hell, hell, and still more hell for me.  I wonder if my partner knows what I'm going through right now.  But he's probably in worse shape than I am.  Last time I saw him, my normally confident partner was striding back and forth at the Glorietta, an uneasy expression on his normally optimistic face.  He said he had too many things on his mind.  He couldn't tell me just what.  All he said was that he didn't want to work with me anymore.  That hurt because he gave no reasons.  My aunt tells me that the idle mind is the devil's playground and Old Nick was  really  playing tricks on me: I started blaming myself.  I called myself a shrew.  I called myself a smothering bitch.  I could not seem to do anything right.  I couldn't get my relationships to work right.  I couldn't keep my partner.  I was fat and ugly and  definitely  undesirable.  But now: I have only one thing that keeps me going other than my meds.  It's the thought that I want him back.  Just watch me: I  will  get him back.  See if I don't...

      Depression is definitely something dictated by one's biological make-up and by the phases of the moon.  If you're female, you would understand.  If you're male, forget about ever understanding because I really, REALLY doubt if you ever will!  I've been cranky for the past several days.  And it DOESN'T help that we're going through the motions of the Easter Triduum this week and we are supposed to be meditating on the Passion of Christ - not very conducive to cheerful thoughts, I'm afraid.  To make matters worse, the moon has been full and has taken on the appearance of the God-sized consecration wafer used during solemn High Mass!  (Trust me, I am all but barking, howling, and baying at the moon right now!)  Oh, for the summer to end that the rains may cool my blistering temper!!!

      Last month, I had the opportunity to join a recollection at the Servite seminary just on the outskirts of the city I live in.  In the company of raisins and prunes, if I may be churlish enough to add!  We read through the Gospel of Matthew (Mt. 20:29-34) about the healing of the two blind men sitting by the roadside on the way to Jerusalem.  One of the focal points of the reading was the part where the people told them to shut up because they were making a nuisance of themselves while Christ was passing by.  (Sounds like the book by St. Josemaria Escriva!)  But Christ healed them, anyway.  My life's been like that.  I'm not blind, of course; just seriously myopic.  But I'm not talking about physical blindness here.  Blindness can come in the form of self-hatred and self-loathing, completely blind to the advantages one actually has because we're too busy envying what we see in others.  Blindness is about not caring about how we actually are as opposed to the world around us.    When we have problems, people normally tell us to buzz off or, worse, console us with empty platitudes that offer not a single modicum of peace.  The attempts of those long-ago Jews to silence the pitiful pleas of the blind men are just like that.  People have this tendency to try and dismiss such things as adolescent angst or nonconformity without reason or even the dual threats of depression and suicide as mere trivialities.  But the truth of the matter is that they are cries of helplessness from people at their wits' end, people who have nowhere to go and no one to turn to.  People like ME.

      It's very cold outside right now.  The rains have begun, doing away with the oppressive summer heat - and for that I am most certainly grateful.  Seriously speaking, I've never really liked the summer.  The heat depresses me, beats down my already downtrodden spirit.  They say that the summer was made for passion and ardor, but why was my heart frozen for most of a season characterized by blistering heat?  Why did I have to lose the one I have loved with my entire being during this season said to be filled with happiness?  Why did everything suddenly grow dark in a season punctuated by days filled with seemingly endless sunshine?  In a long-ago journal entry, I wrote in Japanese:  Ame-sama wa atashi no oneesama desu yo.   The blessed rain is my older sister.  It is she who pours down from heaven, cleansing the world below, cooling fevered souls and sizzling tempers.  The rain acts in a similar manner now, laving me free of the dust that has settled upon me, helping me shake off my cares and worries, cleansing and caressing me.  If I had my way, I would stay in bed all day and watch the rain reviving the earth even as I lie beneath my blankets, recuperating from the pains brought about by separation and sorrow.

      I'm writing in one long-ago personal journal entry.  I wrote this on the day I realized I had fallen in love with a most unlikely person:  "I've fallen in love with a mere boy!  Two years younger than me; well, a year, eleven months, and seven days to be exact.  But I'm just a surrogate older sister to him.  At least, that's how things look right now.  Who's to say how they will be in another few months.  Trust me: writing this entry is all I can do to keep myself from flipping all over that sweet boy!"  I wish he'd come back...

      With regard to the previous entry: sometimes it's better to cope with grief if you can turn it into something completely unintelligible.  In my case, I scribbled it down in Italian.  That way, I am the only one who can be able to understand -- and I won't have any pests pestering me about my now nonexistent love life!

      La mia vita è piena delle ombre scure e dismal, immagini torve che frequentano i miei sogni alla notte e seguono i miei punti durante il giorno.  Il mio cuore è rotto e dubito di se guarirà mai o di se potrò mai sorridere ancora...   Li odio.  Che mi hanno causato così tanto il dolore - mi date appena un buon motivo affinchè cui li perdoniate! Siete un gigolo incurable, una bestia vero cattiva che seppellisce la verità sotto una montagna delle bugie dolce bisbigliate, una chi preda alla vulnerabilità di altre!   Molte notti lo hanno hanno speso senza sonno.  Perchè? Poiché passare le mie notti che mi preoccupo - preoccupandosi sopra voi! Molte notti lo hanno hanno pianto a causa di voi, rotture amare sopportate di dispiacere, di essere gettato via. Ora, sono tutto il solo! Molti bisbigli desolati hanno fuoriuscito i miei labbri.   Tuttavia, dove siete?  Chi passare le notti con mentre mi trovo sveglio alla notte, piangendo a causa del dolore di un cuore rotto? Chi è lei? È chiunque che sappia? È più graziosa di me? Più intelligente dell'sono? È una persona più delicata, meno incline agli scoppi di rabbia come sono?   Dicami; Desidero sapere!  Vigliacco!  Lo desidero potrei dirlo allineare li odio per che cosa avete fatto, perché mi non direste la verità ed avete inseguito altre donne ogni volta che non eravamo insieme.   Ma non posso.   Perchè?   Poiché ti amo più della mia propria vita...   ... ed io sempre volontà.

      Do you believe in magic?    Or, better yet: can you still find it in yourself to believe in magic?    Sometimes, we grow up and lose our innocence with regard to things like spells and magic and fairies and dragons.  When that happens, everything seems to lose its color and you can't see anything but black and white.    No shadows.  No rainbows.  The very thought alone sickens me.

      One of the students from another department who opts to hang out with the teachers in ours was an acquaintance of my ex-partner's in college.  (Note to "He-who-must-not-be-named"  (God, that makes him sound like Voldemort from the  Harry Potter  series!  But, then again, he deserves it; his rep isn't exactly what you'd call respectable.  [Neither is mine, but that's a completely different story all together...]):  Hey,  stupid !  If you accidentally come across this blog, I won't let you deny that we did have a relationship of sorts.  You were my associate, surrogate kid brother, best friend, partner-in-crime - and hell yes, I did love you more than life itself.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to play the whole "things best left unsaid" game, I won't let you and I hope you live to regret what you put me through.  I may have lied my way to get the show on the road, but here's the thing:  I got it on the road  - no questions asked.  We were doing fine till you guys started throwing around the fanstuff and got pushy about getting financing ASAP.  Let me tell you something:  IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY !  It takes  years  for a business to get off the ground, especially one of a magnitude like ours.  I wish you all the luck in the world, kiddo; you think you'll be better off without me and my affection and my emotional blackmail -  FINE , kiddo, and have it your way.   I've finally decided not to care anymore and I think we'll be better off that way .)  My former partner turns out to be the sort of kid who acted cute to get the girls' attention.  Unfortunately, he was so young then.  (He was only about fifteen when he entered college - much younger than most of the kids who would be about seventeen and thereabouts when they got in.)  I don't think anyone would have taken a boy that young seriously; sure enough, no one did.    Christian, the former UP-stude-turned-Mapua-kid, is also a bud of Clifton's - the guy my former partner has since learned to abhor like the plague.  The story is rather pitiful in the sense that my former partner tried to be like Cliff who managed to lure all the girls in droves despite the fact that he looked like a dish of oatmeal (or cream of wheat - whichever looks aesthetically off) compared to the boy wonder from Pisay.  The poor kid, of course, could never seem to get the point and managed to spend all his time at UP looking every bit like a boy desperately trying on the airs of a more mature individual.  Sadly - and I, for one, know this best because I spent a lot of time with him - he  never  did get the point and I feel more than a little sorry for him.

      AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH,  finally !  Finals are over, I've encoded my grades and am now looking forward to a right and proper Christmas vacation.  (And, seriously, I  need  one!)  I have to admit, though, that being the one encoding the grades as opposed to being the one who gets graded is still more than a trifle surreal to me.  I mean, it's only been about six or so years since I graduated from college so I  still  know what it's like: the tension prior to a technical defense, palms sweating from sheer nervousness, one's belly doing quadruple somersaults while one's heart is pounding like a bass drum played for a rapid-fire rock number.  Anyway, nobody failed in my class - for this term; I am not sure how many are going to survive the next term.  It's going to be a more technical course next term as they'll be writing ad copy, mostly product taglines and infomercial scripts.  It's the course where we finally winnow the chaff from the wheat.    One of the kids really proved that he was more chaff than wheat when he whinged about the defense, asking me for an exemption because he didn't think he could hack the rigors of the defense.  All because he was handicapped -  FAUGH !  I had classmates in college who were either blind or stone deaf or had survived a bout of crippling polio - and  they  didn't whinge out on their academic responsibilities!  Some people are just plain  lazy , really.  They make excuses to drag their butts out of things while others slave away to get things done.  It is a most inexcusable deed that  definitely  merits hatred from the people around you.

      I just got  Closer , the new  Josh Groban  CD - and it is just plain  marvellous !   My Confession  is getting to be a new Groban fave of mine, right up there with  Un Amore Per Sempre ,  You're Still You , and  Canto Alla Vita .  It's this truly stirring Spanish-flavored song punctuated by Ramon Stagnara's Segovia-esque guitar playing and Il Groban's wonderful baritone.    The nicest part of this song is that it sounds like the confession of a guy who took his lady-love for granted.   Now  he's paying the ultimate price for his wrongs.  I wish my ex-lover could hear  My Confession ; he might learn a thing or two about honest and transparency in a relationship. >:-P

      If there is anything I can't stand more than anything in the world, it's a person who tries to whinge his way out of things just because of one malady or another.  Of course, this does not necessarily mean that I am against staying out of work because you're sick.   That   is a completely different kettle of fish all together!  What I'm griping about right now is the fact that one of my students wants out of the formal defense required for the final examinations for the basic reason that he's handicapped (he has cerebral palsy) and thinks he isn't up to defending his paper.  Here's the thing: just because you're physically deformed does not necessarily mean that your brain is in shambles as well.  That sort of reasoning is more than a little contemptible and it's unfair to everyone else who managed to scrape through by the skin of their teeth.

      I feel much better at this point.  An enforced two-day seclusion was what I really needed, after all.  I can breathe much easier now and I actually sound a bit more upbeat.  It's been a rough couple of weeks and I am glad that I was finally able to get some rest.  It makes facing the coming week a little less bleak.

      Yesterday, on a wacky sort of whim, I consulted the cards as to whether or not I should head for work today.  Keep in mind that I was already feverish and rather queasy at the time of the said consultation.  (Better yet, check the previous entry for my  exact  physical condition at the time!)  Both times, the cards told me that I should finally take a breather and stay home.   What a relief!   Trust me: it spares me from the tedium of commuting and then just staying in the office doing close to nothing all day save play inane games or listen to god-only-knows-how-many mp3s from Josh Groban to Linkin Park to so many carefully downloaded  anime -rock and  anime -pop files!

Come to think of it, I'm not even sure  why  I opted to come to work today; I should be home catching up on my sleep, dosing myself with anti-congestives, anti-diarrheals, and analgesics.  I should be sipping hot soup with Korean dumplings right now!

       I was browsing through the 'net earlier and decided to take a look at the old  urlLink Studio BeSerene website .&nbsp; I'm just amazed that it's still online and that FortuneCity hasn't deleted it, considering how it's been inactive since the last quarter of 2000.        I also found my old  anime -style portrait, the one done by our head artist Jowell Lee Chan.&nbsp; (Incidentally, until I had my portrait retaken a couple of weeks ago, this was also the picture I used for my  urlLink Friendster  account.)  So much has happened since the BeSerenes last parted ways nearly four years ago.&nbsp; The guys have all finished college.&nbsp; I think John Lagasca's gone abroad; I know for a fact that X Basa has already left.&nbsp; I don't know about Mike&nbsp;Lu and&nbsp;Jowell, but I hope they're both doing fine.&nbsp; Which, alas, is not what I hope for our general director.&nbsp; I hope that&nbsp;particularly self-righteous bastard gets&nbsp;blasted straight off to hell!&nbsp; For all his fire-and-brimstone proclamations, our old G.D. actually makes Mike Abundo look like a saint!  As for me, well...  Here I am.&nbsp; I won't be moving my stuff out of HEAVEN Inc. until such time that I can get an all-clear signal from whichever of the&nbsp;companies I've applied to.&nbsp;  Here's to the whole lot of us, then: may we each find what we have long sought...&nbsp;

           This is all about missing a guy named Mike.   This is a guy who has taken practically everyone in his life for granted.&nbsp; Honestly: the guy is more than a little  insensitive  to the people around him.&nbsp;   Last time I saw him, the look on his face was one of bewilderment mixed with - well, up to now, I still don't know if it was anger or annoyance or even sorrow.&nbsp; All I know is that he told me - politely, anway - to buzz out of his life because he didn't want to work with me anymore.&nbsp;   That was, of course,&nbsp;more than a year ago.&nbsp; I even lamented about the whole sorry deal in&nbsp;an earlier entry on this very same blog.   Anyway, a year, four months, and two days later, (Yes,&nbsp;I  am  keeping track of these things!), Mike has changed from the geeky partner who left&nbsp;me crying in front of &nbsp;LUSH   -  Glorietta&nbsp;and into something of a babe magnet.    &nbsp;          How utterly  contemptible...

       urlLink  Mike Abundo .   Apparently, my pet peeve has been promoted to senior network consultant over the weekend.  Grr...  No, it's not like I don't wish Mike well.  On the contrary, I'm  very  happy for him.  It's just that I have a sinking feeling - and  urlLink Kenneth Co  probably agrees with me on this one - that success is going into my surrogate kid brother's head.  I miss him dearly, but I don't think he's aware that I've somehow managed to stay alive.  *sigh*

      You have to admit that  urlLink Neil Gaiman  is one of the world's most brilliant - if not   the   world's most brilliant - writer.  I have  lots  of his books: three volumes of  The Sandman Library  ( Dream Country ,  Brief Lives , and  The Wake ),  Neverwhere  (in my opinion, it beats other cross-dimensional tales along the lines of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland hollow!),  Stardust  (the unillustrated paperback; my meager earnings haven't been enough to warrant the purchase of that glorious tome illustrated by the equally brilliant Charles Vess! *sigh*), American Gods, and  The Sandman: Book of Dreams . Of course, good Mr. Gaiman was more of an editor for the last one, but he still put his indelible stamp of brilliance on it.  I started reading his stuff in my senior year in high school. My initiation to the Gothic world of Gaiman's  Sandman  was, like many a similar epiphany, born of a chance encounter with Death.  Death: The High Cost of Living , that is. It's the miniseries where Death, older sister to Dream and second-born of the Endless, spends 24 hours as a mortal in the company of a suicidally-inclined kid named Sexton Furnival. It was a heck of a lot of fun to read and was oddly uplifting for a sixteen-year-old as suicidal as me.  Later on, I would have the privilege of reading the first two issues of  The Light Brigade , a graphic tale serialized in Britain's  Trident Comics .   (Incidentally, my friends keep reminding me of how lucky I am to be able to find such rare tomes.  Come to think of it, those were the only two issues of  Trident  any of us had ever seen in the Philippines!)   Gaiman's style has improved greatly throughout the years. (Go read his tale  The Monarch of the Glen ; it's part of the  Legends II  compilation.) Even his webjournal reads like truly excellent prose!  (Oh, and did mention that his recently-turned-21 son  urlLink Mike  looks absolutely babe-a-licious? ^_-)

       No, this isn't a foray into the world of  Harry Potter  in the sense that we're going to the greenhouse and potter [ sic ] amongst the plants.  It's more of an introduction to the use of various herbs in the kitchen and possibly beyond it...if you get my drift,  au naturel !

       Having been used in so many products designed along the lines of alleviating stress and relaxing harrowed minds, the scent of lavender has become a part of many urbanites' (and suburbanites') lives.

       Some people have a tendency to scoff at the act of baking bread.  To them, it is a tedious, time-consuming, wholly annoying chore best done by some pastry chef with a degree from  Le Cordon Bleu de Paris  or the Juan-dela-Cruz at the  panaderia  on the corner.

       I had breakfast at the UCC Vienna Cafe at The Podium in Ortigas this morning.  Totemo  posh  desu yo!  It may be on the seriously pricey side, but it is the sort of indulgence one needs after a seriously stressful period in one's life.
