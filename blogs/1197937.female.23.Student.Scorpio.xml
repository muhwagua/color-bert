      Riding the Tube  tv is bad. when i have kids, there will be no tv in the house. okay, maybe i'll have one locked inside my two-story remote-controlled semi-revolving walk-in closet with built-in alarm. anyway, i spent three hours tonight watching the michael jackson special.  missing the finale to joe millionaire is not my sole regret (bumbling brute that he is, i have nothing to say in my own defense) since my dad was able to fill me in afterwards. the problem is that it's brinking on 2am, i'm returning to work tomorrow after a two week hiatus, and i have the heebie-jeebies cuz images of wacko jacko are dancing left and right around my head! his voice too! gaaaaaaaaaah! okay, i'm calling my mom.

      The Hours: An Addendum  At 4:01pm today, I was at Borders plotting my onsetting splurge when my mom called to tell me that she had just been involved in a five-car collision. Fortunately, she was the second car from the front of the line, so the impact wasn't too bad and she came out unscraped.  The accident, which occurred in a matter of a milli-second, took 7 hours in the making.  I woke up at 9 this morning to find that I'd overslept. I was supposed to have woken up two hours earlier to go to the dealership with my mom to get my car maintenanced. Instead, she didn't have the heart to wake me up and went by herself. So i brushed, washed, ate breakfast, watched "i love lucy," clipped my nails, watched "good day LA," checked email, watched "mad about you," changed into my beloved overalls, and watched "the wonder years." by the time "all my children" rolled around, i was getting a little anxious about my mom's return. it had been four hours! where could she be and why hadn't she called?? a deluge of horrible thoughts washed over me. what if she was the only person, woman, sitting in the customer lounge at the dealership, surrounded by smooth-talking car salesmen, aka gigalos in loud hawaiian shirts with fake gold chains dangling heavily from their necks?? what if they slipped her a "mickey?!" yeah, so i guess my overactive imagination kinda took over. before i knew it, i had cleaned my bedroom and study, washed all the dishes in the sink, and laid out an elaborate lunch feast consisting of chicken salad and ham/lettuce rolls on the dining table. cooking and cleaning, in case you didn't know, are neon signs of panic and pandemonium in my life. i'd just about decided to take off for the dealership myself, ready to taebo the life outta some beemer pervs, when my mom came through the door. she explained that it'd taken forever because they had to change my tire, fix my window, give my car an oil change, wash and wax. after All that, she still had to go back, cuz in the process of fixing my window, they'd gotten the lock stuck on my door. immediately, my colossal apprehension morphed into slight annoyance. what a bother, i was hoping to spend the afternoon at the bookstore. "it's okay, I go again," my mom said.   So three hours later, I got the call. It was as if the fear, anxiety, and guilt of the morning had awaken from napping and not only surreptitiously resurfaced, but knocked me over and sat on me like an overweight three-headed monster.  "Sooner or later . . . . what goes around comes around . . . you Feel it, you Know it" you see, i'm a big believer in retribution. premonition as well. of all things, my instinct is something i trust. in this case, my selfishness simply overruled my sixth sense. If I'd gone instead of my mom, in the morning, none of this woulda happened. If i'd gone instead of my mom, in the afternoon, it woulda been me in the car accident instead of her.  I'll be the first to admit, i'm a self-centered person. I don't try to lay the blame on my being the only child. It's my nature, that's all. My parents are at the bullseye of my selfishness, unfortunate lambs privvy to my irish-like temper and rainbow-colored moods. As if that's not enough, I demand that they be with me forever. I mean, I will never let them go. It would surely drive me mad.

      http://www.neilgaiman.com/exclusive/essay03.asp  Meet my new man! veering a little towards the dark side i must admit, but definitely genius caliber. i just finished "fables & reflections" from his comic series titled "the sandman." omg, can i just say that i don't remember the last time i read something that sent goosebumps across my arms? and i didn't even understand half of it except a faint gist that it was deep stuff. all his stories restore some mythical, biblical, or historical figure who re-probe some realm of philosophical, moral, or political significance . i make it sound dead boring. it's not. i make myself sound like a geek. i'm not. this is me, a person concerned with daily girlish trifles such as the symmetry of makeup application and hypothesizing the percentage of weight fluctuations due to water retention. the two items you never find me leaving home without? a pair of tweezers and a pack of oil blotting tissue. but i'm telling ya, this is the first time i ever laid fingers on a comic book, and it blew me away! Neil made me feel like an intellectual pauper, a true ignoramus humanus, and that's why i love him so. and i have my friend philip to thank for all this. he gave me this book for my 21st bday, and i never got around to reading it until yesterday. well, eveything runs its due course in its due time i always say. probably wouldn't have appreciated it as much back then. can't wait to read it over...if only i were actually knowledgeable and knew what the heck he's talking about.  valentine's day in america. nice concept, over-commercialized. on a tangent, my high school english teacher, mrs. shoop, once told us that the antithesis of love is not hate, but indifference. (Despite all her eccentricites, a lot of what that woman said has stuck with me through the years, i may consider her my "morrie.") I didn't agree before, but now i can see some truth to it. anyway, back to vday. for a lot of ppl, it's a really nice excuse to give something nice to their significant other; for an even greater number of ppl, it's just the flowers and chocolates and little sparkly rocks that's extended the longevity of this maudlin celebration. moi...just stick me in the movie theater with a cup of diet coke and you got yourself one happy camper. personally, from the perspective of true amore, everyday can be vday if you're with the one you truly love, and everything can cast that fluffy romantic glow if you really know how to appreciate it all. just don't make vday to be the excuse for all the rest of the days of the year to not do something nice for your special someone. having said that, happy valentines day to you and me all the same.

      Hero  My new role model is my roommate ms. chinatown. I love my other roommate just as much, but she's too busy spreading SARS and getting jocked. not only is Ms. C-town beautiful, she can also whip up a six course meal AND fix toilets. watching her work my potty today was amazing. after three weeks of having severe drainage issues, due to mineral deposits, i am now one happy camper. when i tell ppl that i went abroad on my own, they are impressed by my independence and survival skills. honestly, i have none. i'm just a lucky dame who always had someone there to help me out when i needed it. anyway, i am truly honored to be living with a real-life Wonder Woman.   i think my earlier blog needs some serious clarification. please note that i said i'd be abstaining from super good-looking ppl. regular good-looking is no problem, i have my children to think about after all. therefore, it was definitely not a cattle call for ugly ppl. sorry.

      last night, i dreamt that i was married to a very good-looking man, too good-looking in fact. i caught him making out with another man in front of all my friends. i now live in constant fear of marrying a bisexual. well...at least he wasn't making out with one of my friends...or a really pretty girl. my mom was right, don't marry a super good-looking man or a super smart man, and never marry one who is both. i shall carry this wisdom with me for the rest of the day.

      Model Family of the Year  there's a korean family that lives across the street from me. their lawn is neatly trimmed, their house quiet and clean, and every early saturday morning, the whole family is out in the driveway meticulously washing their cars and doing chores in and around the house. lemme tell you faithful blog readers, these are the good, hardworking people of america. regardless of whether the world outside is peaceful or steeped in warfare and epidemic, they remain loyal to their diligent routine. recently, it's occurred to me that the safe normalcy and consistency of these ppl is very precious and desirable.   in times like these, you start to realize what has real value, the things that you really want in your life. first and foremost, i hope that all the people i care about will be safe and healthy for a long long time. when i grow up, i just want to live a normal life. once upon a time in my more youthful days, i wanted money and fame. now, i just hope for a nice little house and a good-natured, hardworking man who doesn't cheat and is good to my kids. and i will wish for my kids to be healthy and sweet. they'll probably be super smart and ridiculously good-looking regardless, but they don't have to be, as long as they don't do drugs, crime, or porn. seriously though, what more can you ask from life, other than peace and stability? i just hope that by the time i have these things, if i ever do, i won't forget to be thankful.   this is completely irrelevant, but i made a very disturbing observation at a buffet dinner tonight. it seems that there is absolutely no correlation between drinking diet soda and being thin. in fact, most ppl that get diet drinks are actually overweight. does that mean that these ppl are drinking diet because they're trying to lose weight, or that diet coke actually has no positive effects on weight loss and is just as bad as regular coke?? my world is crumbling before my eyes...

      Love Song for No One  Hi guys. i like this poem by C.D. Wright, dunno why. this is probably readership suicide, but please take your time reading and listening, and read it again.   EVERYTHING GOOD BETWEEN MEN & WOMEN  has been written in mud and butter and barbeque sauce. The walls and the floors used to be gorgeous The socks off-white and a near match. The quince with fireblight but we get two pints of jelly in the end. Long walks strengthen the back. You with a fever blister and myself with a sty. Eyes have we and we are forever prey to another's teeth. The torrents go over us. Thunder has not harmed  anyone we know. The river coursing through us is dirty and deep. The left hand protects the rhythm. Watch your head. No fires should be unattended. Especially when wind. Each receives a free swiss army knife. The first few tongues are clearly preparatory. The impression made by yours I carry to my grave. It is just so sad so creepy so beautiful. Bless it. We have so little time to learn, so much...The river courses dirty and deep. Cover the lettuce. Call it a night. O soul. Flow on. Instead.  sorry, very sexual...that's not why i like it though! i just like the cadences. and how it maps out the struggle of the relationship between man and woman. sorry, this is kinda gross, but just like sex. my dad's gonna have a heart attack when he reads this. you hurt each other through your love for each other, tearing away the romanticism of romance, but in the end, what's left is still worthy of being preserved, because love stripped of its petals is still fragrant? that's my optimistic interpretation anyway. it might actually mean that you should just leave it all behind. or something that has nothing to do with anything i just said. i don't konw, help, what do you think?? What's the swiss army knife line mean? and cover the lettuce? i don't get it. any ideas? i think my favorite lines are "the socks off-white and a near match" and "you with a fever blister and myself with a sty." and "no fires should be unattended. especially when wind," and of course, "the impression made by yours i carry to my grave." haha, sorry that's like every other line. the "instead" at the end, is that supposed to leave you with the wonderment of possibilities, what could have been and/or should have been? or that the relationship should go on and does go on despite the writhing struggle and contempt that arises from the intensity between man and woman which makes the river, dirty and deep but flow nonetheless?? okay, that's all. just thought i'd share. feel free to express, flex that brain power, especially all you darn english majors!!!  it's gonna be FRIDAY! yaaaaaay. i love my job, but even job-lovers gotta have us our weekends mun.

      "They Both Reached for the Gun"  i don't know about you, but i know i've seen a great movie when for weeks after i step out of the theater, random scenes are still replaying in my head. for me, one of those scenes is from the movie chicago, where a self-serving defense lawyer turns a press conference into a puppet show. the lawyer is the puppet master and the reporters his stringed puppets.  Hungry for drama be it truth or tale, they eagerly echo the lawyer's words and jerk to every tweak of his wrist in perfect synchronization. beautifully sung and choreographed...now that's entertainment.  in recent weeks, i doubt that many ppl are in the mood for a little song-and-dance when the words "operation iraqi freedom" are scrolling across the bottom of america's tv screens. the same audience that couldn't be peeled away from high speed car chases and subjected itself to the stranglehold of reality shows has finally decided to take a breather, to tune in to the realest of reality.  the other night, i was flipping through the channels in the hopes of coming across one that WASN'T showing war footage. in the process, i caught a snippet of a CNN report saying something like the residents in Iraq were smiling and waving to the US planes as they flew past. interesting how the correspondents of the next channel over, canadian i believe, were reporting how the terror-stricken nation was crying out in anguish, "why are they [the US] doing this?"  can you blame me for being a little confused? one moment, i'm seeing images of our country's leaders smiling or joking on the golf greens, coming out of sunday service with their families, speaking of God and love, freedom and democracy, justice, human rights, even baseball for goodness' sakes. before i can utter God bless america, huge explosives are dropped on the heads of defenseless ppl, while the approval rating for our country's leaders keeps going up. well with names like bill and george, who would believe that they're a/immoral?   for the past few months, we've been watching a song-and-dance show debating the rightfulness of an attack on a nation that has not attacked us and knows that doing so would mean instant mass suicide. according to our gov't and media, we are targetted because of our wealth, belief in freedom and democracy, and our gosh darn simple goodness.   I read this quote somewhere by someone that goes something like this: if you want to stop anti-american terrorism, then stop giving them a reason to attack america.  what i don't understand is why it's okay to let leaders force their way around as long as the death and suffering aren't happening to americans or ppl close to them. there's no need to debate support and respect for the courage of our frontline soldiers and the value of their loyalty and lives. the real issue is a) who sent them out there in the first place, b) the intentions of the ppl who sent them out there (liberation or imperialism), and c) the destabilization of world order as a ramification of sending them out there.   of course saddam hussein is bad and evil. but isn't it a little hypocritical for the US government, one whose own judicial system is based on the principle of innocent until proven guilty, to take a proactive position of this calibur? i don't know. honestly, despite how anti-war and anti-bush i sound, i'm confused. this is just a forum for me to voice what i know are not my permanent views and opinions, but only what i'm thinking right now, so that maybe one day when i read this to myself, i'll be able to compare how much i've learned and grown. sometimes, i feel like the more you know, the harder it is to take a side, the more the red and blue start to confuse you amid the ugly grey. maybe that's why ppl just go with what's already done, or, maybe they know a heck of a lot more than i do, which is probably the case. but either way, let's make sure that we carry out our patriotic duties by not letting anyone tie a string around our fingers and feeding words into our mouths.

      On the homefront...  on my way home from work today, the 10 was jam packed like no other while the only thing passing me by was a steady stream of police cars. my first thought was that a bomb had been dropped somewhere up ahead. so i didn't hear any explosions or see any smoke and flying debris, but hey, it coulda been a cute mini bomb. later, i found out from my roommate that it was b/c wilshire was completely blocked off by 600+ protesters in westwood.   I didn't go straight home, but made a short stop at the bookstore. while there, my mom called and was frantic that i was still out and about at a time like this. apparently, while the national security alert has been raised from yellow to orange, my parents' paranoia beat it with a rise from red to purple.  my apt was completely empty when i got home. i may be one silly goose, but chicken i am not. for the first time since second grade though, i didn't like being home alone.  this is what occurred to me today: I am 22 years old and already living through the second war of my lifetime commenced by my homeland. that's not even counting the cold war. isn't it ironic how the two wars are exactly a decade apart, both against the same country, and each initiated by father and son? it's weird that i, queen of blase to all things worldly, am marginally affected by all this. but after being abroad and talking to ppl who aren't american, i realized that the problem w/ americans is that we never think anything is going to happen to us. did no one watch pearl harbor the movie?? and if a tabasco farmer can drive his tractor right into a pond near the washington monument, "one of the best guarded places in the nation," i don't think pulling the red carpet from the oscars is gonna do it. (of all things, pleeeease don't sacrifice the pretty dresses!!!!)  man, if bob were president, we'd have nothing but peace. this is a man who avoided service until weeks before wwii ended, and even had a wound to show for it. does that sound like a belligerent (sp??) man to you? i think not.    If world war III is fought with nuclear weapons, then world war IV will be fought with sticks and stones. --Albert Einstein

      HALLELUJAH!! writing class is over!! i'm a free woman, woohoo!! smack me if i ever sign up for another night class.  i heard this on the radio on the way to work and found the article online when i got to work:  "New Thai police uniform 'too sexy'"    Policemen in Thailand are being sexually harassed by women and gay men because of their tight uniforms. Websites have been set up featuring pictures and advice on how to seduce officers. An average of 400 complaints a month are being filed by policemen subjected to lewd calls from admirers.     One high-ranking officer said the worst time for the calls is from midnight to 2am and he said about 60% are from men, reports The Nation. He added: "If we talk to them for too long they ask us out, and the gay men always talk lewdly. We cut the line and call them back later to warn them not to disturb police on duty."     Police chiefs say the uniforms might be contributing to the problem but officers just have to deal with it.   too funny....

      i had this sudden impulse to go for a really long walk on the beach after work today. so there i am, trekking happily across the sand, imagining my jello-like butt turning into buns of steel with each belabored step, and thinking about starting my blog entry with something poetic like "mmmm...nothing like a brisk walk on the beach at dusk, wind blowing in my hair, waves crashing onto shore, mr. sun kissing ms. horizon goodnight...ahhh...the perks of living in so cal..."  and then SPLAT, some big fat ugly bird shat on me. right into the hood of my jacket. i hate birds. pigeons mostly. but now, seagulls too. most days, you can find ppl standing in front of the federal building on wilshire blvd with signs to stop the war. one of these days, i'm going to join them with a big fat sign telling ppl to STOP FEEDING THE BIRDS!!! if i were rich, i'd order a blimp.  the same person caught me serenading Nowadays to my computer twice at work today. after listening to it on repeat for the billionth time, i finally got the reference to presidents: "you can like the life you're living, you can even live the life you like / you can even marry harry but mess around with ike." haha. how clever. it rhymes too. great song. great movie.  if you know how to get rid of this big blue space to the right, please lemme know. i was so smug about the links that i didn't even notice the space until someone brought it to my attention, now it's driving me nuts.   dhan, give me back my green sweatshirt and take your darn yam!! miss ya, let's hang. :)

      An excerpt:  I have very mixed feelings about Americans disliking the French. I'm English, after all. We have a special relationship with the French: we are in awe of their sophistication, their cuisine and their wines, we think their women are beautiful, we like them as individuals, we badly want to go and live in their country when we retire, while at the same time we are deeply suspicious of them. It's like having people living next door to you who may be snappier dressers and better cooks, but who, after all, borrowed the lawn mower sometime in the thirteenth century and never gave it back. Anyway, the English dislike the French. We're really good at it. We've been doing it ever since we got up one day and realised that the Norman Conquerors were now, like it or not, Us, and weren't conquering French people any more. We feel, frankly, that if anyone's going to dislike the French, it's going to be us. On the whole we manifest our dislike for them by drinking their wines, buying up their cigarettes, and, despite the fact that all English people can naturally roll their Rs and speak perfect French, declining to do so, and when forced by circumstances to speak French the English do it with an English accent on purpose.  These are tactics we've worked out over the course of hundreds of years, and if carried on long enough, they will bring France to its knees. I'm English. I know these things.  Changing the name french fries to freedom fries, on the other hand, will just make them laugh at you.  posted by Neil Gaiman 11:21 AM

      Daily Chronicle  Front page: I have a new pet. It's a hermit land crab. Its shell has been painted bright orange with a little happy mexican guy in the middle, so i call it el Matador, aka the bullfighter. el Matador lives in a small glass tank with sand and small blue rocks on the bottom. everyday, i dunk el Matador in a cup of water for his bath and pick out his tiny green poop from his tank. crabs are cool like that. their poop comes out the same color as their food, no matter what you feed it. i'd choose a crab for a pet any day; they're low-maintenance, odorless, and eat veggies, nuts, tree bark, even eggshells...now how economical is that. the only thing i have to buy is a new shell every year cuz they grow outta their old ones. What's really genius about it is that I gave one to my friend too for her birthday. not only does she have to take care of it wherever she goes out of pure obligation, i have her birthday presents covered for the next 10-15 years: funky crab shells. yep, and she was worried she'd be getting christina aguilera cd's. hehehe...  Business: it's been a crazy week at work, and i love it. i like feeling like i'm part of something important, contributing to the greater scheme of things and such. sometimes, i almost wish that i'd gotten this job a little later on in life so i'd truly appreciate it. it's got the structure/bureaucracy/politics of a large organization but the personal feel of a small office. i get to meet tons of ppl of all industries. we help ppl to get their businesses off the ground on the international front. it's just too bad i haven't made my million yet before this job. in class the other night, we were talking about negotiating raises and this lady asked me how much i was getting paid. i told her and she screamed "WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE??!" i dunno. my business card looks real cool though.  Sports: i read somewhere that working out can actually become an addiction. based on personal experience, i didn't believe it until i watched a documentary on female body builders. 'twas no pretty sight. i actually felt physically nauseous. so i examined my own workout routine, and despite the fact that i get a little stressed when i can't fit some physical activity into the day, i'm nowhere near those he-women. i should learn by now to not overshoot. this week, i've been setting my three alarms for 5:55/6/6:05am so that i can go jogging in the park, shower, eat breakfast, read the newspaper, and commute to work. instead, i waste thirty minutes grappling with three kinds of snooze buttons in a state of semi-consciousness. i think i've actually been getting out of bed later than before just cuz i feel so burgled of precious sleep time.  Calendar: mmmm...me like garlic hummus. i watched a beeeauyooootiful movie tonight, Chicago, for the second time. i wanna watch it over every time i hear the commercial on the radio with renee zellweger singing the beginning to Nowadays..."grand, isn't it...great, isn't it...swell, isn't it....you can like the life you're livin', you can live the life you like...and that's good, isn't it? grand, isn't it?swell..." da da daaaaaaa. man, that movie makes me wanna sing and dance. so i've been working on "fast food nation" and "bias," two pretty good reads so far. the only problem is, now i feel like i have to shun the entire fast food industry, and i will never be able to look at dan peter or tom as the familiarly benign news broadcasters again. sometimes, ignorance is kinda liberating.  California: so now i really do believe that the 5 is ALWAYS congested. even an hour ago traffic was at a crawl. and that was almost 11 pm! way past my bedtime, due to a little incident with my car alarm in which i couldn't get the doors to unlock, called AAA, as soon as they pulled into the parking lot, guess what, the doors unlocked. in my embarassed flustered state, i didn't even think of tipping them for making the drive out. now i'm blacklisted with AAA. and all i could think about on my way back was writing about the whole thing on my blogger so i won't forget next time.  Health: hurray, my warts are disappearing! I think the free Warts-No-More samples i got from the last trade show really work. who said my job doesn't come with perks.  Ads: Payless is great. i bought four pairs of shoes, and it cost less than forty bucks. ever since star jones from the view became spokesperson, i no longer feel ashamed to be seen in there. no joke. none of my old shoes fit anymore. i don't know how to explain it, but i think my feet shrunk. in high school, i used to be a 7 1/2. now, i'm a size 6. what's happening?? a chilly reminder of stephen king's Thinner. i think the freaky indian guy in that movie with the big ugly mole actually plays the windex-obsessed father in my big fat greek wedding. anyway, so i was picking out my shoes, and there was this chinese lady also in her 20s who kept going for the same styles. luckily, there was always more than one pair to go around. didn't i say payless is great? so finally, she came up to me and told me what she thought i looked good in. it was true shopping camaraderie. i was so touched i wanted to ask for her number before leaving so maybe we could do this again, but was afraid she'd think i'm gay or something. nevertheless, payless is great.  Opinion: i met someone the other day who i coulda sworn was korean. in fact, i had him pegged as one of those cigarette smokin korean squatters. i was bowled over when i found out he was chinese. so the obvious follow up question i asked was, what kind of chinese are you: cantonese, taiwanese, or mainland? he looked me straight in the eye and said, "i'm CHInese." dang. i felt moted. one of these days, i'm gonna get in big trouble for the politically incorrect things that fall outta my mouth. the other day, i met a "white" director. he looked white to me anyway, with a really thick accent. so i asked him if he's italian, and he said no, i'm pakistani. first thought that came to my head was: omg, i'm so sorry. thank goodness i kept my mouth shut this time. when i was younger, i'd been the target of some racist jokes. now that i'm older, i've turned into the racist. i wonder how interracial relationships work. i mean, problems arise even from being with someone of the same nationality, same age, same educational/financial/familial background. different cultural values?? how does that work when you're trying to build a family together? but then again, problems DO arise even if we're the same color, so...maybe race is not the issue...i dunno. but, the chinese guy was right, why did i have to make that subtle distinction? i mean, we're all chinese. to be more general, we're all asian, we're all ppl. and i guess applying that to a general effort to be less parochial, i should stop thinking of every white guy who shows interest in an asian girl as a perv with an asian fetish. That is, only if they stop using the word "oriental," cuz that just makes me feel like a piece of yellow rug.

      Lesson du jour  arggg...i think i'm sick again. okay, mid-month commitment: take multivitamin daily! my health has really taken a nose dive since work. maybe not enough sleep...lately i've been waking up around 2am every night cuz i have to pee, but lie in bed for 20 minutes debating whether to get up or not. that's TWENTY very precious minutes monsieur!! maybe i should stop drinking two glasses of water before bed... on top of that, every morning my eyes pop open at 5:59 on the dot even though i don't have to get up until two hours later and my mind's completely alert and i can't stand it! i was at the natural products expo today and there was a plethora of health supplements and natural food and herbal products. okay, i have to admit, this show is a lot more interesting than some of the others i've been assigned to (ie, packaging, logistics, electrical components), but while i was walking through the endless aisles of purple soywheat pills and green tofu-garlic chips, something occurred to me: i always thought natural means unprocessed fruits, vegetables and grains...all this stuff was made by some mad scientist with oversized goggles who's tried every combination possible from the periodic table! sorry, but i'd be crazy to put any of this stuff in my body. and...don't mean to be shallow and judgmental at the same time...but it's kinda hard to think that any of these things will introduce health into my life when i see the exhibitors, most of whom are quite portly, munching on cheetos and beef sandwiches and chugging down cokes during lunch. and then, you have the companies that go a little overboard the other direction, hiring blond cheerleader has-beens in skimpy outfits to attract traffic to their booths. i don't get drawn to those either. not just cuz i'm a female and non-lesbian, but i know that those girls don't look like that because of the products they're holding up. and i don't want to be a good-looking dits (sp??). i just want to be good-looking, and obviously, "natural" is no longer the way to go.

      yay, i made it past 10! gosh, my life really needs some order. so they say it takes eleven days to form a good habit. for me, it's more like eleven months, and one crappy day to break it. tomorrow, i'm going to think of one thing that i want to commit to as daily routine and see if that eleven day rule really works.  for now, i'm going to bed, tomorrow's going to be a tough day. i just hope i don't dream about chasing dogs again.

      Red White Black&Blue   so in my relentless quest to become less ignorant and more pretentious, i've been trying to keep up with current events. i guess our troops have shipped out, but...there's going to be a war?? maybe i've been in LA la land so long i just never thought it would really happen. i dunno, i'm just a foolish little asian girl who thought south africa was a region not a country, what do i know...but, can't one generation get by without some war and strife? and can't it be MINE?? the middle east is kinda like another greenland to me. i really know nothing about it. i'm great at tuning things out, especially if they're meaningful. on the radio today, some elementary kids being interviewed about their knowledge of the war were going off about how it's really just another fight over oil b/c ppl's motives are always financial. dang, that doesn't sound like a quote from tom and jerry. catching the bits and pieces while flipping between entertainment tonight and access hollywood, i guess i kinda see where both sides to the great war debate are coming from. but, since a president is elected by the ppl and for the ppl, you'd think that his major decisions should be first and foremost sanctioned by the ppl who got him into office in the first place. man, where's one of those online polls when you need 'em... there's tons for whether america thinks joe millionaire (that bumbling brute!!) and zora are really an item, or who the next american idol should be. where the heck is the one for whether the president is going "ballistic?" it's just ironic how a great tragedy set this thing off, and now a million-fold new tragedies will be born because of it. all because politicians can't take back their word, no matter how much or often they twist and manipulate it. well, regardless of the ranting or raving that goes on, i guess the outcome is really the only thing that determines how it goes down in the history books. since our opinion obviously has no weight, let's just all sit on our cabooties and keep our fingers and toes crossed. man, i bet this thing never woulda snowballed like it did if ma' man, bob dole, were in office. and what's up with north korea??

      sleeeeepy. i'm gonna cheat and paste the homework that I turned in for my business writing class tonight. the assignment was to write about our 5, 10, and 30 year goals.  what this has to do with business writing i have no idea, good thing i'm not the one paying. why i even did the homework i have no idea either, just made me realize it's too hard to see that far down the road. one foot in front of the other, i'msure i'll end up somewhere.   Fundamentals of Business Writing February 25, 2003 Homework #6: Goals   Twenty-Two... Last week, I was writing a birthday card to one of my friends, wishing her a very merry 22nd.  As the friend I was sharing the card with gently brought to my attention, that was sweet and all, but too bad she was actually turning 23.  "Twenty-three?!?" I shrieked.  "That's ANCIENT!"  Then, it dawned on me: I had better make the most of my time before I become practically extinct.   In five years... A recent survey concluded that the peak age for men is 42, while that for women is 28.  In the next five years, I would like to prove the validity of that statement, and the years after, its fallacy.  At age 28, I would like to devote a serious portion of my energy into a fruitful and rewarding career, but also retaining a hopeful glimmer of romanticism.  I once watched a scene in a movie where, in a warm and cozy apartment, a girl who is seated behind a mahogany desk cluttered by manuscripts and an antique typewriter is engrossed in a novel whose pages are yellowed and crinkled from use, oblivious to the gentle tapping of the rain or the urgent sloshing of cars on the street.  I hope that once in a while, I can transform into the girl in this scene, allowing myself to discover a passion and making the time and space in my life for that passion.  In ten years... While career defines me at 28, I hope that family will become the axle of my life when I am 32.  I have no goals or expectations as to when or how Mr. Man will enter the picture, because that matter is best left one of life's X-Y-Z's.  Our house will be charmingly simple, affordably comfortable, and child-proof for the two kids whose births have miraculously caused no alterations in my figure.  Success at this point will be defined by how well I balance work and domestic life.    In thirty years... If I have made it this far, my one goal is to keep going, stronger than ever. I hope to be more loving and lovelier than ever, wiser and sillier, rosy and rotund.  I will be proud of the lines on my face, because there is a memory behind each.  I would like to sit with my husband on a porch swing, talking about our children and reminiscing about our times together through the thick and thin, dentures and Depends.  If I have grandchildren, I would tell them that life is a bag of jelly beans: you never know what you're gonna get, but you're guaranteed something soft and sweet if you keep on reaching in.

      Ya-Ya Sisterhood  i was in the shower today reflecting on the past two weeks of working at trade shows and talking with at least 70-80 people per day. boy...there's a lot of weirdos out there. my mom told me that even if the number of people you meet increases, the people that can actually get near and close to your heart pretty much remains the same. she said it more eloquently in chinese, but that's the general idea. so, i decided to make today's entry a dedication to two important people in my life. be forewarned, it's enough saccharine mushy-ness to spawn a few cavities. but, i'm gonna forego my usual pride and coolness cuz i really wanted to express how thankful i am to have met them in this world full of crazy strangers.  Ya1: probably the only person i ever accosted on my own will cuz i felt like i already knew her and just knew that she'd be my friend. it really paid off. we always say that if only we could meet a guy whom we feel the same way about the way we do each other (plus romantic feelings), we'll have found our soulmates. we laugh, cry, share, exchange, and grow together. she drives me crazy with her stubborness, but every day, i find myself having even more respect for her views, integrity, and values. i never cease to be amazed at how much she understands me, and how much of what she says is exactly what i'm thinking and feeling. her place in my life really reaffirms my belief in fate.  Ya2: genuinely the most caring person i have ever met. also one of the funniest. and skinniest. probably the only person in the world that i feel like i can talk to forever, and i mean hours without end. everyone who has ever met her says that she is the nicest person to have walked the face of the earth, but i'm still touched over and over again by how especially caring, giving, and understanding she is to me.  if ever i needed someone to care about my welfare as much as i do, i'd know where to go.

      Independent Woman: Remix  today, i came upon a book titled "how to be a lady: a contemporary guide to common courtesy." it stood out to me not only because its jacket was hot pink, but because i think, somehow, in this contemporary age of ultra-liberation and feminist anti-feminism, the meaning of feminine CLASS has either been offered up for bloody sacrifice or simply neglected. regardless of whether a girl is raised by traditional or modern standards, she should know that being independent does not preclude her from common sense and common courtesy. likewise, just because certain "feminine" mannerisms are observed does not necessarily make one high-browed or prissy-ish. true feminists should promote feminism, not deny it and run the opposite extreme to blur the distinction between sexy and slutty, bold and boorish. anyway, i'm not sure if the author of this book had these things in mind when she was writing it, but here's a few lines from the book that i picked out and copied down for your viewing pleasure. see if you agree. (hope i'm not infringing on any copyright laws by posting this...how terribly unlady-like.)  My favorites: A lady is always on her toes, realizing that every encounter makes a lasting impression. A lady thinks before she speaks and knows that false congeniality is as obvious as fake eyelashes. Trends come and go, but true style is timeless.  Etiquette: A lady uses a coaster. A lady does not crush her ice. A lady never curses in front of others. A lady knows how to give a compliment. A lady knows how to accept a compliment by saying "thank you." A lady does not wear anything so revealing that it embarrasses others.  Hygiene: If a lady expects her legs to be seen, she either shaves her legs or wears hose. A lady is not afraid to carry breath mints. Neither is she reluctant to offer them to other people.  For the guys: A lady is always on time. A lady does not whine. A lady does not nag. A lady does not brag. A lady knows that it is possible to offer assistance to a gentleman without threatening his masculinity.  Relationships: A lady never makes a date out of desperation. A lady breaks a date only for reasons of science, death, or natural disaster. A lady knows how to break up from relationships, jobs, and confront friends without losing friendships. A lady celebrates friends and lets them know their importance in her life.  that's it. one of these days, i'm gonna start taking my own advice. says the wise wise woman.  g'nite all.

      Drandruff Control  TIME FLIES!! no matter how often i come to this realization, it never fails to boggle my mind. i think i need serious help in the time mgmt department. no time for this, no time for that...post-graduation, i've become one of the biggest flakes i know. and i hate flakes!! to all those whom i've flaked on, i apologize for this past year, but probably more so for the coming one. i'll TRY to be better about it, but definitely no promises.  Head&Shoulders there's a section on the LSAT called logical reasoning where a lot of the problems give you a conditional statement (if a, then b), and asks you to identify the opposite (if -b, then -a). the trick is to not fall for the false converse (if -a, then -b), or the false inverse (if b, then a) because they are not necessarily true. great stuff no? well ponder this: has it occurred to you that a lot of commercial advertising capitalizes on our misperception of the false inverse? car ads, for example, always show some scantily-clad lady sprawled on top of the car (the conditional statement: if there is an X car, there is a beautiful lady), making you think that if you buy the car, then you will get the lady (the false inverse: if you want the beautiful lady, you have to buy the X car). sneaky...a darn good thing that men aren't marketable, b/c women never ever fall for false advertising.   Drag-Free yesterday, i literally had to drag myself to the hair salon for a hair trim. must be part of the whole PRS: less haircuts, less facials, less primping in general...what a terrible trend. anyway, not having had time to make an appointment, i pulled a walk in and ended up waiting for forty minutes. that sucked. and then, I was introduced to the blurr of a man into whose hands I would be laying my hair destiny: blonde-streaked hair, eyeliner-mascara, tight baby-t, tighter low-rise black jeans, i'm talking the whole works and nine yards. my only instinct was to bolt and never look back, but instead, i froze like a deer and just followed this finger-snapping, hip-swaying Being to the Chair. "And how may I service you my love?" uhhhh...  to my amazement, within a matter of minutes, all my bigoted inhibitions went flying out the window. jay-c, as he preferred to be addressed, was attentive yet responsive, gentle but in command...basically, everything a woman could ever want. "How's this my love?...Did that hurt my love?...Is it too short my love?" to quote those herbal essences commercials, the experience was truly organic.  sitting in that red vinyl chair, with jay-c snipping away at my "tresses"and "locks," i found myself fantasizing about the great friendship that could develop between me and this flaming gay man. wih the volume of knowledge between the two of us on matters of makeup, dieting, and men (in that order of expertise), heck, we could probably take over the world.   okay, obviously, that didn't happen. but I did get a great haircut. so after twenty-two meandering years of salon-hopping, i finally have a hair stylist to call my own.   It's good, isn't it / grand, isn't it / great, isn't it / swell, isn't it / fun, isn't it / Nowadays  Man, this entry is like a friggin novel.  Oh yeah, if you read nothing else this year...  A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn. definitely not as bland as it sounds. quite timely too. here's an excerpt to whet your reading buds:  The treatment of heroes (Columbus) and their victims (the Arawaks) -- the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress -- is only one aspect of a certain approach to history, in which the past is told from the point of view of governments, conquerors, diplomats, leaders. It is as if they, like Columbus, deserve universal acceptance, as if they -- the Founding Fathers, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, the leading members of Congress, the famous Justices of the Supreme Court -- represent the nation as a whole. The pretense is that there really is such a thing as "the United States," subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels, but fundamentally a community of people with common interests. It is as if there really is a "national interest" represented in the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts, the development of capitalism, the culture of education and the mass media.  "History is the memory of states," wrote Henry Kissinger...  My viewpoint, in telling the history of the United States, is different: that we must not accept the memory of the states as our own. Nations are not communities and never have been. The history of any country, presented as history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploiting, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners.     running late!!! Lemme know what u think.

      Evening Post  Classified Wanted: I NEED A RUNNING BUDDY!!! some middle eastern guy in a beat up brown car just tagged me for three blocks and i didn't want him to know where i live so i had to hide in the neighborhood mini mart for 20 minutes!! i couldn't even pretend to buy anything cuz i didn't have a dime on me. dude, that was very freaky. so anybody that enjoys getting up at 5:30am, preferrably runs no faster than 2 mi/hr, and doesn't perspire profusely, please gimme a ring.   Editorial i was at the grocery store the other day and noticed that the girl in the checkout stand right before me only had diet shakes and diet bars for purchase. lemme tell you, this girl could have been no older than 13 years old. she still had braces and her body hadn't even gone through puberty! hm, when i was her age, i was too busy chanting "i must, i must, i must increase my bust!" gosh, times sure haven't changed much...girls feel the same internal and external pressures about their physical appearance today as they did yesterday, if not more so. i don't think this situation is going to change anytime soon, and i am disappointed by the slow rate at which society is responding.   so far, it seems that treating the subject of dieting as taboo has done nothing more than create a desperate legion of closet-eaters, bingers, and anorexics. why not be open with it and say, how can i help you so that you are correctly informed on how to eat healthy and still look as good as you want? unlike decades ago when the word "diet" was exclusively defined as not eating or using hazardous diet pills, i believe that in our day and age, with the plethora of medical research and time-tested guidelines, the word "diet" should be redefined to mean a consciousness of good dietary choices. this means that EVERYONE, fat, skinny, or average, ppl who want to live a long life, or just want to look good, should all be on a lifelong diet. of course not everyone is born with a body like jennifer garner. heck even jennifer garner wasn't born with a body like jennifer garner; the woman runs five miles every morning! it just boils down to making some informed decisions and being disciplined.  i get frustrated when ppl have really negative reactions to the word diet. and these are the same ppl that'll turn around and say, "O-M-G! looook at her buuuutt!!! it is, like, sooooooo big!" responses like these have kept weight issues in the closet for too long.  In order for ppl to learn that there are better ways to lose weight than to starve, binge, purge, and starve some more, we should try to establish a supportive community to spread the word, be open, and not treat it like taboo. that is the only way to redefine "diet" so that it becomes something positive and progressive.   back at the supermarket while i was checking out my groceries, the bag boy made a comment about how good the ben&jerry's looked but needed to lose another 30 lbs before digging in. even though he was not fat by any standards, i told him to try the zone diet by dr. barry sears b/c of its nutritional balance, but he said he was on weight watchers and had already lost 52 lbs. "GOOD FOR YOU!!! Keep it up!!" i shrieked. i tell ya, i was so happy for him i almost bagged my own groceries. based on his pleased but surprised look, i guess he usually doesn't get such an encouraging reaction, but i bet you he felt really good about himself that day.    Calendar If you're bored this weekend, here are some personal recommendations from me to you:  reads: the clothes they stood up in (alan bennett), bel canto (beeeautiful book by ann patchett!) flicks: easter parade beats: brushfire fairytales (jack johnson) eats: shamshiri grill sites: http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0417/p01s04-woap.html (go motherland!)  have fun.

      it suddenly occurred to me today that i am as close to living the life of a typical bachelor as possible for any girl. all i do is work, workout, and study. i only go home home for laundry, eat chicken for dinner every night, and the best part of my day is changing outta my stuffy work clothes to bum around in my favorite green sweats. the only things i don't do are drink beer, belch, and compulsively scatch myself. so anyway, just thought i'd share me living mi vida loca. me very very sleepy now.

      The wind blows where the money goes...  woohoo! i bought my first pair of new balance running shoes. 80 steep buckaroos...if this doesn't motivate me to go running before work, rain or shine, i don't know what will. i can't wait to put some mileage on these babies. i liked them so much i put them on in the car. i swear they even improved my driving.  in the B&N cafe at westside pavilion, there's a mural of great american literary figures like twain, james, wilde, poe, shaw and whitman. they're panoramically sitting in some cafe, serious and intelligent-looking, deep in thought... all, except one: dickinson. the only female figure they chose to include, and she is standing up so that her head is completely cut off and her neck merges into the painting's periphery. if you were dickinson and you saw yourself faceless like that in a picture with peers whose features are all pretty well-delineated, wouldn't you be mad?? i'm no dickinson fan, no idea what her poems mean.  i'm no great feminist either, don't believe women should fight on the battefield like men.  but this is just wrong. look at this picture the next time you're there. it's right above the cash register.

      it was cold, dark, and wet when i woke up this morning.  rain rain go away, come again another day.  at work today, my coworker showed me ultrasound pictures of the baby in his wife's belly. in one word, it was a-mazing. it touched a part of me that i didn't know existed. i guess i've made progress since the time i fainted while visiting a mother with her newborn. well, that mother looked like she had been through irreparable pain and suffering. all for a baby that looked like a bald little shrew. he's really cute now though, for a kid.  i stepped into the dry cleaners today for the first time in my life. i don't believe in buying clothes that have to be dry cleaned, and i guess the few i own have a cleaning long overdue.  anyway, from this day forth, i will try to refrain from complaining about work. these ppl at the dry cleaners work in an unbelievably hot, loud, and small space, yet they are seriously the warmest, friendliest strangers i have ever encountered. made me wanna cry.  on a different note, a really scary looking lady at the bookstore was reading a book titled "why men love bitches." i have no comment.

      ...and the Restless  i vacuumed my apt today for the first time since thanksgiving. i've never seen such a full vacuum bag in my life.  a rhyming poem for mr. back-on-the-market:  rain rain go away, come again another day.  sigh...  "Approximately 83% of adult ADD goes undiagnosed."   hm...if it hasn't been diagnosed, how did they come up with that number? if it's true, then i am definitely part of an overwhelming statistic. hello to the ranks of mozart churchill and jfk. yay me.

      The Young  this season's bachelor is so disappointing. the girls have neither looks nor class. don't they screen for these things? did anyone see the asian girl they had?? seriously hope not. i'm just glad they don't make him keep one asian and one african american just to be pc.  interracial couples intrigue me. i just stare and stare.  do and i spent an ambitious friday night sprawled out on the couch to binge on chick flicks. watched hope floats, love sandra bullock. heavy heavy stuff.

      i'm at work, it's lunchbreak. the hour change completely messed me up. i have no appetite and can't wake up in the mornings. i guess my biological clock is a slow adapter. i don't think i ever fully adjusted to the time difference since i immigrated from china. that was a traumatic experience in more ways than one. so i'm going to watch BLT this weekend to understand myself better.

      i feel so burdened by sadness today.  i watched a chinese show featuring a chinese comedy actress whose daughter was kidnapped, tortured, and raped. all because the actresss was famous and they wanted her money. as a mother, she was going insane wondering at what her child went through in her final days. it was as if someone stabbed a knife in her heart and left it there. this happened a year ago, and now she is trying to move on with life. she said something that only a woman with experience would admit: when you are a girl, you fantasize about storybook romances, and when they don't happen, you convince yourself that you can be a power woman, do anything and everything on your own; after you've been through the wind and the rain, you realize you still want a family to come home to. anyway, she is a very strong lady, and continues to make a living making other ppl laugh while her own life is marked by so much grief.  yesterday, a very famous chinese actor, leslie cheung, who starred in highly artistic but controversial films such as farewell my concubine, jumped to his death from a hotel in hong kong with a note attached to his body saying that he was emotionally troubled. life imitating art, concludes the chinese newspaper.  when i was little, i used to daydream all the time. if i watched a movie, i'd stand in front of the mirror, re-enacting my favorite scene as the leading lady, beautiful and strong, brave martyr of love. if i read a book, i'd use the plot as a template for my own adventures of the imagination. every night, these fantasies would carry me across the hazy line between consciousness and dreams. nowadays, i watch a movie, and i get disgusted by its stupid unreality. i open a book, and i fall asleep. i open my eyes, the race against time begins; i close my eyes, complete blankness...dreams may visit, but they never stay.  the following is part of an email from suki, my roommate in hong kong:  dear, have u read the news lately? u know there's a new kind of virus called atypical pnuemonia? it's really scary!!! people are wearing masks in the street now. i have always been thinking that one day in the world, people will need masks on in the street, because our earth is heavily polluted. but i've never thought that the day would come so soon. before, you look weird if you put on mask in the street, but now, u look weird if you don't. and all schools, including unviversities, are suspended for a week. if one is found to be infected, then all the people who have contacted him will be required to have check up everyday. his workplace will be thoroughly disinfected and his colleagues will be forced to take leave. and u know what, there's a residence building which has increasing number of residents found infected. now the people of that building are isolated in some countryside camps. they are not allowed to go anywhere. the government has never taken such action in history and schools are rarely announced to be suspended.  what a world! i just stay at home these days if there's no need for me to go outside. how about the US? anymore large demonstrations against the war? is everything in order? can u tell me how americans view about this and the political instability if any. i am interested to know. the world is getting so terrible! let there be peace on earth!  this was written by one of my favorite ppl in the world. she can be brutally honest, which is really funny, but also perceptively honest, which is enlightening. now she sounds scared, and i am very scared for her too.

      In the Name of Research...  I spent two hours after work today playing computer games on my dinky laptop. my eyes are going to pop out of my head. I am now an official citizen of nerdville...geekdom...call it what you will. after just one day of conferencing with gaming tycoons in the likes of activision and blizzard, i have been completely brainwashed into thinking that digital gaming is the industry of the future. how shall i put this to make it clear...i once was a blank canvas, but now...i am tony hawk, best darn proskater in the world!! i feel very powerful right now. to all you ppl whom i dissed as loser/no-life/legally-braindead for spending hours submerged in a fantasy world, i owe a formal apology. video games are cool, it's all about the strategy man. but what the heck do i do when my free trial to toontown.com comes to an end? so sad...i feel like ms. mildew kookyzapper is already a part of me...  i better go read a book before i forget how.

      hey guys, my second article got published on our corporate website! something about seeing my name in print is so exhilarating!! even though they edited out half of my original draft. and even if nobody will ever be able find it by visiting our homepage. trust me. i tried. for the whole day at work, i delved into every nook and cranny of our  urlLink site , which i never cared to do before, and still couldn't find it...hm. oh well, still exhilarating!! most great authors weren't appreciated in their time anyway. if you want, you can check it out  urlLink here , it's on market trends in the gaming industry. and if you rate it, i don't care if it's outta philanthropy or pity, please say something nice. muchas gracias.  Interesting Fact of the Day: (from Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlossser) The McDonald's Corporation led the way in the standardization of America's retail environments, rigorously controlling the appearance of its restaurants inside and out.  During the late 1960s, McDonald's began to tear down the restaurants orginally designed by Richard McDonald, the buildings with golden arches atop their slanted roofs.  The new restaurants had brick walls and mansard roofs.  Worried about how customers might react to the switch, the McDonald's Corporation hired Louis Cheskin -- a prominent design consultant and psychologist -- to help ease the transition.  He argued against completely eliminating the golden arches, claiming they had great Freudian importance in the subconscious mind of consumers.  According to Cheskin, the golden arches resembled a pair of large breasts: "mother McDonald's breasts."  It made little sense to lose the appeal of that universal, and yet somehow all-American, symbolism.   gee, and all this time, i thought u guys were just going for the fries.

      The Discovery Channel  As I was growing up, one of my biggest fears was becoming jaded, apathetic, indifferent...basically, losing that feeling of excitement for the fresh and simple experiences that i used to have as a kid because they aren't so fresh or simple anymore. you know what i'm talking about...those things that made you count sheep the night before, like going to disneyland, having birthdays/christmas/groundhog's day, getting ready for the first day of school, having pizza for dinner. today, i realized that the fear of life becoming redundant is groundless. a lot of ppl say that life is about discovering new things. well folks, i dare to tread a small step further and say that life is also about the joy of re-discovery.   and because i love you, you love me, we're a happy fam-i-lee, i'd like to share with you a few of my recent re-discoveries that happy my days, all over again:  The Cosby Show: a truly great show about family, love, and life.  A word: that is melliflous, ubiquitously applicable, and whose conditional usage centrifuges the bona fide erudite from the linguistic dilettantes. and the word is...distill---to extract the essence of. (ta-da, unadorned, unpretentious, and still meaningful)  True friends: are bound by an elastic band. sometimes, that band stretches far and taut, but every now and then, it will snap back in place in time by something as simple as a call. and everything will be as it always was.   Weekends: make the weekdays short. like singing in traffic. and a spoonful of sugar, helps the medicine go down, the medicine go doooowwn, the medicine go down.  The scent of a new book: is only less fragrant than that of a used one.  Wearing clicking heels and putting on lipstick: give me the same tingly feeling of being a real-life grown-up now as they did back when i was five.  Sleep: is a beautiful thing. but like many truly beautiful things, can be easily overlooked.    Mr. Keating from the Dead Poets Society:  "That the perpetual play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.  What will your verse be...?"

      Blast and Blessed  If you think Identity has some pretty good twists, you should watch Down with Love. and if hapless you are just about ready to swear off the big elusive "L," then you should definitely watch Down with Love.  and if you like Down with Love, you should watch Pillow Talk.   oh baby, bring it all to me but i don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings oh baby, bring it all to me gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy, hooooooo...  in the past two days, i've been feeling alternately melancholy. i'm sayin, even queen latifah had trouble singing my blues away. estrogen aside, i think one of the minor reasons was the feeling that my life is so lackluster by standards of the 20-something's. when asked whether i would like to go clubbing, partying, or dating, my answer is always an offensive N-O. it's nothing personal. it's just that, well...me. no. like. sometimes though, i feel so sorry for the inviter, so sorry for saying no, and so sorry for being so boring, that it makes me wonder if i should just try to like it, or pretend to like it.  tonight, thanks to a lovely evening of just hanging out with some lovely ladies, i'm reminded once again that the best things in life are really just plain, clean, and simple. gals: my cup-eth overflow-eth.

      Day 3 @  urlLink E3   i experienced a huge epiphany today: guys who play video games all day long are Big Losers; guys who do it for a living and make big bucks, on the other hand, are Way Cool. i know, i'm a walking contradiction. it's terrible. what can ya do?  But I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more...  E3 is awesome. personal picks: world of warcraft and femme fatale 2:crimson butterfly. personal boos: any game which relies on sex and/or violence as its main/sole selling point (ex: grand theft auto!!).  i was waiting in line for the halo 2 demo when a portly man with a digital camcorder accosted me. "z'cuse me miz," he says with a heavy accent. "i vork for the finland yada yada company. vood u mind being interviewed for a review i am doing on ze show?" sure...but i'm not really in the industry, i say. "iz no problem," he reassures me. "just say how u like ze show, vat u think of ze games, very zimple." okay, i can do that. "oh, by ze way, at ze end of the ze interview, i vill ask u to zpit in my face." p-pardon...u want me to zpit in vous face?? (french, finnish, whatever) "yes, zpit in my face. zpit zpit. it's ze vay i end all my interviewz. kind of like my zignature." uh...i don't think i'm comfortable with that. "ok zen. i give u 50 dollars. zpit in my face."   sorry senor, i only zpit on ppl i know. but danke all the same.

      hi y'all. i'm at work. i shook hands with three ppl from hong kong this morning. i think i'm coming down with something. my mouth is dry, my throat hurts, my forehead feels hot, and my feet feel cold. it can't all be psychosomatic. dear friends, if i don't make it home today, please let the world know that i lived a good and happy life. and had i been given the chance to do it over, i would have done three hours of community service instead of two. and maybe donated some shoes. that is all. peace on earth.

      today, i stood in front of santa monica blvd under the scorching sun holding a huge window screen in one hand (from my pathetic attempt at breakingandentering) and a hamper full of dirty laundry in the other while trying to collect call home on a sticky pay phone that said "get a cell phone u loser" and getting honked at by jerks who were probably all on their way to the beach. mark my words: i will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER lock myself out again. even if i have to staple my keys to my a$%.

      wow. coming out of "identity," i got the feeling that i had seen a pretty good movie, too bad i wasn't sure if i understood all of it. after reading the reviews just now, i'm thinking, "that was SUCH A GREAT MOVIE!!" i'm way too impressionable. thank goodness i wasn't born during the mao era.   a reviewer: "Identity was one of those movies I knew instantly would be in the likes of "Memento;" a movie that basically messed with your mind, if you know what I mean. For an instant the movie seemed as if it would be a regular "whodunit" but took an unexpected twist. It'll have you talking about it for hours. The acting was good, and the scares were even better. I strongly recommend seeing this movie, but not alone."  my thoughts exactly. memento was another movie i had to google. but yeah, if you haven't seen either, go.

      It's really sad when you watch a movie and come out so embarrassingly confounded you have to run home and research it on the internet to find out what you were supposed to have realized on your own so you'll know what to say in case anyone asks. running on eight hours of sleep in the last 48 hours, i think this is what it means to be termed medically braindead. g'nite.

      Memento  My Forgot-To-Do List for today: 1. setting the alarm clock last night (!!!!!) 2. bringing my first-aid kit to work (ie, tweezers/dental floss/facial blotting tissue) 3. picking up dry cleaning after work (hello black skirt, again again and ONCE AGAIN!) 4. calling parents before class 5. bringing permit to campus (meaning paying 8 bucks and no running after class)  and at around 10:15pm, i found myself stuck in a stalled elevator with 7.5 other ppl. the .5 was a really really short man standing very close behind me. for a brief instant, i contemplated smile therapy.  oh well...TGIF. As the ending line goes in one of the longest movies made in history: Tomorrow is another day.                 ":)   :)   :)"

      i miss my grandparents. if i could have one wish right now, it would be to have one day to be five again when i was my grandma's mini-shadow and spoiled rotten by my grandpa. whenever we made dumplings from scratch, my grandma would put me in charge of rolling out the dough. it is a very important task in the whole dumpling making process, and i felt extremely important. to this day, she still says that i rolled the best dumpling skin of any five year old she's ever known. my grandma is probably one of the five senior citizens in china who knows the english alphabet by heart. she was the one who taught it to me so i'd be prepared for america. ppl say that if you spend a lot of time with someone, you will start to look like that person. i lived for three years with my grandma, and even though i was six at the time i left and she was fifty-four, ppl said we looked just like each other.   my grandpa is one of those ppl that commands respect everywhere he goes. whenever i went down to our neighborhood canteen to poke around, everyone would point and whisper, "that's the judge's granddaughter!" you can imagine how important THAT made me feel. for the past thirty some years, rain or shine, my grandpa has gotten up at the crack of dawn to do his tai chi at the park. it was actually from watching my grandpa that i first learned to comb my boy-cut hair on my own. both of us are absolutely crazy about peanuts, and we used to drive my grandma crazy with the nut shells we dropped on the floor. that's why everytime i go back to visit, i make sure to bring a huge jar of peanut butter with me.  it would be really nice to be five and to be with my grandparents again. on top of mother's day and father's day, there should definitely be a grandparents' day as well.

      my boots finally came!!!!!!!!!!! ppl, you cannot begin to understand my joy. i've wanted boots like these since like, high school, and i finally found them in the victoria's secret catalog of all places! but these puppies have been backordered since DECEMBER!! talk about delayed gratification. i'm gonna wear them EVERYWHERE, at ALL TIMES, except when i'm wearing my new balance. to my dear understanding roommies: sorry about all the shoe tracks all over the carpet.  in an effort to not seem completely frivolous, an article from the la times today: (please take the time to read it cuz i took the time to type it, TWO hours past my grandma bedtime..that's right, not UNO, but DOS!!!) it's titled "a clash of personal freedom and common good" by ronald brownstein:  "Europeans accept a welfare state that erects much greater barriers to the individual accumulation of wealth -- through much higher top tax rates -- but provides for a much more comprehensive social safety net than in america, through universal health care and generous subsidies for the unemployed....European societies reached a consensus that the common good sometimes requires individuals to accept greater limits on their own options -- whether to amass wealth or to drive mammoth SUVs.  The European support for international rules and institutions -- from the european union to the united nations -- extends that principle to govern the relations between nations."  (sorry, decided to just take excerpts...underestimated darn tiny newspaper font.)  "Yet this core philosophy seems the real source of the european conflict with bush. at home and abroad, bush's priority is the opposite: he consistently aims to reduce constraints on individual choice, even when that weakens collective institutions...Bush's tax cuts, for instance, put more income back in ind. pockets, but at the price of eviscerating (???) govt revenues that support activities society can undertake only collectively...On social security and medicare, bush's vision is to give individuals increased choice -- at the price of almost certainly diminishing the universal benefit guaranteed to all...  Bush's foreign policy vision follows the same principles... ...on Iraq, Bush was willing to engage the UN, but only to a point. in the end, bush was unwilling to launch an invasion that he believed eessential to nat'l security. ...no u.s. president would strike the balace as far toward europe; it's not in america's genes. but in his domestic and foreign policies, bush seems esp distant from the european model; in many of his actions -- from his emphasis on tax cuts to his rejection of a meaningful UN role even in postwar iraq -- he seems actively hostile to it. after the war, bush and european leaders may talk of reconciling. but the chasm betw them -- less on the use of force than on the val. of collective action -- virtually guarantees more storms across the atlantic."    okay, i really regret having typed this thing, even excerpting was way longer than i imagined. the author sounds pretty anti-bush, but tone aside, which is better policy wise? i know it almost seems obsolete to still be talking about the war, but hello, the war only began like, little over a month ago?? and the front pages have already been replaced with these sensational stories about sars. this is just like what happened in chicago, the movie, when roxie's trial ended. again, can i just say that that was a great movie?? seriously, give me any random situation and i will make a reference back to that movie. anyway, my lsat teacher, dale, aka my NFL rookie, told us that the most effective way to make progress towards a better score is not to keep doing new problems endlessly, but to go back and spend time pondering the problems that we've already done. there's no better way to learn. in case you're not sure, i will tell you right now that i am trying to be clever and make an analogy here. history has ALWAYS been told from the pt of view of the victors. since we're living the history right now, we have the choice to not be "ejucated" on  what to think. man, if i started this blog earlier, it woulda been a lot more coercive, but right now, my bed looks absolutely delicious to me. so your turn to talk. g'nite future churchills hemingways and newtons.

      what a day. three hours of meeting. not one, not two, but T H R E E!! all i can say is, i did my best to keep my eyeballs from rolling to the back of my head. torture is what it is for a person w/ undiagnosed ADD. i must have been really bored, when my director accidentally said "let's kill off two stones with one bird on this project," the mental picture tickled me so much i had to excuse myself to the bathroom, just so i could release my giggles. actually, it's still pretty funny...imagine a dumb bird flying head on into two unsuspecting rocks and DOIIINNGGGG!! tell me you don't think that's funny.  anyone: clap your hands if you want to watch daddy day care with me. clap twice if you want to watch finding nemo.

      Dazed and Confucius  Chinese doctors crack me up. my dad and i both have this skin condition on our hands that gets painfully dry and itchy at certain times of the year. i woke up four times last night to find myself scratching like a madwoman. so today, we went to see a "specialist" in hacienda heights. special is an understatement.  doc:    what's wrong with you. me:     uh...my hand. (i hold up the evidence. doc takes one glance, no contact, begins mad illegible scribbling on presciption pad.) doc:    this ointment VERY strong. rub on hand twice a day. me:     does it have any side effects? doc:    Yes. Many. me:     uh...like what? doc:    nevermind. you no need to know. (Father and i exchange looks of bewilderment.) me:     uh...will it make me fat? doc:    No. me:     Okay I'll take it!  dear God: please keep me safe from sprouting hairy moles. amen.

      The Gladiator  oye, i'm pooped guys. during break, i was out cold turkey. man, what a blissful 15 minutes they were. the only thing i can remember from class tonight are the funny squiggles on the underside of my eyelids.  every once in a while, i'd look up at my teacher and shoot him a look that says "what?? you're still talkin??" no. i'm kidding. actually, when i do check into the realm of consciousness, i get quite a bang outta this class. one of my instructors is pretty witty. his name is Dale (whole, not chipped!), and he got his Ph.D. specifically for the L-S-A-T. that's right, you heard me. the man did his dissertation on the analytical reasoning section of the test. so basically, we have ourselves a full grown man who eats, breathes, and pees the lsat, and has no intention of going to law school. Now some of you may look down on such a life as this. but i say, let a man live his dream. sometimes when i look at Dale, standing tall behind the podium, ready to pounce on those tough problems, i see him as a football champ of sorts. one goad from the crowd, "hey lsat-man, do #3!!" and off he goes with mind-boggling speed, ploughing through passages, tackling the "could be false's" and "all of the following EXCEPT's," dodging the trap of extreme "always's" and "never's" to arrive at the finish line flushed with victory and answer choice X tucked safely under his arm. shoot, with such exhilarating mental stimulation, who needs espn?  work has been really slow for the past two weeks b/c of SARS. i realized that i can get pretty clingy during these downtimes. when i get a call for instance, i try to keep the caller on the phone as long as possible. no matter what it takes. i want to know about their concerns, their hopes, aspirations, life philosophies, you name it. no. i'm kidding. but seriously, i've been bored to my wits' end. and then, this afternoon, the penduluum (sp??) swung the other way. i was running around the office like a chicken w/ its head chopped off. everything was a blur, i felt like my arms and legs were flailing all over the place, my baby hairs escaped my hairband and stuck straight outta my head. it was madness i tell ya. and for some reason, when things get busy, it snowballs. the copier broke, the fax jammed up, the printer kept flashing "offline!!" man, my heart was racing even though i was completely caffeine free. and then the calls started coming in, calls which i had neither the time nor patience for. i swear i got a call from the slllllooooowwwweeeest taaaaaaaalker in the world. seriously, i was about to scream, "Lady, i have NO TIME for your verbal constipation!! c'mon c'mon out with it!!" but being laura the affable professional, i just nodded my head, as if she could see me at the other end of the line, and said "uh huh...well let me check on that for you...." eh. that's work life i guess. so by 5pm, i felt so battered i practically had to crawl outta the office. and just when i'm about to step onto the escalator, i see this beautiful yellow gerber daisy lying on the bridge between my building and the westin bonaventure, so on a whim, i walk outside and pick it up before it's blown away, and as i'm walking to my car, treasure in hand, i feel like the luckiest girl in the world.  me sleep now. g'nite you crazy kids.

      gosh, i am blogging at two places. i feel bad for neglecting one or the other because both xanga and blogger seem to have a great, hardworking and responsive staff. therefore, i am doing both. this is exactly what happens when i watch a ballgame. i start out rooting for one team, and as soon as there is a disparity in the scores, i start feeling sorry for the underdog and start cheering for that one instead. this ambivalence is also reflected in my lack of partisanship of any particular political party. (how's that for alliteration?) i think i will end up voting republican for governor and democrat for president. (go dean!) both of which, of course, will most likely lose anyway.  i would like to make it a tentative goal to run in the LA marathon in may. i don't care about my finish time, my goal is just to finish the race, and live to tell about it.  when my self-imposed bank account freeze is over (lord give me strength), the first thing i'm gonna do is go to b&n to buy the following books: -she's not there by jenny boylan -benjamin franklin -kavalier and clay -  there were some other books i wanted. can't remember right now. will revise later.

      things that make me very happy these days:  1. running after dark, with no pressure to run at any particular speed, which naturally only makes me run faster and longer than i thought myself capable of. 2. talking on the phone with my best friend who just started med school. 3. going to hometown buffet with my parents and watching my dad thoroughly enjoy chowing down the world's tallest self-made salad drenched in gallons of ranch dressing (which is probably the equivalent of three big mac's).  i decided to start midnight in the garden of good and evil. i tried to start it last night, but after reading three lines of the first page, i remembered why i never got past page 12 three years ago.  coupons are evil. they only make you spend money where you wouldn't have spent any in the first place. i am such a sucker.  infomercials are evil too. i never ever want to start with that. they're sooo dang convincing...just watching them makes me feel like i'm already doing something good for myself.  okay i'm tired from the running.

      Last night, i finished reading Bel Canto by Ann Patchett. can i just say that i cannot imagine a book to be any more beautifully tragic or tragically beautiful??  i  must remember that this is one of those books that i'd like to re-read when i am old and toothless. this book is probably another reason why i had that dream about being shot by a terrorist, and why the terrorist had a gentle and sad face that i could not help feeling kindly towards.  my next book will be mrs. dalloway. and after that lolita. and after that either the poisonwood bible or midnight in the garden of good and evil which has literally been sitting on my bookshelf for half a decade. i shall refrain from buying any more books until i have read these. i am still working on fast food nation, which i started exactly a year and a half ago. it's been everywhere with me, from shanghai to guilin to beijing to santa monica to downtown LA and back to cerritos. it's a really good book, and i'm not trying to be sarcastic. i just can't read nonfiction as voraciously as i do fiction. call me a dud.  life is seriously all about balance. this is probably something that i will not attain until i am old and toothless and re-reading bel canto in my rocking chair.   actually, i think my next reading project will be the mammoth cheese. all i know is that it has something to do with the thomas jefferson supporters who made a 1,000 lb of cheese in his honor and transported it from someplace to someplace in the eighteenth century. why would ppl do that?? obviously i did not purchase this book. it's just one among the many of my souvenirs from the LA book expo.  i haven't had any interesting dreams lately. they're usually just an incoherent extension of scattered memories. but they're quite disturbing. why do our pasts follow us around like an unshakeable shadow? i wake up feeling like i haven't really slept at all. i guess sometimes something other than time is needed for the ability to forget.  yaaaay! my dad just came home from dinner with a businessman from china and brought back a whole bag of shiseido cosmetics that he received as gifts. i don't really know what any of them are for though. the only english on the bottles are "mousse visage tendre," "lotion tendre," "protection tendre," and "emulsion tendre." what order would i apply them in...? lotion is obviously lotion. emulsion could be cleanser...protection might be for SPF daywear... and mousse visage is moisturizer...? i don't want to risk being wrong. does anyone know cosmetic-speak? hm. does anyone even know i'm blogging here?   okay i just found the "manual" to the cosmetic set. for future reference, the "mousse" is actually the cleanser, the "lotion" is the toner, the "emulsion" is for nightwear, and the "protection" is for daywear. wow, i only guessed one outta four right. i think i'll just stick to neutrogena.

      chicago is out on dvd! yippeeee! i don't think i'm gonna buy it though. i already saw it three times in the theater and bought the soundtrack, which is practically like watching the movie anyway. and of all the movies i've ever bought, i rarely watch any of them over. just knowing that it's out on dvd with the option of being owned is enough to make me that much happier.  i saw brueschie, my high school calc teacher, on channel six's ABC Hour last night. it was for some robot design competition she headed with a bunch of asian kids. she looks just the same. i always thought it's kinda sad to be a teacher, seeing all these kids come and go each year, but you're always there in the same place. yeah yeah i know it's a gratifying job to feel like you've made an impact and taught something to a young person and yada yada...but it's still sad to me. i remember visiting my junior high math teacher at carmenita two years ago. the classroom looked EXACTLY the same, he wore the same clothes from the 70s, but was skinnier, and a lot older. still had the same old overhead projector in the middle of the room, still using the same red/blue/green/purple markers, still cracking the same jokes, still going over the same hmwk problems. i didn't know who was more anachronistic, that classroom or me being in it. well...i guess it's not all that bad, i mean, he made enough of an impact on me that i went back to visit him after all these years. but still. i never want to be the one who stays behind. that's just me.  speaking of brueschie, the one memory that sticks out is the time she called me out of my second period English with Shoop to go to her second period calc class and help her out with a calc problem she was stuck on. i honestly do not know why in the world she called me. first of all, i got by okay in that class, but my test scores weren't stellar or anything. secondly, even though i took summer class with her, i ditched all the time and didn't even show up for the final. so yeah, when that happened, i was baffled. and full of remorse for having BS'd all my homework, cuz i had no idea what she was talking about. i think that's probably when her cataracts were getting pretty serious. anyway, good thing albert tsai was hanging around and solved the problem for the both of us.  i am no longer a raving lunatic. at least not for another month. yay. :)  the minute i'm done with this test and get myself a job, i'm going to get highlights in my hair and maybe a facial at a really nice spa because stress does horrors to the skin. and NO ONE is going to stand in my way! haha.

      today i overheard a conversation between a high school girl and her dad at the park. the dad asked the girl how school was, and she said it's okay, but hard to meet ppl, so the dad says "hard to meet ppl?" and she says, "yeah, no drug free americans." what???? for real?? in little cerritos??? and why would u say that to your dad and drive him crazy with fear??  i watched a little bit of the michael essany show. the mom makes all the guests take off their shows in consideration of the carpet, no matter who it is.  jessica simpson and nick lachey are going to have a reality show about their post marriage life on mtv. no more reality shows puhlease!! look what real world started!! can the term be more ironic though?  hi. my name is laura. i am a recovering shopaholic. i am proud to be abstinent for exactly six weeks and two days. i am stating this accomplishment today in case i lose it tomorrow at the mall with not one, but TWO rock-my-world gift certificates.  one thing i really hate is when ppl blame their moodiness on pms. if you gonna be bitchy, just be bitchy, don't blame it all over something else. but every month, i am reminded that i myself fall victim to this terrible biological phenonmenon for which i have no control over. let me just clarify that all the things associated with pms is not urban legend. it's all true. the bloating from water retention, oily skin and breakouts, feeling ugly, and not just ugly, but uuuuuuugleeeeee! and fat. and really really pissed off. that was me today. i woke up four pounds heavier than i was yesterday, first thing i saw in the mirror was a pink blotch on my chin, and i was literally annoyed at EVERYTHING. the damn birds chirping, the raucus of the law mower, sleeping past seven, and on and on. i was sooooo annoyed for the better half of the day for NO reason at all. and then the physical evidence came that i had not gone off the deep end. anyway, my point is, when ppl say stuff like i have major pms today, they're not lying. but, i still don't like the idea of using pms to apologize for crass or unreasonable behavior, and using pms as an excuse for it is definitely not cool. i guess the only solution is to completely isolate oneself from the world once a month on the day that disaster strikes. that's why i think all women should be given an extra day of vacation from work once a month. not that this affects me right now. but one day it will. and my name ain't laura lu if i'm not always working towards a better tomorrow for the good of all wo/mankind. :)

      i like blogger. it feels more authentic. i don't like writing without anonymity.   i purchased a blender today for $24. it was a great deal. half of the stuff in my fridge has already either been chopped/blended/mixed/slushied/or pureed. puree means to prepare by straining or blending. this is my life.  pay it forward is on tv right now. it's a great movie with both kevin spacey and helen hunt, two of my favorite actors! how come i never heard anything about it before??  madonna is doing gap commercials...target is now carrying isaac mizrahi...what the heck is going on??  weight lifting does wonders. i must remember this for as long as i live.  when did i become such a ppl snob? who do i think i am?? haha, oh well. i'd much rather be a snob than to have low to zero standards. although i do wish i weren't so racist. i was flipping through some grad school catalogs and got a culture shock just from seeing all those campus photos being filled with white ppl. i should just throw myself in nebraska or something.  hm...193 candidates for the recall...who to vote for...  kevin spacey just unbuttoned his shirt and showed helen hunt all his burn scars. beauty is in the eye of the beholder. i really believe it. anybody can look good to me once they prove they're good ppl. i'd say that 98.9% of the ppl i've met have become pretty or good looking to me after i got to know them. i think i could love a man as long as he is funny, equally intelligent, and kind, regardless of any physical defects. unless he's got nasty jagged crooked yellow teeth...or is super short. the teeth thing because, try as i might, i just can't imagine kissing that without experiencing a significant amount of pain. and as for shortness, it's stereotyping, but most of the really short ppl i've met in my life are not the nicest or most generous of ppl. i think they feel the need to compensate for their lack of height by being extra assertive, extra sensitive, or extra defensive. i call it the short complex. this is why i would never vote for gary coleman in the recall. i saw him in person at E3. let's just say he looked like one mean little dude who is not to be messed with. maybe they made a video game outta him.

      so sad, somebody declared cyber war on xanga...  wow, blogger is so different now. nice...  i am such a traitor, haha.  people make mistakes, doctors not excluded. don't easily believe any one person's opinion over your own, always get more than one expert opinion, and don't go into surgery unless you HAVE TO, or this might happen:  urlLink what a nightmare.   due to the wonderful commute from cerritos to LA and back, i have learned to rap my very first song, "where is the love" by black eyed peas. it's a great song. and hurray for me.  there's something very different about early morning joggers/walkers. they're all so dang pleasant. all smiles all the time...i just don't get it. and most of them are over 50. well, it's high time they learn a thing or two about morning crankiness...  the dream i had the other day of getting shot in the heart by a terrorist still lingers with me. i think it might have something to do with my friend telling me that his classmates in med school play catch with a human heart to help with their learning. nevertheless, i am very bothered by this dream. i didn't go to heaven after i died, nor did my spirit hover over my loved ones, and i didn't wake up in time to not get shot. everything just went black, and i felt weightless, but the blackness felt heavy, and there was complete silence, but it was loud in-your-face type of silence, and i knew with certainty that i was dead, and it would be like that forever. i can't explain. but...is this what i really think about death???  okay, enough morbid talk. i bought a trampoline for $20 today. i am looking forward to bouncing in the backyard and scaring the crap outta my dogs and neighbors.

      okay. i did not kick bootay on my last diag. it was my own bootay that got rocked instead. i could not believe some of the retarded mistakes i made.  i've decided upon a golden rule of thumb to use during my test: when in doubt, think and act like ju yon kim. observe: "hm, both B and D look mighty tasty to me...what would ju yon pick?" and hopefully, i will be thunderstruck by a moment of clairvoyance. please note, in consideration of the good of humanity and society in general, i would NEVER, EVER apply this rule to any situation outside of the test. ju yon kim, btw, is my friend who went to yale and is currently attending grad school at stanford.

      i watched The Big One by Michael Moore during one of my study breaks this week. i didn't know that nike doesn't have any of its shoe factories in america. in spite of moore's rampant attacks on the mores of corporate downsizing, however, i couldn't help but to agree with the industrial mega-giants and their profit maximizing strategies. i mean, the goal of a ceo is to make the firm as successful as it can be, which simply means maximizing revenue and reducing costs to maintain a competitive edge. if that entails using labor abroad where it's cheaper while maintaining the quality of the product, then it is obviously in the best interest of the firm to take that strategy. unfortunately for the domestic workers who must bear the brunt, technically, it's not the concern of the corporation. this is darwinism in modern day civilization, in the free market economy. if you started to make it the responsibility of firms to watch out for the interest of society in general, how would you go about enforcing that? where would the line be drawn? i'm not saying i'm against that, but...it's just unrealistic. and wouldn't that be the essence of socialism, which we, as a democracy, is against in principle? still, kudos to moore for paving the way for policy changes that could compromise the conflict of interests at stake here.  btw. all the terms that i took away with me from having majored in "the dismal science," i just regurgitated above. i know nothing more. haha.

      lawd...i'm tired.  i got this new book of short stories called you are not a stranger here by this guy who graduated from yale law school. it's a pulitzer prize finalist, and i thought i'd use it for bedtime reading to help me sleep. boy was i wrong. the stories are FRIGGIN DEPRESSING and i couldn't fall asleep until 4am last night. all of them share this extremely painful, disturbing, and heartbreaking quality. there's a story about this aging manic inventor who's reaching out to his estranged gay son, a woman whose deceased teenage son was a drug addict and chopped off her fingers with a cleaver that she was using to make him soup while he was high, a brother and sister whose mother hung herself from a tree, an orphaned boy who forms a self-destructive and violent relationship with a classmate, and a guy who suffers from manic depression takes a trip with his wife and coordinates his suicide with the slow death of a boy whose flesh is rotting from psoriasis. at the end of every story, i was so disturbed by what i'd read i just wanted to stop and put the book down, but i kept reading. my doing so was almost like a reflection of the tortuous masochism prevalent in those stories. i guess that's why the book is called what it is. in its exploration of suffering in a way that appears so alien to our lives, there is something in the essence of the human pain presented that all of us are familiar to and none of us are immune to. and it makes clear that the line between sanity and insanity is a very fine one. so i guess what's most disturbing about the book is also it's most engrossing and universal quality. but i think i better not read anymore of this until after my test.  there's another book out i really want to read. it's called the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime by mark haddon. i will get this when it comes out in paperback.

      i took two huge study breaks today, both of which i considered indispensable, like how i had to color coordinate my closet yesterday. the first one was for the recall debate, and the second one was for the season premiere of the bachelor.   in regards to the former, i found the mudslinging very distasteful and it was rightfully dubbed by one commentator as "the battle of the accents." i still don't like cruz bustamante, and there is no way i'm voting for the democrats who overspent and placed california in this budgetary quagmire in the first place. after this debate, i've decided to not vote for the terminator, because i think he lacks the political experience and insight that is necessary to get california back on track. i just got the feeling that he doesn't have a solid grasp of all the issues facing the state, nor of the legislation needed to remedy them, and was using all these puffy one-liners like 'three strikes and you're out' to cover up his inadequacy. most importantly, i began to doubt his mental acuity. when they were talking about opposing issuance of driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, for example, arnold said that it would risk admitting "dangerous" persons into the country. i think this was a terribly politically incorrect thing to say, implying what? a linkage between all immigrants and terrorists? mcclintock at least had the common sense to give as his reason that doing so would run counter to the law of illegal immigration, which is exactly what the bill does. admittedly, i'm basing my judgment on a very limited scope, but i think mcclintock is the best man for the job. at least he's got experience and stays focused on the issues. but...is it just me or is he a little cross-eyed? and how come gray davis was not on the panel?  as for bob the bachelor, i'm predicting that he's gonna choose estella or....er...i forget her name, but the blonde girl with bangs. let me once again take pride in the fact that for the past two seasons, i totally called it without having to watch any full episodes other than the very first one. what can i say, it's a gift.   i. friggin. hate. reading. comp!!!

      did i mention how much i dislike bill o'reilly? i don't think there's anyone on television who i find more annoying than this man. basically, all he does on the o'reilly factor is oversimplify issues and distort his opponent's argument to his own advantage. last time i checked, that method of reasoning definitely qualifies as a big in-your-face logic flaw! not only did he put down howard dean repeatedly, he is now poking fun at dean for being a coward and not agreeing to be a guest on his show. well hello! if i were dean, i wouldn't go on his show either and place myself against a man who does not know how to reason! all he's gonna do is ask questions in a way that leads in his favor, and if dean should begin to say anything that makes sense, o'reilly will simply cut in because it's his show and he can do whatever he wants and pull his usual "look, whatever" and "i don't think so, let's move on." please. even i have better comebacks than that. but then again, what do you expect of a right-wing bigot...

      i just called my ex to wish him a happy birthday. unfortunately, i haven't talked to him for a couple of months and his voicemail picked up. basically, the message that i left was a hairpin away from being the real life version of that infamous phone scene in the movie swingers. i am mortified. for the past hour, i have been hoping and praying that the cell phone service in the greater los angeles area will pull a new york blackout and wipe clean all voicemail messages. on the bright side, i've done the honorable thing by letting him say good riddance and finally shake free from the laura looooove spell. okay soooooo kidding...but seriously, now i gotta add practice leaving voicemail skills to my list of urgent to-do's. just another day in the life of laura lu....

      i had a baby in my dream last night. not the actual process of being pregnant and giving birth, just that somehow, i'd accidentally had sex (like how i'd accidentally step on dog poo or something) and ended up as a single mother. it was a beautiful baby girl with a very sweet face and large curious eyes, and she grew at lightening speed and was extra precocious, so that i remember being bewildered in my dream and wondering if other babies could stand up on their own 30 min after birth, sprout a headful of soft brown hair, and had eyes that made their mother feel like the baby was the wiser of the two. and everything was so vivid as i held her and inhaled that milky baby scent and breastfed her and diaper-changed her, and everytime i looked at her, there was an aching in my heart because she was so beautiful and perfect and precious and i loved her so much but i'd betrayed her by having her out of wedlock and being an inadequate mother. and i remember worrying about the power outlets and stairs in my house which i hadn't childproofed, and being scared of holding her the wrong way, and what brand of baby food was the most nutritious or whether the diapers i used would give her a rash. i was also extremely stressed about how in the world i was gonna raise a child and go to law school at the same time. the only thing i knew for sure in my dream was that i didn't need to name her, because she was going to be my one and only baby, i would be her one and only mother, and that all of my attention for the rest of my life would be focused on her alone and no one else would exist in my world as far as i was concerned, so there was no need for me to call her anything. and ironically, it was my little daughter who alone was able to comfort me and gave me the sense that she was there to take care of me and not vice versa. and when i woke up, i was sad that my baby guardian angel wasn't real.   yeah, so i've been having many sleepless nights, and many many weird and EXTREMELY vivid dreams on top of that. i cannot write this entry to satisfaction, as i am unable to convey how real the existence of my baby felt, and her essence, what she looked like, sounded like, crawled and toddled like.   i dunno what to make of all the mixture of joy and pain of childrearing, the feeling of inadequacy and inability to control so many things, of loving something so much and confronting the potential loss...i for one like to have my emotions and fears simple and a la carte, one at a time, no "puree-ing," and not exist in continuum for the rest of my life. i just know that if i ever become a mother, i will not have a single moment's peace thereafter when i am not thinking or worrying about my baby. if i got anything out of this dream though, it's that i would never have an abortion, married or not, just because i never planned to have babies, because i could never do that to this beautiful dream baby of mine.   it's also been brought to my attention that simply deciding against premarital sex is apparently no longer sufficient. it is now necessary for one to also be on the constant lookout for sex poo lurking your neighborhood park and fire hydrants in particular. maybe this is why ppl came up with the idea of chastity belts.

      i called the testmasters helpline today. a) i felt really geeky, b) i felt mentally challenged, and c) i felt like i should talk about my drug addiction or battle with anorexia or something. so after five minutes of being put on hold and listening to mozart, i decided to look up the one word in the stimulus that i didn't know, and lo and behold, i figured the problem out.    i think a lotta things are affected by perspective and attitude. when i first started studying for this test, it boggled my mind how anyone could finish the games section on time. for the longest time, i felt like it was an impossibility, so obviously, i was never able to finish all the games questions. but one day towards the end of last month, i thought, okay, in order to get so and so score, i HAVE to finish the games, no "if's" or "but's," i just gotta do it. so thereafter, something just clicked and i was suddenly able to finish all the games before time was up. now i just gotta apply that same attitude to reading comp. i'm really annoyed that of all three sections, this is the one that i always miss something in. and they're not my typical stupid mistakes. these are questions that i really mull over, drawing straws between two tempting choices. but i'm annoyed because, hello, i've only been reading all my life, and probably more so than the average person my age, so what's the dealio?? the one question type that always gets me is those interpretation questions, like, what can be inferred by this or that. if i can do it in logical reasoning, why can't i do it in reading comp?? oh yeah. another stinker is which of the following would most likely follow the last sentence of the passage. man. i shoulda gotten a study partner. then i'd actually discuss this with someone and not be a loser blogging about test strategies.  i had fish for dinner at home today. something i should always remember: no matter how great the restaurant is, white ppl just can't cook fish. i shoulda gotten the beef ribs yesterday.

      okay. now i know why i shouldn't go out when i have to prepare for something important. the contrast between fun and work is simply insidious towards productivity. i've done practically nothing today. all i want to do is go out and play again! how old am i?? how old?? o shizzel...i'm old.  i had trouble sleeping again last night. i keep thinking about how i became such a cynic and non-believer about everything. God, love, normalcy...i don't believe in anything anymore. well, maybe not so much these things, but ppl who tout these things. you call yourself a christian? then wipe off that hypocritical sunday face and be a real person. you love me? prove it by the endurance of subtle actions and not by words and romantic gestures please.  you think you're more normal than the person you're laughing at? sorry, i don't think anyone's normal. not you, not me, not him or her. i don't know what normal is anymore. i don't like this. i've been feeling black for a long time. not the race, just the mood. every night opens up a can of worms, which is probably why i can't sleep. i guess i'm just pissed off in general, mostly at myself. i wonder, if i had a painting of myself like the picture of dorian gray, what would i look like? dunno, but i sure wouldn't have the galls to look at it these days.   okay. i finally got a little bit of it off my chest. this blogging thing does have some use. let's see if i sleep better tonight. i go do something i should be doing now.

      i've been wanting to go to l'orangerie, a reeeeally nice french restaurant in beverly hills, for just about the past four years of my life, and tonight i finally got to! it's probably the first really pricey restaurant i've been to that i felt was worth the arm, leg, and many many potential heart surgeries that it cost. the place was floral all over, softly glowing with flickering candles and live piano music in the background. very romantic...but probably not a place i'd want to go to with a guy, cuz that kind of ambience is too overwhelming, or mushy-mushy as the japanese would say, which always makes me feel like a trapped rabbit or something. but it's nice going to with girl friends cuz there's no pressure or expectation to have to be in a certain mood or behave extra enamored. so i had a great time. despite the arm and leg. i was stunned to discover how much of a bum i've become and how much i loathe dressing up though. damn the person whoever invented heels!!   one thing that always crosses my mind when i go to these places is the fact that i'm only 22 and i come to these places as if i'm all that but my parents who are almost 50, who actually make the money that allows me to enjoy such luxuries, can't enjoy such things. i say "can't" because i've tried taking them to really nice restaurants and they never leave happy. which is understandable cuz i still think eating out should be more about the food than the setting, something pricey places tend to overlook. but anyway, when my parents were my age, their lifestyles were 500 times more modest and humble than mine, which is something that i really respect and feel guilty about. i always have this ideal that i'd really like to see my parents one day be able to put down their burdens, the heaviest of which probably being me, and just enjoy the finer things in life, like traveling! i never did feel right about having gone all over europe when my parents have never been there, but then again, i am a big hypocrite cuz i went right on traveling to shanghai and southern china the following year...   also watched lost in translation. a lot darker than i expected. there's this one part where bill murray is talking about his estranged relationship with his wife and how once upon a time they were very much in love but after so many years and kids they just grew more and more distant until they became strangers tied by the legality of marriage. even though it's just a movie, i am sure it's reflective of many relationships and just reaffirms my growing skepticism about marriage in general.  i hope to not have another tortuously sleepless night. clear my head and rest my soul.

      nine months after my first (and in all likelihoood last) relationship, i think i'm finally done recovering and hoarding "time to myself" and happy to become a social creature again. i am so looking forward to dinner at a lovely french restaurant tomorrow and maybe breezing through the sunset strip with two ppl whose company i enjoy muchisimo! i'm looking forward even more to a cross country trip with one my best friends (some time before we turn eighty)!!  my mom told me about a saying in chinese that says the width of a man's shoulders is reflective of the size of his heart. hm...i wouldn't know the truth of this, seeing as how most guys i know are pretty skinny. my friend jane has saying that goes something like the style of a guy's shoes is reflective of the size of his wallet. i think this one can go undisputed.

      my head is pounding. my throat is throbbing.  there are gov't workers out there getting six figure salaries for doing nothing.  i studied at the library today. around 3pm, the place was filled with puberty-stricken high schoolers. a quiet little girl sat across the table from me. i learned from her homemade bookcover that her name is monica ha and she has fourth period health with mr. swanee. she looks like someone i woulda been friends with, quiet to most ppl but very fun to be with if you know her well enough.   in stark contrast, i wanted to smack the boys sitting at the table behind me. if there's one thing i cannot stand, it's pure jibberish. sure, inane words manage to slip outta my mouth once in a while, but i never talk FULL jibberish, which is ALL that these boys were about. in the whole two hours that they were there, they did not have one single topic of conversation, and yet they managed to make so much noise!! i cannot believe that when i was that age, i used to be intimidated by or had crushes on these gaseous idiots!!   i've been dealing with severe insomnia for about two months now. last night i woke up at 3 and didn't fall back asleep until 6. it makes me hate my bed because it's become the site of so much miserable tossing and turning and hot squirming and terrible terrible terrible haunting dreams. so yesterday, i came up with an ingenious way to cure myself by changing my sheets and giving my bed a complete makeover. obviously it didn't work too well. i am at a loss. imagine how cranky you get during finals week from lack of sleep. that is how i've been for the past two months. i feel like a vampire.

      my dad is H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!! first thing he said to me, in quite a serious tone might i add, when we sat down for dinner: jennifer and ben split! where does he get this stuff?? hahahaha! i guess this is what phD's do in their spare time when the white lab coats and goggles and pocket protectors come off. so anyway, i had to hop on the internet immediately after dinner to just make sure about the bennifer split, and yep, it's confirmed. just call us the royal tabloids.

      there is a girl in my lsat class who doesn't shave her legs. the thing is, she has the most toned, best looking legs i have EVER seen! didn't i blog about this a long time ago?? the rules of being a lady or something like that. and what did i say?? that's right, if you don't have time to shave, wear panty hose!! judging by the length and density of her hairs, i am deducing that this is more the result of complete oblivion to a cultural standard than anything else. aye...shame...such a shame!!   oh well, who gets the final word on whether girls should shave or not anyways? girls in china don't shave their armpits or their legs, and it's only weird to me b/c i was raised in the western culture. maybe it's weird to them that i do shave. my mom never shaved. but that's cuz she's completely hairless, one heck of a great gene that didn't get passed on to me. honestly, i woulda traded my overbite gene for the hairless gene any day. i guess we just gotta deal with what we're dealt with.   yay! tomorrow is moon festival. i dunno why i like this holiday so much...maybe cuz it's distinctly chinese, and it's simple, no big fuss, when the moon at its roundest and brightest, and just reminds us to unite with our loved ones or remember those who are far away. i hope my grandma and grandpa will be healthy for a long long time. i hope my cousins are doing well in school. i hope my other cousin is liking her job. and i hope my other other cousin stops hanging out with hooligans, overeating and drinking. i hope my aunts and uncles are earning more money, and not losing more hair. mmm...oh yeah, i hope my parents and i will always be this close, if not -er!  i'm finishing midnight in the garden of good and evil tonight. i really hope jim williams got acquitted. this book contained a lotta words i didn't know. the only two i bothered to look up were "pompadour" and...okay i forgot. but if i recall correctly, it also meant some kinda hairstyle. hey hey, i never claimed to be no lisa simpson, or kare17 "harvard" 9uo (this is in case she googles herself and sues me).  i go to bed now.

      blogging does have some use after all. i think i will be basing my personal statement on the blog about my love for chopin. i'm writing this so i won't forget since my memory has proved itself insufficient under almost every circumstance recently. i need to do some research on his life, see if i can manipulate some impressive parallels, and somehow weave an explanation for my unimpressive gpa and why grades are not predictive of my success in law school. why why WHY didn't i CARE in college??? anyway, i am actually kinda excited about writing this sucker. but honestly, honestly, i just keep thinking...if i were on the admissions board, regardless of my lsat score, with so many applicants this year and so many AMAZING ppl out there, why would i admit myself? i wouldn't.   last night i suffered the worst bout of sleep apnea that i can remember.   my skin must also be reacting to my stress level. hm...i don't remember ever breaking out in college. i guess that just goes to show where my priorities DIDN'T lay back then.   maybe this is what i should state in bold red letters on my application: if i go to law school, i promise to not slack off and go abroad and lose complete motivation for studying upon my return!!!!! taaaaaaake me!!! i'm smart!!! i just don't work hard!!!  haha. i don't think so.

      man. i'm kinda sad. i just came back from lunch with my friend. and i gave her my crab. which i've been trying to get rid of ever since i got it. but now i'm sad. like, something's missing. this is very unexpected. i never thought i could form emotional attachments to something that i thought was really hideous, and it didn't even talk, or bark, or do anything really. and yet, i feel like a part of me has departed. i can't even bare to look at the tupperware that i used to put it in. it just looks so...empty. omigawd. i wonder if she remembered to take it outta the car...in this temperature, it's gonna fry for sure. man. now i gotta concoct some excuse to get it back. without making a big fuss cuz ppl will think i'm a lame-o. i went to very great and publicized lengths to get rid of it. o man...think think think!

      i'm super sleepy right now. but i have to blog before bed because i don't wanna spend another night having dreams that bring all my repressed emotions to surface. that's right. even i have repressed emotions dammit! (or is it suppressed? who knows the difference?) seriously. what's up with me? from the minute i close my eyes at night to the moment i open them in the morning, i dream and dream and dream and i wake up feeling VERY disturbed. don't even say i'm overanalyzing cuz i KNOW there must be a reason why i'm having these dreams. all i gotta say is, pasts really can follow you around like a twenty-four hour shadow.   other than that, i just wanted to document my discovery today that my dad is a big fan of Friends. he watches it right after the nbc nightly news with tom brokaw.  i only made this discovery today because i usually go upstairs right after dinner when the news broadcast ends. but today was different because i actually decided to do the dishes for my mom out of the pure magnanimity of my big gracious heart. but yeah, i was very very shocked to say the least. first of all, i can't believe that my dad likes something like that, something that i like. secondly, i can't believe that he understands all the jokes and laughs at all the right times. my dad's english is actually pretty good, but there's certain slang or certain references in pop culture that i guess i really underestimated his comprehension for. yeah. so now friends ranks right up there with three's company in my dad's book, and my respect for him has increased manifold.  i go to bed now. don't even THINK about coming near me if your name is anxiety-ridden dreams!!!

      oh yeah, i remember why i started the last blog. i was just wondering, is it just me or is it kinda weird that ppl message other random ppl on friendster? okay, i guess that was the whole point of friendster, but still...it just makes me think that a) these ppl are desperate, and/or b) these ppl are weird. and if you don't respond when random ppl message you, especially if the message is really personalized, it's pretty rude and sad. oh well. i guess weird ppl just gotta deal with that. and then there's some other ppl who have more than 400 friendsters!! hello! i don't think i've even said hello to that many ppl in my entire life! no way can all those ppl be their friends. so in that sense, it actually kinda defeats the purpose. anyway, my point is...i would never care to date anyone through friendster because then i'd have to lie to all my friends, family, and future kids and grand kids about how i met my husband. no way. too complicated man.

      another day.   everything is good again.  i am such a big sucker. i have been brainwashed by ______ university because they sent me a cd-rom with a virtual tour of their beautiful campus and all these student testimonials. i watch it once every night and turn up the speakers. even though i'm trying really hard to keep it from them, i think my parents have an inkling of where i want to go. i should never watch infomercials.  i must go brainwash myself some more now.

      my dad has a super duper mega powered ping pong ball machine at his office. it's soooo fun! my arm is going to fall off though...if my shoulder doesn't first.  the bane of my success: optimism and smugness. yes, i get terribly smug about myself very easily. apparently, i got it from my dad's side of the family. when i learn something new, whether it's the piano, tennis, pingpong, or brush painting, my teachers always compliment me on how fast i pick things up. it doesn't go far past the initial phase though, because all that flattery gets to my inflatable head and i think to myself, "gosh, if i put so little effort into it and already get such great returns, then it's not really worth it to put in any more effort." after all, it only makes sense according to the concept of diminishing returns, probably the only thing i ever took away with me as an econ major. but yeah, this is the stuff great dilettantes are made of.  as for optimism, i always think that the future is a realm of endless possibilites, most, if not all, of which work in my favor. for example, wrongfully believing that practicing the piano once a week is sufficient for winning a bach festival when practicing everyday is only necessary and still unable to ensure such an outcome. optimism also spawned my terrible propensity for procrastination. i really really hope...that this time will be different. history tells me that i never learn from past mistakes, but good thing i have my optimism telling me to never say never.  even though i still cheer for china during the olympics and all world championships, and always will because of the blood that runs through my veins/arteries/ventricles/atriums/and aorta, i am glad to be an american citizen and having the right to vote! and despite the fact that the american electoral process is perceivably flawed and NOT really democratic (in which case EVERY vote would count), it is still a "great leap forward" from maoland. so...go dean!

      another long night of revising. currently listening to r. kelly's "the world's greatest:"  i'm that star up in the sky i'm that mountain peak up high  great song, except for this part where he says "if anybody AKS you who i am" instead of "asks." go listen to it if you don't believe me. it used to drive me IN-SAAAAAANE. but i got over it after like, a kabillion replays. it's a great song otherwise. brings back some overshadowed memories.  amazing how music has the power to place us right back to a certain time in our lives. listening to this song makes me feel like i'm 21 again, a senior in college, sitting in the powell library computer lab at 4 in the morning, cramming for my econ final and wearing this huuuuuge set of old-school earphones that probably belong in a museum somewhere. i remember that feeling of being stressed out and overwhelmed by the material that i had neglected all quarter-long. i also remember being giddy and slightly dreamy (or was it sleepiness) about my first real relationship. i can't believe how poignant these feelings are after all this time, just from listening to a song. it's like a diary of all my senses.  i finally pinpointed the reason i'm having so much trouble with my personal statement. it's been three excruciating weeks since i started writing. the first draft took a whole week; scrapped. second draft, percolating ideas, no more. third draft, good language, no cohesion. the problem is that throughout this whole process, there's been this little voice in the back of my head that kept questioning whether law school is really appropriate for me. i mean, with this essay, i'm supposed to communicate exactly what makes me a good candidate for law school, what i believe my aptitude for a legal education is. and through it all, when i quit my job, when i was studying for the lsat, and when i'm writing my essay, i guess i just kept thinking, "i'm not qualified. i stopped everything in my life and i'm still not going to make it." amazing how self-defeating self-doubt can be. if i couldn't even convince myself that i belong in law school, how the heck was i gonna convince the admissions ppl? so with all those drafts, i felt like i had to put on the facade of someone that i'm not.   and tonight, i had a moment of clairvoyance. it happened when i was talking to my friend philip who was editing my essay, and as i was trying to defend my sinking paper to him, my incoheret medley of lyrical prose, i stumbled across and blurted out the thesis of my statement that had been eluding me all this time. it was a short phrase, seven words total. and i didn't have to pretend one bit. i can't believe i've wasted all this time hiding behind nice-sounding language when all i needed to do was be simple and be honest. that's pretty much my life philosophy anyway, i just forgot to put it down on paper. so thanks soooo much to the ppl who helped me with my essay so far. i get embarassed just thinking about the terrible drafts i made you read. hopefully, i'll be able to redeem myself with the next one. and to the rest of the ppl out there, i guess my point in sharing all this is: don't let doubt get in the way, talk to smart and caring friends who can remind you of who you are, be yourself, and have a good song to carry you through all the times of your life. pretty cheesy eh...?  speaking of cheese, "yea, i like it reeeeeeeeeal stinky..." -blackeyed peas

      The League of Husbands  i can say without a doubt that my dad's favorite days of the week are Wednesday and Saturday. on each of these nights, he gets together with four or five of his buddies to play ping pong. afterwards, he'll come home, face aglow with victory, taunt me with his stinky socks, and give a play by play account to my mom of how he beat out all the other guys (so cockiness runs in the family). recently, however, it appears that playing ping pong is not the only thing that these half-a-century old chinese guys enjoy doing together. somehow, their favorite pasttime while waiting for their turn at the table has become the begrudging of wives.   According to my dad, one of the guys, we'll call him Old Poo, complains that he can no longer say more than five words to his wife without getting assaulted by a furious tirade. He attributes the case to the recent rise in popularity of korean dramas with chinese subtitles, which have caused his wife to lose all sense of reality and to demand unreasonable gestures of romance from him.  Another guy, Old Moo, complains that his wife won't tell him how much money she keeps in her separate account. He retaliates by stealing from her coin purse while she is asleep. A third guy, Little Foo (hahah, i couldn't help myself, but he is really short), complains that his wife has completely turned his two daughters against him. In his words, "I have lost control of the fort." So then I asked my dad what his role in all this wife-bashing was, and with my mom sitting across the dinner table, carving knife in hand, he says that he never had a chance to join in the talk because he has never lost a game. but if he did, he would have nothing to say because his wife never lets the dust settle in the house, does not care for expensive things, and knows just what to put in the filling of his favorite dumplings. men...

      i got my score i got my score!!!!! seriously, can we say CARDIAC ARREST when i saw it sitting in my mailbox a WHOLE DAY earlier than i'd expected??!! no emotional nor psychological preparation i tell ya! they should NOT do that to people!! but i am happy and grateful. somebody up there must have erased a couple of my answers and bubbled in the correct ones. good thing too, or else i woulda been real PO'd about that bout of breakout my skin suffered from stress. anyway, so if i don't make it to law school now, at least i can get a job teaching at testmasters or something.  i just remembered something funny. my friend maggie and i went shopping for the perfect outfit for my bday bash the other day. towards the end of our frantic scavenger hunt, we were so overcome by exhaustion and thirst that we looked like we'd trekked across the sahara desert, aka brea mall. and even so, we made a final stop at a store that neither of us had ever been to. only when we came out did we see the store sign, "Pretty Plus," clothing for EXTRA LARGE women, and only then did it make sense that all the sizes in the store were 3XL or 6 XL. upon reflection, i think it's great that there are stores like these catering to the needs of specific parts of the population. i remember this one episode of the simpsons when flanders opened the Leftorium, a store full of gadgets for lefthanded ppl. i appreciate it today even though i am neither lefthanded nor overweight, because someday, i might very easily lose use of my right hand or, heaven forbid, eat myself into plus-sized oblivion.   more B00Bs.

      now that i've gone public with my blogger again, i'd like to use this opportunity to make a formal apology to the handful of ppl who i accidentally called over the past few years by letting my boulder of a cell phone thrash about in my jungle of a purse. but no, i shall not be using the keylock feature because i don't believe in it, just like i don't believe in santa claus, britney's boobs, and EXERCISE!  yes it's true. i've changed my mind once again about the benefits of exercise towards my goal of looking waif-like. this must be the sixth time i've reverted my decision in the course of the nine months that this blog has been in existence. like i told philip the other day, if i had spent my energy on consistently working out all these years rather than changing my mind about it all the time, i could be real skinny by now. and like philip said, it's too bad we're the type of ppl who gain weight just by the smell of food.  speaking of food, on a recent episode of The Newlyweds,  Jessica Simpson got confused about what she was eating because the can of tuna in her hand was labeled "chicken of the sea." they should really put this show on NBC, "the more you know..."  good night.

      A Philip Weekend  'scuse the bad language in this entry, i'm sleepy but i really wanted to chronicle my weekend before i forget.    yesterday i had lunch with my friend philip who is my oldest friend to-date, going all the way back to...junior year of high school...i think. so we were having lunch, and talking about this and that and pretty much hopscotching all over the place cuz neither of our attention spans allows us to focus on any one topic of conversation for more than three minutes. we finally got around to talking about our bday bash which is to be held in two weeks, but ended up reminiscing about our bday's over the years and how we celebrated and what our friends did for their bday's, or rather, i should say TRYING to reminisce cuz neither of us could remember ANYTHING about any of their or our celebrations. it was pathetic, we were having this lunch at polly's pies, surrounded by a roomful of of silver-haired, denture-ridden octogenarians, and it's safe to say that we were pretty much the most senile people there...except philip somehow managed to remember EXACTLY and ONLY what he ATE at each party, and i remember only and exactly what i WORE to each party. where was the party held? who else was there? who the bday party was for? we don't remember.  so today, i accompanied philip to his friend's bday party in leiu of his girlfriend who had a previous engagement. the whole idea was that we get the dinner party over with as fast as possible so we could drive to hollywood to check out the bar where we're thinking of holding our bday bash. well.....first of all, philip's friend told him that the bday dinner would start at 5pm, so when we arrived at 5:15pm, we were chagrined at the idea of being the late arrivals who held everyone up from ordering, but upon entering steven's steakhouse, found ourselves being two of the first outta the 20 guests scheduled to arrive. so we were seated pretty fast, but ended up waiting maybe an hour and 47 minutes (but who's counting...)before the rest of her party got here so we could start ordering. and even though philip and i had a good hour and 47 minutes with the menu, philip was still quite flustered when the waitress came around, completely ditched his ordering gameplan which he'd been adamant about for the past hour, and ended up pointing at me and saying "errr...i'll have what she's having." fifteen minutes later, he flagged the waitress down again to change it back to his original order. so the food didn't arrive until maybe 52 minutes later (but who's counting....), and we were pretty pooped by that time cuz we were inexplicably hyper throughout the first two hours of waiting, irrationally over-expending our pre-meal energy through inane laughter and uber-goofiness. so then the food FINALLY arrived, and it tasted like ka-ka, maybe cuz neither of us ordered steak even though we were at a steakhouse, but we still ploughed through and chowed down because it is in our nature to eat what is set before us. a few minutes after we were done, philip mumbled some excuse to his friend and we ran for the exit. we were the very first ppl to leave while the rest of the table was still finishing their food, but i definitely think we'd paid our dues.  sooooo...after a three hour meal, 90% of which was spent waiting and 10% of which was spent swallowing doodoo, we were super happy to be liberated from the restaurant that we felt like we'd spent a few lifetimes in, and were pretty giddy once again as we set forth on the real mission of the night: to check out our bday site. so we followed philip's ambiguous mapquest directions and somehow ended up getting lost and stopping for directions at a ghetto gas station and ended up making enough u-turns to lose all sense of direction. by the time we finally reached our destination an hour later, a bar/nightclub named the hollywood canteen tucked into a tiny middle-of-nowhere street, all was quiet and not a soul was around. me, being the hopeless optimist, thought that either the club just wasn't very happenin', or that all the guests were carless pedestrians and the joint had great soundproof walls...but alas, when i bounded across the street and reached for the door, it would not budge an inch. yes we are idiots. today is sunday, and after all that trouble, the place was not even open, and it had occurred to neither of us to call and check in advance. well...i think it occurred to me earlier in the day, but i probably got distracted by a hangnail and forgot.  so sad. there weren't even any windows that we could peek through to get a view of the inside. so yeah, we felt pretty tarded and moted up the butt. upon returning to the car, it simultaneously occurred to both of us that this is definitely a moment worth blogging about. after fighting for two minutes over who would be saved the trouble of blogging and given the rights to copying&pasting the other's person's entry, we got distracted by...some other topic of conversation, forgot what we were talking about before, forgot about the evening's abortive mission, and laughed our way back home.

      yes, i finally finished! well, the first draft anyway. now i'm just grabbing as many ppl as possible to critique it for me. everytime i send it to someone, i feel like i have to make disclaimers like how it's only my first draft and i know the conclusion is a little corny and how when i started i didn't really know where i was going with the whole tiananmen square thing and i know i talk profusely about china and not enough about my qualifications as a candidate for law school. man...i am so self-conscious when i have my peers look over my stuff. thank goodness i never did this back in school, it would have driven me mad!!!

      i just came back from a japanese rock concert at the house of blues. let me tell you, i am now a changed woman. haha. it was soooooooo unexpectedly good!! it was a group called b'z, and according to my friend, they're supposed to be the number one japanese rock band of all time. before tonight, i had absolutely ZERO interest in anything japanese. actually, i probably had NEGATIVE interest if anything. but i decided to go today even though i've never heard of this group and i'm usually pretty averse to japanese music except for SMAP. cuz otherwise i'd be sitting at home blogging about what i ate for dinner or something. and I'M SO GLAD I DID! they were great! the crowd was great!! the rock was GREAT! and the lead singer is HOT!! even tho he's almost 40. haha. i now understand why ppl become groupies. no, seriously, why am i a changed woman? cuz i realized i need to stop being so judgmental and averse to trying things outside my little bubble. i will probably discover many more beautiful things in the world than i already have.   another reason i'm a changed woman: i am now an all-around FOB, covering the entire gamut of chinese, japanese and korean music. faye wong's long-awaited new album is gonna be released in a few weeks, yeeeeeah!  a weak note of redemption: blackeyed peas, maroon 5, and christina aguilera still rule my english world!!

      okay personal statement by tomorrow night. for reals this time.  somebody got to my blog by googling the keywords "how to get rid of an overbite." did i ever talk about that?? but anyway, dear overbite reader, if you are here again...the answer to all your problems is BRACES.  my friend philip and i are cojoining our 23rd bday bashes at a club soon, i'm so excited about getting buzzed again!! haha. more details to come later from not the world's most organized organizers.

      personal statement...right. i will finish it by tomorrow night if it kills me.  i'm returning half of the stuff i bought from urban the other day. i tried it on when i got home and i swear, they must have magic mirrors at that place or something.  anderson cooper never wrote back to me. there's the end of that affair.  on the newlyweds, jessica simpson declared that she won't eat buffalo wings cuz she doesn't eat buffalo.  humdeedum...  whatever happened to where in the world is carmen san diego?? i liked acapella.  this is a dead boring entry. i have nothing more to say. poor reader, are you still breathing?

      does anyone remember anderson cooper, the guy on channel one who delivered all those gripping stories of famine and strife from somalia and rwanda and bosnia and iran to our jr high and high school homerooms? well, now he is a distinguished-looking, pepper-haired, well-renowned 36 year old anchor hosting cnn's 360 with an emmy award under his belt and a distinctively engaging sense of wry humor. i wrote an email just to let him know how great i used to think he was on channel one and how great i think he's doing now. this is the first time i've ever written someone i really admire on tv. how exciting.  i am really exhausted these days.  i feel like i awake from the sleep of the dead every morning and my body feels like lead as i drag it out of bed. this must be the physiological way of making up for all the sleep i lost over the past two months. but what about the emotional damage???? haha, okay just kidding, it wasn't that bad. i would do it again for, say...$250...  which is how much i spent today! yes, i said omigawd too when i looked at the receipt with my signature on it. in my defense, i really did COMPLETELY abstain from shopping since mid-july. and four of the six items i purchased were on sale, which is MORE than fifty percent of my total purchase! furthermore, none of this was premeditated. i went into express to make a return, and the next thing i knew, i found myself ogling everything in urban outfitters. as for disciplinary measures, i think the guilt that is now eating me alive is punishment enough. what can i say? 'splurge' happens.   apparently, it's also my muse. i figured out exactly what i'm going to write for my personal statement. just a little bit of research and i should be well on my way and done by the end of this week. hurray!   this is a miracle considering how i read every single essay in princeton review's "law school essays that made a difference." can i just say, BIG MISTAKE?? seriously, ppl could get writer's block for life from reading that thing. there are way too many overaccomplished ppl in this world. i will get down on my knees and kiss the ground if i make it to ANY law school. or as i promised a friend, i will donate my entire wardrobe to unicef, sin recent purchases.  don't ever hold me to anything i say. arnold is growing on me already.

      i L-O-V-E costco!!! it's been ages and ages since i've been there, how did i keep myself away for so long?? today, i got harry potter for half the list price, bought a fleece zip jacket for my dad, grabbed a bag of spicy buffalo wings which i ate for both lunch and dinner, purchased the revo-brush for my hair which i saw on a late night infomercial, and found a guitar that i'm going to buy next week. costco is definitely a consumer's wonderland.  i weighed myself this morning and saw that i'd lost eight pounds in the past three weeks. now i'm only four pounds away from where i was this time last year. i guess stress alone works better than diet and exercise combined...although i think i'd rather starve myself than have to go through the lsat again.  oh yeah. i also succumbed to the electric toothbrush that my parents have been egging me to buy for the longest time. i used it once today and i think one word describes the experience: INVASIVE. i've been using the regular toothbrush for all my life, and everytime i go to the dentist, he always tells me how well i take care of my teeth. i think this whole electric toothbrush thing is such an urban myth, just another excessive, not to mention expensive, accouterment to the rise in living standards in the electronic age. are we so damn lazy that we gotta have our toothbrushes brush our teeth for us?? true, it has a lot more revolutions, but the real question is, do we really NEED that many revolutions? is more...always better? (i'm trying to do that carrie bradshaw thing from sex and the city, only difference is her entries talk about sex and mine talks about gyrating plaque removers.) either way, i'm stuck with it for good now, and i no longer look forward to brushing my teeth.  oh, and as for the revo-hairbrush, yes, that many revolutions IS necessary!!

      my dreams last night were filled with logic games. i think some of the games i did on the test came back to me and i actually dreamt the mistakes that i could have made on the first three games that i didn't check. in my sleep, i realized that i should have done "master the possibilities" on the second game and i was trying desperately to remember whether i forgot to use one of the "not rules." it would have saved a lot of time and maybe i would have had 15 minutes left to do the last game instead of 8.  by the time i was able to fall asleep last night, i'd convinced myself that my score could range anywhere from 168-175. as i was groggily waking up this morning, after all those dreams, i had this frightening idea that it could very easily be a lot lower than that. oh man....i need a distraction.

      i think i'm growing a brain tumor. my head is pounding like crazy.  earlier in the day, it was my heart that was pounding. thump thump thump. i've never gotten nervous for a test like that in my life. i think i bit a bleeding hole in my lower lip and didn't even realize it until i left the test center.  it's over. my life can resume. but why does it take three whole weeks to run a scantron through a machine?? it's going to be hard holding onto my sanity until then...  i came home and didn't know what to do with myself now that i don't have to study anymore, and my body was still wired with nervousness and tension, so i went online and started my apps. i am quite the narcissist no? i need to stay occupied so i won't think about the test and how i MISREAD a game and had to redo the whole thing within FIVE F&#@ING MINUTES!! i am allowing myself to cyber swear on this special occassion. sh*t sh*t sh*t sh*t sh*t. my ears were ringing with the sound of my thumping heart and this sh*t word. that was the very first section, and everything after that was literally a blur. at various times during the test, i had this incredible urge to roll the test up into a ball and stuff it in my mouth and just eat it. seriously, what could they do to me? man. the only times i got over 170 on my diags was when i missed nothing in the games section, and now, there's no guarantee what i'll get. if you are my friend and you're reading this, this is the ONLY damn thing i'll be talking about for the next three weeks. F*&%ing "neither" and "either!!!!" why the H#LL can't they just say "j CANNOT be next to k and h???" i can't believe i didn't have time to check my work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am the most careless person in the WHOLE WORLD!!!!! MY LIFE DEPENDS ON DOUBLE-CHECKING MY WORK!!!!!!!!!  okay. get a grip lady. GET A F*@#ING GRIP!!!!  this is pathetic. i only know three cuss words total to express my angst.  oh yeah, i also ran into a buncha ppl i met in my first year at ucla. either i'm REALLY bad at keeping in touch, or these ppl just weren't my type. i dunno, probably a combination of both. but gosh, i wasted freshman year eating a lotta meals with a lotta ppl that i never talk to anymore. i guess it's part of the college experience. hm. come to think of it, all the ppl i lost touch with were church ppl. but i also have to admit that i really am terrible at keeping in touch. and in contrast to freshman year, i have zero incentive to meet or talk to anybody. might be the stress, but my estrogen level is definitely at an all time low.  anyhoo, i felt very competitive today, regardless of who i saw. i do not like the fact that so many ppl were taking the test. even at such a tiny test center as mine, there were probably 200+ test takers. i could not believe my eyes.   for some reason, tv, IM, and shopping do not hold the same appeal as when they were on the hands-off list....

      i am scared as hell.  the other night, i dreamt that it was test day and somehow i didn't hear when the proctor said it was time to start the test, and i only realized five minutes later after everyone was already bubbling away, so i tried to cheat off this fat girl next me, except she was so fat that i couldn't see her answer sheet. i think i had this dream after i read that story about the fat date.  i'm gonna watch tv all night and just r-e-l-a-x now. how hard can that be...?

      hello blog. i think i'm done studying. well, just a little more reviewing, but the painful part is over. as i put away some of my books, i realized that instead of rejoincing over not having to ever look at this stuff ever again, what i should be looking forward to is reading this stuff for the rest of my life. hm. dunno how i feel bout that.  hurray, i got a good straight six hours of sleep last night without sleeping pills again. i read the funniest story before falling asleep last night. eureka! i have found the key to sleeping with a smile on my face the whole night through. here's a synopsis of the funny story: a fat guy uses a dating service for fat people and goes on a date with a fat lady who is quite pleasant and they have quite pleasant conversation and talk about how non-fat people discriminate against fat people until the fat guy realizes the fat lady is talking as if he is the only fat one between the two of them so he gets mad and spitefully exclaims that she is a whole lot fatter than he is and she gets all offended at being called fat even though she is and retorts that she certainly is not and gets up to leave and he says oh no you don't i'm leaving you first except when he tries to get up he finds himself stuck in his chair and the owner of the restaurant comes over to help him and makes some remark about how this might be good for business since ppl who walk past the restaurant will see that people this fat are still willing to eat his food so his food must be great and the fat lady who has not left yet because she now feels sorry for the fat guy defends both of their fatness and they leave the restaurant with the chair still stuck to the fat guy's butt and wait on the curb for a taxi and they make up and the fat guy pats his lap for the fat lady to sit on and she sits and the legs of the chair break off. the end.   this is from a book of short stories by the author who wrote the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, another book that i'd have, if i win the lotto in which case i'd buy borders!! and i choose borders over b&n only cuz i don't wanna deal with that whole amazon franchise. and cuz i'm still a little miffed by that headless emily dickinson mural at the westside pavilion b&n. darn chauvinists!  did i mention i watched lost in translation? it had a lolita-esque quality. i like bill murray's understated humor. there were many moments during the movie that i wanted to get offended at how they portrayed asians, like the off-the-wall talk show host and karoake/ddr craze and the shortness of japanese ppl with accomodations to match. but i couldn't, cuz they're so true! haha.  two of my favorite actors have movies coming out! cate blanchett as veronica guerin and sean penn in mystic river! yaaaaay! i loved cate blanchett in elizabeth! i loved sean penn in i am sam! both of them are great actors who do not make movies often enough! maybe that's their secret, not compromising quality with quantity. maybe i'll watch radio too. i loooooove football movies. come to think of it, remember the titans is probably one of my top three favorite movies of all time. it actually made me want to take up watching football. imagine that.  another thing that puts this whole test experience in perspective: getting into law school is very important to me as an individual, but i have a greater role to fulfill on october 7th at the polls! go mcclintock!  i think i've been bitten by the wesley clark bug...poor dean. he got fueled too early too fast.  i changed my mind about estella too. i think bob the bachelor should go for brooke, the blonde girl with bangs.

      i need a break. some signs that i'm getting nervous: a) i'm drinking like a camel, b) i have no appetite (which might actually be a consequence of all that water intake), and c) i've become an obsessive clean freak, like monica on friends.  i actually got eight straight hours of sleep last night, without sleeping pills! and i had a pretty good dream too, something about my high school crush quitting his job to become a bus fare collector, like the ones in china where they have to ride on the bus back and forth all day cuz the buses don't have those coin deposit boxes. i think i was actually laughing in my sleep. ergo, i am extremely happy today.  another reason i'm happy is that so many ppl have expressed their well-wishes to me for my test. i'm surprised that so many ppl remembered when my test is, considering how i have not seen or talked to many of them for a long time. there are so many nice and caring ppl in this world. i feel so....loved. haha, okay, time to leave mr. roger's neighborhood.

      hey guys, i need some input about xbox and ps2. which one do you prefer and why (ie, size, controllers, attachments, dvd, games, price, etc)?  i've fallen prey to flu season. it started with an innocuous headache, but by the end of turkey day, it felt like a golfball had been stuffed halfway down my throat.   my mom left for china yesterday. it was so sweet. the first thing my dad said when he got back from dropping her off at the airport was, "i feel so sad. the house is not the same." i'm sad too. my mom's absence means only one thing...cleaning up the dog poop! auggggh, why can't dogs just bury their own poop?? they bury everything else! anyway, looking forward to three weeks of hangtime with the pops a la lakers games, chicken in a can, and disposable utensils. :)  being bedridden for the past couple of days caused me to miss a friend's housewarming party, going to the airport with my mom, and the last chance to take advantage of my friend's 50% employee discount at arden b. here's what i was able to do instead:   1. finish watching the first season of 24. resulting stress and trauma did nothing to alleviate flu symptoms. can't wait to start the west wing.  2.watch Together with the 'rents before my mom left. mom cried, dad laughed, i just kept thinking how great it is that i can understand chinese.  3. finish Barman by alex wellen. a must-read for lawyer wannabe's and imminent bar victims. started reading "girlfriends talk about men." so it's not hemmingway or anything, but it sure as heck clarified a lotta things. some excerpts:  "During the course of our interviews, we saw women falling into two general categories: women who felt a strong need for attachment and those who wanted more freedom. The more we listened, the more we realized that, generally speaking, the women who were more likely to want closeness were those who felt, to a smaller or larger degree, that they did not get the attention they needed from their fathers....While our observations were not scientific, we have noticed that many of the women we interviewed who had never married were those who described one or both of their parents are 'intrusive' or 'controlling.'" (try smothered...but in a good way.)  "Most women admit that they've dated 'bad boys' and 'good guys,' and both have their appeal and their own set of problems. Some women we talked to help us identify the types and the sets problems you might expect from either type. Ursula said that bad boys are different from grown-up men, that they are 'more attentive but prefer form over substance.' The bad boys were attentive to being romantic and doing sweet things, so there was never any complaint about the 'trimmings.' Whether they were good people or whether I trusted them was the question. A bad boy is the one you want to pick up at the bar. High on charism, low on commitment." (oh so true...but oh so irresistible...)   "Yes, it's true. Women are perverse. We like trouble...someone who doesn't need us is a lot less scary than someone who needs us too much." (amen.)  "Some couples fall apart when the Switch occurs. The Switch is a phase described by Dr. Sills. she writes, "The most common victim of The Switch is the woman. She was being actively pursued when, suddenly, he turns off just when she turns on...Today, however, sex roles in courtship are much more flexible. It is therefore increasingly likely that she may pursue him until she captures his interest and then --- whammo --- she pulls a Switch and he is the victim." (hahaha..."whammo!" well, at least now i have a name for it...)  "Perhaps we all dream of catchng the eye of a gorgeous man across the room and, as violins play in the background, watching him move toward us as our heart says 'this is the one.' (um no...what decade are we in??) In talking to women, we found that some of the most successful marriages began, not with love at first sight, but with a resounding "yuck!"....As the previous stories show, we frequently have a negative reaction to men who end up making a good match for us. The important factor is that we had a reaction, and someone caught our attention." (okay, personally, i'm not a believer of this whole fungus theory either, but it's been known to happen i guess...)  okay, i'm going back to bed. my head is out to explode, probably because of this junk that i've been filling it with. just thought i'd spread it around. please answer my question about the game consoles. thanks y'all.

      this thanksgiving, i am most thankful for forgiveness. i believe that when you really do love someone, you are able to truly forgive and forget. that is the meaning of unconditional love, that no matter what has been said and done, you are able to overcome your hurt and anger and continue to love as before. to forgive is not just to say that you forgive. the real evidence is that you are able to overlook the transgression and permanently move past it. if you are unable to do so, it doesn't mean that you don't love the person, but it probably means you don't love him or her more than yourself. this is what my mom has taught me today. i am so thankful for her unconditional and selfless love.  happy thanksgiving everyone.

      perhaps you've noticed a vacillation between the frivolous and the contemplative in my recent entries. ever since i began this online journal, i've been extrememly wary of sharing too much about myself. my goal has always been to make everything as lighthearted and impersonal as possible. unbeknownst to you, i've written many private entries for myself that i was afraid to publish for the public eye. recently, i realized that i should be less concerned with who is reading this and what they think of me, and more concerned with what i hope to achieve through my writing. this is my website, and even if it falls outside the conventional comfort zone, i am choosing to candidly share with you some of my joy, memories, mistakes, and insecurities. this does not mean that i'll be bearing my soul and unleashing my mind, but i want to commit to being completely true to myself in my more serious entries. i think the best way for us to learn is through firsthand experience, and the second best way is through each other. i'm not sure just yet how much or often i'm willing to share, because the thought of it still makes a very private me extremely nervous, but i hope attempting to do so will make whoever's reading realize that, despite differences in age, race, gender, class, or whatever else makes us different, we are linked to one another by more things in common than you may think.    Today:   Regret is something that none of us are willing to admit, because doing so would be futile and regressive. thankfully for the defense mechanisms encoded into our system, we manage to forget and move on, or at least convince ourselves that we have.  because i can't cry for myself, my mom cried for me instead. there have only been two things in my life that's made me cry big droplets of hurt like that. i do everything possible to make sure that i won't be vulnerable to those feelings again. i've become such a master at aloofness that i deceive even myself. i'm great at getting misty-eyed over sad movies and moving books, but when it comes to the big personal stuff, things that really matter...nothing, no feeling at all. unfortunately, the people who love me aren't as well-protected. i'm so sorry.  if you don't care enough about yourself, at least think of those who do...all actions have consequences. please remember this. please be responsible for yourself, for your mind and your body.

      hi guys. something has been occupying my thoughts a lot lately, and i go through interspersed periods of levity and reverie, guilt and self-atonement. like a true introvert, i am persistently seeking the rhyme and reason, and a scarlet Y has branded itself onto my mind like the symbol of sin worn by Hester Prynne.  it isn't really about how or where we begin, or what our starting point is. telling myself this has been a great source of comfort. i am still in a state of metamorphosis, and one day, i hope to accept into my heart of hearts that it isn't all about the endpoint either, but everything that goes in-between.  remember my allusion to the garden of eden? the result was expulsion and suffering, but what resulted was also Knowledge, specifically, knowledge of what it means to be human. i now know that it is possible for the state of sinfulness to lead to personal growth, sympathy, and an understanding of others.  from The Life of David Gale:  Fantasies have to be unrealistic. Because the moment, the second that you get what you seek, you don't, you can't want it anymore.  In order to continue to exist, desire must have its objects perpetually absent. It's not the "it" that you want, it's the fantasy of "it". So, desire supports crazy fantasies.  This is what Pascal means when he says that we are only truly happy when daydreaming about future happiness. Or why we say the hunt is sweeter than the kill, or be careful what you wish for - not because you will get it, because you are doomed not to want it once you do.  So the lesson of Lacan is living by your wants will never make you happy. What it means to be fully human is to strive to live by ideas and ideals and not to measure your life by what you've attained in terms of your desires, but those small moments of integrity, compassion, rationality, even self sacrifice. Because in the end, the only way that we can measure the significance of our own lives is by valuing the lives of others.

      throughout my life, people have asked me whether i get lonely being an only child, and i always told them that i've never really experienced loneliness. i was being completely honest because i was content with and fulfilled by my own little biosphere of intimate friends and loving parents. in innocence and ignorance, i was easily-amused, easily-satisfied. then one day, i carelessly tossed it all away and became someone that i don't know and can't quite reconcile with yet. and now, even though i'm experiencing more things and surrounding myself with more ppl than ever before, i feel really lonely for the first time in my life.   a line from the bell jar:   I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of the tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.  i feel like a huge gaping void has been born into my life, and because i don't know what else to do, i continue to do the exact thing that created it in the first place. it's like the biblical analogy of the garden of eden. once you take from the tree of knowledge and bite into the forbidden fruit, what you lose can never be retrieved. you are aware of your nakedness for the first time, and your first instinct is to find cover and cower in shame. i guess this is what happens when ppl go from one extreme to the other. the question is: how far can the penduluum swing before the ball goes careening off into space?   i am trying really hard to find the lessons that i'm supposed to be gleaning from all this. all that i've come up with so far is that people are not that different from one another after all. no matter what you look like, how you dress, how old you are, where you're from, what you do, what you've experienced, beneath it all, deep down, we are subject to the same blueprint as human beings. ultimately, we are insecure creatures, subject to moments of vulnerability and weakness, and we all want to be loved and accepted. it is the hackneyed fallibility of the human condition, but for the first time in my life, i'm coming to realize the truth of it and really, really starting to believe in it.   everyone has needs, whether they be physical or emotional. i am not beyond that. i can no longer categorize ppl into the "good" and the "bad," because if i were to do so, i wouldn't be sure where to place myself. despite my aggrievement, i can find no contempt in my heart, not for anyone else and not for myself. i think there is always a legitimate reason for why someone is the way they are and why they do what they do. i call this my jean-valjean theory, and adhering to it is a simple means to my own salvation. deep down inside of everyone, i know that there is a good heart, even if they themselves do not believe so. no matter how chipped or broken, i truly believe that there is always a way to mend it.   i wish i could form a coalition of healing and recovery from the shock of self-discovery. i want to tell ppl who are just as lost as me, and i truly believe that almost everyone is or will be at some point in their lives, that i understand, because in the past few days, these are the simple words of compassion that i've been craving. i just want someone to embrace me emotionally and to say to me that they understand what i am feeling, even if i'm not so sure about it myself.  i feel like life is a game of pinball. as a player, you should be able to guide the course of the ball while working with some immutable power like physics and gravity so that what appears to be chance collisions is actually the result of skillful manuevering. somewhere along the line, an anomaly occurred in the game and the ball with my name on it hit a wrong button that sent it bouncing offcourse. i can only wait and watch with numbness as the ball meanders through all the wrong channels before i am able to flip it back up. this is the best way i know how to describe what it feels like to momentarily lose control.  somebody once told me that i need to stop dreaming and start living. i've definitely started doing a lot more of the latter, but i am extremely saddened by the concurrent loss of the former. my second question of the day is: is it not possible for dreaming and living to exist in conjunction with one another?

      yippee!!! 11 down, 3 more to go. apps are fugging expensive!!!! i bet i'll never get around to completing the last three. all of them either have additional questions or additional essays. eventually, i'm gonna convince myself that i never really wanted to go those schools anyway, so no point in doing those apps. all because of the extra work. i am a lazy bum.  next week: buy guitar, sign up for health club, look for job, MOVE OUT!!!!  btw, another round of thanks to the many who helped me with my personal statement. i love it i love it. i absolutely love the finished product (twelve drafts!!), not only because i think it's really representative of me, but it also embodies the efforts of the people who care enough about me to take time out of their lives to help. i am truly touched and honored to have such smart and caring friends. this doesn't happen often, but i feel all warm and fuzzy inside. eeeeee....

      it's almost 5am.  i can't sleep. crazy things running through my head. help.  watched the life of david gale, starring mr. kevin spacey and produced by NICK CAGE. great great movie that did not receive as much attention or acclaim as it deserved. i don't believe in capital punishment. i don't think i believe in abortion either. i guess that makes me pro-life.  i'm going to be reading three books concurrently. still plodding through barman, got started on heaven of mercury, and going to start the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. i could say something about what each of them is about, but i don't feel like it.  the party has already drained out of me. no more clubbing, no more booze. i blame it on the fact that there is no void in my life that i need to fill. i'm ready to return to life as i knew it. i liked it. it was me. except now i'm marred.  i'm going to lie in bed and read the bell jar for the umpteenth time.   "The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket."  auld lang syne.  green fig tree.  "This kind of detail impressed me. It suggested a whole life of marvelous, elaborate decadence that attracted me like a magnet."  "after doreen left, i wondered why i couldn't go the whole way doing what i should anymore. this made me sad and tired. then i wondered why i couldn't go the whole way doing what i shouldn't, the way doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired."  last thought of the night: when in doubt, resort to vagueness. it works for astrology, it will work for you.

      it's funny how girls use their hair as an emotional outlet. while i can't speak for all girls, it is definitely true of me. everytime something big happens in my life, i tend to do something equally drastic to my hair. last year, when i returned from shanghai and was confronted by the formidable prospect of finding a job, i suddenly woke up one morning and decided to chop off my beloved tresses. half a year later, as soon as my first relationship ended, i violated one of my biggest credos of life and did the unthinkable. what am i talking about? BANGS! talk about sprinkling salt on an open wound. so today, after a weekend of...let's just say deviant/miscreant behavior, i woke up and thought, hm, i'm sick of black hair, and sure enough, after a brief visit with my flamin' hairstylist (remember jay-cee? "and what can i do for you today, love?"), i am now sporting a reddish-purplish-brownish crown. coincidence? i think not.

      another sleepless night. no matter what, the darkness and silence will always remain a source of great comfort.  i am still reeling 36 hours post-consumption. yesterday, my best friend told me that even my voice has changed.  one word that keeps crossing my mind in the past two days is "self-immolation." not that i've literally set myself on fire, but it's the closest description to how i feel.  sometimes, the one person we most need protection from is no one other than our very selves.

      i noticed the first pieces of white hair on my dad today. they're starting to sneak their way into his eyebrows as well. it made me really sad and want to give him a great big bear hug. he'd prepared tomorrow's breakfast lunch and dinner for me even though i couldn't eat dinner with him for the fourth night in a row. he even saved for me the last piece of cheesecake, his favorite food in the whole wide world. my sweet sweet papa bear.

      speaking of dui...i got to thinking that should something unfortunate befall me, i have very specific wishes as to how i want my remains to be taken care of. so before i do anything else, i'm documenting in a hurry these instructions for all the blogworld to see so that they can be carried out exactly as i want them to be post mortem. please make sure to inform my parents or whoever will be handling the whole thing that i want it to be EXACTLY as follows:  1. i want to be cremated, not buried!!  2. i'd like to have the following things cremated with me: a) The Alchemist (the book, not the person), because it represents everything that i believe life should be. b) the b&w picture of my parents kissing me at the same time when i was little (it's in the green picture frame in my bedroom) c) the sheet music for chopin's walt no. 3 op.34 (i have to double check if this is the one), because it makes me feel so many things, and rachmaninoff's rhapsody on a theme of paganini, cuz it's the theme song for Somewhere in Time d) one particle of possession, whatever they want, from each of the following people, because they have each given me so much, because they each have something that i greatly admire, and because i want their good karma to be with me always: i. suki chan ii. ben chu iii. deborah han iv. sabrina hong v. ju yon kim vi. jane park (h.s.) vii. doris yang viii. philip yen ix. jason wang x. sandy zhen {if you are not on this list, don't be offended. consider yourself lucky for not having to partake in something so morbid and creepy.}  waiting list: i. joe tan  e) the hideous pillow doll that my mom made for me from scratch when i first came to america, cuz it's my keeper of childhood secrets. f) a fresh, pink gerber daisy, just cuz. g) a pencil and a stack of looseleaf white paper, because i like to write, i used to like to draw, because i'm a forgetful person and need to write things down, and because i could never write well under the pressure of permanence left by ink, i don't like writing between the lines, and i don't like the shredded margins left by tearing out of a bound notebook.  3. i'd like for my ashes to be placed in a blue tinted glass vase. do not place me in anything that resembles a box or put a lid on it or i will haunt you for a hundred years to come!! most importantly, the container absolutely MUST NOT be opaque and must be open-aired!!  4. i'd like for the vase to be sent back to beijing and always kept next to my grandparents (mom's parents), whether they are living or deceased.  that is all. i feel very happy and at peace that this has been done. :)

      dadsitting is exhausting. don't apply for this job unless you're close to going on welfare folks. something i learned while my mom has been gone is that men can't find anything if their life depended on it!! something i learned about my dogs is that my pint-sized beagle, Fred, bullies my bear-like lab retriever, Teddy, like the pitbull that he really is at heart. (this only confirms my theory that short ppl have aggressive personalities to compensate for their size. if you are short, don't be offended. i am only telling it like i see it.) I also learned that every night after we go into the backyard to feed and play with our dogs, Teddy sits and turns his back to us while we get ready to go back in the house. and when i call his name, i can see that his eyes have become red and misty. am i hallucinating or are dogs capable of crying??  i am currently re-reading The Alchemist. mark my words, this is the most beautiful, most illuminating, most relatable book of all time. it is the one that i want to have cremated with me when i die. a background: this story is about a shepherd boy who travels from his homeland in spain to the egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the pyramids. he does not know what this treasure is, but is convinced that it is part of his Personal Legend. along the way he meets all these different characters who are also on their own quest. "what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a meditation of the treasures found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our heart."  some excerpts: "What's the world's greatest lie?" the boy asked, completely surprised. "It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie." (an old man the boy meets along the way)  But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.  When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he never dreamed of when he first made the decision.  The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it's all written there.  ...people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.  It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.  The problem is that they don't realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.  To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation.       Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.      At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. when he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke--the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.

      as i pulled into my driveway a few minutes ago, the glare of my headlights caused a black cat to dart from its place of shelter in front of my garage door into the cold and rainy night. seeing this made me feel terribly sad and sorry. being an anti-cat person, i can only conclude that my inebriated state makes me a lot more sensitive and sentimental than usual.  all iwant for christmas, is yoooooooooouuuuu oooo ooooo baaaabeeeee!  tonight, i learned that i cannot handle any drink "on the rocks." no siree bob. i still felt cool ordering it though, even though i did have to return to the bartender and request for an additional shot of diet coke. i forgot to verbalize many things after that, one of them being that the bartender had some freaky dickey eyes if i ever saw any.  thanks to the cool ppl at symantec, esp my beeyooootiful date and ex-roommie, for a great time tonight. boy, do those engineers know how to partaaay!! lookin forward to next year already miss DOH! :) :)   p.s. oh yeah. i also learned that white ppl shed a lot more hair than asians do. mostly from the legs. i know this because a white person told me so. ergo, it must be true. i am documenting this info in case it comes in handy later on. ya never know.

      happy birthday to my dad! we celebrated by having dinner at todai. with my mom gone, my dad and i are free to eat as fast, as much, and as undaintily as humanly possible. dinner at home for the two of us usually takes no more than 8 minutes. at the seafood buffet, we clocked in around 20, inclusive of scavenging and gathering time. you'd think we've been starving for weeks, but that's just how we eat when we feel completely uninhibited and no one's around to regulate us. it's not a pretty sight. my dad says he eats that way cuz he grew up during the cultural revolution in china when food was scarce and you had to eat it before somebody else stole it off your plate. what's my excuse...?  i tried to do some xmas shopping this week. there's this rule that says for every three presents you buy for other ppl, you're entitled to get one for yourself. i accidentally abided by this rule in reverse.   a delayed rebuttal to one of boxworthy's entries: "Money is spent to be made."   i've been watching the first season of the west wing. IT IS THE BESTESTESTEST SHOW. i like it even better than 24. the banter the banter i love the banter. martin sheen is so lovable with his santa claus belly.   the new alicia keys album does not fall short of expectations.   vegas in two weeks!!!  i'm a pauper of words tonight. gonna go curl up with a good book to get a refill.  peace y'all.

      under normal circumstances, i'd say that i'm a pretty staunch proponent of affirmative action. aside from adding diversity to our education, it's a necessary measure to breed competent individuals who will serve in the interests of minority groups and communities. after spending an unhealthy number of hours looking at  urlLink this , however, and obsessively calculating my chances as an asian female who majored in econ, i say FUG AA!!! from now on, i am going to spend every waking moment praying that Cornell will admit me instead of some philanthropist who has real intentions of representing the disadvantaged. and if you love me, you'll pray that i go to booneyland as well.

      friday night: back to the hollywood canteen for c's bday (feliz cumpleanos). as much as i adore that place, this would be my ABSOLUTE last time there.  sat night: finally sent in my ucla app under the unmitigated coercion of my mom, who practically clicked the submit buttom for me in her determination to keep me close to home.  sun night: ate dinner downtown and rushed tix to watch La Boheme. this one definitely topped my first opera experience when r and i hightailed outta there during intermission to escape PURE AGONY. la boheme was not so bad, although i was dumbfounded when ppl started sniffling ostentatiously cuz they were sooooo touched by the ending that's been done, re-done, and over-done in just about every other love story. i guess opera just doesn't move me, not like the way some musicals do when i can feel the chills running down my spine and goosebumps spreading over my arms, and i loathe to blink for fear that i'll lose a single moment of the splendid experience. what really trips me up about opera is that there's these beautiful aurias sung in italian, and then you read the subtitle and find out they're just saying something like "slice me up some more ham, woman!" call me a boor, but i really don't care to be all THAT cultured anyway.

      for the past few months, my one prayer has been to get accepted to law school, ANY law school. today, that prayer was answered. around 5pm, i received a call from the director of admissions from my "backup school," congratulating me on my acceptance into their fine institution of legal learning. grasping the receiver in my hand, i was inundated by a sense of joy and relief. studying law was no longer a pipe dream, and by this time next year, i will be doing exactly what i want to be doing...now how many ppl can say that about themselves?? "go laaauuura, it's your biiiiiirthdaaaay!"  alas, i have never been and never will be the type to remain content. as the excitement wore off fifteen minutes after the call, it dawned on me that i had been over-modest in my celestial request. "more...MORE!" whispered the greedy monster from within. the more i thought about it, the more discontent i became with the idea of attending my backup for the next three years, knowing that it was my ABSOLUTE last choice. (okay, this is actually a false statement. i actually have four absolute last choices, all of which are located in california. come to think of it...i have two absolute first choices, both of which are very far from california, three regular first choices, still cross-continental, and two regular last choices, somewhere in the middle. to the untrained eye, this would appear to be the ranking system of a person who is more concerned with location than the actual school.) so as i was saying, "backup" quickly turned into "blech!" and i berated myself for having started my string of requests from the bottom up instead of from the top down. man, do i feel gypped.

      you're not hallucinating. there used to be another entry here, but i deleted it. i have a weird habit of doing that, you may have noticed. i think there's already an octoberprl.blogspot/xanga support group out there that you can join to help cope with your confusion.  "i can feel it in my fingers, i can feel it in my toooooooes..." (10 pts if you know which movie that's from. cuz somebody's keeping real score.) this is gonna be my year, the year of the ALMIGHTY MONKEY. that's right, it's gonna be ooh ooh aah aah all the way baby!! tentative goals (b/c i don't believe in resolutions) for this exciting new chapter of my life include the following: steer clear of carbonation, alcohol, and potential sex offenders; decide on using only ONE of xanga/blogspot/myspace (although some just call it being versatile); concentrate on growing out new bangs; become a vegetarian (does not apply to aquatic creatures, ie, salmon, lobster, unagi, and duck); break out groovy dance moves as seen on soul train; unload the serious junk in the trunk amassed during 2003; harass the poopies out of ppl with "real" stuff to do; manage personal finance, ie, start balancing checkbook, learn to invest, stop accumulating monstruous cell phone bills, errr...and other stuff like that; and last but not least, take some time off from livin' La Vida Loca to smell the LA smog. did i leave anything out?

      hi guys.  i went to watch a show of chinese acrobats tonight. it's not the type of thing i'd prefer to attend. anything that involves any type of elevation or suspension doesn't sit well with me, as evidenced by the profuse sweating in the palms of my hands and feet when i watch figure skating and gymnastics. well, sure enough, five minutes into tonight's trapeze act, my dinner was working its way back up my esophagus.    watching stuff like this also has the effect of making me want to cry. it's got nothing to do with fear. debs calls it "the sea world effect." basically, when i was 19 or something, my parents took me to sea world for the first time. in the middle of watching the sea lion and otter show, it suddenly dawned on me how sad it was to kidnap these creatures from their natural habitat, manipulate and program them to do things for which they have no scope of comprehension, and put them on a stage to draw a few laughs. instead of dancing on their fins in front of hundreds of people, these creatures should be frolicking in the ocean with their family, or doing whatever it is that sea lions and otters do. as i was sitting there, i just couldn't stop thinking these thoughts, and the harder that ppl around me laughed, the harder i cried. i guess it's kinda funny and weird in retrospect. i really have no idea why i suddenly became the mother teresa of animals. i never saw free willy, i am the ABSOLUTE worst pet-owner in the world, i think animals are filthy and smelly, and i don't even like dogs that aren't my own. but i guess at the time, the sadness of it all just overwhelmed me.  i kinda had a similar experience in the first half of the show tonight. watching a guy get catapulted from a see-saw, do multiple backflips in midair, and land at the top of a five-man totem (with no net!) made me think of all the times he must have failed and fallen and hurt himself, practicing day in and day out from dusk till dawn ever since he was five so that he could perform this act in front of us and put his majorly deprived life in danger. it just didn't seem right to me. i know, i think too much. i can't help it. i'm female, i have a positive blood type, and aunt flow's in town. don't mess with me.  so anyway, the lump in my throat was getting bigger and bigger as the show progressed. during the second half, i guess i experienced what's called an epiphany. in one of the performances, there's these two purple strips of cloth dangling from the top of the stage and a  yin yang   symbol for the backdrop. a man and a woman grab ahold of the billowing cloth and swing around together, but they'd dangle and climb over each other while swinging.  even though i just made them sound like agitated monkeys, the actual choreography was breathtakingly beautiful. the point is, of all the times i'd heard of  yin yang  to mean the harmony and balance between opposing forces, it was during this performance that i actually  felt  its meaning. it was so awesome how they utilized the aerial synergy between man and woman to represent the balance and harmony that transcends over space and time. it was truly an artistic tapestry that wove figments of imagination with this crazy athleticism so you'll leave the show in complete awe of the human body and the power of mind. guys...it was so beautiful i wanted to cry again.  now i know why ppl "give," and not "sacrifice," their lives to art and entertainment. what better way to live than to give the gift of sheer wonder and awe?

      thanks to  urlLink anonymous  for inadvertantly introducing me to  urlLink this.  it is high-friggin-larious. it's the guilty pleasure i treat myself to at the end of the day. i know it's wrong but i just can't help myself. it just dawned on me that i used to have teeth just like his. same overbite, same gap-age, same speech impediment. no joke. i still have the mold of my mouth to prove it. kids used to call me bugs bunny back in the day.  anyway, i think will's absolutely adorable, especially in the way that he's so unpretentious and impervious to criticism. honestly, if only we could all be a little more like him, i think we'd be a happier lot.   i think amy is gonna be the last wo/man standing on the apprentice, girlfriend is sharp as a whip. nick is a bumbling idiot. bill is a cutie-pie but privy to pettiness. troy is a texan, 'nuff said. katrina, like ereka who got the boot today, is too girly and emotional. heidi and omarosa will probably kill each other off in a fabulous catfight. so i predict that it's gonna come down to troy and amy. the only reason that troy would win over amy is that he's a man, which is no reason at all. i can't believe katie curic is doing a knockoff show called the intern. the apprentice does as well as it does mainly due to the legend and icon known as donald trump. ya gotta love the man, combover, fuchsia ties, ex-model girlfriends and all. as sad as this sounds, i get really, really excited to hear those beautifully succinct words, "you're fired!" delivered with a cobra-like flick of the wrist. ahhhh...nobody does it like the donald, and nobody ought to even try.

      hi.  did y'all see what just happened on the season finale of the bachelorette?? did i call it or did i call it (again)?! i think it's time to turn professional.  i am so unbelievably happy about meredith choosing ian. i love it. i love it. i love everything about the idea of meredith and ian. i love how their unspoken chemistry was so palpable from day one and they just kinda form their own little world when they're together. i love how they're both rational ppl (as much as one can be on a reality show) who both said that it's more important to find love than it is to have a ring. and i LOVE how their feelings were so strong by the end that ian chucked his marriage-phobia (he'd vowed in previous episodes that he would not propose on the show) and proposed with no fluff, no sap, no speech, just feeling out the moment, holding each other, shaking in authentic nervousness and joy, talking it through, fixing each other's hair and tie, and then, "okay well here it is. so will ya?" "of course." OF COURSE OF COURSE! it was so beautifully simple, unadorned, unplanned, and close to my idea of the perfect proposal that my eyes filled up with tears. so yeah, i'm totally in love with mer&ian. thank gawd she didn't get with bachelor bob last season who ditched poor weepy estella one week after the show ended! wow. do i sound like a walking tv guide or what.  stop shaking your heads, i have a point to make with all this. i might have said this before, but being "perfect" and trying too hard could actually work against you. you could be like matthew or charlie (both were the last guy to be eliminated from the past two seasons of the bachelorette), the attractive, well-built, romantic, successful, good-with-the-'rents, perfect-on-paper kinda guy, but if the other person doesn't feel it, pack your bags and call a cab buddy. what i love about ian is that he's this cool, flawed, practical, inexpressive, seemingly detached, globe-trotting, struggling-to-open-up kinda guy who only showed one moment of vulnerability throughout the entire season. but that one moment was loaded with meaning because it was so hard to come by and authentic that you just wanna grab him and yell, "i knew it! i knew you liked me! i knew i could turn stone into putty!" trust me, us girls love that. there's no fun in ready-whip. well, don't take me to be the final authority on this or anything. according to the polls, 74% of viewers prefer sweet doting matthew over ian, so i could be wrong. but if you want my opinion, thugs win more than hugs. okay bye.

      i am in such pain today i will kill any man foolish enough to cross my path who bears no blood relation to me.  okay. i just realized that something i always say makes no sense at all. for the longest time, my defense for eating meat was "eat or be eaten." but...cows and chickens don't eat people... oh well. take my word for it: the beef brisket from costco is really good y'all.

      if you watch tv as much as i do, you've probably noticed a proliferation of shows these days shifting their fixation from female  sex uality to female  sens uality.  oprah did a show yesterday titled "is your sex life normal?", basically helping wives to cope with feelings of sexual frustration, and to let its female viewers know that whatever problems they're having with their sexual partners, thousands of other women are probably feeling it (or not feeling it) too.  similarly, barbara's discourse on 20/20 just now featured an erotic "school of womanly art" for ladies looking to take charge of their sex lives.  in the wake of trend-setting shows like sex and the city, it is no wonder that women are charging out of the linen closet with sex drive in high gear. after all, there shouldn't be any shame in baking the cake and eating it too.   only in the past year have i become acutely aware that real-life people, as opposed to just the hot peeps on the OC, engage in sexual intercourse on a regular basis.  in fact, people are getting it on ALL---THE---TIME.  okay, so maybe by people, i don't mean you or me, at this particular moment.  but you know that computer geek over in the next cubicle swimming in an oversized star wars t-shirt and flooding pants?  he's getting some.  and those spandex-covered health nuts doing the warrior pose in your tuesday night yoga class?  they're also into doing the monkey dance act, if you know what i mean. and we're talkin evening  and  matinee.  Sex...it's a nebulous thing ain't it?  i, for one, am very confused as to whether this era of sexual renaissance for women is anathema to feminists or a byproduct of their cause (i guess it would depend on whether i'm talking about feminists or post feminists...?).  on the one hand, there's no use denying that sex sells, and this can be no more evident than the four week winning streak of the females on the apprentice (best reality show by far!).  on the other hand, we refuse to be viewed as sex objects, sincerely hoping to be esteemed for our brain and not our boobs.  but regardless of where the glass ceiling hits in the office, i guess the media is at least catching on to the concept that women have a need for fulfillment in the bedroom just as much as men.  for this service done to female sexuality and equality in the bed, bath & beyond, I say hurrah!...with bated breath.  I think it's great that women are no longer ashamed of our bodies and our sexualities (if you have any doubt that we ever were, please remember that corset-wearing and foot-binding and muslim veils were all imposed upon women  by  women!), but I hope men aren't gonna overzealously misconstrue this as a season pass to having sex with any girl that shows interest.  to be fair, i guess i can kinda see it from a guy's point of view, circumstantially speaking.  Girl dresses promiscuously, girl wittingly situates herself in a drunken orgy of strapping libidos, girl makes sexual innuendos, girl basically gives off every signal that she is willing to have sex.  Now  urlLink research  done by some bored peeps at a canadian university have proven that men can't think straight after just looking at photos of attractive women.  can you imagine what happens to these fools when they're completely aroused??  but i gotta say, especially in light of the recent colorado football rape charges, the bottom line is that once the girl says no, at any point in time, the guy has got to stop. cuz that's the law. so regardless of evolving sex roles, no still means no, and so does "zzzzzzzzzzz" for that matter.  the second thing that kinda concerns me is how sexual pleasures are being openly promoted without some warning label like "to be used only by the sexually responsible."  i mean if they make them for hot coffee, i don't see why they don't make them for hot sex. but seriously, don't you ever wonder how Samantha on sex and the city could have sex with the whole city of new york (and probably some peripheral states) and not have contracted some form of STD by now??  i absolutely LOVE that show, but i think that was an irresponsible oversight on the part of the writers. I mean, I totally understand the whole physicological aspect about peeps needing to be sexually actively ( urlLink this  even says it contributes to good healthy and longevity), and I don't think peeps ought to be judged on whether they're having premarital sex or not vis--vis the many other things to measure a person's character by. But still, too many peeps out there are having babies who shouldn't be, or suffering a lifetime of pain for a few minutes of pleasure. so i came upon this "golden rule of thumb" for sex that says peeps should only have sex with someone that we're willing to make a potential baby with, and somebody that we're willing to die for, literally. then maybe nobody would have to bother with that whole abortion issue, and those labrats could better spend their time looking for a cure for cancer instead of aids.  so yeah...about that essay on campaign finance reform...

      okay. i usually try to abide by a one-entry-per-day policy, but after watching tonight's episode of "the bachelorette," i just gotta say that it was SO obvious that chad had NO chance.  no job + no moves = adios amigo .   seriously, should the opportunity ever arise for you to get dumped on national tv, please PLEASE refrain from sobbing on and on about how you were misled and how you really thought that person was The One and how you just don't understand cuz you really felt It and how that person let the greatest thing that ever happened to them ride away.   it did occur to me tonight that the concept behind the whole show is pretty messed up. i mean, the bachelor/ette pretty much has his/her eyes set on one, maybe two, out of the 25 contestants right off the bat during the taping of the very first episode. that's just how human attraction works. not that there's anything wrong with the others per se, but you can only truly click with a select few in this entire world. but to keep the ratings up, the bachelor/ette has to act like they're SO torn during each rose ceremony, and they gotta act like all those other ppl have a chance when deep down, they've known exactly who they were gonna choose all along. so with all those contestants vying for one individual, and having intimate dates with that person without seeing how that person interacts with the other contestants, and being treated by that person as if everything is rosy-cozy, ppl are literally setup to get their heart trounced on. so i've wisely arrived at the conclusion that  abc's the bachelor/ette is an amoral show . i'm going to stop watching as soon as this season ends.  since we're on the topic, kinda sorta, i just gotta say that i absolutely abhor the idea of dating. i absolutely detest the awkward getting-to-know process. and i absolutely hate it when guys are ambiguous about their motives until they get you alone and trap you in an overly romantic setting and then you feel all guilty and wonder if you've been misleading so then you agree to another get-together cuz you feel bad and on and on it goes until you explode with the truth and then you become the girl that gives all girls an evil name even though you were just being nice.  whatever happened to just chillin'???  seriously, peeps just gotta calm down. we're only in our early TWENTIES! our lives have barely left the dock, most of us still haven't learned how to steer or know where we'd like to head. we're so dumb about so many things with so much to do and so much to see. i used to be like many girls my age, lamenting about how our golden years are passing us by, being a whopping 23 and all, but then it dawned on me how ludicrous that sounds. there's not going to be any markers or timelines to dictate where i should be or who i should be with at any particular age. the best years of my life are going to last throughout the rest of my life, and that's how i'm gonna live it. so my point is: what's the friggin rush yo?   on another tangent, i totally agree with  urlLink boxworthy  that while caught in the maelstrom of gay unions, the idea that  love  is the ultimate, defining characteristic of marriage has been conveniently overlooked. the fact that we're even debating the legitimacy of gay marriage as a nation is a showcase of bigotry plain as day. how is homophobia any different from racism or anti-semitism or any other form of discrimination at its ugliest? sure,  your  ppl can go to school, just not  our  school next to  our  kids getting  our  education riding  our  school bus. sure, we'll take your tax money, but the day you wanna share a right as basic and natural as marriage, we gotta give it some bullsh*t second-class name like civil union. and that's cuz God don't like how y'all's different from us. i absolutely loathe the fact that ppl use religion as a trump card for unfounded personal grievance. (i suppose bush believes in his pious heart that God endorsed the war in iraq, the  botched intelligence  ((  (btw, does anyone else find it unsettling how outrageously prolific i become when i have a pressing deadline to meet?)

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- whoopdeedoo, another admissions essay to compose for a school that considers me "well qualified but [is] unable to reach a definitive decision at this time." i am given a choice from among the following three topics for the tie-breaker:  (1) should the government be allowed to limit campaign donations, or is this a violation of the First Amendment's prohibition of free speech; (2) to what extent should government be permitted to invade individual privacy to guard against terrorism; or (3) would a legal system that charges wealthy people larger fines for minor offenses be more just than a system that charges the same fine to all regardless of wealth?  as of now, i'm leaning heavily towards the first prompt. topic 3 is too obvious for me to form a good argument that gives serious consideration to potential counter-claims. and topic 2 just seems dangerously broad to me. what do they mean by to what extent? "to the extent that one's treasured paraphernalia, ie, tweezers...nail clippers..., won't be confiscated before boarding a plane??" (screeches the bushy-browed, nail-biting girl with pronounced bitterness in her voice.) best to stay away from something that hits so close to home.  well, that leaves topic 1. let's see what my response might look like:  position: yes, limitations should be placed and enforced on campaign contributions. argument: yada yada. counter-argument: but first amendment rights yada yada. counter-counter-argument: true, first amendment rights yada yada, but keep in mind, yada yada. and yada yada some more. conclusion: see what a compelling argument i'm capable of making? now admit me to your law school or thou shalt be condemned to the land of remorse!  okay, you know what the kicker is about the letter i received? "it is our hope that you will use this essay as an opportunity to think about and express your ideas,  research is neither expected nor encouraged ." yeah right. like mad competitive peeps out there aren't gonna be tossing in some legal jargon they just found on the internet to appear politically savvy. oh how i hate those rule-breaching, over-achieving desperados. why can't there be a general consensus among us that no one shall invest more than 30% effort? that ought to level the playing field just enough to work in my favor.  okay fine. i'm actually one of those anal bastardettes that like to spew out the most pretentious facts and figures and act like it's the most natural thing to hop off the top of my head and roll off the tip of my tongue. heh...it's the likes of me that nipped socialism in the bud.  hey there, the due date for this essay is march 15th. wow, that gives me...26 days. and that's not even counting today's productive brainstorming session! pfffffft, PLENTY of time...  whoa, oprah is 50. i must say, girl looks goooood for her age.

      hi. i'm still alive. despite my previous references to golf, may the record show that i think it is a fuddy-duddy non-sport whose assault on fashion takes the master cup.  pink polos and pleated plaids aside, i've stumbled upon a rare breed of thoughtful, mature, and unabashedly sensitive men  la lloyd dobler. the boy-man who lives to love is no longer myth. the flickering candlelight and bordeaux bubbles continue to swim in my boggled mind. what waste to be spent on a reclusive brute such as i.  it suddenly occurred to me today that i will never have to finish reading beowulf for ap english. i can't remember the last time i was made this happy by a random thought that crashed the party in my head.

      this movie:     is classic kaufman. you'd know what i'm talking about if you've seen Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. those two were entertaining but plain weird. eternal sunshine was a lot easier to relate to. it was everything beautiful and sweet and scary and sad about love and fear and loss and regret. i enjoyed it very much.    How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!  The world forgetting, by the world forgot Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.   i think this is one of the few movies that i could watch over and over again. and as for the other stuff, had i known the ending, i'd still have started them, in a heartbeat.

      i CANNOT believe that polygamy still exists right here in the u.s. of a. stories like  urlLink this one  were featured on oprah yesterday.   colorado city, arizona contains an isolated religious sect that forces thousands of teen girls into marriage with men who may be 50 years older and already have 30 other wives. the girls are not allowed to attend school beyond the eighth grade because, according to the community leaders, "girls do not need to know things unrelated to child-rearing." incest is also quite common there. to introduce fresh blood into the community, girls are frequently exchanged between colorado city and another polygamous sect located in Bountiful, Canada. polygamy has also been openly practiced in Hildale, UT for more than 70 years.    urlLink here's  a site where you can actually view some pictures of this freaky place.   i don't believe that the freedom of religion clause in the constitution was intended to protect stuff like polygamy and sex-trafficking. the girls in these places are forced into marriage against their will and subject to molestation by fathers, uncles, and cousins. their lives have been determined for them, and they are to have no contact with the outside world. this is a taliban of sorts that exists in our own country today...i just hope president bush watches oprah as much as i do.   currently playing:  urlLink fountains of wayne - fire island

      hi. i just watched yoanna win america's top model. man, it's kinda scary how easy it is to become emotionally involved with these reality shows. the last time i was so nervous about the outcome of something was during the finals moments of the bachelorette. and the time before that was...probably when i was looking up my lsat score. ya know, just something that would determine the rest of my life. anyway, since i missed the first half of tonight's finale, i have no idea why chandi was longer in the competition. i'd really appreciate it if somebody could fill me in, so that i don't go on wondering about it for the rest of my life.   i looked up rates for flying to chicago in about a week and a half. they're about $260 for aa, does that sound right? that's about 4.2 jessica simpson scarves right there. i may postpone the trip until i get some definitive responses from schools on the other side of mountain standard time. for the time being, i'd really appreciate it if somebody could email me about where to find the best fares.   i'm really really excited about school starting. not about the studying of course, but more about meeting new ppl, actually having something to do during the day, being in a new city, having something to do during the day, wearing pretty clothes to class, having something to do during...  anyway, a few weeks back, in the heyday of my pre-law school fervor, i made the mistake of reading One L and Law School Planet. the authors of these books made 1L (which refers to the first year of law school) seem like one HELL, and they succeeded in scaring a motherlode of crap outta me. since then, i've been trying to ready myself for school by studying the material that one of the authors recommended. i even ordered the restatement (second) of torts and contracts, as well as the "abc's of the ucc" for articles 1 & 2. all these books probably come out to 150+ pages of reading per day if i wanna get through them by the time school starts. well, unfortunately, i happen to be a person who's incorrigibly devoid of any discipline. it's really amazing that i held out until today to scream FORGET IT!! so what if these super duper smart guys had a horrifying experience in law school? that doesn't mean that i will...right? anyway, i'm pretty sure i'll be stressed up the wazoo once classes commence anyway. i might as well enjoy life to the max now and wait for the axe to fall later. after all, this is the attitude that has carried me through all my previous years of schooling, i don't see why i should lose faith in it now.   maybe i'll give the constitution a once-over before school starts, and brush up on some econ as some 1Ls have advised (for reasons that are beyond me), but NO MAS!! from now until august, i'm gonna take my sweet time reading/watching/listening to good books/movies/music, going boarding again as soon as my wrist/bruises/peeling skin heal from the last trip, sleeping a lot, eating a lot, and maybe getting a playstation. btw, does anybody think it's a good idea to get a console from ebay, considering the risk of fraud and machine damage and shipping trouble? and what prices would you deem reasonable for new and used?  anyway, i think i've already mentioned how excited i am about school, minus the studying of course. i really have my mind set on getting a chihuahua like the one in LB, but naming it kitty instead of bruiser. how adorable would that be?? i just hope i can find a nice little studio that allows pets and is within heel-walking distance to class. on-campus housing, on the other hand, has not been completely ruled out. the residence hall at nwu, for instance, accomodates law students AND med students. uh huh...meddies.......definitely a plus...  currently playing:  urlLink white stripes- i just don't know what to do with myself

      okay ppl. major damage done this weekend. i am in SUCH a big pile of doodoo. omg. i accidentally bid on something on ebay and ended up winning it. well not accidentally as in i clicked on the "bid" button without meaning to or something. more like i was looking at this jessica simpson scarf that was going for $15 and i was like, hey that's not bad, not bad at all...so i bid $16, but i got the automatic reply that i had to bid higher cuz the person who set the amount at 15 actually entered a higher amount that he/she was willing to pay. so i was thinking, okay, i think $20 is a reasonable price, so i entered that amount, and got rejected again! now i was just plain curious...exactly how high did this person actually set his/her max bid?? at first i went up to $25...then $30...$35...the higher the stakes rose, the more perversely exhilarated i felt, and the whole time i was thinking, just one more try and i'm done, for reals...and then, out of nowhere, BAM! i became the highest bidder, with six minutes remaining. that's when i realized what i'd done and started sweating some major bullets. well, you already know what happened after that. i guess the other person just figured that i'd clearly lost my mind and left me alone with my little jessica simpson scarf. it's not even the REAL jessica simpson scarf, mind you, just a stupid replica that cost me a staggering $65!! and now that i think about it, that scarf looks an awful lot like something a drag queen would wear.   after reading over the entire ebay agreement, i was pretty sure that i was stuck with it for good. there's only three conditions upon which you can retract a bid, and i didn't satisfy any of them since none of them mentioned anything about stupidity.   if you were me, don't you think you'd have good reason to comfort yourself?? try to redeem yourself at least?? that's why i immediately bid on and won another scarf, pink cashmere, for only $26, S&H included.   the way i figure it, these two things together come out to a total of, what...80-something dollars, and if you divide that number by 2, it means that each item cost me about $40, which is not soooo bad considering that one of them is 100% cashmere and the other one was featured in Cosmo last month.   the only thing is, after all this, i'm thinking...i don't even have a great neck for scarves. *sigh.* i think i have a serious problem. no man who's reading this will EVER want to marry me now...   currently playing:  urlLink fountains of wayne - utopia pathway

      2 hours til the west wing...  hope you've been keeping track of the presidential election...the one in taiwan that is. some exciting stuff going on over yonder. here's what's up, or gone down, in a nutshell: pre-election polls show the 2 candidates going neck-and-neck; day prior to elections, both incumbent and his vp escape an assassination attempt that leave them with mere scrapes (the force of one bullet was so weak that it came to a nice little rest inside one of their jackets); incumbent wins election the next day by a very narrow margin; demonstrators hanker for a recall, partly cuz they suspect the incumbent staged his own shooting to get the "sympathy votes" that won him the election. crazy huh? and i thought chinese politicians were just a bunch of boring old farts...     urlLink here's  the most recent article regarding the whole ballyhoo.   whether you ask me or not, i would much rather have the challenger win. the guy that's in office right now promotes taiwan's independence from china. to give you a little perspective, that's comparable to hawaii seceding from the united states. and that's just plain wrong, if you ask me.  some chinese politician joked, in chinese, "if every person in china spit on taiwan once, it would drown out every single person on the island." well, i won't contest the validity of that statement, but it's neither a very nice thing to say, nor to do, nor to witness. so let's hope it won't ever have to come down to that. peace on earth.   currently playing:  urlLink fountains of wayne - peace & love

      quoting from http://www.tntluoma.com/kepler371/lawschool.html:  "Almost without exception, in the Top 14, there are more black females than black males,  more asian females than asian males , and more overall female minorities than male minorities."    that's just grrrrrrreat...  p.s. ebay shoppers are INSANE (esp females looking for celebrity fashion knockoffs)!! i think shopaholism is drowning out all theoretical benefits of the invisible hand. the thing about ebay is, if you lose the bid, you feel like a fantastic deal just slipped through your fingers. but if you win, you feel dumb cuz you bought something for a price that nobody else was willing to pay. this is definitely not healthy for me.  p.p.s. what's the deal with ugg boots?? i have never seen an asian person wear them. and i've never seen an asian person look good in tan suede. the smell of it alone makes me gag.  p.p.s. you're currently listening to my favorite song from damien rice's "o" album. it's the only one that i can sing along to without having to think or try too hard, kinda like a praise song i guess, although i'm fairly certain the lyrics are secular. i really like "imperfect" voices like his, it makes the yearning a lot more heartfelt and genuine-sounding. nice huh?   currently playing:  urlLink damien rice - cannonball

      quotes from my new favorite show:   Jessica: Oh my gaaaw!  Nick: Oh your what?  Lea: She's not saying God. It's her new thing.   Jessica: I could feel your teeth.  Nick: They're not my teeth, actually.  Jessica: Oh, I forgot. They're 'ventures.' No, that's dentures.  Nick: Ventures?  Jessice: What are they called?  (Nick laughs)  Jessica: Veneers.  (Nick laughs)  Jessica: I thought 'dentures' and I thought 'veneers.' And then I came up with 'ventures.'  Nick: Yeah. "Think" is the key word.   now you know that if anybody can empathize with jessica simpson, it's got to be me, for sures. the girl may not have a clue when it comes to...well, just about anything, but she's definitely got an acute sense of fashion (okay, maybe having a sizeable bank account doesn't hurt either). feeling particularly inspired after watching the show, i,for one, have decided to battle the pangs of pms this month by hitting up ebay instead of the cookie jar. it's a lot more productive this way, i think. i'm currently making my premiere bids on jessica's beautiful crochet shawl and vintage scarf. this ebay thing is not nearly as complicated as i thought... it's like i've discovered a whole new world. oh my gaw. anyway, only about 18 hours to go for one of the items, and it'll be mine, all mine!! my alarm clock's set so i'll be ready to roll. eeeeeeeee, this is so exciting, wish me luck guys!!   currently playing:  urlLink jessica simpson - with you

         this is the only show that i watch on a daily basis now that oprah is doing reruns. it's been my favorite cartoon for the past four years, and in my opinion, far surpasses all the other cartoons for kids these days in terms of entertainment and educational value. i might not have learned much from the classrooms in elementary school, but this show reminds me of all the valuable lessons that i picked up on the playground, stuff about friendship and acceptance and survival that we might have forgotten as we grew up. the characters crack me up too (mikey's my favorite). i hope it's still around by the time i have a kid.

      hi guys.  this morning, i awoke from the worst nightmare a girl could have. i dreamt that i'd gluttonously devoured a dozen or so cupcakes by accident and immediately found myself sprouting a j.lo-esque rump of psychedelic proportions. it was truly one of the most devastating moments in the recent history of my life.  naturally, the first thing i did when i got up this morning was to park myself in front of a mirror and check out my "rear" view. after consuming myself in the serious business of fanny-appraisal, i happily concluded that my junk in the trunk, though ever-accumulating, was nowhere close to immersing itself into the back of my knees.   anyway, i felt compelled to share this experience with all of you, and i hope you've been able to take away something meaningful from it as you do from all the rest of my entries. as for me, this dream was definitely a rude awakening to the fact that looking good is a high-stress job. you think trying to maintain a beach-perfect body is a walk in the park, a piece of cake? think again! haha. okay goodbye.

      wow. i think i reached a new low today. my "friends" duped me into having dinner with them as a fifth wheel. not to exaggerate my extrasensory powers, but i distinctly sniffed danger and deceit in the air as soon as i stepped inside. and what do i see when i reach the table but two pairs of lovebirds on either side of the booth, symmetrically basking in the sacred halo of blind adulation...truly a single person's worst nightmare.  okay. truthfully, i had a pretty good time, but mylanta, the gibberish these ppl whisper to each other when they think you're not looking. my conclusions from the evening: a) always ask for details of attendance when getting together with friends who are involved in relationships; b) never trust anything said by friends who are involved in relationships; c) some ppl become the best versions of themselves when they're complemented by a significant other; d) good or bad, this version of me is here to stay for a looooooooooooooooooooooooooong time.

      today is friggin friggin friggin hot.  my poor dogs and all that fur...i don't care what benchu says, i'm sure they'll feel a lot cooler after i shave them naked.  the first response ppl have to chicago is, "it's so cold there!!" (with the exception of my mom:  aiya! so many black people!! ) well, right now, i'd much rather be freezing my a$$ off than suffering this sweltering heat. i feel like a human slushy that can't get through the day without two naps and a fudgesicle.  i went on my first trail hike this weekend at eaton canyon. it was a lot more physically demanding than i'd expected. as we traversed over rugged slopes and turbulent streams underneath the full moon, i thanked my lucky stars for deciding to leave my manolos at home.   i also watched starsky & hutch over the weekend. i think it was pretty funny, but i can't say for sure. i was constantly distracted by these wonderful fantasies of walking down the red carpet one day on the arm of this man:     now that's one kind of  caliente  i wouldn't mind. (the one on the right)  i also ate really bad sushi on sunday. after that, i was pretty sure i'd be abstaining from fish for a good couple of years.  for dinner tonight, my mom baked salmon with sweet onions drowning in XO sauce. that marked the end of my fish fast. i now have food coma on top of heat stroke. goodbye.

      hey y'all. my absolute favorite song of the moment is "take me as i am" by wyclef jean.  sooooooo sweet...i love it. ( urlLink listen  /  urlLink lyrics )  another artist to check out:      if you think i ought to be rewarded for all this free promotion, please make a check out to the laura-wanna-fly-to-chicago-for-a-taping-of-the-oprah-winfrey-show foundation.  yesterday, i purchased my first snowboarding outfit. i live by the theory that if you wanna be good at something, you gotta look the part first. the thing is, when i came home from the store, i discovered that the clerk had accidentally given me TWO of the $200 burton jacket that i bought. hm...what would william hung do in a befuddling case such as this?   i doubt that he'd consider e-baying it...  okay, my computer is doing very weird things that me no like. goodbye.

      as i was checking my hotmail acct tonight, an item on the sidebar reading  "Bling-bling a date destroyer?"  immediately caught my attention.  the  urlLink article  didn't turn out to be what i expected, but the headline so perfectly captured my date with this one guy that i might as well have penned the article for it myself.  first off, let me just say that I do not make it a habit of dating complete strangers.  at an ideal 5'9'' with a quietly rebellious air, the man was without a doubt the asian replica of james dean.  in addition to the chiseled face, rock-hard body, and a fabulous crown of hair that he'd run his hand through every now and then, he sported a sexy Canadian accent that I found completely irresistible.  i'm sure you would have swooned too had you seen him, regardless of your sexual orientation.   needlessly to say, i was meticulous about my choice of attire for my date with this beautiful man.  we'd agreed on keeping it "low-key," and even though i was the one who offered those exact words, i had no idea what it meant in terms of first-date fashion-speak.  any girl with half a brain knows that until she has ensnared a guy into a stable relationship, the single worst thing to do is to give off the impression of being high maintenance.  the key to successful dating is to always appear stunning without looking like you tried.  based on what i knew about my date's area of residence and its demographics, i decided that it'd be wise to dress down from the overall quality of my wardrobe by a good 55-65%. (Surely, a decent man would appreciate a woman of modest appearance and humble breed.)  as soon as I pulled into his driveway and saw him coming towards my car, i realized that my awesome powers of deduction had failed me, big time.   i guess i could sum it up by saying that he's a mysterious-adonis-by-night-full-blown-pimp-daddy-by-day kinda guy.  at the club where we'd met, i distinctly remember him in a sleek leather jacket over a simple black top.  for our afternoon date, the man was decked OUT.  i don't even know where to begin...maybe with the tan suede jacket fringed by faux mongolian fur that he had to  special order  from an obscure boutique in nyc...or the finely tailored shirt with distinct couture print...or the turquoise Dior sunglasses...or maybe i should just jump right into the bling-bling around loverboy's neck  and  his fingers.  as you can imagine, i was abso-friggin-lutely mortified to be trapped in my cotton gap tee, tattered blue jeans, and imitation dr.scholl's sandals by way of target.  all i can recall from the drive towards the pier in his topless mustang is that i was feeling very very resentful.  there was no doubt in my mind that this man had breached the first-date code of fashion conduct by dressing as he did.  in fact, he specifically misled me to believe during our prior phone convo that he was a real chill and earthy kinda guy.  has the man no scruples??   on account of his good looks, I could have  easily  forgiven him for his smoking/drinking/drug habits, to say nothing of his faltering sense of direction, his dainty appetite that made me look like a starved elephant by comparison, his swollen ego, his frequent use of profanity and porn, and the fact that he had nothing in common with me.  but quite simply, the man had out-bling'd me on our very first date, and that fact alone is a travesty i find so reprehensible as to preclude the possibility of any future to be had between the two of us, period.  so in conclusion, the answer is an emphatic  YES!

         in fear of sounding hackneyed, being a latecomer to the da vinci bandwagon, all i'm gonna say is:   DAMN  .  when the movie hits theaters, i assure you that i will be the first person there, flanked by my diet coke and bucket of spicy buffalo wings, and that i will be one happy lady. it was THAT good, and dan brown is DA man.  i think one of the reasons, among the legion, that i liked it so much is that i've actually been to and seen some of the stuff written about in the book. unfortunately, i was too much of a dumbass back then to really appreciate it while i was there. the louvre was just a really big museum that we raced through (literally, ran) to see the mona lisa (our tour group was allotted RIDICULOUSLY little time), and westminster abbey was just "ANOTHER?!" cathedral, its prominence overshadowed by london's grey sky.  oh well. revisiting those sights in this amazing book was good enough for now.  an excerpt, lengthy but worthy (if you find yourself offended by the following content, i suggest you read it over):  Langdon smiled.  "Sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication.  That is the definition of faith--acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.  Every religion describes God through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians through modern Sunday school.  Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible.  The problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors." "So you are in favor of the Sangreal documents staying buried forever?" "I'm a historian.  I'm opposed to the destruction of documents, and I would love to see religious scholars have more information to ponder the exceptional life of Jesus Christ." "You're arguing both sides of my question." "Am I?  The Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions.  If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that?  Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom?  Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth?  Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical." Sophie looked skeptical.  "My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ  literally  walked the water,  literaly  turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth." "My point exactly," Langdon said.  "Religious allegory has become a part of thefabric of reality.  And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people." "But it appears their reality is false." Langdon chuckled.  "No more false than that of a mathematical cryptographer who believes in the imaginary number  'i'  because it helps her break codes."

      did anyone watch the president's news conference tonight? as with all his speeches, i was wondering whether it's the speech-writing or his delivery that makes his speaking so unbearable.  i do know for sure that this is one president who should never ever ever EVER hold a news conference, no matter how dire the situation.  doesn't his staff prep him for questions beforehand, like they do on the west wing, so that he can avoid saying something mortifying like "you just put me on the spot here...i guess i'm just not quick enough on my feet"??? honestly, i was cringing for the man.    watching jessica simpson say stupid things is funny cuz she's a harmless entertainer (and it makes me feel a whole lot better about some of the things that i'll occassionally let slip). watching the president say things stupidly is scary cuz he's the president.  no matter how they spin the thing, the war in iraq is a distraction from the war on terrorism. they are NOT synonymous. and that's my $0.02.   currently playing:  urlLink let's get retarded - black eyed peas

       foreword: doris, i'm sorry i broke our date tonight cuz i had to watch the apprentice. thanks for understanding that the apprentice : me as alias : you.    i am in such a foul mood right now.  DAMN THAT OMAROSA!!!  i can honestly say that i have never harbored such strong feelings of animosity towards any living person (bin laden's existence being in question) as i do towards that LYING, CONNIVING, TWO-FACED, LAZY-ASS [bleep]!!!   on top of tonight's incendiary episode, the woman had the nerve to show her face on oprah and accuse the media of intentionally portraying african americans in a negative light. i'm not infuriated by that allegation, but by the source of it! omarosa, if you're reading this, PLEASE SHUT THE F*** UP!!! actions speak louder than words, so don't even try to make yourself out to be an aegis of racial equality!! i may not have authority to comment on other shows, but i do know that your atrocious behavior on the apprentice, not your race, is what makes you truly disgusting. if i weren't sooooo repulsed by the idea of being within arm's reach of you, i'd wring your neck with my own hands.* and may the record show that i am gentle and peace-loving by nature.  that being said, i'm really looking forward to watching next week's grand finale. one of the final two contenders is in charge of jessica simpson's vegas concert, so she'll be making an appearance on the apprentice. it'll be the fusion of my two favorite shows that i've been praying for. there is a gaaaaw.    *note: this statement does not make me liable for committing a tort in the form of an assault. it is a conditional threat where my own words negate the intent to cause a harmful contact by indicating that i do not plan to carry out the threat.   (just practicing...)  p.s. after multiple threats and demands via email, i'm starting to feel that some of you no likee japanese midi. so i've removed the background music, for now. a comments section has also been added for your venting pleasure. please be advised, however, that comments made in languages other than espanol will be respectfully ignored in honor of william hung, whose work has done so much to bridge the gap between the chinese and spanish-speaking communities. gracias and wo aye nee.   currently playing:  urlLink bailamos - william hung  (released on April 6th, check your local stores for availability)

Anonymous Friend: it's cold there Anonymous Friend: and there's a lotta white ppl Anonymous Friend: if you're into that sorta thing...  maybe this is a sign that it's high time i thrust myself smack-dab in the center of america-land. i feel like i've been having trouble communicating these days, forming complete adult-standard sentences out of words. granted, i encounter extreme linguistic difficulties when talking to a crush, but these days, i go around talking like that to everyone. it's very troubling. i could blame it on my williamhung obsession, but i think somebody just needs to pry the remote out of my hand and replace it with a book. according to the Oprah's Book Club newsletters via email, i'm desperately behind in One Hundred Years of Solitude. as you may recall, i had listed that book back in January as one that i'd already completed. well, that was a little beige lie...i now confess to you that the only book i've finished this year, the year of the ALMIGHTY MONKEY, is Confessions of a Shopaholic. that's pretty pitiful if you ask me.  the next book that i want to read, after 100 Years and Fast Food Nation (unfinished from 2002) and Guns Germs and Steel (2001), is A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers. I've heard such raving reviews of the man that it's about time I acquaint myself with him personally.   hey y'all, i think i have a zit on my tonsils, if that's possible. since it's beyond popping range, i guess i just hafta put up with this gaw-awful case of halitosis a while longer...  btw, does anyone know the html for uploading pictures onto blogger? the code that i've been using so far only allows me to link internet images. my overwhelming desire to share myself with the world has been thwarted many-a-times due to this inconvenience. input from anyone would be greatly appreciated. thanks sabin.  p.s.

      hehe, guess wha? it was an allergy after all. either that or claritin is a miracle drug. life is good great wonderful again.  a few weeks ago, i purchased a product from estee lauder called Slim-shape claiming to contain "a host of metabolizing agents proven to firm and tone trouble spots." now i know some of you are skeptical, just like i was, but i'm telling ya, i've been using the cream for four days now and i could swear that my buns are shrinking as we speak. observe:  7:50am: (____l____)  7:51am: (___l___)  7:52am: (__l__)  seriously, modern science never ceases to amaze me. to all my friends who are slaving away in a lab somewhere, my heiny salutes you. keep up the good work.

      *obygaw, suhbody shoot be outta by bisery puh-lea...ahh-ahhhh-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-choo!*   i can't believe it's only saturday. it was only...five...six days ago that i was overdosing on benadryl. it took a few pink elephants and still being runny-nosed/congested/teary-eyed/aching-from-head-to-foot for me to figure out that i was not suffering from spring allergy, but a really bad case of the common cold. since then, i've succumbed to all the life-leeching symptoms, and every belabored breath comes by way of swallowing a truckload of snot (which the human body is amazingly efficient at resupplying if you ask me). look, i don't want to sound like a big baby for being sick, so quit begging me for more details, but...I HATE IT I HATE IT I HA...ahhhh-ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....!!! gee, and i wonder why i can't wait for this week to end. *sniff gulp*

      okay ppl. go  urlLink here  for my narrated tour of Cornell.   Note: Two things that my pictures did not capture, and what i actually liked the most about the place, were the beauty of clear running water, such as the creeks and gourges, and the warmth of the ppl in the town of Ithaca.   p.s. in the previous entry, i meant the acronym P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. to stand for "Prettiest," not just "Pretty." Hope that makes more sense.

      hi. i'm back. it was every bit as perfect as i knew it'd be. frankly, i'd made up my mind way before i ever stepped off the plane. i'll post some pictures to narrate my trip later, when fancy strikes and the lazy bones turn to dust.  now i'd like to share with you a funny dream i had last night. it was so funny, in fact, that even  i  had to say to myself, "Self, you really crack me up sometimes ya know that?"  okay. Start:  so in my dream, i was moving into my dorm at law school and setting up my room. after i was with those final touches of haute decor, i stepped out into the hallway hoping to meet some of my new classmates, and the first person i bump into, the  very first  person, is no other than...the P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. (D.H.!).   for those of you bumpkins unfamiliar to coolspeak, P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. (D.H.!) is an acronym that stands for "Pretty Asian Girl I've Ever Known In Person (Damn Her!)". this P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. that i speak of is someone that i've known since the wee-days of junior high. even through those hormonally-tumultuous years of puberty, miss P.A.G. was stunning as ever, brandishing her beauty in our pimpled faces with her long pantene hair and porcelain skin. the rest of us could only look on in open-metal-mouthed awe. well, open to the extent that our rubber bands allowed.   just in case you think i'm exaggerating, i assure you that this is not the case. Fact: in 2002, P.A.G. won third place in the Miss Korea Pageant. yeah, that's number 3 out of ALL the women in the entire nation of south Koh-Ree-Ah, emigrants included. mm-hm. that oughta put things in perspective.  anyway, the high school years were easy on me, cuz i didn't go to the same school as P.A.G., and even college was okay, when we did go to the same school, because the campus was big enough so that i rarely saw her, and was therefore not constantly reminded of her otherworldy beauty. but law school...well, remember this:  asian women:   49  asian men:     29   so the presence of P.A.G. at  my  law school would be nothing less than catastrophic.  i guess there comes a time in everyone's life when one is confronted by such a menacing threat to one's livelihood that one barely has to time think before the fight-or-flight response kicks in, a biological defense mechanism that gives one an oppportunity to survive beyond the challenge that one is facing. an example would be when one is about to be sprung upon and torn to bloody shreds by a ferocious mountain lion...or when one comes face-to-face with her nemesis in the netherworld of uber-superficiality...  well, the fight-or-flight response manifested itself in my dream by manipulating P.A.G.'s face so that she had sallow skin and undereye bags. it wasn't much, but the minor facial reconstruction allowed me to be happy again, and i even considered allowing her to be my friend.  so in my dream, me and my new best friend, the uglified P.A.G., linked arms and ventured outdoors. we crossed a wide concrete road, easily dodging the sparse traffic, and immediately came upon a bulletin board planted on the precipice of a cliff at the other side of the road. an asian girl was standing before it and stapling some flyers onto the board. she had her back to us, and when i tapped her shoulder, she turned around, and...brace yourselves...it was P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. again! "what da??" you say. "i know!!" i say. it was P.A.G.  double-time : i look to my left, P.A.G. I, the de-prettied version; i look to my right, lo and behold, P.A.G. II,  in her finest form : sparkling smile, twinkling eyes, svelte figure, picture perfect.   this is when i shrieked like a hienna in my sub-sub-conscious. maybe out loud in my sleep.  "hey laura," she says sweetly, innocuously. "i decided to come to cornell law school too."  more shrieking. possibly even some rabid salivating.  "oh, and i'm running for student body spokesmodel. don't forget to vote okay?"  spokesmodel...like a liz hurley for estee lauder...??   "okay, gotta run. let's get lunch together sometime okay??" and just as she finishes her last sentence and steps into the road, a big rig comes roaring towards her outta nowhere. P.A.G. II instinctively draws back just in time to avoid being crushed by the vehicle (fight-or-flight: check), but in doing so, loses her balance and topples backwards (fight-or-flight: n/a)...in slow-mo...over the precipice...off the cliff...disappearing into the dark abyss, forever.  End.   naturally, my first thought upon waking was, "do i need to seek professional help????" i mean, what kinda sicko dreams up a deranged scenario like that?? i dunno. do you?  i recounted this dream to S today, and she brought up an interesting point: if you were P.A.G., how would you feel if you found out that someone had this kind of dream about you? flattered? frightened?  after much deliberation, S and I came to the unanimous verdict that, if we were to be P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. III & IV, we'd be unduly flattered to our wits' end, like, totally.  End II.

      hello. i'm back. i'm tired. i'll write more later, supplemented w/ pix too. i'm pretty sure i know which school i want to go to now after my trip. in a nutshell, here are my thoughts on the schools i visited these past few days:  northwestern: perfect location. a five minute walk from chicago's magnificent mile with a lakeside view. what more could a girl ask for? oddly enough, it just didn't feel right to me. the proverbial "click" didn't happen. it's the kind of school that, and bear in mind this is just my personal opinion so nobody get all belligerent or anything, says "please come in! but don't stay long."  dowtown chicago, btw, is awesome. tall buildings, amazingly clean, great public transportation system, and tulips everywhere!! love the location, not the school...  u of chicago: love the school, hate the location. southside chicago is what i'd call freaky-dickey. my mom and i were freaked out walking on the streets there in broad daylight. walking around past dark is basically suicide, even on campus. the surrounding area is as ghetto as it gets, and i now know that i'd never seen ghetto until i saw southside chicago. a damn shame cuz the campus itself is beatiful. i'm all up for new experiences, but i just can't imagine living in constant fear and incarcerating myself to the law school like that for three whole years...  u of michigan: has a very collegial feel to it. the law quad is the most beautiful place on campus. it's also very old. very. old. the res halls have a musty odor and communal, as opposed to private, baths. it was either that or the obese squirrels that did it in for me. seriously. ppl need to stop feeding those damn critters!!  okay. so having eliminated pretty much all the schools that i was seriously considering before my trip, based on the important criteria that you witnessed above, i'm back to my original first choice, that being cornell. i've always had a gut instinct that this was The One, and my gut instinct has rarely failed me (pls refer back to all my reality show predictions). it's funny cuz my mom said i'm picking the school just like i would a boyfriend, which is probably not far from the truth. anyway, now i just have to seal the deal with a visit, and sell my choice to el padres, aka...the Vault. man, that's gonna be one tough battle...  i need my sleep. g'nite y'all.

      i can't sleep. travelling is stressful...especially with a parent. over the course of the day, i've been asked to confirm the placement of my ID card, plane ticket, hotel confirmation, and extra cash (a whopping 15 bucks! quick, somebody get me a safe with extra padlocks!) about a ka-jillion times, to the gad-zillionth degree. i'm trying to be very zen about the whole thing, but one can only take so much before falling off the brink of sanity.  i found out today that i got into cornell. it's been my first choice ever since i got this law school idea stuck in my head. for a while, cornell was all i could talk about, and my close friends (poor things) will readily attest to my unhealthy fixation. i literally carried the school's admissions brochure with me everywhere, and i mean E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E, busting it out at luncheons, dinner parties, birthday parties, whenever and wherever it was deemed most inappropriate. i was so obsessed that i'd take the virtual campus tour on the cornell website every single night before going to bed. that's how badly i wanted to go to cornell law school. and nobody understood why. not even me.  naturally, i was pretty happy when i read the acceptance email. i immediately started having these visions of myself strolling across the lush hills and quaint bridges with breathtaking views of the town's many gorges and waterfalls...or reading a victorian novel while floating idly in a canoe over lake whats-its-name. somewhere in these idyllic scenes, i think i was also being serenaded by the birds singing overhead: tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet. but then it occurred to me that i'd probably have to go to class sometime, so i looked up some stats on the actual school, which i'd never done before, and i swear to gawd this was the first thing my eyes landed on:    Racial Composition of First Year Class . . . Asian Men:  29  Asian Women:  49  . . .   well. that's that. hola chicago and adios ithaca.    juuuuust kidding! :)   (not really...)

      whoa, i can't believe i almost forgot what a momentous occassion tomorrow is. Tomorrow, May 3rd, is a day of celebration that marks the birth of someone who is very special to me. he's not only smart, handsome, and loyal, but has also changed my life in more ways than one. ladies and gents, tomorrow, May 3rd, is the birthday of my beloved firstborn dog/reticent philosopher/king of the backyard, Theodore (Teddy) Ch-Zhang.   oh yeah. and it's benchu's birthday too.   hehehe...  well well well, what can i say about my good friend benchu that won't get me in a crapload of trouble...i'm sure he expects something nice (easier said than done).    hm......        hmmmmmm...........................            hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................                 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................................                          hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................................     oh okay, i know...hehe...  benchu has a very lovely girlfriend. they've been going out ever since dinosaurs roamed the earth. this shows that benchu is very loyal and possibly,  possibly  even loving, but that's not my point.   i remember this one picture that benchu took with his girlfriend. the rest of us saw it and noticed a striking resemblance between the two (nothing personal christine). we couldn't figure out whether they looked alike to begin with, or whether this was the terrible fate that would befall anyone who spends a lotta face-to-face time with benchu. as you can imagine, all of us were terribly disturbed by the possibility of the latter, and i for one, was not willing to take my chances.  this is why i don't see much of benchu anymore. but even so, i still consider benchu to be one of my truest friends, someone i know i can always rely on and whose input i respect a heck of a lot. that is, when he's not too busy abusing me. okay. the end.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY "UGLY"! :)   p.s. i think i did a pretty good job of writing a fair and positive tribute, but just to be safe, i'm fleeing the westcoast for the next three days. if y'all don't hear from me by the weekend, you'll know who was responsible....

      today is my mom's 50th bday. we spent most of the day shopping at the mall, where she bought me a lovely set of earrings and the most adorable pink tweed coat.  we also watched 13 going on 30 and ate spicy cheese nachos. the movie turned out to be a lot better than i expected, and both of us enjoyed it a lot. afterwards, we came home to pick my dad up for dinner. that's when we gave my mom her bday gift. i will never forget the stunned look on her face; it was absolutely priceless. then we went to dinner at my favorite chinese restaurant and shared a sumptuous meal fit for three emperors. then we went for a walk in the park and now i'm here. man...what a great day. i wish everyday could be my mom's birthday.   currently playing: 50 cent -  urlLink In da Club

      woohoo for me (boohoo for you), i'm leaving in six weeks! it's a lot earlier than expected, but i'm attending the Academic Orientation Program that starts a whole week earlier than the regular orientation. if i understand correctly, it's only for minorities and essentially gives us a head start on moving in and getting acquainted with the school and each other. the school also provides a small but thoughtful stipend for the extra week's living expenses. anyway, i figure it'll give me the much needed extra time to get organized and figure out a way to squeeze my nine trunks of clothes into a five-person suite. i'll also be able to show my dad at a leisurely pace all the beauty and wonders of "gorge-ous" ithaca (can't take credit for that one; it's printed on their postcards and tourist tees).   incidentally, i attended my friend's bday fiesta last week at garden of eden and met a totally random person who graduated from cu. now i'd like to consider a myself a very rational person, even when circumstance proves otherwise, but i have to admit a weakness for believing in the potency of Signs. for instance, i read a long time ago in one of those corny young adult books that the person you're "meant to be with" has to have the same number of letters in their first name as you do. what that means for me, L-A-U-R-A, is that the guy has to have a name comprised of exactly five letters, no more, no less. and believe it or not, it's the first thing that runs through my head everytime i meet someone new. i know, it makes no scientific sense. but hey, some people pull on straw wrappers, others consult eight-balls, i count names...on top of all that other stuff. anyway, what was my point...oh right, so i'm saying of all the ppl at the club that night, i just happend to meet someone who went to cu, and i'd recently decided to go to cu, so it's a definite Sign that cu is where i'm cosmically meant be, you follow? so now i'm doubly comforted about my decision. um, yeah, i think that's all i have to share. this is why i don't blog much anymore. oh, and that cu guy only had four letters to his name, so it was a no-go from the get-go.

      i think a gypsy put a curse on me.  last thursday, jyk and i were doing some window-shopping in west hollywood when we passed by a little house in the middle of a commercial street. the handwritten sign in the window read as follows:   FORTUNE-TELLING: Palm Reading Character Reading Tarot Reading and More...   after declaring our complete disbelief in such hocus-pocus, we decided to step inside to see what kind of information we could get for $5. just for fun.  i was pretty disappointed upon entering. the small "consultation" area was stifling in size and minimally furnished with two wicker couches and an eyesore of a coffee table. the bare walls further accentuated the undone and unwelcoming ambience of the room. worst of all, the plain woman that greeted us didn't resemble anything close to what i'd imagined a fortune-teller would look like: no purple eyeshadow, no fancy headdress, and definitely not a crystal ball in sight.   after a quick inquiry, we learned that a character reading, ie, being told what kind of personalities we have, alone costs $10, and that being told what our past and present contain costs $15. well who the heck needs a stranger to tell them any of that?? we started inching our way towards the exit, a bit too apologetically. "what do you want to know then?" the fortune-teller persisted, fishing for some potential weakness in her prey. um, the future? "$20 covers past present AND future," she said, like only a dumbass would pass up on such a great deal. "er...we'll, um, think about it and come back," i, the dumbass, responded. and just as i was about to follow jyk out the door, the gypsy woman caught my eyes and said, "i can already see that there are two ppl for you: one from your past and one from your present!"   well, that did it for me brother. 1 past + 1 present => 2 future?? what a bunch of bologna! it was quite obvious to me that the lady earned her living as a thick-skinned charlatan, and i walked away not planning to give the meeting a second thought.  so that was last thursday. i've not only NOT been able to sleep until the crack of dawn since saturday, but have also been bombarded by the most disturbing feelings/thoughts and dreams. not that i believe in any of that stuff, but...do you think the gypsy cursed me?? i knew that she knew that i was lying when i said that we were gonna go back. and she didn't look so happy when we turned to go, noooo she didn't....  have you guys seen that stephen king movie "thinner"?? 'member that old man with the gi-normous [moooooooooooooleymoooooooooooooley]mole?? *shudder* anyway, my point is, mad gypsies = no good.  alright ppl. i initally wrote this entry for your entertainment and cuz i couldn't sleep but now i'm really scaring myself cuz i'm a big chicken. so the moral of today's story is to not hang out with  urlLink jyk . i go to bed now. buhbye.

      can't sleep. haven't been able to sleep for the past two, three nights. so here i am. hello.  this blog feels foreign. like i left it out to dry for too long and it's become hardened and resistant. so now we have to get reacquainted.   i got my first homework assignment in the mail. i was pleasantly surprised when a book fell outta the package. then i saw that it was something written by kafka titled "the trial." this is a bad bad omen, i said to myself.   see, in my freshman year of college, i had to read one's of kafka's short stories called "the hunger artist." it was about this guy who put himself in a cage on display so that ppl would come see him  not  eat. so he's sitting in this cage as part of a circus, not eating, and ppl bring their kids and point and laugh at him out of curiousity and wonder, and i guess this somehow substantiates the guy's existence to himself, and in turn makes him all the more determined to not eat, but it's ironic because what's confirming his life to him, ie, the attention, is also taking the life out of him. anyway, i practically went outta my mind trying to cough up a decent essay. why, why did he do it?? (i think i just answered that in my summary above...so i dunno if i was just stupid back then or what.) the whole night that i stayed up writing my paper i couldn't stop cursing the stupid starving freakazoid, and i hated kafka for writing a story that i just didn't get.   i think part of the problem was that the professor wanted us to come up with our own prompt. it's a lot tougher than it seems, not having a question to answer; it's what i'd imagine being lost at sea without a compass feels like, or trying to find a needle in a haystack, but not knowing what a needle is or looks like or how it's different from a piece of hay. it wasn't until this exercise that i realized the questions that we're given usually contain the keys to the answers. anyway, ever since then, i vowed never to read kafka again, or anything remotely existentialist in nature. but now i gotta break my vow to myself that i almost forgot about, and what's more, it's for work that i'm getting before school's even started.  i'm on page 23 of the book. it's been a long four days.

      hello. i promise to make a serious effort to blog regularly once school starts, but for now, as these halcyon days draw to a pitiable close...i'm just too damn lazy.  i saw f9/11 today. i had some reservations about watching it. i already knew my exact sentiments about the war and gwb, and i didn't feel like jumping on the bandwagon to support sheer propaganda and blatant bush-bashing. well, the film ended up justifying the attention and critical accolade it's garnered so far, at least in my opinion. yes, it's biased, but what isn't? and yes, it lampoons the president without a hint of self-restraint, but it also contains some sobering images and elements that everyone needs to see, or at least be aware of.   marlon brando's passing yesterday finally galvanized me to read a streetcar named desire. i mention this because i've owned the book for years now and never once had the desire to read it until i was enlightened by several tv programs yesterday that marlon brando was "one of the most influential actors of his time," and one of his most famous roles was the barbaric stanley kowalski in a streetcar named desire. if it hadn't been for his death, the only interest i ever took in marlon brando was watching on the waterfront with tepid interest and of course, the godfather. my point is, ppl sure do get a lot of attention and honor post mortem. the real tragedy, it seems to me, is that they're too dead to bask in it. well friends, i'd like to change all that. for starters, you don't have to wait until i'm dead to honor me. i think you should be allowed to honor and appreciate me as much as you want, whenever you want. this way, when i'm really good and dead, you won't have any regrets about not having said just how much you liked me while i was alive. i think it's a great idea.  oh, and have your beautiful selves a happy and safe independence day!

      the last entry has been taken down b/c jyk said that none of us looked so hot in the pix. what a blow to my fragile ego; i only put them up cuz i thought i looked rather decent.  today has been a miraculously productive day. i was a packing fiend throughout the  morning and the majority of the afternoon, and most of my stuff is now ready to be shipped. i also briefed a case that i'm supposed to mail to one of my professors and have her revise for orientation. i've never briefed a case before. in fact, i didn't know what i was doing at all; but i must have done a truly decent job, because each word i wrote felt like a golden nugget of smartness descending celestially onto paper, and i could hardly get over myself.      this book good. you read and have smart. like me.
