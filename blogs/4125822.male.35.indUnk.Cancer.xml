      You know what the worst thing about Friday is? It doesn't start at 5 pm. The  urlLink Altercation blog  has Slacker Fridays. Since I don't have any readership - yet, I can't sit back and wait for people to contribute. I thought Fridays would be a good day to write nice, happy thoughts. I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that I'm an angry, bitter person. I'd like to use my Happy Friday post to talk about people I admire:    Bill Clinton&#8212;My favorite President. The Republicans really missed a great opportunity with Clinton, a true moderate. But then, he got the country going in the right direction without their help. If he had only been more liberal...   Barack Obama&#8212;The future is now. His speech at the Democratic Convention was...indescribable. I have a little crisis in thinking. Will it be fair to John Edwards in eight years to have to go up against a Clinton/Obama ticket? I'm a little torn. Kerry/Edwards for eight, Clinton/Obama for eight, Obama/? for another eight&#8212;I'm going to be an old man by the time this is done.   John Kerry&#8212;Help is on the way! Am I being a conservative when I think back to an earlier time and hope to see those days come again&#8212;like four years ago?  No, thats no being bitter or angry, it's being hopeful.    Howard Dean&#8212;Gave the Democrats balls. Democrats are talking about a trifecta (Prez, House, and Senate). OK, maybe it doesn't happen, but before Democrats stopped being a bunch of weenies, that wasn't even worth thinking about.   Al Franken&#8212;The books were great.  urlLink Air America radio  is better. If only we could get a local station to pick it up since I can't listen to the online streaming broadcast as our DSL is barely better than dialup at work, but I'm neither bitter nor angry.   Michael Moore&#8212;I'm not always sure of the details, but the message is right on target.

      There are fiscal conservatives and then there are social consevatives. Ultra-conservatives tend to gravitate towards social issues. Ultra-conservatives see themselves as traditionalists. They nostalgically think back to a golden age when women and minorities knew their places. Remember Trent Lott's  urlLink praise of Strom Thurmond ? How about Bob Barr's idea of the  urlLink Real America ? Here's a clue, if the person speaks passionately about "states rights," they oppose civil rights.  Alan Keyes is an ultra-conservative. His basic tenet is that, through hard work, anyone can overcome any obstacle placed before them, and that is within the power of all Americans to do so. And then there's the whole national sales tax thing, abolishing the separation between church and state (or whatever). Well you can  urlLink read  it for yourselves.  Will Illinois consevatives vote for Alan Keyes? Which demographic (really, which subset of a demographic) is Alan Keyes hoping to draw from in Illinois? I'm sorry, it just doesn't exist in any numbers. Alan Keyes could not win even if Katherine Harris were responsible for counting the votes. Where is the money coming from for this race? The RNC is not throwing money away this year.  Alan Keyes believes that Barack Obama is out of touch with the people of Illinois. And, Alan Keyes should know. . .because he lives in Maryland. Keyes opposed Hilary Clinton's run for the Senate, because she was not from New York.  urlLink ArchPundit  has the Keyes quote,  I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton’s willingness go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it.  Somehow, I guess, this is completely different.

      There, I've said it. I don't like Missouri. The last time I was in Missouri I was harrassed by a security guard at the Holiday Inn in Lake of the Ozarks with a fondness for racial slurs. As a child my family would travel to Six Flags in St. Louis, which wasn't so bad, but I'm not much for roller coasters and stuff. Missouri gave us John Ashcroft - the bastard. Now Missouri gives us their version of a  urlLink constitutional ban on gay marriage . Seventy-some percent of Missouri voters approved the amendment.  Missouri, if you're going to take a big dump on your constitution, why have one? (I'm sorry, I had trouble deciding between wipe your butts with it, or take a big dump.) I don't think discrimination should be written into our country's constitution, our state's constitution, or our city's charters. Discrimination should be left in the jurisdiction of small minded people getting together for a beer, at the local tavern that displays the Confederate flag.  Marriage is a religious function, pure and simple. To the government, every marriage is a civil union. It's a contract, a business partnership. Let the government collect their tax revenue from unions, and let the churches do as they please. If a church doesn't want to marry a "non-traditional" couple, I think they have every right to refuse under the First Amendment. However, if a church gives it's blessing, more power to them.  In short, marriage is not a federal, state, or local decision, it's a personal decision between two people in love. Sounds easy to me.

      Ok, that's not really news. Anyway, between  urlLink iffy accounting practices  and  urlLink dealing with nations on the terrorist watch list  during his tenure as CEO of Halliburton, is there any doubt that Cheney is a crook?  Did I mention that the Bush's campaign attacks on Edward's and Kerry's qualifications is laughable considering Bush's business record and lack of any real power as governor of Texas, and apparently  urlLink Cheney's stint in Congress  was rather forgettable. Didn't he only sponsor one or two measure (of no real value) that actually passed?  The Bushies don't really care about what they say (or do). They rely on the American public to forget about it.    What WMDs?   Exactly how many bodies did they find in mass graves in Iraq? And, how many were there because Bush 1 didn't follow up on his promise to back a coup?   Did they ever catch the Anthrax guy?   Who outted Valerie Plame?   Did they ever apologize about making up the story about how the Clinton administration trashed everything before they left?   How about rewriting the EPA air quality report for New York following 9/11, or any other scientific finding at odds with the official administration line?   What did Bush do while he was AWOL?    I'll come up with some more later with links.

      So what is my second passion? Chicago sports! Let me go on record as saying that acquiring Nomar Garciaparra is one of the greatest events in Cubs history. We are truly blessed to be witnessing 4 future hall of famers on the field for the Cubs (Sosa, Maddux, Alou, and Garciaparra). Anything less than a World Series Championship will be a disappointment.  As far as the Bulls go. . .why trade Jamal Crawford? Crawford is the only proven scorer on the whole team. Now granted, being an Illinois transplant, I wouldn't mind seeing Frank Williams come over from the NY Knicks in a trade, but I still think Crawford is future all star. I got a few names to throw out - Miller, Brand, Artest, Hassell. The Bulls have been too quick to discard developing talent.  I'm not sure what to say about the Bears yet. I'm excited about what the future may bring, but there are just too many unknowns. And, by that, I mean unknown unknowns as opposed to known unknowns or unknown knowns, but I digress.

      I came across an article on  urlLink Eschaton  on Michelle Malkin's new book   In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror  .  Go to Michelle Malkin's  urlLink website  and it shouldn't take any time to figure that there is something seriously wrong with Michelle Malkin. I'm not saying that all Asian Americans should have the same belief structure. I am saying that there is  NO  defense for internment or racial profiling, especially coming from an Asian American.  Michelle, if you hate who you are so much, I recommend cosmetic surgery. Get in touch with Michael Jackson's people. They should be able to point you in the right direction. I can just imagine it, little Michelle Malkin would have ridden her tricycle up to the gates of Manzanar to turn herself in. "I'm sorry little girl," the guards would apologize, "we're only locking up the Japs today." To this little Michelle Malkin would cry out, "But look at me. I could pass for a Jap. I'm a threat to national security. Look at the busload over there, you've got other women and children. Take me please."  If anyone has a clue as what is wrong with Michelle Malkin, I'd love to hear comments.

      I've been readings blogs for the past year or so, and I'd always thought that it would be great to have a chance to give my 2 cents. For lack of a better title, I decided on  Dis Dat And Da Utter Ting .  So what is it that I feel the desperate need to share with everyone else? First, W's got to go. So does that make me a Bush hater? I'd rather think that I love my country enough to hope that we can pull out of the downward spiral that is the Bush legacy.  I'm not sure what the Republican's fascination with traitorous morons is. Reagan and Bush 1 had Iran Contra. Bush 2 was generous enough to give a bunch of them jobs. The thing is, if you ask a right winger about Iran Contra, it pretty much never happened in their minds. Keep in mind that Reagan and Bush funded and armed Iranian "fundamentalists", Saddam Hussein, AND Osama Bin Laden. Oh, I forgot to mention their pet South American death squads project. They sure knew how to pick 'em, didn't they?  Back to my point. . .is Bush 2 a traitor? Well, I'd say he is traitorous. Actually I already described him as a traitorous moron. Is he a liar, a pathological liar, or too stupid to know the diference? Yes, yes, and unfortunately - yes. The thing is, I believe that the Impostor and Cheat realizes that the facts do not back up his assertions, however; in his simplistic mind the end will justify the means. W wanted/needed to justify his and Cheney's, Rumsfeld's, Wolfowitz's, Perle's, Libby's, and Condi's desire to assert American might so badly that I believe he talked himself into believing his own crap. So what does that make him? A liar, a pathological liar, or too stupid to know the difference.  So, to be a traitor, one must sell out their country. Who did W sell America out to? The answer is his own greed. Bush and Bushies will make a buttload of money off of Afghanistan and Iraq. Was this the primary reason for going to war? Actually, I don't think so. Let's just call it a bonus.

      Alan Keyes says he'd like to go back to the appointment of U.S. Senators by state legislatures. He feels that the 1913 change upsets the sovereignty of state governments in federal representation. What Keyes says sounds almost resonable.  Here's why I disagree. If we look at the reactionary pace of House proceedings and compare that to the deliberate course of the Senate, you can see a wide contrast. This is a form of check and balances. The House members represent a match smaller, and usually more homogenous constiuency. No one would argue that the House is much more partisan than the Senate. If state legislature appointed their Senator, this appointment would be made, in effect, by the ruling state political party. And really, by the national political party.  Following this line of thought, the Senator would be even less representative of the state's sovereignty and even more a mouth-piece for national politics. Yes, Alan Keyes is crazy. Yes, it's easier to decipher Nostrodamus than Alan Keyes. And yes, I like picking on him. But, does he have to make it so easy?

      Including myself, my readership may be up to four. I'm not claiming regular readership, just someone may have stumbled across my blog. In other words, my readership has exploded 400%. If we interpolate for the year (experiencing the same level of weekly exponential growth), my readership should reach 1.3x10^33, giving me a higher market share than all news sources, over the course of human history, combined. I am truly humbled by the magnitude of this responsibility, and burden.

      Alan Keyes  urlLink burst into song  for CBS 2 Chicago. Keyes evidently studied music at some New England Consevatory and considered a career in music (opera). After hearing him sing "Somewhere Over the Raindow," I'm not sure what to say. I can't tell him to stick to his day job (politics), but I can honestly say he made the right decision not to go into music.

      Richard Shelby, R-Alabama has retained the services of a lawyer to defend himself against ethics charges on  urlLink leaking intercepted terrorist conversations . Bad news is that the Justice Department doesn't take national security too seriously. Referring the charges to the ethics panel means that charges will most likely not be levelled against Shelby.  Let's summarizes:    Sandy Berger—oh yeah, they'll go after him   Condi Rice—blew covert operative cover, not a problem   Cheny, Wolfowitz, Perle, Libby, and/or Feith—Valerie Plame probably had it coming    Of course, Dubya's pick for CIA director, Porter Goss doesn't feel the Valerie Plame thing is a big deal. Apparently, since no ones personally delivered to him the perpetrator, the motive, and the ability to commit the crime, it's  urlLink really not worthy of a criminal investigation . I'm glad Porter Goss does not work in criminal investigation. Nor should he in the future.  On a completely different note, Senator Kerry please stop talking about your vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq. You made a mistake then, if you'd still vote for it, knowing what you know now, then you're going to lose a lot of voters. Unless you know what's in store for the coming October surprise, and it has something to do with finding WMDs, this is just a bad position to be taking.

      I've been too busy to post today, so let's try something different. George Bush's idea of "Compassionate Conservatism" is neither compassionate nor conservative. Talk amongst yourselves.  I know. . .I'm sure it's been done before, I'm just really busy. If it's too cliche, how about a different subject: How can Porter Goss head the CIA while his lips are firmly planted on Dick Cheney's butt? There, talk amongst yourselves.

      Alan Keyes compared Barack Obama's stance on reproductive rights to a " urlLink slaveholder position ." Here's Keyes quote,  I would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence. . .has broken and rejected those principles he has taken the slaveholder's position.  Hey buddy, if it were up to the late Strom Thurmond and like minded Trent Lott (and many more conservatives), you would still be picking cotton. I have no idea what Keyes is saying, but I'm not sure he does either. It would be a waste of time for Obama to spend time defending himself against this nutjob. The Illinois GOP is already regretting its decision, I'm sure.

      Let the implosion begin! The Bush administration is starting to crumble.    Judge begins  urlLink contempt of court proceedings  against journalists covering for Valeria Plame leaker. I have mixed feelings about this. Without the guarantee of confidentiality, will the press be hobbled? Then again, the press shouldn't aid and abet criminals.   Condi  urlLink blows terrorist double-agent cover  . Al Franken needs to write a new book on the Bush Administration,   Leaks and the Leaking Leakers Who Tell Them    Rumsfeld might be implicated in a  urlLink report on Abu Gharaib  . It's not new news, but at least it'll make it official. I wish people would pay attention to this stuff. Keep in mind that the CIA had different instructions than the military.  Bush  urlLink misspeaks , and  urlLink again  . He's lived up to the nation's low expectations. Way to go ~49% of American's that actually voted for this moron.   urlLink Arrest warrants issued  for Ahmad Chalabi and nephew, Salem. Ahmad has a new arrest warrant out for counterfeiting to go along with his arrest warrant for  urlLink embezzlement  in Jordan. Salem is alledgedly connected to a murder. Ahmad Chalbi is, of course, the man who  urlLink supplied corroborating witnesses  to W in his case for war. It turns out the "intelligence" was fabricated, but W and friends already new that.

      Michelle Malkin looks very different from Ann Coulter, but I swear they're the same person. I heard about Michelle's appearance on Hardball, so I had to see it myself. Michelle Malkin accuses Sen. Kerry of purposely injuring himself to get out of Vietnam, to get medals, and/or further his future political career. I have to congratulate Chris Matthews for putting an end to it. Chris put Larry Thurlow on the spot as well. The biggest problem is that some people are listening. This stuff is actually working.

      "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength." Is "Swift Boat Vets for Truth" anything like "Fair and Balanced" or "Compassionate Conservative?" I used to think Aldous Huxley was closer to the truth, things are definitely swinging Orwell's way. Here's a  urlLink link  to the newest proven liar of SBVT.

      Since I'm always calling Bush - Dubya, I was wondering why the rest of the Bush crew don't have appropriate nicknames too. So I propose to name them.    John Ashcroft could become Boner (it's funny on a couple levels. Remember John covering up the liberty statue? Sounds like he has some sexual fixations. Plus Boner could suggest he's a screw-up).   Rumsfeld would be renamed Goober. Please see the  urlLink urbandictionary  for various meanings.   Tom Ridge might be named Skeeter (every good ol' boy network needs a Skeeter).   Doug Feith would become Dawg or Hound Dawg (keeping with the good ol' boy theme).   Condi Rice would simply be Candy or Shug (see Condi sounds like Candy, which is sweet because of sugar, thus Shug. Condi is a bitter bitter person. See the irony?).   Dick Cheney would remain Dick (no irony there).    I'm not that up on rural nicknames, so I could use some help. Anyway, it's something to think about.

      I live in Indianapolis, IN. It's a great town; not too crowded, all the amenities. So the governor's race is between the quasi-incumbent Joe Kernan (took over when Governor O'Bannon died) and the Bush's coattails-rider Mitch Daniels. I'm not sure why anyone would ride Bush's coattails. But then, Mitch was instrumental in the collapse of our (U.S. economy, not Indiana's) as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The news is that My Man Mitch was arrested for selling marijuana and LSD. He was convicted for possession of marijuana, or something. I'm probably getting some of the details wrong, but I tend to pay more attention to national politics instead of local. I don't know that Mitch has run as a Bill Bennet kind of Republican, so I'm not calling him a hypocrite. It is funny that Mitch was employed by a major pharmaceutical company, though. Anyway, it ends up that Joe Kernan had a thing for the chronic when he was in his twenties, as well. So really this is a non-issue in the campaign.  I have to wonder about Mitch's time in the Bush administration. With Mitch, Dubya, and Dick all, at one time or another, having had some degree of chemical dependencies, was Laura always having to watch them so they wouldn't get into trouble? Did they hold AA meetings in the Oval Office? Did Mitch and Dubya sneak off to the Lincoln Bedroom for a toke?  Does My Man Mitch ever have flashbacks from the LSD? Dunno, he doesn't have any flashbacks about Vietnam, though, as he took advantage of student and health deferments (and a high draft number). Kernan was a Navy pilot shot down over Vietnam and spent 11 months as a POW. Military service should not be a deciding factor in electing officials. It's just funny how well Mitch fit in with the rest of the Bushies. Why does the Republican party get so much credit for patriotism?  The pillars of the Daniels campaign are Integrity, Health Care, Jobs, State Government Reform, and Education. Let's take these in order.    Integrity-My Man Mitch wants to end fraud and corruption. Where was he for MCI Worldcom, Enron, and the sweet contracts that went to Hallibuton and Bechtel?   Health Care-Mitch worked for Eli Lilly, sounds like a conflict of interest? No way he's going to help with the rising cost of health care.   Jobs-Yeah, nice job destroying the economy and losing jobs. Mitch might be able to give advice on what not to do in order to grow the economy.   Government Reform-The Republicans typically want to starve social programs, but Mitch worked for the Bush administration. I guess the government might explode in size under Mitch. Too much or too little is not the answer.   Education-Can you say unfunded mandate? Leave No Child Left Behind must mean something different to conservatives.    OK, I'm done ranting for now. If I'm way off base on anything, I apologize; but then, you came here for my opinion. It's time for bed. . .later.

      I don't have anything to add today. I did buy a new game for my computer, though. It's called   The Political Machine   from Ubisoft. I am glad to report that in my first attempt, Kerry/Edwards easily trounced Bush/Cheney. In my second game, the behemoth combination of Hilary/Bill didn't even break a sweat against Condi and someone, I don't remember who the other loser was. It's an ok game, I guess. I think the biggest complaint that I have is that it doesn't require that much thought on issues. You just need to pander to the electorate in major states. Oh well, maybe I will have something more for you tomorrow.

      I'm being overdramatic with the title. I'm talking about U.S. basketball and their recent  urlLink defeats at the hands of Puerto Rico  and Italy, and their horrible outings in the World Championships. The World Championships were supposed to be a wake-up call to U.S. basketball. . .they weren't. The loss to Italy was supposed to be a wake-up call to U.S. basketball. . .it wasn't. The loss to Puerto Rico might be something more. This recent loss may be a slap in U.S. basketball's face with the realization that, while we may produce the most athletic, high-flying players in the game, we may no longer produce the best basketball players. Which brings me back to Larry Bird's ill-conceived lament about the  urlLink decline of white players in the NBA . There are plenty of white players in the NBA. There are even quite a few good white players in the NBA. What Larry Bird should have said. . .well actually Larry should have kept his mouth shut. Larry needs to start being concerned that the NBA draft will leave out all Americans, and not just white Americans.
