      Sorry...I can't resist these things:   urlLink      urlLink Which Sex and the City Player Are You?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty    You're upbeat, insightful, effervescent and imaginative.   Sometimes a little too imaginative... You're all about the subtext, about what's going on between the lines. You very rarely take anything at face-value.   You also have a tendancy to be a little neurotic and self-absorbed, and fall for guys who are either (for the most part) emotionally unattainable or completely wrong for you.   That's okay, though, everyone loves you anyway. You're very well-liked. You always have a shoulder for your friends to cry on or an ear for them to gossip in. High-profile and fun, you're the life of the party.   Carrie quotes:  "You can't make friends with a squirrel. Squirrels are just rats with cuter outfits."   "I'm thinking balls are to men, what purses are to women. It's just a little bag but we'd feel naked in public without it."   "The only thing I've ever successfully made in the kitchen is a mess. And several small fires."

       Current Song: The Starting Line- Break Up Day   Hah...I'm reading the best blog ever. It has a bunch of thoughts, and they're all really amusing. Here are some of my favorites: *Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No wait... not me, you. *The face of a person can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face. *I wonder why people do drugs. I mean if everyone wants to feel good, why can't we all just have sex? *I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it at all. *Why do shops have a sign on the door 'Guide dogs only'. Who is supposed to read it? The dog? *Why do people say, "If only I had a nickel for everytime I heard that". Why not say, "I wish I had 1 billion dollars for everytime I heard that." Think about it, which way do you make more money? *Bums have great lives. They get drunk, and stagger around town asking people for money. Free money while your drunk! How great is that? So why do people feel bad for them? *Take the time to go out and appreciate life. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, taking all your things. *We saw a young boy who got splashed by a mud puddle on the way to school. Driving away, we saw him wondering if he should go home and change, but be late for school, or go to school the way he was with dirt all over him drenched in dirty, mud water. Well, while he tried to decide, we drove by and splashed him again to give him a little incentive. *I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it. *Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door. *I hope that someday we will be able to put away our fears and prejudices and just laugh at people.  alright...I think that will be enough...haha.

       Current Song: The Promise Ring- Happiness Is All The Rage   Well...I felt like posting yet again..for no reason. Nothing to say. No quizzes to put up. Nope...just a pointless post. I've had a few inspirations to write poems today, but I'm having trouble getting them to flow right. I want to go shopping. Sadly enough, the mall is closed by now. Oh, and I just remembered I have to work tomorrow! This sucks! I need a change of scene...everything is so monotonous. But I think school will, unfortunately, change that. I was hoping for another change of scene...like a Cali beach or something....ahh...sounds nice...

       Current Song: Third Try- Sad Eyes   Well, I just got done watching Orange County...it's a good movie. I have decided that from now on, I'm letting go. No more useless worrying about everything. Life happens, and I'm sick of trying to mold it into the image I've created in my perfectionistic mind. So there ya go! That's just how it goes! I also want to concentrate more on writing, because for several years, it's the one thing I've been missing. I want to start chasing all the dreams I'd left behind when I got caught up in the hype of trying to be someone that I just wasn't. From now on, I'm going to concentrate on being myself. I just want to go back to being happy all the time...ok, well, how about  most  of the time, alright? I tell myself that I'm going to do that all the time, but I really mean it now. There's just so much that I've left behind...and I need to go back and pick up where I left off. Get rid of all your conceptions and judgements about me now, because they aren't going to do you any good.  Wow...enough of all that...I'm out!

       Current Song: No Use For A Name- Let Me Down   Sheesh...quite a way to start off the day. I didn't sleep at all last night(if you must know, I was having the worst cramps  of my life , and I felt like DYING!), and so this morning, being as retarded as I am, I thought "hey, I can go rollerblading at 7 a.m.! Because, well, you know, that sounds like  so much fun!  So I left at about 7:30, and got back at 9....and I'm really tired. Sheesh...I'm ridiculously out of shape...and cranky. Not to mention I've already had my overdose of Advil for the day. "No more than six a day"...bah...I'm too good for their crazy rules and stuff. Alright...I'm going to...possibly sleep...though now I think it's next to impossible...

       Current Song: Five Iron Frenzy- Every New Day   Just got back from the mall. I went jean shopping...which is such a pain for me. I'm really picky about jeans; I have to find brands that fit PERFECT. Like LEI, Express and Lucky Jeans fit me really well. But Lucky Jeans, for the most part, are too expensive for my liking. I like all my jeans to be low-rise bootcut, because I like them to ride low on my waist and hips, and I think flares look so cheesy. Wow...cheesy? I don't think I've used that word in...ever. Even straight leg jeans aren't that bad, cuz you can roll em up and that's always fun...but why flares? I know, I used to love em in like 6th grade, and they're coming back now, but why?!? Say yes to bootcut! O wow...I'm campaigning jeans...I'm a sad story. HeHe. Well, again I need to find something constructive to do. I might go rollerblading tonight once it cools down...of course if you go too late you can't see a thing...ah well...later yall...

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- Automatic   Well, not much is going on lately. I think I'm gonna go to the mall today. Yay! Shopping! And I've got money, so I'm even happier! Well, I wrote this crazy poem last night...so I guess I'll post it or whatever:  I’m finally content and now I understand My life is becoming so clear It’s like I’m finally able to see the light On the path once carved in fear.  A burden has lifted from my tired back And this feeling is all so great I’m learning now I can trust and love Rather than loathe and hate.  I’ve taken my chances in the game of life I’ve bet everything I can And for a moment it seemed that I’d lost it all But now I’m winning again.  Now I stand in the dawn of a brand new day And I watch the sun rise with a smile The light bathes my soul, and uncovers a heart That I haven’t seen for a while.    Yes, a happy poem! Whoo hoo! Alright, I'm gonna go find something constructive to do.

You make decisions quickly and execute them even quicker. However, somewhere in the back of your mind you're worrying about mundane, sometimes trivial, things... it's not expected of a person like you, and it's actually kind of refreshing.      urlLink which honda are you?  |  urlLink visit high mileage         urlLink See what drug you are.     ...and I may add more as I run into them...

Well, I don't have much else to say...the four hours of Marco Pollo today have tired me out...plus the fact I got 4 hours of sleep last night. Oh, but we played a new rendition of Marco Pollo today...called QMP(Quiet Marco Pollo)...very interesting...haha...

       Current Song: Saves The Day- At Your Funeral   Again, work was a breeze today...didn't really do anything. I really want to go rollerblade right now. I've decided that I am going to go on a diet. I don't know what type of diet yet. But one that works. And it's not that I'm overweight and need to lose the pounds(I'm actually a bit underweight), but I want to get in shape and tone up and stuff. I've decided that I'm going to really stick with this, and it won't just be a two week thing. Hey, maybe I'll join Becka's gym! That'd be fun. And I'll start using my crazy ab roller, and I'll rollerblade a bunch n run a whole lot, and even work on those kickboxing routines. Ahh, the planning...doubtful any of it will ever come to pass...

       Current Song: A New Found Glory- Understatement   I wanted to post some of my poems...because I can. So here they are; enjoy!    This isn’t how it’s supposed to be You shouldn’t be on my mind I’m supposed to be thinking of someone else But still you’re all I find.  Your memory shouldn’t make me smile I shouldn’t see your face I’m not supposed to hear your voice But it’s all so hard to erase.  This isn’t right to reminisce Of how things used to be Getting over you is a winning battle But I’m losing, can’t you see?  This isn’t how it’s supposed to be Your thoughts should be a bore You’ve been gone so long, and this isn’t right I shouldn’t love you anymore.    She’s all alone and the world’s asleep You can’t imagine what it’s like to keep All those feelings she’s stored inside her heart And even in her dreams, they never part.  She’s wrapped up in a world of lies With angry words and hurtful goodbyes And she wonders if people will ever know About the heart she’s afraid to show.  Through all the pain she’ll never admit That yet again, her heart has been hit That heart that once drowned in warmth and gold Day by day, turns dark and cold.  And on this night she stops to think Of how she allowed herself to sink Her heart is clouded with the falling snow Casting out the sunshine she’ll never know.    Well, I figure that I shouldn't bore you too much with any more as of now. If you like, or dislike, let me know, ok? I'll possibly post more later, depending on the response.

And I was like "...she's taunting me...I know it!"...    Current Song: Jimmy Eat World- Sweetness   Well, not much going on right now. I'm really kinda bored, and I'm feeling very energetic and athletic...a strange thing for the same person who has sat around all summer. I will just have to get out and do something today then! Not much else is really going on lately...I'm dreading school starting back up. That is definately no fun. But I get to see everyone, so I guess it isn't so bad.  I like how it's seemingly human nature to be a hypocrite. People contradict themselves so much...that it's absolutely hilarious. Well, that's about all I have to say...

      Ah, well, I thought I would have alot to say, but evidentally I don't anymore. Every time I sign in, I swear, it's like a curse! My mind just goes completely blank. Almost like a stage-fright sort of thing...only not. So much has been running through my mind all day and I'm like "Oh..I'll write about that in my blog." But of course...what do I do? I forget everything that i was previously thinking about. Blogger, you cursed beast you! Heh, anyways...I have the urge to go shopping, but I'm really trying to save up my money...not blow it all. Right, because  I  could really do  that!  It's doubtful. You know...sometimes I wish I was a more personable person. I'm gonna work on that though...something to accomplish before school starts. Speaking of which...may I remind you all we only have two more weeks. Yes. It's very depressing. Another thought: I've realized over the past several years that I seem to have a good understand for most people. I can relate, and sort of see peoples' opinions. I suppose that's a good thing...but it makes it hard for me to debate alot of subject matter, because I can see both sides of the argument, and I'm not always sure where I stand. Bringing me to another point: I wish I could be more firm and decisive in my opinions. I'm a very opinionated person, unfortunately, I often represent contradicting opinions. Does that make me fake or something, or understanding, or just plain confused?  Well, I think I will call it a night pretty soon...I woke up too early this morning...Farewell for now!

      There's one thing that absolutely drives me crazy. It's when people tell me I can't do something, and that I'll never be able to do something, or that I'm not good enough or smart enough or strong enough or daring enough...or anything else. People make stupid judgements about me, and they're just joking around, but it really pisses me off. I mean, if I want to accomplish something, I will. But when people start telling me that there's no way...then I start doing it for the wrong reasons. But it really  PISSES ME OFF  when people do that. They thinks it's sooo damn funny that they're making fun of me based on judgements that they can't back or confirm. But my first instinct is to prove them wrong. So if anyone can figure out what I'm talking about...watch your damn backs, because I'm gonna  prove  you wrong, and shove it up your judgemental little asses!  Thank you, and have a nice day. :-)

      I just got done watching Legally Blonde...I like that movie. And as crazy as this is going to sound, I can relate really well to Elle's character. I mean, she's trying to prove to people that she can be a different person, and that she's not who she comes off to be, and she ends up proving it to herself more than anyone, and not really caring about what everyone else thinks.  I mean, I try to prove that I'm a certain person, or that I act, or dont act, a certain way. And then I realized that it doesn't really matter what people think, and that I'm not gonna quit and go back to the same old person...and that what really matters is that I can prove who I am to myself. So therefore, I  can  be someone different, but not to make a point to anyone. The only person I have to prove anything to is myself.

But it's weird, it doesn't count page views...it counts visitors. So if you view it 200 times in the 30 minutes...it's still one visitor. Crazy, huh? Hmm...well, as most of you know, I've been very bored for the past several weeks...and so I've checked out alot of websites...so I think I'll take some time to list a few of my favorites.

      Don't put your trust in people too quickly...cuz so few of them are actually trustworthy. Kids, believe me on that one. But seriously, it really bugs me when people have to talk behind your back...it's just about the lowest, most immature thing they could do. If people have a problem with me, I'd appreciate it if they came to me about it. A swift kick in the ass would most certainly straighten them out.:-)  Anywho..some crazy people kept calling my cell yesterday. It was slighty amusing for a while...then it was just retarded. Well, I'm gonna get going now. Have fun everyone.

      You know...I realized recently how funny it is that people can deprive themselves of sleep, and then find other alternatives to make up for their loss of energy...anything from power bars, to energy drinks, to energy pills to coffee...People just  thrive  upon finding ways to escape sleep...for whatever reason.  Example:  The other night, I fell asleep at, oh, 3 or 4 a.m., knowing perfectly well that I had to wake up early the next morning. So, at 7, I wake up feeling very tired, but not to a dramatic extent or anything. I go to an eye appointment at 8:15 that lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. On the way home, I pick up a Caramel Frappucino with a power pack(I figured I'd need an extra pick-me-up for the day). I go to work at 10, tire myself out for 4 hours, and head home at 2. I get home, take a shower, and then call a friend about going to the mall. We leave for the mall about 4, and get back at around 7 or 7:30. Then we decide to go to Starbucks(I'm quite exhausted, and I need another pick-me-up to get through the night-- might I add...we walked ). I get an Iced Latte(mmm...), and we head back home. We get back at 8 or 8:30, and then decide to go to the park. By 10, I have no idea why, but I'm skipping and singing around the volleyball court(that really wasnt important, but I figured I'd throw it in anyway). Ok, THAT'S a night. I go home and stay up till all hours of the morning...or until I'm tired enough to actually sleep. The point? People starve themselves of sleep, and then find any other alternative to make up for it.  Shame on you all...

      Well, I am posting again. I haven't been doing much lately...in fact, over the past few hours I was doing what most people would refer to as...well..."nothing". But that's ok, cuz doing "nothing" doesn't really bother me too much. Anyways, I was reading a bunch of random blogs and some of them were...hilarious! There were several that were even more pointless than mine...it made me feel alot better. So...if this doesn't satisfy your need to keep occupied...try reading my other blog:   urlLink It's All So Meaningless...   Well, that's all I have to say for now...have a good evening...party and be crazy...but don't forget to invite me first..;-)

       Suffering is clinging in an impermanent world. All things change and clinging always fails.    One of The Four Noble Truths of the Buddhist religion. It has an absolutely amazing point, and it's so accurate too. We suffer because we desire things we can't have, or things that won't last forever. Nothing on Earth is permanent, and we rely to much on that. I mean, haven't we all made ourselves miserable desiring something? I do that all the time, and it ends up tearing me apart. I desire something so badly, so completely, but the truth is, what I want isn't always what I need. It made me sad to realize that I can't have what I want in alot of situations, because I'm a stubborn person and I always have to have whatever I want. Having to let go of dreams and goals because they aren't plausible isn't an easy thing to do, but I think our society is too blinded in the sense that we think if we try hard enough we can have whatever we want. And that's not true. You end up trying so hard that you make yourself miserable, and therefore you suffer horribly because of selfish, shallow desires. I'm not discouraging trying to reach for your dreams, but make sure your dreams are within reach. Sometimes what you want seems so close to your grasp, but when you look at it from another perspective you realize it's soo far away. I guess life is just about moving on, and not clinging to something...because it'll destroy you. I personally believe that in return for stopping chasing the things you want, you might end up getting something you really need. And then you'll wonder why you wasted your time in the first place. Everything has it's way of working out in the end...or so I tell myself.

       Current Song: None   Not everything in life is a winning battle. Sometimes the things that seem so important aren't really what you make them out to be. Meh. I guess that's life. But if life is so full of disappointments, then where does it become worth while? Eh...oh well.  On another note, I went to see North Star last night at the door. Awesome job y'all, you kicked major ass.

School, band, homework, school, band, homework, school, band, homework....yea, you know what's missing in there? A LIFE! This is how it SHOULD be: party, party, sleep, eat, eat, eat, party, party, be crazy, party, party, eat, sleep, party, orgy, orgy, party, sleep, sleep with random people...hahaha...you get it, right? I'm...kidding about the sex stuff of course. But the partying is always fun! And eating...and occasionally sleep. Ok, this is so pointless it makes me wanna cry. So I'm gonna go do homework(how did u guess...) and then find other ways of wasting my time. Au revoir.

       Current Song: Something Corporate- I Want To Save You   I feel like that girl in all the songs. The one that's wasting her life away, the one who feels lost and hopeless, the one who doesn't know where she's heading. You know...that girl that everyone watches through the glass walls...the one who's so oblivious to everything around her. I feel like the girl who has such high hopes, but she's living in the real world, where she's sitting at the bottom. The one that probably could do something better with her life if she wasn't so lost in her own misery all the time.

I just keep listening to it. I think metaphorically, I can relate to it very well. I was listening to the radio last night before bed, and the second it came on I stopped everything n started listening and I was like "Oh my gosh...I love this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Haha...kinda crazy...  "...yeah life throws you curves...but you learned to swerve...me I swung and I missed and the next thing you know I'm reminiscing...dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes...like you would be back again...........I wake up and tear drops that fall down like rain...I put on that old song we danced to and then...I head off to my job, guess not much has changed...punch the clock, head for home, check the phone, just in case...go to bed, dream of you....that's what I'm doing these days..."  What a pretty song!

So then...not much else to say. Besides the fact that I have a contradictory mind. I think one thing, and at the same time think the exact opposite. My, how I confuse myself. Ok, well, I'm gonna go now and find something a bit more constructive to do. Au revoir.

       Current Song: Nada   Well, I'm grounded through Friday, and I can't get on AIM today or tomorrow. Bleh. Oh well, I almost got grounded this weekend, but I weaved my way out of it...so it's really not that bad. Ah, the joys of being an awesome debater with your parents...and an awesome suck-up. Actually, no, minus the suck up part. I suck at that. That's why I got grounded in the first place, because I wasn't sucking up, and I was speaking my mind a little more than I should have. I eventually told my parents that it was alllllll my fault, but I don't believe it. Meh. Being a stubborn person really SUCKS. But this time I took people's advice, and I stopped arguing and just let them have a victory for once. I think I have way way way too much pride for my own good. Oh well...I don't have a problem with it. You know, that right there is a major character problem, and a definite older-sibling trait. Gah, sometimes being the oldest really sucks. And sometimes it doesn't, in the cases where you can be as bossy n bitchy as you please. Well, if you have the heart to save me from my insanity, please call me. Thanks a ton.

       Current Song: None   Sometimes I feel so dumb. My life starts spinning out of control, and I let it. Because the truth is, I don't care. It's like I almost want it to. Everything is going to hell, and I'm just along for the ride. I guess I'm just really stupid like that. And even when I can admit it, like now, I won't do anything. Then again, my life isn't all that bad right now. But I'm letting everyone down, and that's kinda pissing me off. But I don't even care to try to meet their standards. Meh...I'll learn a lesson from pissing everyone off...and I think that's what I need. Eh. What the hell am I talking about? Wow...ok...bye...

I don't feel like it. I'll finish up the first section of that crazy book before I go to bed tonight.  Well, I'm outta here...au revoir!

       Current Song: None   Ok, I had the craziest dream last night. What's really odd about it is that I can't translate it metaphorically, which in itself has to have some importance. Now, on to my dream. I was sitting at a friend's house, and we were just kinda sitting around(I think I'd stayed the night over there, and we were just lounging around), and at first we were doing homework(for some odd reason), and then we were watching TV. And the news was on, and it was about the Pope. This is where I concluded that there was a religious war. The Pope himself couldn't even go out in public without masses of people attempting to kill him. Neighbors were fighting neighbors. The streets were mass chaos. People had become barbaric. Then all of a sudden people started firing on the house I was at. They had more than guns, they had some pretty crazy weapons. I remember hearing my friend shout that it was a "group of evangelists," and when I somehow caught sight of them, I realized that I knew most of them; one, in fact, was my own father. Then as I looked outside at the street, I saw people running everywhere, frantically; everyone was just in this huge, chaotic state. And I realized that our society, and our civilization, was destroying itself. That evidentally people hadn't learned from the past, and I knew that everyone would eventually destroy everyone else. All civilizations come to their end, and I realized that that was the end of ours.  Yea, pretty depressing. Pretty strange, actually. I don't really know anyone else that dreams about religious wars and the ending of our civilization. Haha...I guess I'm just one strange person.

Because the truth is, I don't know. Now I'm gonna go sit in my room for a few hours trying to answer that question, but getting nowhere. Maybe the answer is 'neither' but rather that I think too much for my own sanity. Indeed I believe that I've solved this mystery! And I am tired, so off to bed it is...au revoir.

       Current Song: Something Corporate- Punk Rock Princess   Again, I haven't posted in days. I just got back from the band picnic thing...and I'm wondering why I went. Something in the air reminded me of youth and happiness and flirtatiousness...and it almost made me sad. I just stood still for a moment and I breathed in everything around me...and it made me miss the way things used to be. Then I was just kinda sad for the rest of the evening. There's something missing in my life, and I wanna find it. And then I watched the sunset, and I thought of love, and I watched everyone around me; so happy to be with someone...and so I stood alone and just watched everyone...and it made me sadder than before. But...not truly sad. I tried to smile, but I just let out a sigh instead. It's not a depressed sad...it's more like knowing that there is so much out there...and realizing how much you want something that you've never had before. Something........you don't even know what, but you want it. You want that happiness. I mean, have you every been so happy that you just sat and smiled...and nothing else mattered but the moment. And you could feel the sunshine on your face, and it was so wonderful...and you noticed every little beautiful thing around you. Personally, I have. Not everyone has, but I'm sure many people can relate. Well, I want to feel like that. Forever.  "I'm a hopeless romantic in a male chauvinist world."

What is with people trying to get people against me? They're dumb. First of all, if you're going to tell people about all the horrible stuff that I do, make sure it's true. But...I don't care. People can say what they want. If you want to give me some bad rep, have a blast! Because actually...I find it amusing. LoL. And if you really really hate me, and you want me to back up my rep, hey I'd be glad to help you out! Haha...just kidding. I mean, I know I'm very far from perfect...no one needs to point it out to the world...everyone has their flaws. Big deal. Alright, that's all! Au revoir!

       Current Song: Saves The Day- Freakish   Blah. I'm kinda feeling..well...blah. Not in a bad mood at all, but I'm not exactly excited about anything either.  "There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done And it sure feels good To finally feel the way I do I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you..."  Ahh...that song cheers me up. I like songs like that. I feel like re-posting a poem, because it's in my archive now, and not on my main page. So here it is...I like it because it's optimistic, and I like that:  I’m finally content and now I understand My life is becoming so clear It’s like I’m finally able to see the light On the path once carved in fear.  A burden has lifted from my tired back And this feeling is all so great I’m learning now I can trust and love Rather than loathe and hate.  I’ve taken my chances in the game of life I’ve bet everything I can And for a moment it seemed that I’d lost it all But now I’m winning again.  Now I stand in the dawn of a brand new day And I watch the sun rise with a smile The light bathes my soul, and uncovers a heart That I haven’t seen for a while.    And there you go. You know...the greatest feeling in the world is to feel all that is good. Not have to reminisce or think of everything going on...just to be. Just be. Soak up all that is beautiful around you in the most simplistic forms. I have a quote for that, but I can't find it. I'll post it later today. I have chores to do now.

Yea, I'm such a dork. And no, I'm not trying to be some skater or anything, it's just one of those things that if I never do it, I'll regret it some day. And I can't live with regrets!

I'm really starting to have very eclectic tastes in just about everything. I've come to realize that I can be whoever I want, and no one can really say anything about it. Well, I need to go study for that crazy English test tomorrow. I'll catch yall later.

Ah well, what can ya do. Things have been going pretty good lately, and I'm glad. Has anyone else noticed that the directors r really moving fast this year? I mean, for one, none of the freshmen were ready for their tryout when they did it, and we're learning the show alot faster than last year. The poor freshmen...they're so confused. And then that STUPID guy that is helping out was like "ok, your line looks absolutely horrible.." And he kept distracting us and confusing the hell out of us all, and he only made things worse! And it's the freshmen that are screwing it up, not anyone else. And so he tells us that we're all wrong, and he's looking at the wrong set, and yet doesn't even realize it after I try explaining it to him...whatever. Isn't he like supposed to be older and wiser? Cuz the guy seems like a freaking dumbass to me. Ah well, that's all my pointless ranting for the day.  Haha...don't you like how my ranting is about stupid stuff involving marching band? My...it's so consuming of my time...I spend like my entire autumn without a life. Meh, what can ya do.

But my classes aren't so bad, and I think I'll survive. So yea...I just hope I don't spend another horrid year in Concert 1. Anyways...not much to say about that mess...  Why are people never who they seem? It's pretty depressing...and people really are good at letting me down. Maybe because I build them up too much. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe I stress too much over nothing. Anyone have a solution? I'm open to just about anything. Life is so stressful.

Everyone with their doubts...hah! But seriously, it was so much easier than I thought. I mean, really, everyone acts like it's sooo incredibly hard, and there's not much to it. I guess that's because I can't really do much, but hey, for a first timer, I'd say I was pretty good.  But on another note, why can't people just grow up? I'm sick of everyone judging everyone else by how they dress. It's not about outer appearance! People shouldn't make all those crappy judgements like...it seriously makes me want to kick them in the face. Let's grow up a bit people, I swear, not much makes me as mad as this crap. "Preps" judging "punks", "punks" judging "preps". Let's drop the labels. I'm sorry, but I have a name. And so does everyone else.  Well, that is all!

       Current Song: Goldfinger- January   I think that people should be more carefree, and not so uptight. So what if we make mistakes? That's life...and how will you learn anything in life if you never have mistakes to learn off of anyway? I really hate when people try to make my decisions and their like "dont do that..it's a mistake.." and blah blah blah. If it's going to be a mistake, then I'd like to make it on my own. I'm a hands on person...I want to learn from my own mistakes, not everyone else's. I can accept making mistakes; I mean, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. I can live my own life, and I like that. Mistakes help people to learn, and often, they can make you a better person. And I know that first hand...because I've made mistakes, and I know better for next time. But there are things out there that I haven't done, and if I want to go out and do whatever I feel like, then so be it. I don't want people trying to stop me...if it's a mistake, I'll learn. But that's better than going through life just wondering...and not really knowing. I mean, what if something that I never did wouldn't have been a mistake? What if my only mistake was trying to avoid that "mistake"? I want to live life first-hand, not have other people live it for me. I think people should live more like that. I mean, I want to see every aspect, be every person, do everything, make EVERY mistake. Because then, I'll know who I really am, and what I really want to do with my life. It's kind of a self discovery thing. If you only take one road, and one path, then who knows what adventure and excitement you missed on all the others. To sum it up: Carpe Diem. Seize the day!

       Current Song: Five Iron Frenzy- A Flowery Song   Whoo hoo! No more work! No more babysitting! No more 4 consecutive hours of Marco Pollo!!!! I'm through! Ahh...the joy. Well, I have band tonight...fun fun. Meh, I suppose it isn't that bad to be back. I was really dreading it, but not really anymore. I'm just glad to see everyone! So anyway...I'm going to go get a shower in a little bit, and then be lazy for a few hours. Oh wait! No I'm not! I'm going to read...because I REALLY need to do that. Ok, i'm gonna get going now...adios!

       Current Song: Sugarcult- Pretty Girl   I love this song...it rocks. Anyways...I realized I worry alot. Alot. I worry because I'm happy, and odd as that sounds. Once anything good happens to me, I get so worried about losing it.  I guess I'm just skeptical that anything good can ever happen to me.  I need to learn to let go more. I'm going to work on that.

       Current Song: Lagwagon- Sick   Hmm...I'm bored. I'm in a good mood. Felt like re-posting this:  I’m finally content and now I understand My life is becoming so clear It’s like I’m finally able to see the light On the path once carved in fear.  A burden has lifted from my tired back And this feeling is all so great I’m learning now I can trust and love Rather than loathe and hate.  I’ve taken my chances in the game of life I’ve bet everything I can And for a moment it seemed that I’d lost it all But now I’m winning again.  Now I stand in the dawn of a brand new day And I watch the sun rise with a smile The light bathes my soul, and uncovers a heart That I haven’t seen for a while.    Well, not a whole lot to say. Adios.

       Current Song: The Getup Kids- Forgive and Forget   I got to get a pretty early shower today. Because my parents are freaks about clean water, so they are putting a water softening/filtering unit inside the house. We have one outside the house, now inside the house, one under the kitchen sink, and a brita filter. Not to mention the stuff in the brita filter goes into a container in the refrigerator, so the water is always nice and cold. FREAKS I TELL YOU! Haha...it's pretty funny how obsessive they are. Ah well...at least I have extremely clean, softened, filtered, cold water. :-P

Wednesday we don't have anything....oh wait..no. I have LESSONS! Of course, I get no days off. But that's ok...it's better than being up at the school until like 7 on a Wednesday evening. Because that is always oodles of fun. Anyways though, I'm gonna go study for my French oral tomorrow and that other crazy test we have in that class. Au revoir!

Oh, and the fact that I was up till about 3 washing that blue hair dye out of my hair...bleh. HeHe.  The single life can be fun, I admit, but currently, it's sucking. I don't feel like being single any more.  Well...that's about all that is going on with me. I'll see yall laters.

       Current Song: Finch- Ender   I just woke up a little while ago. It's early for me. But that's ok, I have alot to do this morning, and I need time.  Last night at the football game, I looked at the horizon as the sun was almost done setting, and it was picture perfect. There was a very small streak of light painted along the bottom of the horizon, and the sky was a deep, rich blue. It made me realize how little things in life are what make it all worth while. I hadn't noticed anything like that in a long time, because I've been too caught up in the misfortunes of life. But when you just take a minute to look around, you realize the small upsettings in life only make the small, beautiful things that much better.

We just found out. That's horrible. I'm so freaking mad. Ughh...that's disgusting. You'd think someone would have the decency to make a quick phone call to let us know. That's so...sick. It makes me sick how much someone's pride can ruin their person. Pride is a sick, sick thing.

I'm still in alot of confusion, but I'm just going to stop thinking about it, and things will work out in the end. I'm sorta leaning toward a certain way I wish things would end up, but it's the most unlikely option. *Sigh*...I guess that's just life. But sometimes what you think you want isn't all you think it is. Because sometimes what you really really want hasn't been laid in front of you yet. That's not always true, but what can I say. And not everyone will always be pleased with what I want, but it's my life...so if I want something, then I'll go after it. And no one can stop me. Yea, anyways...that dream from several days ago is still stuck in my head. How odd...

And you try to act like nothing happens. I hate that feeling. It's the biggest way to be let down. I was just thinking about that...because I've felt like that countless times. And I've learned that wishes won't get you far. Because I've done more wishing then anyone could imagine...and look where am? Everything I've wished for is far from my grasp. Only a miracle could get me satisfaction...and I'm starting to doubt the existence of those too.

I made some crazy quote thing a little while ago. It kinda sorta rhymes too. I don't neccessarily feel the way I've described, but I'd be lying to say that I've never felt that way before.  And the whole world stands around to watch in my time of need. Not a hand stretched out as I stumble to my bitter defeat. And though I beg and plead and cry, the crowd just stares in silence as I die.  Yea...anyways though...I'm so tired...today's been long...even if I can barely remember it. Well, I'm going to bed. Goodnight everyone.

       Current Status: Something Just Suddenly Hit Me!   Oh my gosh...I just figured out my dream from a few days ago! It was telling me that I should care less what other people think, and what everyone else's opinion is. Because it's  my  life, and I need to stop caring about what everyone else thinks! It's repetitively told to me, but now that I'm even telling myself that, it has a stronger effect. Sheesh! Insane. I'd been trying to prove everyone wrong about that, and that what other people think is more important, but maybe I need to be a little more concerned with what I want and what I think. After all...it's my life. Wow...that hit me just instantly a few minutes ago...out of absolutely nowhere. Because in my dream, everyone kept swaying my opinion, and I made a huge mistake...but then I realized "Oh my gosh...what about what I want? What about my opinion, and how I see things?" And so I went and got back everything I'd lost, and all was well. I hope I still have time to do that.

       Current Song: Something Corporate- Hurricane   Blah. I am bored. And I haven't posted in a while. Not much has gone on. Had a football game last night. Amazingly, Keller won 20-14 in overtime. Hey, is it possible that we might have a good team this year? I'm not quite sure yet...Well, again, I'm extremely bored. I wanna do something fun tonight. I skipped 1st and 2nd period today to sleep...and because I had a ton of homework due 2nd period that I wasn't even gonna try to do. So I am in party-mode tonight, kids!  Oh yea...I had a weird dream last night...it made me puzzled. If you want to know about it, I'd be glad to tell you. It was good, and then there was conflict, but what's odd...there was a resolution. A happy ending...how odd. I think I understand the moral, but it's only causing me more confusion. I think that it's a product of my lonliness. I feel kinda pushed away...not that I blame anyone for pushing me away. I don't deserve to have anyone close to me.

No one understands...everyone just jumps every time i make a mistake, and they rub it in my face. I know I'm not perfect. So if one more person tries to make me feel like crap, I'll kick their ass. And I mean it. I don't learn from hatred! No one does you FREAKING IDIOTS! Love truth, but pardon error. So chill. Because I'm close to breaking...and when I hit my breaking point, there's no turning back. That's a warning. Leave me alone, and I'll do the right thing. But if one more person has to be rude to me, I'll do my best to piss everyone off.

       Suffering is clinging in an impermanent world. All things change and clinging always fails.   Life is so horrid. How can you be on top of the world one minute...and in seconds take the fall...and suddenly you're nothing...you take the dive and you crash and burn and nothing seems fair. God, I'm so sorry that I'm so freaking emotional...but pain is something that's not easy to handle. Nothing in life is fair.

And then the stories get twisted or even made up and...oh my gosh, it's making me go insane. I having nothing that's my own anymore! It's like my own thoughts belong to the world...and they aren't even my own. Then again, look at me...I'm sitting here publishing my thoughts for the world to read anyway. But I don't sell my life away to the public...so why doesn't everyone mind their own business, and I'll keep more introverted? How's that? Sounds like a plan. It's my life, and from now on I'm running it my way, and I'm keeping it less open-book. I totally admire those people who keep parts of their lives so secluded...I wish I could do that.

I used to be so hopeful but I feel like I've fallen further than I ever thought was possible. And I sit here and I cry, but I don't try to change. Because I don't want to change. I'm not ready to turn around yet. I just have this mindset that someone will rescue me from this hole I've dug myself, and I know it'll never happen. And I cry and I create pain for myself. Every single tear that no one else will ever see kills me. Because no one is there to feel their force but me. And It makes me feel so alone sometimes. Because no one wants to deal with me, and I definately don't blame them. I've turned into something horrible......

       Current Song: Finch- Stay With Me   Wow...I'm lazy. I haven't posted all week. That's horrible. Let's try to sum up this week's happenings. Monday I began to realize how high my stress level has become, so Tuesday I was so tired of everything that I skipped school and band and SLEPT. Of course, the stress returned by Wednesday; I was up alllllll that night doing a frikkin english project. Thursday was a really good day for no reason at all...just enjoyable.     Friday was one of those days that was in between really good n fairly bad. It was odd, I sorta felt like the center of attention in alot of situations. I also felt crowded by alot of people; in some ways it was kinda cool, and in other ways it was like "get the hell away from me!" So then, I hafta tell you about my great experience after the football game(at which Keller actually won, thank you very much). Ok, so Candace drives me home, and when I get there, both of my parent's cars are gone. Which is odd to say the least at 11:00 at night. And only to make things that much stranger, there's a random unlocked car sitting in the far end of my driveway. Ok, another fact: my front door is IMPOSSIBLE for me to unlock. No one else in my family has trouble with it, but I do. So i try for about 5 minutes to get it unlocked, Manda tries for about 10, and Candace tries for about 15, and finally she gets it open. So we go inside and there is no note or anything telling me where my parents are. How cute. So Manda and Candace leave, and I'm trying to figure out what's going...neither of my parents will answer their cell phones, and it's frustrating me....alot. So finally my parents get home quite a while after 11. Here's the situation: the random unlocked car in the driveway is mine, and my parents had to take my mom's car back to pick up my dad's, cuz he drove mine home when he bought it. Then they went out to eat and came home. But hey, I got a car out of the deal. It's a 97 Accord, in good condition. It's auto and a 2.2 liter, but hey...it runs, right?      So now, on to Saturday. We had area, and we had a really good performance. But of course, Duncanville, LD Bell, Fossil and Haltom go to state. We got 7th, which really isn't that bad. If you think about it, Area is a contest where most bands typically have their best performances.      Yeah, so I feel like going shopping today. I think I just might. Ah well, I'm gonna go now, and get a shower and such. Adios you crazies.

       How To Manipulate A Person   1. To manipulate(finagle, wangle) a person, you have to put yourself in a win, win situation. You have to become invulnerable to anything they can lay out at you. In other words, don't let them have any affect over you. You have to keep complete control, and never let them get the best of you. 2. You have to find out their behavioral patterns. Find out how they react upon certain situations, and how  they  manipulate others. Figure out what they do to maintain control over other people. For instance, how do they react when angry, and what tactics do they use to get the other party to give in to them? Discover their strategy for power over people. 3. Find their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This often ties in to their behavioral patterns and their strategies for power. When people want reactions, they provoke it among people. Don't ever let them provoke the response they want from you. The goal is to own them, not let them own you. 4. Carry out a plan. You have to plan a strategy that targets their weaknesses, and carry it out. Never give in to them...there's always a possibility that they will be stubborn at first...but the plan is full proof. Eventually, it works out. 5. THEY ARE OWNED. Once you've got em manipulated, then you've won. You get what you want, and never settle for less. 6. Repeat when necessary. Enough said.  Haha...just thought that was kinda crazy like that.

I think I'm gonna have lunch in a bit, and then find something to do, because I don't really feel like sitting at home by myself today. This is the kind of day that I like to spend with people. Well, time for food.  *~~ :-) ~~*

       Current Song: Ok Go- Get Over It   Wow...haven't posted in a few days. Crazy finals suck, they drain all your energy. K-Town won another football game, but it  WAS  against Boswell, so what can I say. Well, things aren't so bad lately. I have nothing to rant about, so there isn't a whole lot to say. Except for the fact that people try to make decisions for me, and act like I'm not capable of just doing things on my own. It's like they all want me to just live in a box by myself for the rest of my damn life. It's dumb, why should everyone else care so much about what I do. And when they try to talk bad about people, they sound like hypocrites. But that's okay, they can go on doing what they do, and I'll just mind my own business and ignore them. :)  Anyways, that's my pointless ranting...see yall laters.

       Current Song: The Promise Ring- Happiness Is All The Rage   Humm...been thinking alot lately. Old memories are so nice. :) But they make me sad too. Because I wish stuff would go back to the way it was back then. I mean, have you ever looked back on something and been like "wow...I was so happy." Or you start to think about someone who's sorta been in the back of your mind, and you're like "wow...I really really cared about them. They really made me happy." It's nice to think of things like that. The only really sad thing is that you probably don't even hardly cross their mind anymore.  I was also thinking back to this past summer...like, the very beginning of the summer, and camping and such. Those were good times. Just...happy. I'm always so alive in the summer...God, I love it! I remember nights I would just stay up all night, just happy over nothing, and then being so tired at work the next day, but so blissful. I remember one day at work, I was so tired, yet so peacefully happy that i just watched the pool water around me in awe, and I just closed my eyes, put my face against the sun and soaked up the warmth.  Wow...I just suddenly got carried away. Didn't even realize I was typing.  Summer makes me happy. I wish it was summer. :-\  Goodnight you crazies.

       Current Song: Finch- Waiting   If anyone's been wondering why I've been posting alot lately, it's because I've been really bored. And I'm a crazy computer geek. :-P I wish I had something interesting or inspiring to say. Heck, I just wish something interesting or inspiring would happen in my life. I'm such a horribly boring person. Ah well, the holiday season is here, and unlike past years, I plan on really enjoying it.  I just realized that I haven't written in my actual journal is months. Isn't that sad? And yet I write in here almost every day. Pathetic. Okay, I'm gonna go watch Star Wars: Episode 2. Hehe...see you crazies later.

       Current Song: The Distillers- City of Angels   Interesting poem...not very good, but it makes me think of how much I've had to leave behind in life:  I once was a child with uniquely crafted dreams A wild imagination behind bright blue eyes Everything in life seemed to shimmer and gleam Disappointment wasn’t obsolete; just cleverly disguised.  But year by year reality began to take hold My dreams fell victim to dust and rust I slowly let pieces of my past turn dark and cold But I couldn’t dwell on that past; I had to adjust.  It took some time to uncover my lost goals Though never again would they shimmer and gleam Now I look back with a sigh at my childish soul And my bright blue eyes, harboring uniquely crafted dreams; Dreams that now are gone.  Well, that's all of that. Luv ya, bye bye crazies.

       Current Song: The Distillers- The World Comes Tumblin'   Haha...that quiz inspired me to listen to some majorly owning music.  Haven't done much today. Just cleaning and such. It's *tons of fun*. Only, that is a major negatory. Lots of pre-Thanksgiving cooking and cleaning going on. I like preparing for holidays. It's fun, and makes me happy. But the actual holidays themselves are much much more fun. Because it's fun minus the work. I wanna start Christmas shopping Friday, but I'm afraid my lack of money may hinder my plans a bit. Ah well, no worries. I always come through when it comes to my financial situations. Except when it comes to my damn Visa...majorly not goodness. Haha...but that's okay...I just hope they don't deactivate my card, which is what they're threatening to do. Sux0rs. Anyways, I'm in a talkative sort of mood today. I notice that everyone else's blogs and journals have such longer entries and they actually talk about stuff. I figure it's time I started doing that.  I've decided that I am going to lose all this weight I've gained. It's dumb on my part, however, they I've waited until the holiday season to make this decision. I'm gonna get back in kickboxing, because that got me in awesome shape right away. Corey, the instructor, works everyone really really hard, and at first you want to kill him, but when you realize that you're starting to tone up, you gain a great deal of respect for the man. He's so damn cool too! He was talking to me and Becka one day, and he was like "what you hafta do is party all through high school, and then settle down in college." Kinda ironic, because most people say otherwise. Maybe I should combine both sides of the advice, and just party through high school  and  college. Haha..ownage.  Okay, I think I've done enough rambling today. Au revoir you crazies.

       Current Song: No Use For A Name- 3 Month Weekend   I'm so bored. Went shopping yesterday, and then went bowling. Today I went and got my hair cut, and my hair dresser used some sorta shampoo to make my hair redder. It owns.  Some people don't realize that the point of life is to  live  it. The way I see it, we should live and be crazy  now , because, what happens later when we regret all those missed opportunities?  Mistakes are part of the beauty of life. Live with no regrets.  Bye bye you crazies!!!!!

Actually, I'd woken up earlier, like 11 or 12 with really really bad cramps, so i got a shower, and then layed back down because of the pain. I was like crying by the time my mom brought me two aleve and a heating pad. And then I slept...a really long time. I'm better now, thank God. And  that  is why I am getting on the pill within like a week or two...because I can't handle more of that.  Well, adios you crazies.

Manda: No, actually I'm talking about a.....*keeps writing...pauses...looks up*.....Yes I am.  Bah...owned. Anyways, I don't like Mr. Babcock. In fact, I despise that favoritistic little jerk! If I don't move up soon, I'm going to hafta quit, he's that bad. And then he threatens to move people down...humm...he's talking to trumpets.......who is (unfairly) last chair? me. He even thinks about doing something that dumb, and I'll quit on the spot. I enjoy playing, but band isn't fun. It's lost it's enjoyment. And it's just not worth it to stay in if I'm miserable. And I do mean  miserable.   On another note, World History=class of death and such.  Bye bye crazies!

Though I was washing blue dye out of my hair until about 1 or so this morning. That's okay, I skipped 1st and 2nd period. :)  I do that alot...oh well.  Isn't it odd how sometimes you feel so alone in the world. Right now I'm just mad at people in general. People are so FREAKING RUDE! You can't be serious with any of the stupid asses, because if your mood doesn't conform to theirs, they have to be rude to you. I hate people sometimes! Ah well...I don't care anymore. Screw people, I don't want any shitty friends that are gonna step on me, and then run in and be nice when it's convenient for them.  We just got a gas fire thingy for the fireplace. Like, just now. As in, my dad just finished hooking it up. We'd never been able to have anything in the fireplace before, because of my dad's asthma and emphysema. I don't know why we have one now, but okay.  I'm gonna go catch up on all the homework I have. Bye.

       Current Song: Five Iron Frenzy- One Girl Army   Sometimes I feel alive. Sometimes I feel dead. And then there are the times when I feel like I'm caught somewhere in between death and life. Like I'm still breathing, but with each breath I die a little more. People get so mad at me because they don't understand me. And when they get angry like that, how can I explain myself to them? It's like no one understands, because they're too nieve to even listen. I want people to listen. Because if they only knew the things I could tell them, than maybe--just maybe--the way I am would be a bit easier to understand.

Awesome lyrics, mostly.  Adios.

       Current Song: Mustard Plug- Mendoza   Interesting day. Most interesting being first period, ironically enough. I have World History. Now what could ever be interesting in the frikkin class? Well, here's the story:  I was sitting in class, bored and tired as usual. Because honestly, who can listen to that woman lecture for an hour and a half and stay sane? Not me, so I slept. Strangely, I've never slept that well in her class. I was seriously out cold. Dreaming and so on and so forth. Then I tried to wake up, but it felt like I was paralyzed and couldn't move. Eventually I did...in perfect timing. We were about to have a test over the notes that...oh...I hadn't taken. Even better yet, we got to use those notes...you know...the ones I hadn't been AWAKE for...it was real cute. Yeah, so you try B/S-ing an entire paper about how China influenced Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Haha...it sucked, but it was pretty amusing. Because I really don't care.  Yep, so that was just about the highlight of my lovely day. Had an ortho appointment, missed band(thank God), and I'm debating over whether or not to embarrass myself and do region. Maybe next year.  Buh Bye you crazies.

       Current Song: Coldplay- Politik   Last football game of the season tonight...thank you God. So umm...I've been in a good mood lately. It's nice. Like today...constant good moodness. Up until just recently, because people's bad moods are easy to catch. I hate that! I wish people with bad moods would just stay away from me when I'm happy. If I'm in a bad mood, I don't go hang around someone who's all happy and bitch to them. Or I try not to. Happy people should group with happy people, and sad, pissy people should go vent to one another...not anyone else. That's okay though. I'm still pretty happy.  Yeah, things have been good lately.  "There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known, I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done, And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do, I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you."  I just realized I've quoted that song before in my blog. Haha...how funny.  I'm hungry.  Au revoir you crazies.

       Current Song: Reel Big Fish- Sell Out   Wow, what a weekend. Friday was the game against LD Bell. So, we're performing our show and this group of students from Bell is screaming and cussing and throwing ice and tennis balls and paper and such on to the field. I found it very disrespectful..but funny at the same time. Because some of them got arrested. Hehe...So now, we get home around 10:30 or so, and I went home n SLEPT until 3:30, so i could get up, get a shower n be at school by 5. I left the house with my hair soaking wet, no make-up...but ya know what? I enjoyed not caring. So in San Antonio we got a division one rating, but didnt make finals. The bands that made finals...made me laugh. Because they don't have marching shows! They have some guy rapping n people breakdancing and dirty sluts for color guard. Or they have people jumping on trampolines and such. Or they have someone playing a guitar and people worshipping guard members. Come on. And of course Bell had the same show they've had for the past 6 years...the machine twice...what a shock. So I slept the entire way back, and we got home around 4 or 4:30. I'm not sure what time because I was too tired to care. Then I got home and slept until about 12. Or close enough.  Anyways, I dunno what it was about the trip, but I felt incredibly...lonely. And I don't necessarily mean the relationship kind of way...I just mean lonely. Through alot of Saturday I found myself just kinda sitting alone, walking around alone, not really talking to anyone...just sort of alone. And I didn't really go running for anyone either, because I just didn't care. I just got this feeling like I wasn't really welcome to hang out with anyone. It made me question alot of things. Like where I stand as far as friendships with people are concerned. Because if people are gonna give me a cold shoulder whenever they don't feel I'm "needed", then do I really want to be hanging around with them? It might have just been an odd weekend, but it made me sorta feel like shit. I think I just need to re-evaluate things.  Ah well, I'm gonna go now...I feel like going shopping today. Shopping can make me happy. And I'm not broke either. :)

       Current Song: Ozma- Baseball   Well, today's been interesting. Had a doctor appointment, because for the past 3 or 4 days I've been getting sharp pains in my stomach...and it's so incredibly horrible and painful. So then I had to go down to Ft Worth for a blood test, because they  think (and I stress the word think, because you never know with crazy doctors these days) that it's either a gallbladder infection, a liver infection or appendicitis. Fun. So depending on what the results are, I don't know if I'm going to San Antonio this weekend or not.*Pains currently jabbing me...ouch*  Anyways...not much else going on. Last night was Halloween...it wasn't too bad. Well, I'm out children. Buh bye.

People call you sentimental or idealistic, and sometimes they even make some comment about they might vomit if they have to listen to go on and on any more.  Phew.  Some day, though, you will make someone very happy.           urlLink Be cool! Take the What Do You Want Out Of Life? Quiz     Funny how none of that sounds anything like me.

You've come so far since the time when you let your first boy in... And you do it so callously As if you had no self esteem... A victim of apathy, but you don't care what people say about you..."  Bye bye crazies.

       Current Song: Rx Bandits- Analog Boy   Looking up good quotes:  Every man is guilty of all the good he didn't do. Voltaire  In the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost. Dante Alighieri  Treat the other man's faith gently; it is all he has to believe with. His mind was created for his own thoughts, not yours or mine. Henry S. Haskins  To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. David Viscott  The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want. Ben Stein  Not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious. Brendan Gill  It's not true that life is one damn thing after another; it is one damn thing over and over. Edna St. Vincent Millay  Well, the page just decided to close, so that's all for now.  Have fun you crazies.

But I just don't care anymore. Meh.  Oh, by the way, yesterday was a funny day. Just everything made me laugh till I peed. Only not quite....well, off to....do something else I suppose.

I've had alot of trouble focusing on anything or anyone lately...so badly that I can have zero distraction and still not be focused. And it's not like my mind wanders or something catches my attentions...it's that I just stop thinking completely...just blah. Haha...it's cool though. No one really has much to say of any importance anyways.  Alright...adios crazy kids.

       Current Song: Kernkraft 400- Zombie Nation   Wow, I was thinking about organized religion today. And suddenly, everything started clicking for me. You see, lately, I've been finding dissatisfaction in my Catholic religion and upbringing. So I decided not to get confirmed this year, and kind of sort things out. Maybe even find a new religion. Well, I finally realized that basically...I'm anti-organized religion. Yes, I'm a christian and such, I believe in God and that Jesus died for our sins, but I also believe that organized religion is corrupt. Basically, I first weighed the pros and cons of organized religion. My findings:   Pros:  *it enforces common morality into society *in reference to Christianity specifically, it gives different interpretations of the bible, and gathers crowds with similar views   Cons:  *it creates corruption within the church and even the religion itself (By the way, "organized religion" and "church" are two very different things;  urlLink read here ) *it spoon-feeds religion to people, sometimes to the extent of practically "brainwashing" them *it creates biases, and makes people judgemental and close-minded *in reference to the 2nd "Pro" statement, different interpretations to the bible could be a "Con" as well, because people are given interpretations of someone else's opinions  Now, let me clarify that christianity is not an organized religion. the practice of true christianity is called New Covenant Christianity, and it's not an organized religion.

       Current Song: Jimmy Eat World- Sweetness   ...I wish it was summer...  Hatred level of the winter: 132143243000000%! Yes, that percentage is possible. Because I say so.  I feel bad for people who don't ever just LET GO. Have fun. Be crazy, and not always follow all the rules. That's what it's all about. Like my personal cliche goes, "Mistakes build character". I mean, I'd rather not be spoonfed morals and rules. I guess I'm big in to individualism and such. I have nothing against anyone's morals, but I just like living. I don't like being preached to either. Because then I don't really learn anything for myself. As goes another one of my personal cliches(maybe I have too many of these), "To experience life is to live it first hand...".  I'll leave it at that. Au revoir crazies.

       Current Song: The Vandals- Summer Lovin'   Found an interesting article in the newspaper today about blogging. Actually, it was about narcissism, but it talked alot about blogging. Here's a little snippet:   urlLink It's all about... ME    Tom Schenden, 34, lives in Brea, Calif., and works in health-care marketing. He also keeps an online diary -- an online soap box, really -- filled with whatever strikes his fancy that day.  When he first heard about blogging, "it sounded so dorky," he admitted. But he started an online diary anyway and soon was hooked. "It gave me an outlet to write, it's personally enjoyable. It's a chance to explore my own creative writing and see what people react to."  Schenden actually had two blogs, one of which was written about his personal life, including a divorce, though anonymously. Like almost everyone who decides to share their story with a viewing audience, Schenden latches onto the language of psychotherapy. Everything is "catharsis" these days, as if getting it off your chest is, in and of itself, the most important thing.  "It was fun to be able to spill all," Schenden said. "It's sometimes interesting to get feedback, safe feedback, when no one knows who you are."  Schenden soon shut down the anonymous blog, however, for the simple reason that he could have been exposed -- hurting others, and himself. It's a sentiment no doubt one or two former Sally Jesse Raphael guests have, though they can't so easily tap the "delete" key. How few of them actually think of this before.  The other Schenden blog is a collection of opinions, meted out in paragraph spoonfuls. Like so many online rants, it's like eavesdropping on a conversation at the mall, hearing only snippets of opinion.  None of Schenden's thoughts is publishable in the conventional sense. They're not long enough to be editorials, not developed enough to be articles. Instead, it's a journal, but he wouldn't keep it unless people read it. A personal diary "is not worth doing. I do groove on feedback."  Of course, Schenden himself doesn't read blogs. He just writes one. Sometimes it seems like the whole blog community is this way -- everybody shouting, nobody listening.  It's not my intention to belittle Schenden, or even blogs. If this fulfills him, bravo. And as a journalist, I support any technology that democratizes the written word.  But I'm looking for a little self-censorship. What happened to formulating thoughts, writing them out in private and editing them before publication? Where is the thoughtful analysis in the ravenous beast of a blog updated every day, every hour?  Some days, Schenden doesn't feel like writing in his blog. But he knows there are 20-30 regular readers of his journal, so he starts tapping away anyway. "Then all of a sudden I realize I do have something to say," he said.  Call me old-fashioned, but shouldn't inspiration precede production? Too many things are said, and written, because we're taught that if you have a story, you must tell it. If you have a secret, you must tell it. Expose all.  When, I wonder, does one stay silent?    It makes you feel so narcissistic, huh? Well, c-ya you crazies.

I've gotten a total of 7 hours of sleep in the past two days, and it's really catching up with me.  I couldn't stay awake 4th period today at all. Today's been a good day though...lots of fun.  Okay, well, I can't think of much to say. I have no energy whatsoever. And I can't think. Well, I'm off to do homework or take a nap...most likely the latter, seeing as how for some reason I just looked up the word "likely" in the dictionary. Yes, I need sleep. Buh Bye crazies.

       Ahh geez. These are too good not to show everyone   The tiger can't change his spots. No, wait, he did! Good for him!   Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet? And also, you're drunk.   I remember that fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really on the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought, something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.  I think a good novel would be where a bunch of men on a ship are looking for a whale. They look and look, but you know what? They never find him. And you know why they never find him? It doesn't say. The book leaves it up to you, the reader, to decide. Then, at the very end, there's a page that you can lick and it tastes like Kool-Aid.  Better not take a dog on the Space Shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.   When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven and pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it's not, ummmm, boy.  If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did."   Okee dokies. I'm so done now. Later crazies.

Ahh geez....funniest thing EVER:   *silence at lunch table* Manda: So...did you hear about the guy who tried to kiss his girlfriend in the fog and mist? (Yes...it's spelled wrong for a reason.)

       Current Song: Bad Religion- Punk Rock Song   Hmm...good day.  I find myself changing alot lately. I mean, something about me is changing again. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's almost a little scary. I think it'll work out alright though.  Have you ever known someone who you didn't really talk to much...you know, maybe a 'hi' every once in a while....and you never really thought much about them, but all of a sudden you find yourself thinking about them? And all of a sudden, you find yourself almost being attracted to them. Just out of nowhere...nothing to spur it...nothing changing between the two of you...but all of sudden you're like...strangely attracted to them. I think it's weird. Something just all of a sudden makes you think differently about them. Very peculiar. And it's not like a  strong  attraction either...you just find yourself thinking about them a bit more.  And then there are the situations, which conveniently arise at the same time, where you start to think about people from the past. And you kinda start missing that. But, I mean, everyone reminisces once in a while...it's just kinda sad to miss all the good things that used to be in your life. And, now, I'm not really speaking of people, but of memories in general. Sometimes I just miss the way things used to be. But I guess moving on is part of life.  Well, I'm outta here. See you at the end of the world, crazies.

       Current Song: No Doubt- Spiderwebs   Ah geez. Today is good in a very bad way. But hehe...that's cool!  Damn can't wait till kickboxing starts. Oww Oww...painful pleasure. :)  I wish I had talent. Like, musical talent or something of the sort. Geez, I've always been in love with everything about music since I was like 2 or 3. No kidding. Now if only I'd done so much as acquired a talent for anything involving music. Then I'd be happy. Maybe I should concentrate on that sorta thing. I've decided I wanna learn drums or bass. Preferably drums. Because that would just be so damn great.  Well...what to say.  I've decided to ignore my family from now on. Because I am having a big self-improvements lately, and all they do is drag me down. So, no more of that. I will keep improving, and forget all about them.  When I graduate college, and find a career of interest, I'm moving to somewhere near the equator. I'm thinking to like an island or something. A tropical place. That way I never have to deal with cold, shitty weather. And I have pretty, tropical weather. And everyone thinks that I'm not completely serious, but I am. Really. Because it's the only way I see of me being happy in life. If I have to deal with winter, then I can't do that. Ahh...wouldn't that be wonderful. Nice, tropical weather. God, I love it! I mean, even when the weather is shitty in places like that, it's still great. So moving to somewhere like that. hooray.  I feel productive right now. Hmm...that's really good. Because about an hour ago I felt like rolling over and dying. I think I'm gonna go take another Aleve and then read or study or something. I really shouldn't be taking another Aleve though...I've already had 4 since last night. The limit is like...3 in 24 hours. Eh...what am I supposed to do when they  DON'T WORK!?   Well, off to do something of importance.  See ya at high tides, crazies.

My family always tells me how I used to be so happy, and how they wish I would be like that again. How they "want that person back." And I don't know what to do. What  am  I supposed to do?   I can't do anything.     If people would just stop pointing out to me how unhappy I am, then maybe I could ignore it a little more.

I laughed so hard I almost died.  Went to IHOP this morning then. Actually...this afternoon. Whatever, I'm still confused.  Got home...now I'm doing absolutely nothing.

I realized that my new template kinda looks like a newspaper. I was just thinking about that. Geez, I'm still tired.  Does anyone else ever feel like you waste time if you take a nap during the day or sleep too long at night? Because I do. Like, I'm just wasting away a day by napping. Maybe if I got adequate sleep every night, that wouldn't be such an issue. I wouldn't have to nap. And I would be able to enjoy my days, rather than sleep them away.  That's probably why I don't take naps in the summer.  Because I couldn't bare to waste such beautiful days. Hell, I never even  sleep  in the summer. Because I don't even feel the need.  Ooh! I just got a good idea. But I can't say. HeHe.  Just saw an ad for Final Destination 2 on AIM. God the first one is so great. I don't see how they can make a successful sequel to it though. Ahh well, all the power to 'em.  Hmm...so long and farewell, dear crazies.

       Shauna's Day From Hell   Hmm...what a day. SUCKFEST! Went to the DPS today. Here's story number one:  Get to the DPS in Hurst, and they tell us that my TEA form is expired by  TWO DAYS!  Oh my gosh. So much anger. Well, we got the TEA form on December 20th. So, my mom and I, being...desperate, change the 0 to a 6. Haha...yeah. We were angry. So we go to the other DPS, and they tell us that we have to go to the one in Hurst to get my permit. GAY. So, our plaigarism didn't work, but we were kinda glad, because we were so nervous about it anyways. We're getting a new TEA form now, and I won't get my permit until next Tuesday. *Boo*  Yeah, and I missed sectionals, Mr. Babcock says that the fact that my mom could only get off work today to go to the DPS isn't a "valid excuse", but whatever. I don't see how that isn't a "valid excuse." What a jerk. Okay, sorry, life not  revolving  around damn sectionals! So yeah, I'm gonna be screwed over tomorrow.   And also, I like how Babcock had such a  vivid memory  of listening to Jared play his chair test on Friday. He told me yesterday when I asked about it. So I asked Jared about it today...Jared was  never  at school on Friday. Very puzzling. I mean...think about it. He has a grade for Jared, and also specifically remembers him playing. Something is wrong with that. Something is also wrong with the fact that he didn't have grades for me or Kelvin, though we both played, so he thinks...writes a little bit, and then gives everyone their chairs. Honestly, he's making himself very suspicious. See, what would  appear  to be going on, is that he's  manipulating people's grades!  You know, maybe I'm being paranoid...but look at the facts. Sure, I definately do not agree with that man on alot of levels, and that would give me reason to be paranoid, so maybe it is just me. Except that other people see it as well. Makes you think.  Ooh, started reading  Atlas Shrugged  by Ayn Rand last night. It gets you hooked. Quickly.  Well, that's my day from hell. What a blast. Have a better day than me, crazies.

       Current Song: Lagwagon- Sleep   Hmm...very good day! I was very glad.  I get my permit tomorrow. Finally. Amen to that.  Well, last night was interesting. I couldn't sleep. Only think. I just finally realized how much I have...well...changed. I was reading my journal last night (my actual written one, not the one that anyone can see). I was reading back to January through May of last year. In April or May I can accross something that really shook me. It was a list of "Things That Make Me Happy". Do you know how many things I had listed?  50.  Fifty things that made me happy. Gosh, if you could have seen how simple and delightful each thing was. By the time I got to the third thing on the list, my eyes were welling up. And by the tenth thing, I had tears running down my face. Because it made me realize how horribly unhappy I've become. In just a matter of months, I have lost faith in nearly everything on that list. And to make it worse, I probably couldn't have thought of 15 things to put on that list anymore. I just don't think I'm supposed to have to be like this. And I read back further through my journal, and in nearly every single entry, with the exception of  only one! , I expressed so much joy and thankfulness for everything in my life. And probably the most ironic thing of all, was that I found myself envious of...well...myself. I found myself filled with  so much envy , for none other than the person I used to be.  It made me sad.   Well, off to go study or read or something. Ta ta for now, crazies.

       Some Insightful Quotes For You Lovely People   I'm hoping these quotes will provoke a few...comments...from people:  It is a fine thing to establish one's own religion in one's heart, not to be dependent on tradition and second-hand ideals. Life will seem to you, later, not a lesser, but a greater thing.  D. H. Lawrence   Hmm...it's like all my thoughts on religion put quite simply into words.   If you can't have faith in what is held up to you for faith, you must find things to believe in yourself, for a life without faith in something is too narrow a space to live.  George E. Woodberry   How true.   People ask for criticism, but they only want praise.  W. Somerset Maugham   And will I EVER agree to that statement.   I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty.  George Burns   BAH HAH. Quite humorous.   Assert your right to make a few mistakes. If people can't accept your imperfections, that's their fault.  Dr. David M. Burns   I am careful not to confuse excellence with perfection. Excellence, I can reach for; perfection is God's business.  Michael J. Fox   If your success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart, it is not success at all.  Anna Quindlen   Hmm...sometimes I feel like that. Like when everyone tries to implant this impression of my so-called "success" into my head...or when they tell me what I have to do to be "successful"...and sometimes, I just don't feel like I have to be THAT person to be successful in life.   Well, that's enough quotes for now. Until next time, crazies.

       Current Song: Simple Plan- I'd Do Anything   Oh man. What a day. Me and Rae went to Thrift Town, then back to her house. We went skateboarding around her neighborhood...and wow. Let me tell you a story.  So something possesses me to suggest going down this hill...btw I'm riding Rae's brother's crap skateboard. The wheels aren't even aligned right, so they turn whenever they please. And the trucks were like about to freakings FALL OFF. So something possesses me to say "hey...let's go down  that  hill."  Big mistake.  So...heading down hill...start going FAST. We speed up to at least 30 mph. Really. And then...board starts going crazy...wheels are shaking like they are going to fall off. Trust me, I knew that if I hadn't jumped, I woulda freakin had my ass kicked. So...like a moron...I jump the board. I try to run for a while, and then I skid like 5 feet along my left side.  And  to top it off, I rip a brand new pair of pants. So I immediately think "OMFG...MY PANTS...NOOOOOOOOO!!" And I jump right up and see a nice tear in my pants. Suckfest. Didn't care about my knee being torn up or my elbow being torn up. Just the pants. And so I dont know where the hell Rae is and I yelled "Uhhh...Rachel...a word of advice...DON'T JUMP THE BOARD!"  Oh, so lovely. No. Not really.  But can't forget: *Rachel lies motionless on ground, faking to be dead or something of the sort* *Shauna's mangled body stumbles toward her" Shauna: Rachel...Rachel!!!!! Are you dead?!?! *Shauna drags mangled body toward Rachel* *Rachel sits up* Rachel: HAHAHAH...oh my god...  haha. so great.  Well, I'm off to...listen to music or something. Adios crazies.

Hmm....only thing is...6 months of this thing and I don't wanna switch...you know what? Maybe I'll just get a new template. Yes...that should do the trick.  Well, yesterday was boring. Extremely boring. Hopefully today will be a bit more exciting.  Well, off to take a shower. C-ya crazies.

       Current Song: Finch- Ender   Hmm. Nice day.  Wanting to go to Thrift Town. Just need someone to accompany me there. Haven't gone there in...well, quite a long time.  Had  another  weird dream last night. Only last night was definately the strangest of the past three nights. Because it didn't make sense. Nothing fit together. I was at one place, then the other, then the other, and so on. All this stuff was happening and it just got so jumbled together.  Hoping today is a good day.  Wishing for great things to happen.  Dreaming of even greater things.  Mmmk, I'm outta here. Laters crazies.

Not in a bad way though.  Definately  not in a bad way. Test in Alg 2....easy. Test in Chemistry...easy. Chair test in the hell band...easy. French...boring.  So then I came home and took a 2 hour nap. Oh it was lovely. I'm still recovering. From it's greatness. Gah...gotta love sleep. :)***  Yes, and now I'm horribly bored. So I am gonna find something to do.  Au revoir you crizazies.

       Current Song: A New Found Glory- Hit or Miss   It's funny how a person can think upon many things, but acts upon so few. Shouldn't something insightful produce action rather than thought?  Just a *thought* that came to mind. Figured I should *act* upon it.  I had the strangest dream last night. However, I don't feel like posting it for the world to indulge in, so if you would like to ask me about it, I'll probably tell you.  K, nothing else to say. Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye crazies.

       Ma vie ne peut pas être décrit dans le mots...   Hmm...good day, as is becoming rather frequent. Remember back when a bad day was somewhat rare and out of place? I think my life is starting to be more like that again. Because I'm letting it. And because drama is overrated.  Looking up quotes...it's rather fun.  He who knows does not speak. He who speaks does not know.  -Lao-tzu   Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.  -Erica Jong   *Manda told me that one today...and isn't it so true?*   The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.  -e e cummings   Man is distinguished from all other creatures by the faculty of laughter.  -Joseph Addison   *I'd have to say that man is distinguished my many more things than just laughter.*   I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.  -Oscar Wilde   Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self.  -Cyril Connolly   *Ahh...I love that quote. It's very true...and I think there are certain people who should think on that one.*   You ask me why I do not write something....I think one's feelings waste themselves in words, they ought all to be distilled into actions and into actions which bring results.  -Florence Nightingale   *In a way, I suppose that's true...but words are a safe harbor to passive people.*   You have to know how to accept rejection and reject acceptance.  -Ray Bradbury   We do not write because we want to; we write because we have to.  -W. Somerset Maugham   Well, I'm done now. Au revoir crazies.

       Current Song: Ozma- Battlescars   Hmm...another day. What to say...what to say. Whoo, I rhymed, go me.  *yawn*...so much tiredness today. I've been wearing my contacts lately, and it's good, but it kinda sucks. Because I get to actually see my face clearer when i look in the mirror. Ugh...nightmare of breakouts.  Well, and blau.  "My life is just swell. Fuck off."  That was random.......wow, I really am tired. I'm going to go...be productive...or something. Though I don't have anything to really be productive on. That's okay though...I'll just randomly walk in circles n such.  I have the taste of vodka in my mouth. I don't know why. Kinda rather strange.  Okay, enough rambly-bambly shit. Adios crazies.

       Current Song: None   Ah....blah day. Started off good, and then I got home. And lately, life is repeating itself.   "Life isn't one damn thing after another...it's the same damn thing over and over."  Trying to figure out where I heard that quote.  Yeah, so, had a family discussion...well, that is, my mom, my brother and I. It wasn't a happy family discussion either...it was a depressing one. Like ones I remember from about a year ago. When shit around here sucked. Gah, none of us know what to do anymore. I sure as hell don't know what to do. I mean, I tried a year ago to solve things, and it obviously got me back to square one. It's like...not in my hands.  Sometimes it takes something seemingly bad to make things better.  You know what it's like to see someone who has just wasted away life? Like someone that is just like a perfect picture of hopelessness? Doesn't someone like that just...make you so depressed? Just to see someone like that...it brings your heart down...it makes you just sink a little. What if you had to see someone like that every day? The same person just wasting their life away? It drags you down...and I am being drug down day after day after day. I can't live with that anymore. I just can't do it. Two years of it is enough to drive a person to feel that their own life is hopeless. It's like watching a depressing movie over and over and over and over and over. After a while, everything just seems completely hopless and depressing. I mean, wouldn't that melancholy repetition just get to you? Life should be a more pleasant balance...sure, drama is necessary once in a while, to keep a person interested.  Anyways, the point I'm trying to get at is that being around such hopeless people all the time can have a horrible effect on a person. I wanna come home to a house that isn't a picture of such hopeless depression. And I want to be surrounded by people who are at least  somewhat  hopeful and optimistic.  Gah, that's all the ranting n such for today. Very sorry...I just had to vent a bit. Adios you crazies.

Things to do this week:  1)  Get my permit!  2)  Abolish all stupid/ditzy people from the face of the earth.  3)  Go to...that place...for...that thing.  4)  Work out and go running and such...more than once.  5)  Your mom. :-P  6)  Have something interesting/important to say in here.  7)  Not piss off  too  many people.

       Current Song: John Mayer- No Such Thing   Humm Humm...I wish it was summer. I love summer. It's so wonderful...It makes me so happy. Like nothing can bring me down. And nothing  can  bring me down. This summer will be one to remember...I  know  it. I'm just so ready to let go of everything. I wish summer could last forever. And ever and ever and ever. Because then I'd be happy forever. I mean, every day like today, every gray, cold, depressing day lasts forever. I am sitting here wondering how to make it through today, let alone the rest of winter. It just seems like it never ends...and summer is all too short. I live in the summer, and in the winter I just die so slowly.  I just got the inspiration to take my life and turn it around. How odd is that. It just sparked out of nowhere. This life I'm living...I don't need it anymore. I'm sick of hiding behind everything! I can't just sit here anymore...just sit here and waste everything away. Everything I used to be. I want to be everything I used to be, but I want to be more. I've grown dependent on everything that is ruining me, and it's time for me to let go. I've basked in misery for far too long.  I'm going to be happy. I'm going to live and I'm going to love it.  Well, enough rambling! Adios crazies!

       Current Song: Clint Mansell- Summer Overture   Yay. It's Friday kids. And...I'm grounded. How gay is that.  Today was pretty much a typical Friday...except for the school's LACK OF CHICKEN. Lunch is the highlight of my Fridays...and they have disappointed me. Me and Manda were quite angry. Did good on my French tests from yesterday and today. Sucked up my lesson. Came home and took a long and quite lovely nap. Then watched Signs.  What a day. So much lack of excitement. Well, I'm off to...sit here.  Au revoir you crazies.

I didn't think so..."  "...then you bring me home  cuz we both know what it's like to be alone  and i'm dreaming in your living room  but we don't have much room to live..."   Well, today was again rather typical. But aren't they all. I'm really looking for something different in my life, and I'm just getting the same repetition. And I'm hating it. However, some good memories from the past are catching up with me, and I really enjoy that. Just getting that feeling again...it's nice. But I'm looking for more...I'm always looking for more.  Well, computer is lagging so bad and I'm gonna go kill it now. Later crazies.

I'm just quite optimistic that things are going to take a turn for the better. I just have...this feeling. And God I hope it's right. Things are starting to make sense. Things are starting to get simpler. And simplicity is just perfect.  I just want to be different.  Cuz I'm not happy with who I am.  There are times when everyone rushes in and tries to be the hero. And then there are times when you really need someone to save you.  I'll leave it at that. Bye crazies.

       Current Song: None   Geez, I'm so happy.  No reason at all.  I just feel like, in light of everything...life works out. And, ya know, maybe it's just all in the way we approach our lives. If you don't expect anything good to ever come out of life, then nothing ever will. And if you don't have faith in yourself, then no one will. I know the feeling of faithlessness...it's empty and there's nothing to look forward to. But if you're going to have faith in ANYTHING, let it be in yourself. Because you've got control over that much.  I am content.  Catch ya later crazies.

       Current Song: Autopilot Off- Long Way To Fall   Damn I am addicted to this song. Hell, I'm addicted to this CD.  Today's a good day. I'm in a good mood. No reason really. I'm just optimistic...it's a nice change of pace.  I've realized that...well...I wish I was just happy all the time. And I try so hard, but I never seem to be able to do anything about it. If I'm in a good mood, then it's pure luck. I don't like that about me...I wish I could just have more control. I'm slipping back in to old "habits" lately, and it's kinda scary. I'm just scared to death that I'll end up really screwing myself over. And sure, there are alot of things I do that could screw me over, but what I'm talking about probably isn't what anyone reading this is thinking. If you're reading this, you probably don't even know. And that's probably for the best. I feel like I'm sort of talking to myself, and basically, I am, right? Haha. Oh well.  But all that's okay, because NOTHING is going to ruin my good mood today.   Bye crazies.

       Hey guys! Take our super quiz and find out:   Does He Like You???    1. You two are walking through the halls at school and a monkey flies by. He says:       A) "That monkey's cute, but nothing compares to your beauty."       B) "I didn't know your family was in town!"       C) "Hey, did that monkey just steal my banana?!"       D) "I didn't know monkeys were allowed at school."   2. The two of you are sitting at lunch eating mystery meat for the third day in a row. Your conversation includes:       A) "Let's ditch this lunch and makeout in the janitor's closet."       B) "This meat smells like  YOU !!"       C) "Hey, do you like see-food?"(At which point he proceeds to show you his chewed up food.)       D) "Is that a finger in my mystery meat?"   3. Aliens attack your school during third period.

C) "My family is here--I must return to Klyrp(or his home planet of choice)"       D) "Why couldn't this have happened second period during my math test?"   4.

To him you're as insignificant as that banana peel on the ground!   Mostly C's:   Well, it looks like there could be a budding romance in the near future, as long as you don't mind living on Klyrp. If you want to be with him, take up psychiatry.   Mostly D's:   Looks like you're just another stupid girl taking a pointless quiz out of another retarded teen magazine about a guy who's not interested.  Get a clue!    This Quiz was made by: Becka Isbell, Rae Hendrix, and Shauna Zajac   And if you just took this quiz, please go die.

       Current Song: MxPx- Tomorrow's Another Day   Sometimes what you really need is to know you still have people that care. In all of life's trials and disappointments, there is none too destructive or harmful if you have friends to stand beside you. And that is my life, for without those friends--and I do not speak so strongly of all of them, only the truest--I would have nothing. And I would be nothing. But I am much more than that. A bright future still awaits me somewhere, and as long as I have faith in that, then someone out there must certainly still have faith in me.  "One day can make your life. One day can ruin your life. All life is, is four or five big days that change everything." -Riding in Cars with Boys  Well, I just woke up and couldnt get back to sleep cuz I had a dream about snakes...and I can't go back to sleep after dreams like that. Yuck. Went to see LOTR last night...freakin owns. Get to clean today. How exciting.  Well, adios you crazies.

       Current Song: The Clash- London Calling    ~~So there was this movie with these scary clowns and they got hit in the face with pies. And then there was random sex on a rollercoaster. Wait...maybe that was me. Oh, and did I mention all the heroin? Yes...splendid really.~~   There you go. If it doesn't make sense...please don't ask.  So anyways, today was boring, and tomorrow will be relatively similar. As will the next day, and so forth until I die or something spectacular happens in my life. I'd kinda hope the latter...but I suppose I'll take what I can get.  You know, it's rather sad that I'm losing faith in so much. I want to change that, but I feel so incapable.  Mmk, well, have a nice evening crazies.

       Current Song: The Vandals- Oi To The World   My life is an ambitious work of art turned to a worthless shame. Captured on numerous 8 1/2 by 11 sheets of a lost passion that was once so vibrant and lively, it has now become the vaguely remembered past of the lifeless being I have become. It was once the portrait of youthful aspirations, engulfed with loving support. My words were eloquent yet simple and touching, flowing from the heart of such an innocent child. But I am the anti-masterpiece; the once wonderful, now shameful prize that past supporters scorn for their foolish faith in something so disappointing. My 8 1/2 by 11 sheets of paper are tucked away painfully in cluttered drawers, out of the eye of the public, and hidden from a shattered, empty heart. My words once so beautiful are crude and lifeless, and are the meak attempt to rebuild an innocence that is far beyond repair. My soul is now the image of blurred and lost dreams; a work of art that the world is unable to love.   Well, that's all crazies. Have a spiffy day.

       Current Song: Bad Religion- I Want To Conquer The World    Odd Coincidence of The Day   So Rachel and I go to Thrift Town and Sonic today, then drive around my neighborhood a bit. Here's the weird things:  *The lady at Thrift Town points out that both of our totals are $5.06.  *We order a few things at Sonic, but specify no sizes, and they didn't even ask. Our total: $5.06.  *We are driving through my neighborhood and note that all the addresses are 400's, 500's and 600's. But there are no 506's. Anywhere.  *We are at a dead end, so Rachel casually picks a driveway and turns around. I happened to glace down at the mailbox post. It was 605. Read upward: 506.  *We also note that my address is 512. Half of 12 being 6. 506.  Yes yes. Rather interesting little tidbit for you all there.  Well, I'm off. Chase the 506's crazies.

       Current Song: Autopilot Off- Nothing Frequency   Hmm. So many things on my mind, and yet so hard to say.  I kinda feel like I'm losing alot, but in the end, maybe I'll end up gaining more.  I think that all in all, the good and the bad in our lives can be justified in some way. I think that the bad we have to endure in life will only make us truly appreciate the good, that, in my case, is yet to come. I actually feel bad for people who never have to deal with pain and suffering. Because life will never be as wonderful and prized to them as it is to the people who know what it's like to lose. So, I guess that that makes me luckier than all of those people I've envied so much. I mean, sometimes I just ask myself how much more of this I can take before I'll break. The funny thing is that I'm growing a stronger independence. I'm just waiting for the big turn around. The one I just wish would happen.  Well, g'night crazies.

       Current Song: Homegrown- Surfer Girl   I think that slowly I've been losing alot of myself. I just have no one anymore. I don't think that I even have myself anymore. For some off reason I feel this sort of betrayal by everyone. I guess I'm just not really a people person. I guess I don't know who I am anymore. And I'm so sick of everyone. My family, my "friends", you know, I honestly don't know what I'm doing anymore. Or even what I'm fucking saying right now.  The only thing I can think of is how much I absolutely hate life. How I hate every aspect of it. And maybe that's sinning in some way, and maybe it's my fault, but I don't know what to change.  I hate being like this. I hate how I am. I'm just done. I've got to stop relying on people, because I  hate  people. And by people I am encompassing just about everyone, give or take maybe one or two people, who I can't really even think of at the moment.  Honestly, I'm so frustrated. I've just got to get out of this.

       Current Song: Glassjaw- Tip Your Bartender   I know that it's a common thing to look at pieces of someone's life and say "I want to be more like that" or "I want to try to handle that sort of situation like they did."  But do you ever feel that piece by piece, someone else is taking  your  life and making it their own. I mean, those little piece of your personality that make you who you are, are being used by someone else. Like they use your example, but they don't even acknowledge you ever. In fact, they may very well completely dislike you, but they mimic certain traits about you. Sure, seemingly childish jealous, true? Perhaps, but if someone were to take your unique character and make it their own...wouldn't you find that a bit upsetting? Proof that individuality is a game of trying to figure out who the  true  individual is. In most cases, it's usually not who you think. The one who flaunts their "individuality" is usually the one who truly lacks it.  A few thoughts to ponder. Farewell crazies.

       Current Song: Evanescence- Bring Me To Life   I am listening to the best song ever. These lyrics...they are MINE. Unbelievably mine.    How can you see into my eyes  like open doors. Leading you down into my core  where I've become so numb. Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold  until you find it there and lead it back home.  Wake me up.  Wake me up inside.   I can't wake up.   Wake me up inside.   Save me.   Call my name and save me from the dark.   Wake me up.   Bid my blood to run.   I can't wake up.   Before I come undone.   Save me.   Save me from the nothing I've become.   Now that I know what I'm without you can't just leave me. Breathe into me and make me real Bring me to life.  Wake me up.  Wake me up inside.   I can't wake up.   Wake me up inside.   Save me.   Call my name and save me from the dark.   Wake me up.   Bid my blood to run.   I can't wake up.   Before I come undone.   Save me.   Save me from the nothing I've become.   Bring me to life.  I've been living a lie There's nothing inside.  Bring me to life.  Frozen inside without your touch, without your love, darling. Only you are the life among the dead.  All of this sight I can't believe I couldn't see Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me  I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems. I've got to open my eyes to everything.  Without a thought Without a voice Without a soul   Don't let me die here There must be something wrong. Bring me to life.  Wake me up.  Wake me up inside.   I can't wake up.   Wake me up inside.   Save me.   Call my name and save me from the dark.   Wake me up.   Bid my blood to run.   I can't wake up.   Before I come undone.   Save me.   Save me from the nothing I've become.   Bring me to life. I've been living a lie There's nothing inside.  Bring me to life   You people do not understand how that song is like MY song. I own it. Screw Evanescence...that song is no longer their's. It's mine.  Those lyrics are like screaming "Here's Shauna. Come and get her."  It's like the words I have on the tip of my tongue all the time.  It's insane, crazies. It's just insane.

       Story Of The Night!   Wow...tonight was CRAZY. Okay, hafta tell the story.  So, me, Rachel and Becky go to Chili's. And we sit down, and these 2 girls are sitting diagonal from us. And I notice that every time I talk..the brunette girl stares. So i was like nervously glancing over there every few minutes like "why the hell is she staring at me..." Then her blonde friend starts turning around and looking at me, and looking back, and they keep saying stuff. So, this goes on for about 10 minutes, and by that time I was anxious to leave because they were making me completely uncomfortable. Then all of a sudden, the brunette walks over and is like "My friend and I have noticed that you've been staring at me and I wanna know if you have a problem with me or something." *Ironic, because wait...I haven't been staring. Damn bitches.* So I immediately get like pissed and I'm like "Ya know..I don't recall that  I  was staring at you." And she was like "Hey, you don't have to get an attitude with me." And so I'm like "Actually, I think I can get an attitude if I want, thanks." So she goes "If you wanna get an attitude then we can take this outside." And I was just like "No, ya know what...I'm good." So we had gotten our check already, we pay and leave. Guess who follows. The two bitches. By the way, they look like they're in college or something, and I honestly wonder how much of a life they would have to have to be that GAY. So I see them following and I'm all like "Excuse me...do you have a problem." And the brunette starts cussing and being gay, and then comes up and slaps me. So Rachel drops her car keys, which Becky grabs to get our getaway van. Rachel punches the bitch in the face  so damn hard , and she's totally out of the fight. Then this blonde bitch comes after me, and tries to like restrain me or something, but I punch  her  in the face and kicked her a few times, until Becky shows up with the van and we HAUL ASS outta there. Oh my gosh...it was the craziest thing ever.  Wow. Is that not like...a crazy story? Yeah, all you people who are like "Shauna's a pansy"...wait till I get that adrenaline. I just felt like this rush of anger, and I just totally went out on the one girl. And when Rachel punched the brunette that was bitching in the first place, it was like the coolest thing ever to watch. I wanted to scream "owned bitch!", but I was too busy owning the other one.  Ahhhhh crazy. Well, I could probably go on alot longer, but I think that I'll just quit for now.  G'night crazies.

       Current Song: None   I'm listening to an entertaining little song being sung by a bird outside my window right now. It chirps in a four-note tune. The first two notes sound beautiful and eloquent, but the last two sound clown-ish and mocking. It makes me wonder how a bird like that could ever be taken seriously. It makes a delightful first impression, but as you listen more intently, his song is ruined by his foolishness. When I first listened, I was so delighted by the first two notes that I mistook the 2nd two notes being played. I pictured the tune in my head that I wanted to hear, but as I listened closer...I heard that the third note was a sharp, shreeking noise, and that the fourth sounded horrible.  I've been thinking about that, and making a connection between that bird and people, in that people, like the bird's song, can be horribly deceiving. They make a cunning first impression, and from that people assume that their full character  must  reflect that delightfulness that they had first witnessed. And so they become blind to the flaws that consume the rest of who that person is. But sometimes you have to look a bit deeper, listen a bit close, to find out who they really are.  Think about that, crazies.

       Current Song: System Of A Down- Prison Song   Man, I feel good. And no, it doesn't correlate to the occasion of today, which I won't mention.  I love getting outside on beautiful days like today. It's so wonderful. My mood got 100% better by just spending about an hour or so outside. Actually, it was about 2 hours. I really feel great right now. I'm starting my diet and workout stuff as of today. I think tomorrow I'm gonna focus on doing a kickboxing workout...I still remember all my workouts n stuff. Way cool. I really don't feel like being much of a people person tonight...I just need tonight to be sorta calming and nice. And I don't want to hafta change out of my running clothes.  Mmm...I'm gonna go find something to do. Good day, crazies.

       Ma Vie Ne Peut Pas Etre Decrit Dans Le Mots   *My Life Can Not Be Described In Words*  You know...I don't think anyone truly appreciates the summer like I do. Because there is no one that hates winter the way I do. No one has quite the passion I have about summer. I take it all in. I grasp every moment. Because the season is so fleeting, that I can't let it slip through my fingers without loving every moment. Even when things get me down...I may be a little upset, but it's a calming sort of pain. Mmm...it's the most wonderful thing in the world. I wish I wasn't so depressed in the winter. You can't imagine what it's like to feel as though you're only living half of a full life. If I were to keep living like this, and I died at 60, it'd be like dying at 30.  I'm listening to a good song. It's cheering me up a little bit.  *Sometimes I fear that I'll daydream my life away. I'll just wake up one day and realize that none of it is real.*  See you crazies tomorrow.

       Current Song: The Distillers- Ask The Angels   Today, my blog will have substance. I hope.  Sometimes people really, honestly puzzle me. Because it seems that people have this  un -natural (I stress "un", because I know it's not always the norm) tendency to degrade others in an attempt to upgrade themselves. But why? Does an individual really have any right or  ability  to judge other people based on immeasurable standards? Or even on measurable standards...in the case that they haven't measured them. I mean, where do people go along saying that they're "prettier" or "smarter" or "better" than anyone else?   "Hi. Let me take a minute to 'prove' your inferiority to me."   I just don't understand why people have to make everyone inferior to them. Like no one else is worthy of their presence or their time. People just act as though they have a better grasp on life than anyone else. Like everyone else is so much less intelligent. And sometimes, they succeed in making others feel worthless. But you want to know the truth about these people?  They aren't better than anyone.   And I've felt it a thousand times...where someone has to knock you down to boost themselves up.  Or where people brag to make you feel insignificant. I just hate people like that. Because their release of low self esteem is to put others down...and my release of low self esteem is to take it.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  In other news...   that is all.  Have a lovely day crazies. I'll catch ya later.

       Current Song: All-American Rejects- Swing Swing   Hmm...I've been thinking alot lately. Just about everything...like how much I'm screwing up life.  I wish things were so simple. But things will never be simple, and wishing wont get me very far. Sometimes I just feel so hopeless. But I try to keep in mind that there's always hope for the future.   *~Smile for the day that lies ahead, and give hope that tomorrow will come with good intentions. Value the days when laughter filled the air, and the sky cast it's vast beauty amongst the Earth from end to end. Desire to touch your childhood memories, and wish to grasp a tranquil summer's eve.  Remember your love of the past, give hope for the future, and the present will be of little worry. ~*   Something I always like to keep in mind. I wrote it a long time ago, but I like to read it whenever things get crazy. There's something about that last sentence that always offers the little bit of hope I'm needing.  Just found something else in My Documents that goes hand in hand with the above quote:  *~The odds are against me but I force on through troubled waters.  I pray that fate will be a gentle guide down the river of my life, so interrupted by the crashing waves of a violent storm.  But I know that every storm will break, and that a rainbow will pierce through the darkened clouds.  The ocean is a cycle; tide to tide, dawn to dusk.  All bad will fade, and all good will prevail in the end.  So as the winds fiercely rip at my heart, and the tears drench my tired face, I hold my head high, keep my eyes toward the sky and wait for that tiny gleam of sunlight to shine through the clouds.  Hope is infallible.~*  Well, have a nice day crazies.

       Current Song: Boston- More Than A Feeling   The thought sprung in my head that good days are simply perception. They are the perception of acheiving goals, maintaining desires, and grasping tranquility. Then, given that we all know how to perceive such emotions, why do we have bad days?  Perhaps we lack faith in the strength of these emotions. With that being said, then perhaps a primary reason for our bad days is the lack of faith in ourselves.  Just a thought.   Anyways, I woke up a little while ago, so I'm still kinda sleepy. Well, not much else to say.  I'm off to perceive a good day. C-ya crazies.

       Current Song: Homegrown- Give It Up    urlLink     Where do you fall on the liberal - conservative political spectrum?  (United States)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    haha. Politics. I can sorta get in to politics, but only on a philosophical sort of level. I love philosophy. On the other hand, I hate politics on an issue by issue basis. I can't get in to that boring, monotonous shit. I like the full spectrum of things. I can get into political theories and stuff. I think that's why i enjoy reading stuff from Ayn Rand and George Orwell. Because of their great political views and stuff. But man...I'm definately not the type to like get in to all the world matters and business and shit. I just hear briefly and vaguely about what's going on.  Anyways, enough political bullshit. I give this "wonderful democracy" about 100 more years tops. Because there are alot of weaknesses in our government. However, I won't go in to detail about those opinions, because, frankly, I'm not that bored.  Ok, adios you crazies.

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- Nervous In The Alley   Hmm..I found some song lyrics that really apply to me. Great song:    "I don't want to be the one who's old before their time And loose the wonder that I felt as a child  I can't run this race believing I might lose  There's still so much to see, so much left to do  *~Yes I'll fall before I fly But no one can say I never tried~*  Oh we just get one Ride around the sun In this dream of time It goes so fast That one day we look back And we ask...Was that my life   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them All those sunny days and all those starry skies Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights   *~I can't tell them enough Just how much that they are loved~*  Oh we just get one Ride around the sun In this dream of time  It goes so fast  That one day we look back And we ask...Was that my life..."   Great song. Beautiful. :-)  Well, that's about all kids. Luv ya, crazies.

       Current Song: Mad Caddies- Monkeys   Ah man. I had a really depressing dream last night.  You see, in my dream, I was with this one guy, and we were both like really hating life..and it was just a really really dark dream. Very sad. So we ended up locking ourselves up in this one place...in this room that didnt have any windows. For a very long time. Like weeks and weeks. And the whole time i just sat there going through fits. I was just going crazy. I had no sunlight, and no one to help me. He left alot...he was quite into the drugs, and need his fix rather often. So it ended up mostly being just me. Completely alone in a small dark room going crazy. I was so hurt emotionally, so depressed that I couldn't even imagine living. After several weeks, I left. I came back out to the world, I guess you could say. But the sad thing was, I felt so lost. Life didn't just brighten up as I'd hoped it would. I felt just as helpless as I had all alone. And it ended kinda happy-like. Except for one thing.   I   wasn't happy. I mean, talk about a dark dream. It had this message that life is hopeless. Funny thing is, I woke up in a good mood this morning. But I think that's because my room was really warm, and it just felt so nice to wake up to.  Yeah, so...today will be good. Because if I wake up in a good mood, then it has to be good. It's the rules.  Well, not much else to say. Au revoir crazies.

       Current Song: The Ataris- The Hero Dies In This One   I didn't go to school today. I just didn't feel like it. I've gotta start all over again...making things simple and happy. I don't like having to start all over. I wish I wasn't running around in circles all the time. Which is why I have to just move on. Again.  I have something to do today. Something important. Well, not of some amazing importance, but something that is gonna help me get up on my feet again. And it's going to make me happy. I need to take care of that today.  A day off can really be refreshing. I'm definately feeling better than I was yesterday. I think another part of me moving on is figuring out who my friends are. What's funny is that my friends are who they've always been...I've just failed to take notice in all the chaos of everything.  I want to get back to being content. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  On another note, I've done nothing exciting lately. Nothing is really that exciting.  God, I am sick of posting about all this stupid shit. All this blah blah life sucks but it'll get better...who cares?  Things are fine. Everything is fine. People overreact about everything. I'm very VERY guilty of that. Haha, ahhhhhhh, whhhy do I overreact?   No more overreacting.  That's my goal for the rest of my life. No more freaking out over stupid shit.  Well, crazies, I have things to do today. Later.

       How can you have a beautiful ending without making beautiful mistakes?   I like that quote. I like it alot. It says more about me than you could ever imagine.  "...The leaves are scattered on the ground I miss the seasons, and the comfort of your smile.   Sometimes this all feels like a dream I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up, from this life...."   ...As I sit here all alone I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on When your gone...  I'll never be the same without you I love you more than you will ever know..."  ..Do you ever feel like crying? Do you ever feel like giving up? I raise my hands up towards the sky I say this prayer for you tonight Because nothing is impossible."  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Well, I went to the races today.  It sucked.  Blah.  Make beautiful mistakes, crazies.

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- Automatic   I've been doing alot of thinking lately.  What's new.  I've just been thinking about why some people feel this need to impress everyone. It's like they're different around everyone just so they can fit in. It's annoying, and it's fake.  I hate fakes.  But I just don't get how people can change their opinions so easily to conform with what someone else thinks. Or how they model their opinions so that everyone can see how godly, intelligent, and moral they are. You know what I think?  Who cares!  I feel that if you feel the need to prove morality and intelligence to someone, then maybe you're just trying to fool yourself.   So why don't you just go dig a hole, climb in, and prove yourself to the dirt. It's obviously got more substance than you do.   Rants. Must love rants. I feel like ranting alot. But I'm kinda sad about stuff, and when things get me down, I tend to rant in this broad, generalized fashion.  Sometimes, things really suck. And escaping your problems doesn't fix that. And it's too bad I haven't learned that yet. See, I could preach to people that escaping your problems won't make them go away, but I know that I don't take that advice. I'm still off looking for ways to make my problems magically disappear or just clear up, without ever really facing them.  And so what? It's a learning process. Everything in life is a learning process.  You have to break every rule before you can truly enforce it.  That's my theory at least. I think that doing otherwise is narrow-minded.  Yeah, maybe I'll eventually figure out how to deal with things better.   I just hate when everything you want seems so far out of reach.   Well, crazies, that's enough ranting for today. Adios.

I guess I'm just going through some down time. It really sucks because lately I've just been feeling so wonderful, and then I dug myself into a hole I've already been in before. I just can't care. I have to stop caring about stuff and move on.  "Baby, baby stay Stay right where you are I like it this way It's good for my heart I haven't felt like this In God knows how long I know everything's gonna be okay If you just stay gone."  Hmmm...stuff sucks and wow. But I'll get over it. I'll dig myself out of this and it'll all be for the better.  Faith in better days, crazies. C-ya.

       Current Song: Cursive- The Night I Lost The Will To Fight   I hate school. And I can't figure out whether I think too much or I just don't think enough.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I am ordinary.  I am typical. People don't have to prove themselves to me, I don't care. And I don't feel the need to prove myself to  anyone.  People don't have to be extraordinary to see eye to eye with me. I can see eye to eye with most people. You don't have to be on some godly level to measure up...please don't try to be on that level. I'm not, I'm nowhere near, and I never will be. And that's fine. I have expectations for myself, but those expectations aren't to be the smartest or the prettiest or the richest or the greatest at anything. I don't want to be outstanding; I don't want to be amazing. I don't think I could be if I tried. My expectations are high, but they don't revolve around proving anything to anyone. I don't need to feel competitive with anyone. I don't want to fight with the world to prove myself in any way. I don't want to be spectacular. I don't care if the people around me are extraordinary either. Extraordinary has nothing to do with being beautiful or intellectual or successful, but extraordinary has become that. So I don't care about extraordinary. I'm fine with typical. Typical makes me happy, and happiness is the only thing I care about in this world. If I'm happy, I mean, If I'm completely happy, then I've met every expectation on my list. Call me an under-achiever, I'd call myself an over-achiever.  So while the world is out there trying to be "beautiful" and "intellectual" and "successful", I'll just sit back and try to be happy. While the world is modeling their looks,  throwing their heads into books, working to get into 'top 5' colleges, trying to make it into a high paying proffession...I'll be meeting my goals. And by the time the world gets as far as their goals can take them, and when they seem on top of the world, I'll be happy. And my, how puzzled they may be, as I smile back at them as they bask in their success. Because I'll never see the world on a different level. The world will never outrun me. As long as I am happy, no one will ever be too far out or reach. No matter how extraordinary the world becomes, I will stay typical. I will stay ordinary.  But I'm content with ordinary.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, I suppose I've just gone and run off with myself.  Go on; be extraordinary, crazies. I'll see ya later.

I woke up this morning and I felt all shaky and I could hardly walk. But I figure once my body gets adjusted to ketosis, then I shouldn't have that problem.  I haven't been doing much lately. I've been lazy...really lazy. I'm sort of on this mission to recreate myself. Mentally, physically and emotionally. It's a project that I hope I'm able to accomplish.   I HATE FAKES.

So hooray to that, I won't be going naked to banquet this year.  Saturday night was crazy. haha. Oh my gosh. Grape Schnapps is the worst stuff ever. There is nothing worse.  Nothing.  Me and Rachel had to drink that nasty nasty CRAP. I almost died. We even tried mixing it with coke. Didn't help. Only made it that much worse. Also, I spilled Grape Schnapps, Grape juice and whiskey in my room. Congrats, Shauna. Then, at FIVE am Sunday morning we went for donuts dressed like crazies, and then got followed by a crazy white car.  Yesterday, went to Six Flags, and saw this great band with this super super hot guitar player. Wow, he was hot. And then he came up and talked to us, which was mucho coolness. Did I mention that he was amazingly hot?  Yes, well, that's about all. I'm starting my  diet  today. Wish me luck.  Crazies make the world taste better. Later.

It was absolutely wonderful, and I'm very picky, so that says alot. Well, of course, they don't have my size. But I swear to God I will wear that dress or I'll go naked. I'm hoping they can specialy order my size. Because GAH I need that dress. The one size I tried on was just a BIT too small, and all the other sizes were huge.  But it's so pretty.... :(  Oh, also this:    Well, I'll talk to you crazies later. Leave me something in my chatterbox, k? Adios.

       Current Song: The Ataris- so long, astoria   Well hello crazies. It's nice to be back.  I got back from Florida yesterday. Man, what good times.  We got there Saturday and went to Epcot, though our flight didn't get to stay very long, because we got there last. Sunday we went to Magic Kingdom, and then had to march in our lovely parade. I kept thinking that it was going to rain during the parade, but no. It had to be burning hot instead. Oh, but afterwards it rained! That was pretty nice too, because we needed that cool weather. Haha, and let's not talk about Me, Manda and Candace's little freak out incident when we got back to Epcot. :-P  So then Monday we went to MGM, and that super cool. Me, Manda, Brad, and Neal got stuck doing this show in the backlot tour. Let's talk about that. So we're walking up to get in line for it, and this lady like pulls us aside and asks us to do the show, and we didn't even agree before she like shoved us back into this little room-like thing where we had to take off our shoes and sock, put on nasty, smelly black boots and this blue suit. I can not describe the stench of that thing. It was the worst thing I have ever smelled. So then, we get to go get water drenched on us. I was the mechanic, so I got it the worst of all. Lovely. So for the rest of the day we smelled absolutely horrid. Then the four of us plus Stuart and Sharon all went back to Magic Kingdom for a little while, until it closed. Then, on Tuesday we went to Universal Studio's Islands of Adventure. That was lots of fun. Well, after we got back, they told us they were going to wake us up at 3 a.m. So our room (Me, Candace, Amanda and Espi) decided that there was no point in sleeping. Well, one frappuccino and 5 cups of coffee later, it was 3 and we were off the walls. By the time we had to get on the buses, I think everyone else wanted us dead. I actually heard people saying things like "oh my gosh, someone shut them up!" But oh well, good for them, I found it rather amusing. Even the chaperones were getting rather angry. So our plane got home first, because we had a straight flight, unlike the other two, and so I went out to IHOP with my family, then came home and took a 6 hour nap. It was nice. Also getting 12 hours of sleep last night was quite grand.  Well, that's my trip. We had a damn good time, and now I'm finally all rested up.  So, that's all I have to say. I'm out, crazies.

       Current Song: Hot Rod Circuit- The Pharmacist   Hmm...today was nothing out of the ordinary. It never really is. I have this feeling that I'm anticipating a change of pace that might never come. I don't want to be let down, but I don't want to become faithless that things can change, and turn around.  I used to despise change. I was the type of child who loathed the idea of altering my daily routine of life. I became accustomed to a certain order of things, and I would attack anything or anyone that tried to change that. From the time I woke up, to the time I went to bed, I liked everything to be a certain way as I knew it. If some small detail altered, I freaked out. But, obviously, things eventually started to change.That routine started to ruin me, and I grew more and more sick of it. In fact, I was downright disgusted with it. To this day, routine life is something I can handle no more than I can slitting my own wrists. Because it's something that would slowly drag me down. Slowly and painfully. I've become more spontaneous; I like change, and I enjoy just being unpredictable.  Because if life isn't unpredictable, then what hope is there for the future?   Well, I'm outta here to study for crazy stupid finals. Be crazy, crazies.

       Current Song: AFI- Exsanguination   Life is like playing a long, exhausting piece of music. Every note is just another chance to either make something amazing of it, or completely ruin it. Once you miss more and more notes, it becomes harder to salvage the integrity of the piece. And your audience is full of skeptics and critics and composers who are sure they gave you your only opportunity, and feel they have the ability and overwhelming right to take it all away. You typically start off playing lively and attentively, mastering articulations and dynamics, and trying with all your effort to capture the essence of what has been laid in front of you. But after a while, that liveliness drones off into a monotonous stride through notes and rhythms.  You become so bored with this once wonderful piece of music, that you start missing all your accidentals, and other little unique bumps in the road. Sometimes you have the urge to simply stop playing all together. But you drudge through and eventually find yourself perking up as the style begins to change, and your interest is reinstated in the piece. And soon enough you find yourself in a grand, regal finale, and as you near the end, you kinda wish you could go back and play it again; go back and correct your mistakes, and make the most of it. But your music isn't lined with repeats, so you do your best to turn your finale into something spectacular; and if you fight your way vigorously through the end, your audience will be quite pleased.   There...stupid band got the best of me.  Thank God I'm quitting.  Well, I'm gonna go do some homework or something. Play vigorously, crazies.

       Current Song: Thursday- Jet Black New Year   I have many things to say. But I just don't feel like saying them all.  I feel like my life is on a timer. And, well, technically it is, but I have this feeling of running out of time. Isn't it odd? I feel like if I don't take care or certain things, then they'll never get done. There's alot I'd like to say right now...but I'll get around to it. All in good time. Some of it is good, some is bad, and all of it is to my benefit. Things are going to start working out for me...because I'm going to make them. And not in the raving, evil bitch style that some people prefer...but I'm going to do things the right way. What's funny is I'm confusing myself right now. My head is lost right now.  I don't think I will ever understand how people can so willingly shelter themselves from the world. How they can be so judgemental of people, and of actions and things that they refuse to even understand. Shame on you mindless followers. People are hypocrites. They claim to be so unique, and insist that their minds are so superior and different and they think unlike anyone else. Well guess what?  You aren't special.   You act as though you're some connoiseur of the world, while you refuse to even give anything a try. How much can one actually know without first hand experience? Very little.  When you refuse to have an open mind, and to be objective, you simply become another mindless follower.  Well, I have kickboxing in a little bit, hooray! Actually it's in like 2 1/2 hours. Haha.  Mmm, times are good. They could be better, and hopefully they will be. But nevertheless, I'm content.  Be open-minded, crazies. And love your local hippie.

       Current Song: Mad Caddies- Monkeys   Why do we plot such a beautiful, dramatic destruction of ourselves?  Why is it that we lose concern for our future, and our well being? And why don't we care? Why do we allow or lives to spiral in a downfall to such depths of destruction? Why...because our recovery is beautiful. We lose control, and we lose ourselves. A lost soul is a painful thing, but in the end, it's findings are lovely. Falling astray is a thrill, a dramatic escape.  I'm sick of drama. Sick of the downfalls, and the recoveries. I'm well over the destruction.  I think my randomness is complimentary of my extreme fatigue.  Keep it random, crazies.

       Current Song: None   Banquet was awesome. Everyone was lovely, and everything was lovely. Fantastic time.  I'm tired.  People are changing so much. I'm certainly no exception, and certainly not complaining. I like change. I think people have every right to do whatever they want with their lives. Change can be a beautiful thing. I'm confused. About alot of things. I don't know what I want...or what I'm supposed to want. I am torn in a million different directions. I keep saying I'm going to just run with things, and just take risks and chances...but I don't. I feel kind of like I'm falling behind in many different ways. I don't feel horridly depressed. I feel sad. I feel a little down. I'm just kind of stuck. I'm sitting at a crossroad with a million different paths, and I couldn't begin to know which way to turn. There is no continuing where I'm heading, because I've already forgotten where I came from. Everyone else is moving along. Why can't I? It's hard to smile. Impossible not to sigh. But I'm not complaining, as long as I don't sit idle for too long. I just want to move on.  Ahhh, on a lighter note...omg Amanda I so want to put a certain something in here, but umm...I wouldn't want to come off as so much of a huge bitch as someone else. Hahahahaha, jesus, so great.  I feel tired. And sick. And sad. But I'll get over it all. Definately the first 2...hopefully the third as soon as possible. It's typical.  Have fun, crazies. Later.

       Current Song: AFI- ...but home is nowhere   Well, the days have not been bad.  Man, I love this song. You just have no idea.  Today's been a bit of a downer. I hate to say it, but i needed this. Sometimes I need to sigh a little bit, rather than just pretend that I'll be happy forever. I can't pretend that that sort of thing would ever happen. I don't like to pretend.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I've been happy lately. I am happy. Things are good and life isn't worth getting all melodramatic over. But today was just the kind of day that's typical of being human. It's this kind of blah and sadness that I haven't had in a long time. Longer than I can recall. It's just a normal feeling of being down. It's not extreme. And that's why it's so unusual. Because I'm always at extremes. Today calmed me down from that streak of foolish, unruly happiness. About 2 weeks ago I had this horrible breakdown in the midst of my happy streak. It was soo strange. I was just sitting, folding towels like normal, and suddenly I felt weighted down. I felt stressed, and I felt tense, like I was going to snap. I started screaming at my mom and just spazzing out and I still have no idea why. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, hyperventilating, going crazy...and I don't know why. And then I started crying. I was bawling and sobbing so hard, for like 15 to 20 minutes. Then I just stopped. I sat there and just blanked out, stared off, and my mind went blank. It was like I had no more emotions left in me. I was drained. It was frightening, but calming.  But today isn't like that. It's more normal, it's just nice. I feel drained of emotions, but in a good way, and without the extremes beforehand.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not a dramatic person. I despise drama. I typically don't like talking about blah-de-blah stupid shit. It was just an interesting little occurance that I suddenly felt compelled to write about. I hate drama. The way people wind themselves up in their intricate little soap opera story lines. Life isn't a drama. Life's meant to be enjoyed, not plagued and torn and scattered. So collect yourselves, you insecure children, and learn to stop worrying about things.  Don't stress over the past, because it's too late; relax in the present, because nothing is as urgent as you make it; and take the future in strides, because things will take care of themselves.   Life's too short to place tears where there could be laughter.  Well, tomorrow is banquet (hooray!), and I have a room to clean and a hairstyle to pick out.  Stop the drama, crazies.

       Current Song: None   Yep, I'm gonna post a quiz, but I haven't done any in like 50 million years, so don't bitch at me. :-P    You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    There, there. I'm done now.  Later, crazies!

       Current Song: Rancid- Ruby Soho   Hmm...another boring day. Happy Easter, kids.  I have finally realized that I need a change. I big one. I'm sick of my surroundings. I need a little more excitement. A little bit more variety. I need new things, and new people. No, not  all  new people, but you know. This past week I've been sorta doing different things, and I really really enjoy that. Because I wasn't stuck around the same old people doing the same old things all the time. I don't understand how people can be content living like that.  I'm looking for new things.  *On another note...I had the best dream in the world last night. I woke up feeling so happy. And I don't remember a thing about my dream. Awesome.*  Find new things, crazies.

       Current Song: The Beatles- Yellow Submarine   I'm so tired. Today has been boring. Also, I'm really dizzy.  I had kickboxing this morning. Then I came home, got a shower, and just layed around my room all day. Today felt nice. I opened my windows and sorta soaked it all in. The weather made me optimistic of good things. Good things that...that I just wish would happen.  Well, I'm so tired. I'm outta here.  Make good things happen, crazies.

Stupid I-net blows.  I should probably go to bed soon, because I have to wake up for kickboxing tomorrow morning.  Fun.  "I love to eat each and every sprinkle...as I watch the stars twinkle."~~~ You can thank Rachel for that lovely quote. Bah hah.  Well, I think I'm gonna go and probably sleep.  Live wildly, crazies.

       Current Song: The Used- Buried Myself Alive   Hmm, time to update.  I am sick. It sucks. And I'm so sad and pansy-ish when I'm sick. *sobbing, whining, moping...that's me.*  Oh, also I was talking to Rachel and I came up with a constant, and mostly accurate (though not completely), name theorem.   The Name Theorem    Part One:     Guys with a first name containing four letters are hot.   Some famous examples:     Brad Pitt                                               Sean William Scott                                               "Drue" from "Flying Machine" *hell yeah...what a sexy man*    Part Two:     Girls with a first name containing six letters kick ass.   Some of the best examples:      Shauna Zajac                                                     Rachel Hendrix                                                    Amanda Carter    Part Three:     Guys with a first name containing six letters are not very cool.    Part Four:     Girls with a first name containing four letters are also not very cool.    Note: Parts One and Two in comparison to Parts Three and Four can be referred to as "The Opposite Factor". You see, the opposite of "cool" is "not cool", therefore the opposite number of letters in a person of the same sex must be opposite in character traits.    Part Five:     All persons with a first name containing any other number of letters are indifferent. No one really cares.    Part Six:     A six:four or four:six ratio is a damn good combination.    Note: The Name Theorem is somewhat erroneous. If you believe an error has occured, go back and re-check your work. If the error is not in your work, then please consider that The Name Theorem may not necessarily apply to you. And then again, it just might.    End.   Haha yeah. I get pretty bored. No, don't be some bitch/asshole if that offended you. I wasn't going for offensiveness, so chill and go shoot yourself or something.  Well, that's about all I really have to say. Catch ya later crazies.

       Current Song: Chevelle- Send The Pain Below   I'm bored. So I decided to post something.  I'm so glad things are starting to look up for me lately. I've been really happy lately. You know, maybe I really do have some sort of seasonal depression...because this could possibly be due to the season changes...or even the fact that I've been working out a bunch lately. Nevertheless...whatever the reasons, this is good.  "...it's hard to see the pain behind a mask; bearing the burden of a secret storm, sometimes she wishes she was never born."  Ughh, I'm actually having some shitty allergies as of late. Typically, I really don't have bad allergies, but occasionally my eyes get watery and I sneeze a bunch. Ehh, no biggie. I'm kinda having trouble breathing too...and I can tell it's allergy related. I have this whole breathing thing where my sternum gets inflamed and blocks my lungs from expanding all the way sometimes...but that doesn't happen too often and it's a different sort of feeling. Haha it's crazy weird.  Anyways, that's enough rambling. Stay cool, crazies.

       Current Song: No Use For A Name- This Is A Rebel Song   Lately, alot of people have been asking about the whole "crazies" thing, so I figure that I'll share with you all where I get it from. It's from No Use For A Name's "This Is A Rebel Song". Great song. Umm, here are the lyrics...I think you'll get it.   I love you my hard englishman Your rage is like a fist in my womb Can't you forgive what you think I've done And love me, I'm your woman  And I desire you my hard englishman And there is no more natural thing So why should I not get loving Don't be cold englishman  how come you never said you love me in all the time you've known me how come you never say you're sorry  i do  Oh please talk to me englishman What good will shutting me out get done  Meanwhile crazies are killing our sons  Oh listen, englishman  I've honored you hard englishman Now I am calling your heart to my own Oh let glorious love be done Be truthful englishman  how come you never said you love me in all the time you've known me how come you never say you're sorry  i do i do   So there you go. Finally.  Anyways I'm really tired, so I'm thinking a nap is quite called for.  Have a lovely day, crazies.

       Current Song: Finch- What It Is To Burn   Ouch. My legs are going to fall off. And I don't even know what I did. But it hurts like crazy and I look like a gay ass when I walk, cuz my upper thighs are in super major pain. Also I have kickboxing at 10 tomorrow morning. Watch me die. :(  Today was good, by the way. Got progress reports, which is good when you have like a damn blow off semester. Had a test in Algebra that I thought was gonna be super hard, but then it was easy. And by saying that, I will jinx myself. I jinx myself alot. Like the other day my brother was sick and I was like "bah hah loser...at least I'm not sick." And the next morning, I woke up, and my throat hurt sooooooo bad. Luckily it went away after about 2 days.   pwnt:  CrazyLikeTHAT 87: nub SmarterChild: Um, that's you!  Haha greatness.  Hot Rod Circuit is a great band. Listen to "The Pharmacist". It's a great song. By a great band. Yeah.   "No, no, no!" *Shakes finger*  Haha, no no, you people wouldn't get it.  Oh my gosh, so the other day, Rachel and I went running at the park. And we saw these ducks having a threesome. I'm so not kidding. It was two male ducks and a female, and like one male duck would hop on and...ehhrrm...you know...and then it would hop off and the other one, who was waiting patiently for it's turn, would hop on and go at it. Oh my gosh, I never want to see duck sex ever again.  I bet you all wanted to hear that story.   I'm very random and sporadic tonight. Incoherent.  Ah well, I'd rather be cheerful and sporadic then morbidly, depressingly coherent.  Sure. Whatever.  Anyways, I think I'm gonna go. My contacts are kinda hurting and it's gonna take a while for me to stand up and walk to my room to take 'em out. Have a good evening crazies.

       Current Song: Punchline- Heart Transplant   Today was a good day. I went to an ortho appointment after school, bleh but oh well. Then I came home n worked out for a while, and that kicked ass. Did my homework and such, and now maybe I can actually go to bed early tonight! Sweet!  Saturday will be a test of my sobriety powers. That's right. I am going to  attempt  to stay sober. If you're there, help me out. Support me by like beating me or something. Now sobriety doesn't mean I'm not going to drink a bit, but I'm limiting it to where I don't actually get drunk. I get drunk so often, I figure it couldnt hurt to stay sober this once. Oh god I don't think I can do it. We'll see though...we'll see.  Well, I'm outta here. Keep it clean, crazies.

       Current Song: Fall Out Boy- Dead On Arrival   Hmm. Normal day. Didn't really do anything. Okay, did absolutely nothing, but who cares? The only thing that has sucked lately is that we lost an hour because of the gay time changing crap. But besides that, things have been....*and I say this hesitantly, for fear of jinxing myself yet again*...good. Things have been...quite good.   There's no purpose in hate. Where will it get you to hate the things you can't change? And if you  can  change them, what's stopped you thus far?   Hmm...I really can't think of much to say. Not much has been going on though, so it's understandable.  See you crazies later.

       Current Song: Punchline- Play   Wow, the show last night kicked ass.  So, we got there around like 6:45-ish, and we met Less Than Jake's tour manager. I think it's kinda funny how he didn't check to see if our names were on any sort of list (because Brad's and Rachel's names weren't), nor did he check to see if we had tickets or anything. He just wrote our names down for the hell of it, and gave us our guest passes and all the cd's and stickers to pass out. Before we headed out to walk around and pass stuff out, Chris and JR stopped in and said hi. That was pretty damn cool. So then we went out and walked around the Arts Festival thing and passed out all of our shit. We got rid of everything (and took our own share) by about 7:45, so we headed inside the club and waited around for a while. Yeah, so it completely kicked ass. Less Than Jake freaking owned. Oh, and we were standing right next to the speakers the whole time (from 8:00 to 12:00), so my ears have been ringing for over 12 hours now, and I'm just kinda waiting for them to stop. Well, my left one stopped ringing eventually, but my right one is still at it.  Ahh, mucho greatness. Well, I'm off to go get a shower and such. Have a damn good day, crazies.

Nothing to get my hopes up for...nothing to be disappointed by...simply ordinary.  Sometimes ordinary is kind of nice.  Well, had sectionals after school...pretty gay but it didn't murder me or anything. Went to Hooters after that, and then came home. And that's where I am. Obviously.  Wow, I'm so sore from yesterday. Oooh, but it is the greatest feeling in the world. My entire body just aches. It's nice.   Less Than Jake on Friday. Hell yes.  Did I mention we get to meet them before the show? Haha, yeah, so all you other suckers going, we win. Times like a million.  Well, that's all I really have to say. See ya 'round, crazies.

Wow I'm tired. I really need to get some energy before kickboxing this evening, or I'll die. I'm so glad to be getting back into kickboxing. It's going to be quite a struggle for the first week or so, but once I get back in to it...oooh, it'll be spectacular.  Well, I need to do my homework, maybe read a little bit...wake up alot...you know.   All men by nature desire to know.  ~Aristotle   Fulfill the desire, crazies.

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- Look What Happened   Have you ever felt like you don't really belong anywhere?  Have you ever just felt like there's not a place for you with anyone or anything? It's like you've kinda ruined your invitation with pretty much everyone you know. For once, I'm actually feeling a sense of regret. I wish I could just go back in time and change  everything.  I feel like I've messed everything up. I've lost so many great friendships because I've been  stupid  and foolish in a million ways. I've ruined my life all in my attempts to make it better. All because my perception of "better" was something so far from reality. I just wanted to be different and have a life that's a little more exciting than everyone else's. And through that, I've created a life  exactly  like everyone else's. Somewhere in the last year, I lost hope in good things.  And I don't want pity or sympathy or anything, because I'm more apt to run away from that. I'm the only person who can help myself, and I don't want nor need anyone else. I just want to belong somewhere. I'm a drifter, and I'm drifting alone.  Find hope in good things, crazies.

       Current Song: Fall Out Boy- "Tell That Mick He Just Made My List of Things to Do Today"   I'm so glad summer's almost here. It's a little scary, because I feel so unprepared.  Some times I hate this stupid journal. I wish life was simple enough that I wouldn't need some online journal to express my views, rant my opinions or explain my trivial situations. I just want to live in the sunlight for the rest of my life. Screw complications...we create them ourselves. The only reason we do that is because we aren't content with what we have. We're just craving more and more. I think once we reach an honest state of contention...then the complications disappear. And I think we'd all be much more content if we quit wishing for so much more than we have. I hate having a complicated life. I can't say I create all the drama, but I tend to exacerbate it. Sometimes I just have to take a step back to realize that life isn't as bad as it can sometimes seem. Life still feels like a downer most of the time, but being a little down is alot better than being ragingly depressed. I'm just trying to get my life back. Because for a long time, I think I really lost it. I'm just enjoying my time making all those little mistakes.  Enjoy it, crazies. Later.

That popped in my head today.  And it's true.  I don't have regrets. I don't believe in stressing over the past. Looking back will get you nowhere.  Just move ahead.  Move on, crazies. Move on. Oh...and don't get grounded for something you did  six months ago!  Because it sucks.

       Current Song: None   Ughh. These past few days have been pure hell.  I thought I was supposed to be over all of this.  Everything that I ever imagined could go wrong, has. It's like God is punishing me and laughing as he watches me fall and crumble into pieces. But I'm sure in the "God" perspective of things, I'm as good as dead and burning away in hell. It just doesn't seem fair. Life isn't supposed to be like that. If it really is God punishing me like this, then I'd rather he leave me alone. If it meant that I wouldn't be miserable, then fine. But the fact is that everything is crushing me. And at the worst possible time. A week ago, everything seemed great. I was at a peak. I was happy, things were going great, everything was in anticipation of good things; everything was looking forward to summer. It took only days to knock me down, and only a few more to shatter me. I'm just waiting for the point where I completely break apart into a million unrestorable pieces.  I hate this life. It seems as though any life I choose ends up for the worst. Maybe I'm too optimistic and not realistic enough. Or maybe I'm just not intended for anything good.  I honestly feel completely hopeless.  I guess that's just how life is, crazies. Too much drama.

It's like a drug...an addiction. I soak it in to my skin so deep, I let it creep through my body, I let it take it's full effect. I just sit back as it strolls by. And when it's gone I feel as though I need it. I have to have it. I can't go a day without it. And I trudge mournfully through winter until summer comes back again. I love summer. I'm so happy. Everything about it is absolutely amazing.  Cha-ching.  Well the mellow-ness is gone. Kinda. I'm just sorta insane now. As usual. Bah hah.  Get your gay ass algebra projects done, crazies.

       Current Song: Bad Religion- 21st Century Digital Boy   Posting again. Because I feel like it.  Found some gooooood lyrics. They make sense to me.    It's been a long time since I've been close to you It's been a long time since I've been sad. It's been a while since I've really spent time with you Wish I could take back the times that I had. The only thing that you ever really did for me Was make me oh so miserable.  And the hope that I never see your face again Is anything but questionable.  I hope this is goodbye. I hope this is goodbye.   There was a time when I thought you were a friend to me I think those times I was probably just drunk.  And if they offered a test about being a good friend I'd put money down that you'd surely flunk. The only thing that you ever really took from me  Were my records to sell them for dope.  Now all I have left is this heart in my chest  And my happiness helping me cope  I hope this is goodbye [x4]  It's been a long time since I've been close to you. It's been a long time since I've been sad. It's been a while since I've really spent time with you. Wish I could take back the times that I had. The only thing that you ever really did for me Was make me oh so miserable. And the hope that I never see your face again  Is anything but questionable. There was a time that I thought you were a friend to me I think those times I was probably just drunk. And if they offered a test about being a good friend I'd put money down that you'd surely flunk.  The only thing that you ever really took from me were my records to Hawk them for dope. Now all I have left is this heart in my chest,  Your dishonesty helping me cope.   I hope this is goodbye. I hope this is goodbye....    Great song, awesome lyrics.  AIM is still being gay. And I'm still procrastinating.  Keep it clean, crazies.

       Current Song: Alkaline Trio- Jaked on Green Beers   Ahhhh. So tired.  Went to see The Buffingtons play at The Door in Dallas last night. They freaking kicked ass as usual, but the crowd was so shitty. Oh well, the guys did a damn good job, and it was quite spectacular.  So then I had to wake up for kickboxing this morning. Fun. Gah...so much lack of sleep.  And, AIM isn't working. Stupid crap. I should just kill it.  Well, not much else to say. I have sooooo much to do today...suckfest.  Later crazies!

       Current Song: NOFX- Anarchy Camp   Yep. Guess what day it is?   May 6th.  Yep,  506.   So, I wake up this morning, completely unaware of the date and such.   And then my blow dryer catches fire.   And I don't mean, it starts shorting out and sparking...I mean it's on fire. Flames and smoke and such. I dropped it, shaking, and unplugged it, and stood in shock for a few moments before thinking to myself, 'Oh, that's right...it's 5/06.'  Yes, lovely.  Oh, and the new Fall Out Boy CD came out today, but Best Buy sucks and didn't have it. Jerks.  Well, that pretty much covers it.  Later crazies. Can't wait till 5/06 is over.

       Current Song: Story of the Year- So Far So Good   Well, today wasn't a horrible Monday.  It was actually somewhat good.  I came home and took a lovely 2 hour nap. Tomorrow I have the Chemistry letter K test after school, and then I have kickboxing that evening. Then Wednesday is Girl's Night Out, Thursday I'm hoping to do my second interview for Algebra, and Friday I'm going to the Door in Dallas, because  THE BUFFINGTONS!!!!!!!!!  are playing. Quite a week ahead I suppose. Fun.  Well, I can't think of much else to say. Keep yourselves busy, crazies.

       Current Song: Dropkick Murphys- Get Up   Sometimes I have to wonder what life has become.  It simply drones on with lack of excitement. It is plain, in it's monotonous hues of black and white. I fall asleep to wake up on a bare mattress in a dark room, as a result of my own laziness and lack of concern for anything around me. I sit around and reminisce about the past, and it's vibrant colors that used to illuminate this empty world I'm living in. I am not depressed. I am not sad and discontent in the world. I'm just looking for a little more excitement.  I think I'll go open the curtains, and let some light in.  I found some old memories in file cabinets near the windows.  I let some color seep through the blinds.  There is optimism in the sky today. But I don't feel very lucky. Maybe tomorrow I can match the mood of the rest of the world.  Maybe the vibrant colors will soak through my skin.  Maybe I will mix into the palate of blues and greens.  And my world will not be so grey.   Bye crazies.

       Current Song: Eels- Jungle Telegraph   Ahh. I am so sleepy. And my eyes hurt.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh....I got pwned today. So me and Rachel pull up at Starbucks...and I'm about to get out of her car, n the window is down but there is that front window thing that's still up of course. And something compells me to lean forward as I'm hopping out rather quickly. And I gashed my head on the corner of that window, so i have a huge cut down the side of my face. So it looks like I got in a fight. Lovely, but hilarious. I was cracking up, it was greatness. Except for the redness and swelling and stinging around the temple area.  I have been soooo accident prone lately! Oh my GOSH...it's not cool. Saturday, I cut my knee on the corner of my bed while I was making it. Monday or Tuesday I slipped while getting in the shower, and hit my shin. Wednesday I cut my finger on our cracked stove (lousy lousy piece of shit...I was like 'omg it's cracked...' so i ran my finger along it, not realizing it was cutting me), and then later that night I nearly broke my middle finger by smashing it while opening a cabinet door. And now this. Could I be much more cursed? Am I really that unlucky?  Why won't my luck just change for once???  Not only am I physically jinxed, but everything else pretty much sucks lately as well.   Sometimes it seems as if I have the worst luck in the world.   And I have kickboxing tomorrow. So I should probably sleep.  Be careful, crazies. It's a cruel and dangerous world out there.

       Current Song: Misfits- American Psycho   Ahhh. Long day. It was blah.  I almost felt sad today. Maybe just because I feel like I'm having a stroke of...bad luck. Maybe God is punishing me because he hates me. If God exists, I bet God does hate me.   And This Is Why I'm Such a Crazy:   Futant3: did you hear that you are a alcoholic? CrazyLikeTHAT 87: really? Futant3: yea that's what I heard CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hmm...that's interesting CrazyLikeTHAT 87: i'll have to ask myself about that. Futant3: i suggest you do then maybe you can get in that center with jack osburne CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hmm...i'd fuck him. CrazyLikeTHAT 87: that might be fun Futant3: *throwing up* CrazyLikeTHAT 87: no, there wont be throwing up CrazyLikeTHAT 87: because we will be sober Futant3: you know its hot when chicks talk dirty Futant3: no I would be throwing up for the both of you CrazyLikeTHAT 87: well okay CrazyLikeTHAT 87: then maybe u should get help CrazyLikeTHAT 87: maybe YOUR the alcoholic CrazyLikeTHAT 87: sir.

       Current Song: Alkaline Trio- Jaked On Green Beers   Well, I'm leaving tomorrow for Pennsylvania. Two whole weeks. It's scary. I mean, it's such horrible timing. The way things are being left open and so unclear. There's not alot of clarity in my life right now, and all of a sudden I have to get up and leave it on hold for two weeks. The sad thing is that I don't think things will sit around and wait for me while I'm gone.  But I guess I need to be positive. I need to think that two weeks away may clear things up. That way, when I get back, whether things are the way I want or not, at least they won't have me spinning in circles. And a vacation is always nice.  Well, I need to do some packing and perhaps some other things as well.  Well, if I don't get around to posting again...I'll see you crazies in two weeks!

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- Plastic Cup Politics   Haha...wow, had a great time in Dallas. We caught the train at Richland Hills and headed out there, etc etc. Got drinks, chips and queso at the Cocktail Lounge in Reunion Tower. Then we rode over to the West End, and ate at Spaghetti Wharehouse. Oh, then Becky got hit on my some 14 year old boy. He was like "You remind me of a famous person, with your boobies and all." Hahahaha it was FREAKING HILARIOUS. Oh, then some crazy hobo man offered to get us fake ID's and jobs at a strip club. Wow. That was interesting to say the least.  Well, I'm shortening the whole of the venture, because I don't feel much like typing.  To sum it up, I had a great day today.  C-ya round, crazies.

       Current Song: None    It's My Birthday!   Yes, so let me explain this morning. Err...last night, this morning...it's hard to tell.  I went to bed at 1:30. At 2:30 I was awoken...to find that Becky, Amanda, and Rachel had snuck into my house and were making quite a racket to wake me up. First of all...I had no idea what was going on. Then when it finally hit me that they were in my room I was like "oh my god...what the hell...I freaking hate you guys!" Haha it was outrageous. So before I know it Becky is dragging me out of bed, and putting these outrageous clothes on me (I still am so out of it that I don't know what the hell is happening), meanwhile Rachel and Amanda are taking pictures of my horridity and I'm flipping off their cameras (I'm cranky when woken up). So then they take me outside and into Rachel's van. I'm finally starting to sorta-semi wake up. So by now I have a feeling we're going somewhere, though they claim that we're just "driving around". And our driving around takes us to IHOP. Oh God. So I'm like praying that no one else is in on this, so they don't have to see me, tired, make-up-less, and in the most horendous outfit ever created. Oh, but there are more people in on it. So I'm walking into IHOP at 3 am, getting  alot  of stares, and being cranky, but amused. Haha, my friends kick so much ass.  So then we went back to Becky's and got some more sleep. Then tonight the four of us are going to Dallas. Cool stuff.  Well, have a spectacular day, crazies! Oh, and I just officially turned 16 about 2 minutes ago. I shouldn't know that, but I have no life. Later.

       Current Song: Less Than Jake- The Science of Selling Yourself Short    I've come to my senses that I've become senseless I could give you lessons how to ruin your friendships Every last conviction I smoked them all away  I've drank my frustrations, down the drain, out of the way   So I sit and wait and wonder Does anyone else feel like me  Someone so tired of their routines  And disappearing self esteems  I'll sing along with every emergency Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophes  I'm so far gone that deep down inside I think It's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy   I could be an expert on codependency I could write the best book on underage tragedy I've been spending my time at the local liquor store I've been sleeping nightly on my best friend's kitchen floor  So I sit and wait and wonder  Does anyone else feel like me  I'm so overdosed on apathy And burnt out on sympathy  I'll sing along with every emergency Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophes I'm so far gone that deep down inside I think It's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy  Let the meanings slip away  Lost my faith in another day    Self-deprecation seems okay I never though I'd make it anyway   Well, just thought I'd post some lyrics before going to bed. Later, crazies.

       Current Song: Fall Out Boy- Calm Before The Storm   I'm angry. Very angry.  I spent $15 tonight because we were going to go drink, and had it all planned out. So I spent $15 so some guy could go buy us some alcohol. And, of course, because of the fact that God hates me, plans fell through. So I told Bo he owes me a bottle of vodka. Seeing as how other people are drinking MY alcohol tonight.  Urghh. Oh well. Now I get vodka instead of nasty beer and bitch drinks. So I guess in a way I win. Kinda.  Well, kiddies, I don't have much else to say tonight. Oh by the way, today was the longest day of the year. I hope you enjoyed it...err, I suppose *yesterday* rather.  Party like crazy, crazies.

       Current Song: Alkaline Trio- San Francisco   Today pretty much sucked.  Nothing was accomplished today. And I've been suffering through a horrible headache. You'd think an assload of aleve would help that sort of thing, but it just makes me feel sick and makes me want to pass out.  God, my birthday's in 3 days (closer to two days actually), and I'm not the least bit excited. I think I just don't have a very positive attitude today. I need to lose this skeptic-persona, and try enjoying my life a bit. I'll do that tomorrow. Maybe.  I still think God hates me. Really, I do. He's definately out to get me. Or I guess my constant bad luck is just an odd coincidence. Either that or satan is being a bastard, and God is either sitting back laughing at me or he doesn't exist. You know, I don't really care. Religion is a dependency, and I think it's just human nature. We have to find some sort of meaning for everything, some sort of reward for life that follows death. Otherwise I guess people wouldn't see a true purpose in living. I mean, throughout history you have these intellectuals and philosophers who have these great prophecies about some great destiny or some all-powerful being or force that controls everything. Then they gather followers, because they're ideas are so convincing. And different people are attracted to different philosophies. All it takes is a great, convincing leader. Look at Confucius, Jesus, Mohammed...they're just prophets with different philosophies on life. Philosophies that perhaps they invented in hopes for finding some purpose and meaning. Hell, look at Hitler. That man was one of the greatest leaders of our time. His views weren't necessarily on a religious level (nor were they humane), but he felt a conviction for them, and he conveyed his message, and people followed. Basically, people just need something to believe in. I personally, can't say that I have anything that I believe in. I can't really say that, at this point in my life, I need anything. The only thing that truly comforts me is knowing that I have the opportunity to leave something behind me. All I care about in life is impacting people long after I'm gone.  Sorry if I've offended anyone with my "Religion is a dependency" speech. Actually, I'm not sorry. It's my opinion, and I'm not shoving it down your throats. I respect people's decisions about their religion, and infact I admire people that have strong convictions about their religion. So if you throw some royal fit about what I just said, I'm not going to bicker like some immature child, but I'm probably not going to care either. My opinion is mine, yours is yours. So go ahead and spill it to me, but don't shove it down my throat. I don't know many people that do that, in fact I really don't have run-ins with people like that, but just in case any decide to pop up, this is forwarning that I'm open to conversations, not lectures.  *Well, I feel like I'm in a better mood now. Odd.*  Oh, The Hulk is possibly one of the worst movies ever created. The plot is so barely-there, and you can't go anywhere with it. I wanted to stab myself in the face, because it was that awful. I'm typically not a big movie critic, and I usually like most anything I see.... but it sucked.  God almighty, it's plot-line was so shallow and dull that you couldn't have saved the movie if you tried.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.  Don't ever ever see The Hulk, crazies.

Played Vice City, and got bored actually completing missions, so I ended up seeing how many cops I could kill. And now I'm doing absolutely nothing.  Well. I just forgot I was posting something in here, and it's been like 20 minutes since I started this.  So I completely lost my train of thought.  Take it easy, crazies.

       Current Song: Hot Hot Heat- Bandages   Life has been treating me very good lately.  But...(and there is always that little exception, isn't there? that little catch to optimism that drags it under a bit)...I'm so skeptical of good things.  I hate it.  I just get so sure that something is going to come knock me off my little pedestal. But ya know what? I'm the only person that can do that. So I have to stop. This is  my  life and no other force controls it but myself. I am in control of my goddamn destiny. So there. Plain and simple.  So back to optimism. Yes...things are going pretty good lately. Ahh, but I don't want this vacation. It's like horrible timing. Always always. Why must my family ruin my life?? I've decided that if God exists...he really really REALLY hates me. He just hates me so much, that he likes to fuck with my mind a little and then kick me down. Ughh. If he doesn't exist, then I'm just a horribly horribly unlucky person.  Note to self: You control your life, dammit. So get control of it!  Well, that's about it. I am thinking a shower sounds good right about now.  Oh...and also: "Uh oh!"                       "You can't fool me. I don't want a room full of pillows."                       *Staple spoon.*  Hahahaha....God help me.  Control your own destiny, crazies.

       Current Song: NOFX- Mattersville   Wow...I didn't sleep much last night.  Okay, now that I think about it I did.  Just the fact that at 6 I woke up after a whole four hours of sleep, and I was like tossing and turning and just couldn't fall asleep.  Yes, well...anyways.  Didn't do too much last night. I have kickboxing today and I really should actually GO, unlike Saturday.    My Birthday is Monday, June 23rd....6 days! Hooray!    And then I get to leave for vacation. Two weeks. My parents have this great idea to  drive  all the way to Pennsylvania. Honestly, I'm good with flying. Because a week on the road with my family is like the vacation from hell. I told my mom that and she yelled at me. She insists it's going to be "fun". Well I think her idea of fun is very very very messed up. So if anyone would like to kidnap me on my birthday with no intention of returning me...God, I would appreciate it. I would rather drive up there with some psycho killer anyway.  Haha yes. Well, I think I'm going to go get a shower now.   Kidnap me, crazies.

       Current Song: Prodigy- Smack My Bitch Up   Well, I've been pretty busy lately. I've been meaning to post stuff in here, but I haven't been home to do that.  Thursday I went mud-wrestling (well...sand, rather). That was fun. Yesterday I went to Dallas, and today I woke up too late to go to kickboxing. Suck.  Wow...I  did  have alot to say.  I think it's really odd when guys get all shy and timid and stuff. I mean, I guess it's because approach and confidence are really important to me. I just like it when people are confident, rather than making me feel like I have to make all the moves or something. You know...that's just awkward. So boo to awkwardness.  Yeah, so I really did have more to say. But I think a shower is much more important at the moment.  Thanks and buh-bye, crazies.

       Current Song: None   *yawn*  I'm kinda tired.  I'm still not sure what direction my life is heading, but I've been feeling optimistic lately.  The one thing I truly hate about my life is that all I have is the  hope  for good things.  Maybe some day they will evolve into something more. Or maybe I'll just spend my life hoping that something good will come my way. And I'll stopped getting so sidetracked by people that keep wasting my time. Because then I lose sight of the people who really matter.  Most people are a giant waste of time.  I could beat them all senseless. With a large, heavy bat.  I think it would be fun.  Well...I think I'm gonna go find something actually worthy of my time. *Yes...that sounded conceited. Good. Because my time is valuable. Screw anyone that doesn't think so.*  Have a spectacular day, crazies!

       Current Song: John Mayer- Why Georgia   The past few days have been pretty good.  Got my hair cut yesterday! It's very short, and it's got red streaks. Awesome. I don't think it's  not  touched my shoulders since I was 6. Seriously.  I'd give an in-depth rundown of the past few days, but it's too much to say, and I doubt that many people care to hear every detail of what I've been up to. Basically, I've just been working out and hanging out with people. But what is there really to do otherwise? You get the idea. Nothing's been all too exciting. I wanna work out today, and I really feel like going bowling tonight.  Well, I don't have too much to say that's actually substancial...but who needs substance when things can be simple? If you ask me, sometimes life has too much substance. But only because people create it. Half the troubles we endure originate from our own imagination. That may not seem logical, but it's true. We just create dilemmas in our head that in actuality, don't exist.  I think I'm gonna go find some way of wasting time.  See you crazies later.

       Current Song: Fall Out Boy- Saturday   Wow...I got a whole three hours of sleep last night.  Or, this morning rather.  I'm doing it again. The whole thing where I don't need sleep because it's summer. I just feel so euphoric and peaceful. So it's about eight right now...and I've been up for an hour already. Yup. Didn't fall asleep until four. But it's as if...three hours is enough.  Today is interesting. I feel a sense of anticipation...stupid anticipation, but it's somewhat odd like that. I dyed my hair auburn yesterday, it's interesting. Can't wait till tomorrow. But right now I need to concentrate on making it through today. Not to say that today is a bad thing...it's anything but.  I think it's funny how I am. I sit around and wait for something to happen to me. As if some miracle is going to just run up and smack me in the face. I wait for excitement to come to  me.  I create this image of perfection in my head and sit waiting for it to form into a reality. How silly and foolish.  But how normal.   I've been doing alot of thinking, as a result of my insomnia. It's good thinking though. (Wow...to note: after I typed that sentence, I noticed that it said "I've been doing alot of sleeping, as a result of my insomnia."........Lack of sleep isn't good.) I decided to read through my journal last night, because it was conveniently sitting on my dresser next to my bed. (Quelle coincidence...) It starts off positive, and yes it is for the most of it's entirety, pretty optimistic. But it starts off very religious. And it slowly strays from that. It simply goes to show where I headed over the past few years. I'm not saying that I regret how I've torn away from religion, because I don't regret it. I don't mock religion, nor do I think of it as  anything  negative (and I'm trying my best to get my point across, without offending half the universe...but hey...this  is   my  journal, and i can write freely my own opinions, and if anyone disagrees...I have a chatterbox for that), I simply feel that it doesn't accomodate my needs. I would go deeper into my opinions on religion, but I understand that it's a debatable subject, and I don't want to cause  too much  of a controversy over it. Religion isn't typically a subject I like to bring up, because I don't like to infringe on other people's beliefs too much, and I'm not out to try to "convert" anyone or anything. It's a subject that I  enjoy  discussing, but only with people who are a bit more open-minded, and not simply eager to bite my head off and smite me. You know.  Well...I like the fact that I changed subject at least 4 or 5 times.  I suppose that's what a lack of sleep can do to you.  I'm gonna head off and enjoy the day...because it is absolutely wonderful. :-)  Don't get in  too  much trouble with the law, crazies.

       Current Song: Eels- Novocaine For The Soul   I've realized the one thing I absolutely love about summer.   Seeing everyone so peaceful and content.   God, what a beautiful thing. Today is absolutely beautiful, and when I look around, I just see this perfect ease and contention in everyone. Summer has such an amazing ambience. I feel so at ease, as if nothing in life has to be stressful. And it's true. Nothing in life has to be stressful unless we make it as such. It's something I can say, but being the drama queen that I can be, is often something a bit difficult to grasp. True, I can be so overly dramatic quite often; just ask my parents. I'm passionate about things, and that's why I am the way that I am. And I'm starting to accept that alot more. It's becoming alot easier to laugh at my passionate outbursts; my petty quarrels, and insignificant debates.  I'm finally coming to life. And I'm finally starting to appreciate who I am.  So, to get to my day now....  Woke up this morning, went to kickboxing, came home and had to rake some brush out in the front yard (so I can get money to get my nails done...because I'm quite broke), layed outside for a little bit, came inside, took a shower and here I am. I think I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat, and then figure out what the plans are for tonight.  Come to life, crazies. And enjoy the beautiful day.

       Current Song: Five Iron Frenzy- The Day We Killed   Hmm...I did absolutely nothing today.  Honestly. Nothing.  And I enjoyed it.  I think sometimes that random day where you just want to sit around and do nothing is kinda nice. I haven't had a day like this in quite a long time. It's like I always have to be on my feet; doing something, hanging out with someone...just always on the go. Today was nice just being lazy.  I think I washed my face about 50000000000000000000000000 times today.  I think I'll wash it about 5 more times before bed.  I'm glad I'll be busy again tomorrow. And I'm sure I'll find something to do Sunday. I can definately make some schweeet arrangements on Monday, and Tuesday is going to  freaking kick ass.  If I still haven't told you, in my failed "efforts" to keep it on the down-low, well...you'll see.  Well, I should probably go to sleep soon, since I have to wake up for kickboxing in the morning. Hooray.  Keep it on the down-low, crazies.

       Current Song: Voodoo Glow Skulls- The Devil Made Me Do It   I've been looking back alot lately. At how much everything has changed. Especially myself. But I'm not alone in that aspect, I'm simply alone in that I've trudged off in another direction. I think everyone has their own direction. But quite honestly, it's the mistakes that people make that truly mark how they move forward.  It amazes me how foolish I can be sometimes. It's amazing that I've made so many mistakes  already , not even considering what I have ahead of me. But the mistakes I feel the most, aren't the ones most people would expect me to feel for. I don't feel regret as much for the things I've done, as I do for the times that I missed out on. I feel for opportunities I lost, and that I screwed up. God, I've screwed up some beautiful things. I've missed out on alot of times that could have been some of the biggest opportunities in my life. Everything I backed out of....God, why do I always do that? Why do I always back out of wonderful things?  All I really know is that things will eventually have a way of working out. Maybe not to fit my picture of perfection, but maybe to fit what perfect really is.  But I suppose I should update on life. Hmm...it's good. I'm doing what I said I would...I'm making change. I'm trying to find a new life. Who knows, maybe I'm screwing everything up again.    My life is like sitting next to a bomb, waiting to see if it explodes. In other words, it's stupid, foolish, and the odds probably aren't in your favor.   But that's all I have right now.   No regrets, crazies. No regrets.

       Current Song: Catch 22- 9mm and a Three Piece Suit   I don't know what it is, but I keep waking up at 9:30  EVERY SINGLE MORNING.  It's very odd.  I had a dream last night that I really could have done without. It just brought back waaaaaay old memories. It wasn't a bad dream, but it was discouraging. But I'm glad that it was. Because life in that aspect has always been a bit discouraging as well. And I need to forget about it.  I love summer so much. I have alot to look forward to this summer. First of all, I can look forward to next Tuesday. But I'm not telling why. Just make it a point to see me in about a week. Ahh, I can't wait. Hopefully I can look forward to this Saturday, because Fall Out Boy is playing at Club Indigo, but I'm not sure if it's an all-age show. If it's not...I'm going to cry. I can look forward to my birthday in  19 days!  Of course I don't get my license until late July. A shame. But something else to look forward to nevertheless.  There is more, but I suppose I don't want to ramble too much. I think I'll get going now. I've got things to do today.  Look forward to great things, crazies.

       Current Song: Def Leppard- Pour Some Sugar On Me   Humm humm humm.  What to say, what to say.  Nothing of extreme importance. Nothing bad, that's for certain. But I should bite my tongue and knock on wood before saying that, because every time I think nothing's going wrong, something always does.  It's kind of my luck. My life makes me faithless rather often. And then when I go to hang my head, something good eventually comes about. But as soon as I get optimistic, something comes and knocks me down. A vicious cycle.  Now you see why I'm a pessimist. Because optimism will only kick you in the ass.  I've learned that the hard way a thousand times. Never be sure of the good things in life, because they'll come and go before you get a chance to truly take hold of them. It's the bad things in life that are certain to hang around.  See you later, crazies.

       Current Song: Tsunami Bomb- Russian Roulette   Life's been fair for the past few days.  Blah de blah. Etc etc...nothing too exciting, nothing too horrible. A few issues on my mind. Minor, irrelevant type things that are pathetic excuses for problems...but whatever. They are quite mind-boggling. But I can solves them. Pretty simply too.  So, all in all, I'm still ahead. And I'll never fall behind. I know how to play my cards right, and I have ways of reading people's intentions before they're actually revealed, giving me an overwhelming advantage.   I'm prepared for every battle with full intentions to win the war.   To my competitors in every battle I may be fighting: Have fun losing.  Because, of course, I'm unstoppable.  And then, there are the situations where I simply need miracles. Enough said on that. You know what it's like.  Sometimes it takes more than fighting to get what you want.  Well, See you crazies around. Schedule pick-up today. Etc etc.

       Current Song: Tsunami Bomb- The Invasion From Within   Things haven't been so bad lately.  Friday was interesting. It seemed like I was just having a horrible day, and I was just so upset about everything, so down, and everything just sucked. Then, later that night, as I was just giving up on  everything  that had been dragging me down, everything suddenly turned around to shock me. Everything, within maybe...an hour...just went...incredibly  right.   Saturday was Warped Tour, and it kicked ass of course. Good good times.  I think that for once, I'm refusing to let things get me down. I'm refusing to let others claim the victory. And it's funny, because the harder people try, the more I realize that I don't have to care. I don't have to care about situations that drag me down. Because people that drag me down aren't worth my time. So thanks, to all who have helped me realize this. I'm much stronger than people make me out to be. I've got way more self control in these sort of situations than I ever really thought I could have.  I just think drama is stupid. So why the  hell  would I get caught up in it?    If you're going to be dramatic, then keep me out of it. I have better things to do. :)    Fabulous.  I get my license in a week. :) :) :) :) :) :) :)  Cool it down a notch, crazies. It's gettin a bit hot.

       Current Song: Punchline- Stop    There's one thing you should know. No matter how hard you try, you can't knock  me  down. After all, I'm Shauna.  And I'm unstoppable.   I have grown to be a very strong person. I have strengthened and matured alot from who I used to be. I may have alot of moments that I'm not too proud of, but lately, I'm proud of every choice I've made and every path I've taken. I have felt that I've been making alot of mature, logical decisions. And it's about time.  And if I truly feel that I'm making the best choices, then it would seem only logical that I should come out ahead. And we'll just see. Because I'm going to do everything in my power to get what I want.  My mind is set. Don't fuck with me.  :-)  I'm unstoppable, crazies.

Just chilling...having a good time home alone, while my family was out TV shopping. I love that alone time. I get to like break the house down with the sound system in the living room. And just be alone and have time to kick back and relax for several hours.  Mmm...fantastic.  Life is  fantastic.   Have a  fantastic  day, crazies!

       Current Song: Yellowcard- October Nights   Today wasn't very good.  It's the first time I've had to say that in a long time.  I'm kinda frustrated and disappointed with alot of things, and with alot of people.  First off, I feel like what I really really want is being snatched away from me. And I can't let that happen because I don't have the luck that everyone else does. And the one chance I get is being spoiled for me. I need to take control, but it's so hard because of circumstances.  And then, my mom starts talking about confirmation again. Because it's close to that time of year. And I don't think she understood why bringing it up got me so worked up, and i don't think she could figure out why i broke down. It's so stressful trying to make your parents understand you. And I don't have the strength to try.  To top it off, I'm facing a huge GUILT trip that isn't even my problem, yet I  still  feel absolutely horrid.  And 50 million other things that suck.  Suck suck suck suck suck.  Take some control, crazies.

       Current Song: Punchline- Power Off    I'm doing it again.   I'm becoming the dreamy insomniac stuck in her own little world. Her own content world, far outside of reality, obviously, because contention is something she always finds so unattainable and out of reach. But she just goes on living behind a smile and distant eyes that always seem to be looking off somewhere else. Looking admirably at the past and longingly toward the future, impatient with the present.   Maybe this time around things will be different.   Circumstances are very different this time. Giving me hope that I can have the storybook resolution.  Close your eyes, crazies. You look tired.

       Current Song: August Premier- 4 Hours   I thought I should post something. I've got alot of different things on my mind.  Ya know, sometimes I have to wonder if the reasons I get angry at people are simply a result of things I've done. I mean, I don't get mad at people often. I mean, it's rare that I get angry with someone, because I find that most things are just too petty to stress and argue over. And if I do get mad, 99.9% of the time I just keep it to myself, because I realize that it's usually a huge misunderstanding, and if I just wait it out or confront the situation nonchalantly, then everything can fix itself without making a federal case out of it.  But sometimes I feel as though people intentionally do things against me. And it's not that they're doing it in spite of me, but rather out of the jealous, selfish human nature that everyone has. I'm very guilty of that sort of thing. I often find other people's success to be a damper on my happiness and my feeling of success in my life. Yes, it's self-centered, but there isn't a single person in this world that isn't guilty of it, and by coming out and admitting that I'm  very  guilty of downplaying and sometimes attempting to sabotage other people's success, I would consider that I'm probably more in the right than those of you scorning me for such a thing. Because everyone has been guilty of it sometime in there life, and I believe that if anyone would try to deny it, they'd just be lying to themselves. Yes, I am a jealous person on many occasions. I've just come to realize that people aren't happy in  spite  of you, as silly and ridiculous of an idea as that may be, for some reason I can feel that way. I wish people would realize that I'm not doing anything in spite of them, and that I'm just thinking of...well...myself. But when it doesn't concern other people, I don't understand why they have to get so offended. Well, I do understand, I suppose, but I feel a little betrayed to realize that sometimes people aren't out for my best interests.  It's probably just all in my head. I just need to start relying more on myself to control my life a little more.  Well, I'm off. Have a lovely day, crazies!

       Current Song: Slowreader- Every Part Of Nothing   Well, I'm back! We got home at 10:30 last night, and I was too exhausted to post anything. I had a great time in Pennsylvania, though the whole driving thing was painfully long and boring. We made a few day-stops however, in D.C. and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I came to several very positive revelations during my trip too. I guess getting away can be a good thing. But I was anxious to get back home.  I think when I first got home last night, I was cranky, tired, burnt out, and slightly disappointed, but that changed. I came back to find that things are quite close to how I wanted them. My life didn't tumble into a mess of disorder, as I had thought. Oh, silly Shauna, and your silly pessimism.  I still feel slightly rushed and a bit overwhelmed, but I can manage to get everything done that I need. And most of my stress (well, all of it actually) is just me freaking out over nothing.  That's why I love Slowreader. So mellowing.  Oh, and I'm proclaiming July "Anticipation Month". Because I have a ton of stuff to look forward to.  To start:  9 days until Warped Tour!   18 days until I get my license!   There's much more, too. Juuuuust wait. :)  It's good to be back, crazies!!

       Current Song: No Use For A Name- Coming Too Close   :-/  Things are confusing lately.  Some good, some bad.  I suppose either way I can muddle through it all.  I can be a strong person and try to get over the worst of things.  Because the worst hasn't happened yet. But I can feel it coming. It's painful. I kinda hope I'm just being paranoid, but I can see it.  I suppose that's the price I'll have to pay.  Pay for what? I don't know anymore.  I don't quite understand why my life is one big punishment....I guess it's for being alive or something. Or for being faithless.  I worked from 4:30-12 last night, then went to IHOP.  blah blah blah.  'I have a picture of you on my wall. And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII....'  HAHAHAHAHA. Oh good times.  Thrift Town and a car show today. whoo hoo!  Have a great day crazies.

I'm just so skeptical, and it's really quite sad.  But I'm happy! Things are wonderful. Fantastic. Amazing. Optimistic.  The list just goes on.  I'm just have this fear of falling. Metaphorically, of course, but you understand.  Because when you fall you get hurt. And you feel pain. And you're left with the scar- the memory- of your defeat.  I don't want that.  I want things to work out.  I want life to be the way that I  want.   Got paid today. That's always good.  To update my hours: Tomorrow (Wednesday) and Thursday I work 4:30-10. Quite an improvement from 4-10. Right.  Friday I work 4:30-12. Please shoot me.  Saturday I have off!!!   And so on.  Well, I need to go finish my homework.

Whoo, my register at work was 35 cents over last night...it was good.  I work again tonight from 5-11. Then there's going to be a kick ass little party. Haha. No, not a big, exciting crazy one that you're all invited to. Too bad I have to be at work at 8 tomorrow morning. What fun.  Oh my gosh, some guy from southlake came in to work yesterday and totally made my day. I told him his total and he was like "What? that's outrageous..I live in Southlake and it's cheaper there. There's a sign outside of here that says 'thank you, keller' and I feel like saying 'up yours, Whataburger!'" Hahaha....I started cracking up, because he was a funny guy. And when I deal with plenty of rude people, it's always good to deal with people that have a sense of humor.  Well, I guess there isn't much else to say really.  Things have been very good lately. It's great.  Well, have a wonderful day, crazies!

School started last Monday obviously, and it's not so bad I suppose. With the exception of pre-cal. Someone please shoot me for that one. Oh, and work...I am working non-stop. It's insane. However, I have off tomorrow, so expect a post again. Perhaps one longer and more important than this brief update.  One thing on my mind however...I wish that things wouldn't be so impossible. I want simple things. I just feel like I'm trying and trying and it's like swimming through molasses...in the winter, on the coldest day in the past 50 years...in Alaska.  I just can't sit back and watch everything just walk away from me. I have to do something...sitting on my ass isn't getting me anywhere!  I have to try harder to make life work out. And I'm going to. I'm going to try alot harder. Because I'm  going  to get things right for once.  Well...that about covers it for now...I'm going to bed.  Keep busy, crazies.

Monday I got my license! Whoo hoo, it's about time. Still, however, my car's in the shop. So I'm forced to drive the mexi-truck. Oh, also Monday, I got hired at Whataburger. I'll be working in Roanoke until the new one in Keller opens, which should be soon!  Tuesday....didn't anything really of importance.  Wednesday I went down to Dallas with my dad to find the asshole that sold us my car illegally, because he didn't finish all the papers. So we got that taken care of, got my car registered, now it just needs to pass inspection, which it didn't do Tuesday.  Yesterday I started working...which was cool. I work today and Saturday again from 4-8.  I'm going shopping in a little bit, so I'll be heading off to go do that.  So there you have it, my week, short and sweet without the long, drawn out details. I figured I'd spare you all.  Oh! How could I forget...my schedule. (Seeing as how school starts Monday!)  This Semester:  1st Period - AP Statistics - Garrett 2nd Period - Pre-cal Pre-AP - Benbow 3rd Period - BCIS - Folger 4th Period - French 3 - Curry  Next Semester- 1st Period - English 3 Weighted - Shannon 2nd Period - Physics Pre-AP - Hanifan 3rd Period - French 4 - Curry 4th Period - US History AP - Murtagh  Well, that about covers it!  Have a nice rest-of-summer crazies! (Err...try to.)

       Current Song: Three Days Grace- (I Hate) Everything About You   It's been a while.  And I've been good. Nothing too special really. Working alot, schooling alot, sleeping very little.  I'm kinda tired.  Like always I suppose.  I'm not working today obviously.  I can't really think of anything exciting to talk about. I don't have very much energy. I feel kinda sick, so that's probably why.  It's like my mind just draws blank.  My life isn't exactly blossoming with substance right now. Well, okay, so it does, but nothing worth noting right now. I've got to make a turn-around, but I haven't done that yet. I'm still cycling, and I'm kinda crawling out...or so I hope.  "You love the penis I DONT HAVE."  Rofl, good times.  Stop cycling, crazies.

      I've been thinking alot lately about who I am. About the type of person I am. It's a confusing thing, trying to figure out who you are. I've just been searching and searching for some sort of identity. Something to characterize who I am.  And I've made alot of mistakes. In my 'quest', I've done nothing more than alot of finding out who I'm not. But yesterday, as I was driving around, I started to come to some realizations. I started to see the obvious.  My questions started with 'who am I?' and sort of evolved into 'why am I who I am, and who is that really?' It sort of complicated itself. But in a way, it clarified things for me.  I am because of my friends. I am because of the people who are undyingly by my side, through the good and the bad, through the trials and triumphs, through the ups and the downs. There are alot of things in life that come and go: love, relationships, jobs, school, acquantances...even the people you once called your friends may become impermanent and distant with time.  I just feel that sometimes people have a tendency to lose sight of who they are...and I think that for a long time, that's where I've been. And true, it's impossible to say that I won't ever lose sight of that again, because life is about learning and growing and experiencing...and it's short.  And so, to my friends, and be no doubt whether or not I speak of you, I want you to know that you have helped me through everything, and without people like you, I don't know where I would be.  Quite honestly, I don't think I would know who I am.  Thank you.  ...crazies.

       It's definately been a long while.   I apologize sincerely. This is the longest I've gone without updating. But I think it's something healthy. Something good.  Because I've been undergoing some changes.  Maybe no one can notice, and that's fine. It's something within myself.  I have been given so many experiences since my absence from posting. I've dealt with the good in the bad in all aspects; from life to love to education, I've suddenly found myself in a different position than from when I began.  But I'm back at a crossroad.  And instead of being intent on taking the straight path like everyone else...I'm taking a little detour.  No. No, I wouldn't call it that. I wouldn't call it anything. I'm simply living my life the way it should, and that is for one purpose and one purpose solely: to live it.  There are alot of things to say, and for probably the first time in months, I have time to say them.  So I'm taking grasp of today as an opportunity to do as much as possible.  Lets start off with stating the obvious: I'm a busy person. My schedule just doesn't seem to let up or slow down right now. And honestly,  I'm loving every fast-paced second of it.  I love being busy and just getting caught up in the rush of life. It's taking me places. There's a bit of irony for all the people who seem to think my life is going nowhere. There's another thing; sometimes people try to make me seem like I'm less of a person, and maybe that could have affected me in the past, but it means nothing to me now. I know that I'm successful, and that's all that matters.  I'm going places. You could use that statement metaphorically or literally. Either way. I'm anticipating my little Europe-Africa trip in March. It's exciting. (FYI: My family is going to France, Spain and Morocco over spring break) And education-wise I feel like I'm really sitting down and saying 'okay...time to get into gear.' I'm working hard, and my grades and personal satisfaction are rewarding me.  So all in all life is good, I can't complain, I'm living and I'm loving it.  And I'm loving. That's sort of where this post takes a more solemn approach. My life is like a novel. It's like a dramatic epic. Well...maybe more of a story I suppose...my life hasn't taken on any sort of epic proportions...yet. It just puzzles me...love. To simply find satisfaction in someone; a pure, loving satisfaction that makes me feel like a complete person. To find someone who has that much undying faith in me...is incredible. And so this is my sole complaint in my life: how two people can find themselves in each other...find completion in one another, and have something stand between them. To have  life  come between two people like that. And to drive the misery out of both of them. I see it in his eyes the same way I'm sure he can see it in mine. And when he tells me how important I am to him, it kills me. It's like I want to move on, but I'm still clinging to that little bit of hope for life to work out. And I see him doing the same thing. And for that fact, I can't see how life has to be so unfair.  Otherwise, life is great. Even with that fact, life is great.  All in all...this is the beginning. Or the end. Or the climax. Or some insignificant detail inbetween.  Who cares!  Glad to be back,   crazies

      Lalalalala....  Tonight was cool but gosh I'm so tired.  Mmm I don't even want to wake up for work tomorrow, it just seems so depressing. I hate work. I need a job with people who have a bit more professionalism than this shitty after school fry-fest provides.  Drama is for outside work. That's what I hate about my job. Gay gay gay gay gay  SO...yep.  I'm a pretty cool, exciting person.  Working is not fun. But I have to work tomorrow. From 8 to 4. Please visit me. Please rescue me.  Ahh I can't even focus I'm so tired. Good sign that sleep is near.  Goodnight crazies.

      So...new name. It's fitting. Because this damn thing is a pensive waste of time. A waste of a life I could be living rather than writing about. But alas, I'm in an era where people do nothing but evaluate and speak simply for the sake of running their mouths.  I'm guilty of it. Who isn't? Everyone talks to talk. 95% of the time I'm talking I have absolutely nothing of importance to say. 95% of this entire blog, over the past 2 years...is complete bullshit and nonsense.  But then isn't it the perfect expression of life? Nonsense. If my life was exciting every day, then it would be filled with so much interesting works. But no one's life is that interesting. I mean, hell, my life is way more interesting than I go in to detail about in here. But even then...it's still boring.  If I wrote about all the crazy things I do...all the good things and the bad things...not only would you think I was a total nut, you'd probably think I told too much.  I do talk alot, but there are still things I leave to the imagination.  So my title is suitable. All I do in here is think. Think and think and blah blah blah about pointless shit. But no one in history has every been acclaimed for writing about actual substancial things. That's my opinion at least. Everything is always so metaphorical...that way people can interpret it in a thousand different ways, everyone can relate, people can argue and debate....that's the writing that makes history. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Take the bible: by far the most popular book in the history of the world. So why? Because it's so abstract, nothing's in clear print, everyone can interpret it differently. Dozens to, hell, hundreds or religions have spurred off of one book, simply by people's interpretation of it. The bible was literature of pure genius. I mean people will never stop debating over that book...and it's controversies from interpretation to inerpretation. To write a book that inspires the world for hundreds and thousands of years would be impossible if you wrote it straight forward. Because times change, and views and people change. The bible was written in such a way that it adapts and appeals to so many people, because it's sketchy, elusive, and anything but straight forward. Definately, the most ingenious piece of literature in history.  I'm not debating over fiction, nonfiction, who wrote it, blah blah...I'm simply pointing out that it's genious. Pure genious.  I'm the type of person who sees all sides. I could take stand on either side of the fence. Not just in religion. In life.  I have this way of seeing alot of different aspects.  I'm not a die-hard anything.  I don't think that really makes me a leader; I think it makes me more of a....  You see what I mean? THIS PENSIVE WASTE OF MY LIFE! I could be finishing homework.  Ahh, see ya crazies.

      Today I was driving and I started crying for no reason. I think it was the song. I mean, once I realized I was crying, I tried to think of what I had to cry about.  And I couldn't think of a damn thing.  Because I don't have a damn thing to cry about. And once I realized that, I stopped, and cheered up.  Oh, I have like a week until Europe. It's so exciting. Just gotta make it through this final stretch of school...final stretch of studying and saving the grades I've practically killed.  I know why too.  No more of that. No more ruining my mind.  Well...just not so much.  On another note...still can't wait till summer. I love summer.  It makes me alive.  Especially those days when you can just lay outside, close your eyes, and slow everything down.  Those are my kind of days.  And the days when you feel completely spontaneous, like you can do anything, and you do...those are my kind of days too.  I'm just going to make the best of every world.  Maybe somewhere between now and the end of high school I'll decide where I want to stand. But I doubt it.  Well...I'd say that's pretty much that.  I don't have anything important to say.  And if I do...I don't know if I can find a way to say it.  I'm wearing an A on the inside, and I'm afraid and ashamed to bring it out.  That pretty much sums it up.  Later. crazies.

Can't wait till summer.  Really. I can't.  I love the summer, because it is FREAKING AWESOME.  So happy YAY!  Haha I feel gay and retarded.  TAKS was today...which totally blows but my essay totally ROCKED DUDES. No really, it was quite good. It gave ME butterflies...and I wrote the damn thing. I think the beginning and the ending tie was really freaking powerful.  Okay, I'll talk later....I have homework to do.  Awwwwwchayeah crazies.

      God I am cool.  Haha.  Too cool. Freakin' rocks. Life is good. Hectic, crazy, but good.  I need that madness. It  fuels  me, baby!  I can't wait until spring break. Europe is going to be awesome. And then in April, when I go to New York! Ahh, so much anticipation. And then of course the summer is going to be the best summer over, because my friends and I are the coolest people ever.  I just love it, all this excitement and adventure...it's spectacular. Sure, there's stress in my life too, but it all involves school. And if that's the only stress factor in my life, then I'd have to say I must be one of the luckiest people alive. Went shopping this weekend and I DIDN'T MEAN TO SPEND MONEY, DAMMIT! But I did. Just imagine how crazy Paris is going to be. Oh, and all the markets in Tangier...oh, I'm gonna go crazy. I love attention. I dress for attention, I act for attention, I do alot of things to get noticed. Is that wrong of me?  I think not!  I don't think craving attention is a bad thing.  I just have ALWAYS had this feeling inside of me like I can't slip into the seams, I can't fall into the background.  If I'm not remembered, if I'm not acknowledged...then I haven't done my job.  Still looking for an internship. Haven't really been looking actively, but maybe it's time to start.  People who doubt me in life, are my motivation.  Remember that when you tell me that I'll amount to nothing. Because every time someone has said that to me, I never forget.  They probably don't remember saying it, but I could quote them. And someday that motivation will be the words they'll be shoving up their asses.  It's good to have people behind me too.  They are my pure motivation.  It's nice to have both sides. The people who want to see me succeed, and the people waiting for me to fail.  Because I wouldn't ever let myself fail in life.  That's not how I work. My friends know that, those who doubt me (I hesitate to say enemies...I don't care enough about people like that to call them enemies) will learn it soon enough.  Step one...get out of Keller. This means college. I'm narrowing my search down, narrowing the choices down, and I've picked my good choice college that I'll have to work toward, and I've picked my safety school.  I feel like maybe I'm not being totally open-minded, but I know what I want.  That's as open-minded as this decision is going to get.  Well, it's time to sleep.  Deal with the way I am, crazies.

      I hate high school.  Sure, everyone says that, but I mean it.  I hate high school people, minus a few.  Those whiny ass sons-of-bitches who have to make life so difficult and be such bitches about everything.  I hate being around anything that remotely relates to people like that.  I don't care about this person and that person.  The thing that I hate is how people do that nonchalant bragging, as if it somehow makes them cool.  Where they casually bring something up as though it's not intended to be bragging, but really is. And then there is the anti-bragging, where one rants about something they're actually boasting about.  I mean, when I talk about something, it's because I'm either pissed about it, sad about, happy about it, or excited about it. Or some other emotion.  I like to share how I feel, not make people feel like I'm just sharing. Please. God. Spare me.  I'm in this ranting sort of mood tonight because, for no real reason, I feel sort of upset. Just by...high school.  I think the real reason is that I just hate being upstaged.  Of all my faults (minus the ones I'm condemned to hell for--which I definately wouldn't be discussing in a public blog, due to severity of such issues), I think my biggest fault is that I can NOT deal with being out-done.  I hate it when people are smarter, prettier, nicer, more of a badass, etc... than me.  I can not deal with being out-done.  It's ridiculous, and of course you're thinking 'get over it', but it's impossible.  I mean, I'm the type of person who knows how to get talked about...I know how to get attention, and I don't like it taken from me in any way.  One thing I've always hated, since elementary school, is when I'm the best at something, and then someone comes along and knocks me down. Second best is a thousand times harder to bear than worst.  I would much rather be worse at everything than be second best.  And, well, I'd much rather just be best, to be honest.  I'm very paranoid about that sort of thing too.  Honestly, I know that no one is trying to knock me down, just as I never try to knock anyone down either.  I work solely for myself, and I don't really give a fuck about what most other people are up to anyway.  But for some reason I get this idea in my head that everyone is just trying to knock me down.  Ridiculous, I know.  So I'm self-centered and I like to have my way. At least I have persistence.  That's what'll get me what I want.  I guess I'm very open about my self-centeredness.  But why would I not be? I know it, and I'm honest about it.  I don't hide it behind bragging and vanity.  That lacks all class.  I have so much more to say right now, but unfortunately, my lack of sleep is seriously catching up with me.  I do have one thing to say though--my jaw is killing me.  It has been constantly popping for like the past...oh...month? And now the right side is swolen, and it's in a constantly clenched position.  I'm really starting to get worried, because it's seeming more serious than I had originally thought.  I just wish I could relax my jaw...I can't describe the 24/7 pain and discomfort it's causing me.  The only time it's okay is when I'm chewing something.  That's probably what caused it...chewing things...for best example, obviously, gum.  And the past month is when I stopped chewing gum. Hmm..what a coincidence.  Anyways, I'm tired, my jaw hurts, my feet are sore, my eyes are strained, and my brain is getting cramped from all this thinking.  So yeah...  Told you I was in a ranting mood tonight.  Oh well...does a body good.  Shut the FUCK up, crazies.  Nah, just be cool.

      I'm a lucky, lucky person.  I don't know what got me thinking about that tonight.  But I know why I'm lucky. Luckier than alot of people out there.  I'm lucky because I don't need to rely on something amazing in my life to make me happy.  Life doesn't have to be spectacular to make me content.  I don't need everything to fit together in life.  That's part of what makes it so exciting for me.  Is knowing that there are still things out there that are just waiting to go right for me.  To know that there are opportunities waiting to be grasped...but maybe not just yet.  Not right away.  I'm lucky because I'm patient.  I don't need the prospect of "love" to fuel my happiness.  Or whatever.  People care too much about their fantasy life, where everything is wonderful and dream-like.  Well, wake up.  As amazing as that would be if it were true, life isn't like that.  Tiny parts of your life may resemble dreams, but you have to live in reality.  And I am lucky.  I've got my ducks in a row...I feel freakin' great.  My life isn't perfect, and it's got it's quirks that I could work out, but I just don't want to.  Because without a few quirks, life wouldn't be nearly as interesting.  And where's gonna be all the drama when they do my story on E! ?  Haha, just kidding.  But really, in retrospect, I want a damn good story to tell when I write my memoirs.  Damn right.  And it is for that, for the imperfections in my life, that I am truly fortunate.  The fact that I can accept it puts me on a different level.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* My family and I were watching The Apprentice tonight, and we were discussing who we thought should be fired, etc etc...and I realized that no one else in my family ever has good reasoning.  I hate to insult them (my parents just threw a huge fit a few days ago because they thought I was insulting their intelligence), but they never put reasoning behind anything. It's always, he's wrong, she's wrong, and never any explanation.  I seem to get the same treatment from them.  When I argue, I always make sure I have something to back myself with.  But when I argue with them (and this goes for my dad especially), they tend to just throw out these wild arguments with nothing to support their case.  And of course, even if I throw an amazing case out there with undeniable backing and evidence, because they are my parents, they will win by default. Can you tell I have plans for a career in law? It's something I excell in.  Even when it comes to opinions, which was the case tonight.  When I explained to them who I thought should be fired, I had firm reasoning and an undeniably good case.  They even took to my side after I presented my argument. Unfortunately, Donald Trump didn't feel the same way.  But who can blame him... he  didn't hear what I had to say.  Well, I'm sure I've bored you all significantly, so if you feel it necessary to find a gun to shoot yourself, or me, I'll let you go tend to that now.  Au revoir, crazies.

      People have no business being discontent.  I believe that if someone is dissatisfied with their life, then it's their own damn fault.  They can't go tossing blame every which way. So if something is wrong in your life, then fix it or quit complaining. Honestly. Even things that are out of your control are...technically...in your control.  I suppose that's just the way I think...and that thinking really has shaped who I am. I guess I didn't always think like that.  I always put some supreme power in control of my life and for some reason I kinda stayed in one place.  I'm not saying that I lost faith...well, I guess I did...but it kinda took that for me to get back on track. On whatever track I'm running on. And I'm getting that faith back...but it's in my own way, on my own terms. The only way to be content with life is to live it on your own terms.  As far as my life goes...I am content. I'm happy with the way it is, even if things don't always go right. There's the occasional dramatic moment that jumps in, but it's nothing I have to worry too much about. After all, that's life.  Sometimes you have to grow up and realize that.  So quit with the whining, people. Cheer up and get over it.  Well...I've got mucho the homework to do.  Ahh, my life is so crazy lately! ShEeSh I'm busy 24/7....  Farewell, crazies. Keep it upbeat.

      Hmm...I've realized a pattern.  Okay, so in life not everyone is going to like you, blah-de-blah get over and move on. But I've realized most people who don't like me are girls. Maybe it's because guys don't care enough to not like me, or because as girls...we're just like that.  Whatever the reason, it's a pattern I've noticed.  And I hold nothing against anyone who doesn't like me. It's not an issue really, I mean their impression of me is whatever they make of it and that's just that.  Some people, unfortunately, take it too far. Like getting obsessed with hating me. Like getting other people to hate me and threaten me and blah blah blah.  I don't care that people voice their opinions about not liking me. That's life, that's people, hell, I'd do the same thing.  But quite frankly I just don't care enough about disliking people.  If I don't like someone, I don't like them, and that's that. Done and done.  Some people freak me out about it.  It's too bad that some people care grudges too far. The majority of people can make the best of it, but some people have to go and be all psycho. That makes me uncomfortable.  Other news: School is gay. I don't like it...I want to graduate and run far, far away. To New York City. I don't think I was meant for Keller. I don't think I was meant to be around here, to be stuck in a place that's so dull. I don't think I care for high school in general. I don't care for the drama or the rumors or the haters... why can't we live in a world where everyone just doesn't give a fuck?  That would be such a lovely world. :)  I hate the fact that I have this stupid blog. Like I have to be dramatic and thoughtful. I want to just put stupid shit in here. I'm sick of that blah-de-blah love-heartbreak-drama shit.  I am quite a cynic tonight. Mostly because I'm done concerning myself with 90% of high school altogether.  The only 10% I care to associate with are the crazies that don't bitch.  I think I'm doing a good job so far.  Lata crazies.

      Blah-de-blah  Things are good. Things are never really bad.  I was just a little irked the other night. I had some crazy dreams last night too. Really manic and psycho.  It was kinda scary. I think they were all showing parts of my life though. First it was the parts of my life that I'm ashamed of...and there were no walls in my house and everyone could see in, and it was really messed up. Then I was in my car, and the brakes weren't working and I was going down this steep parking lot. Then I got out of the car and I was really scared and my mom was crying and she was like "I should have believed you...I should have...I'm sorry...I love you" That was really messed up. Then I was at this...banquet of some sort. This one girl came up to me and started yelling at me because she said I was at some party and I was seducing her boyfriend. And I wasn't...and it didn't make any sense. And she was going psycho and everyone at the thing was staring at us...and I was trying to explain that it wasn't me because I wasn't even there. But someone had set me up and then this guy came around with a knife and I was trying to get away...etc. There were all these little details that encompassed every single worry or concern in my life. EVERY single thing. Every minor detail was somehow fit into this dream. It was really manic and crazy and I woke up very edgy. I still feel edgy. Like I'm on the rise to a climax in my life.  I don't feel right anymore.  I mean...I'm fine. But I feel on the edge. I think I need rest. I need to find some way of escaping...but my life is too busy to warrant that any time soon.  I watched requiem for a dream tonight too. Haven't watched that in ages.  Summer's really close and I'm not ready for it yet.  I've got to start getting in order...and I might as well start right now. This very instant.  I need my mom to call that phony doctor too and see why on earth he wants me to have this surgury and go on this stupid treatment for something that I don't even have.  I need to start eating better and working out. I can start that now.  I need to get through this last push of school, keep up and just get it out of the way so that I can enjoy my summer.  I need to relax and party and have a good time.  I'm going to go make a to-do list...and I'm actually gonna stick with it.  Adios crazies.

      There's too much hate.  All everyone does these days is hates.  Random strangers hate me. People I've never talked to hate me. Hatred is so childish.  And I'm so tired I can't handle it.  I feel disappointed. Disappointed in myself.  I feel really unstable. I think it's from lack of sleep, or frustration...  Being nice to people really backfires sometimes.  I go out of my way to just overwhelm people with kindness, and they stab me in the back...or in the chest. Or both.   It really bothers me that so much effort can be so useless. At least I know that I'm the better person.  I'm too good for some people's shit.  I'm too good to lower myself to certain people.  Quite honestly...in my opinion (which is always rights...and I'm really not joking either)...I'm just plain better than ALL of those people.  The way I see it...anyone who is childish enough to hate me for no reason and hold a delusional grudge...is too far below me for me to acknowledge.  I'm too good to consort with trashy people.  Boy oh boy I sound like a conceited bitch.  Good.  Because with all the effort I have to put into to being nice to some people, and reaping no rewards...I have the right to be a bitch.  And let's face it...I don't have to hold anything back about being slightly conceited...I don't walk around talking shit like I AM the shit...but I can justify who stands below me.  Anyways I need to go to sleep...I can't take this anymore...  G'night crazies.

      Ahh today was kinda stupid and somewhat annoying.  I was sick first of all. Then I had to go in for a sonogram and the "doctor" was pissing me off. He told me that the sonogram was TOTALLY normal, and yet he wants to do a day surgury to diagnose me for something I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE.  How on earth does it make any sense?  And then it would require some six month treatment that would be like a shot every week and a daily pill.  Then after the treatment, there's a good possiblity that I'd never be able to have kids. All for something I don't have.  I mean, and it's completely obvious to me that I don't have it. When he told me about it and gave me all the info on it I was like "We're talking about ME and MY symptoms, right?" And he was like "yeah.."  Oh well...he's retarded.  No, I'm not pregnant you retarded douche-bags.  Sorry...I'm not feeling good...I'm gonna go to bed now.  Adios crazies and fools.

      Oh boy.  I am gonna drink myself silly this weekend.  Awww buddy!  Rofl. I'm such a loser.  I went to World Market today and bought some food. Some good food, as opposed to the usual crap I eat.  I cleaned out my car today, and I found alot of old things in there...made me reminisce a bit.  *sigh*  Some scary stuff in there...glad neither of parents cleaned my car out for me.  Whew. Anyways...time to eat and then go rollerblading a bit. :) I haven't done that in a while.  Peace crazies.

      I am posting alot today, possibly because I'm bored. And ADD...so I can't finish my homework. Or because I only woke up 7 hours ago...   I'm not a hypocrite...I'm a liar.  Rofl...sad, but true.  Some day my life will catch up with me...and I will be one screwed little chiquita.  That will suck. If god be willing however...it won't ever occur.  I was a bitch in 8th grade. Hahaha boy oh boy was I a little bitch. I was a good kid, but I was a bitch. I found a bunch of old conversations I had with people. I was blunt...ridiculously blunt. I'm glad I've acquired a bit more tact in the past 3/4 yrs. I was bold too...a fearless person...if I wanted something, I went straight for it. I wish I could be that bold again. I wonder what happened. Well I guess I went through a phase where I lost that. I'm getting it back...tactfully now, of course.  I am such a bad kid. Couldn't really call me a kid though. I realized the other day that one of my ex's never realized how young I was. I mean, he knew, but I guess it never really hit him until I was joking about having 3 months until I'm finally 17. Then he was like 'omg. you ARE young.' Good. Maybe he'll go throw himself off of a bridge. I wish he would, stupid bastard. At least I'd never have to deal with him again. :)  My God ADD sucks. I CAN'T FOCUS FOR MY LIFE.  I swear...the most random people in the world hate my guts. It's 99.999% of the time people I don't know...or I'm somehow associated to them through other people, but I never actually talk to them. And the other .001% that hates me and actually knows me...well, honestly I can't think of anyone off the top of my head...but I would have had to do something really f-ing stupid. Or they are a bunch of pricks.  I don't mean to sound like I'm perfect and if you know he you wouldn't hate me...because who knows. I'm just saying that it makes no sense.  Oh, and a good number of people who hate me...hate me because of stupid rumors and stuff. Hahahaha they are the ones I'd love to beat senseless...because they have to be stupid to care about a bunch of made up shit.  Oh...and 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of them are girls.  Ahh well...the attention and conflict FUELS me. rofl...bring it.  Can't focus can't focus...gahhhh.  Alright crazies...enough for today.

       The joy of life isn't finding pure complete happiness..it's knowing that you never will. What kind of life would it be if you did?   I just felt that I'd speak the truth in a world where no one is satisfied. Satisfaction isn't perfection...it's the lack thereof.  That's why I'm satisfied. Because my life isn't perfect. It's manic and stressful and crazy and wild and busy and insane...and it keeps me interested.  I've realized I don't really spend much time talking about my day in here. I guess that's just not me.  I can't sit here and tell you about all the events of my day.  I'd rather tell you how they affect me.  Some day, I'll probably change my views of life.  I'll probably realize that I had just been led astray by struggle. Someday I'll wake up and come to some great epiphony. But today, I'll just keep living like I am...and on through tomorrow, if God be willing.  "Suffering is clinging in an impermanant world..." That may be one of the oldest truths out there, folks. Don't count on everything to always be there...don't count on tomorrow. In the Islam faith, it's common that people state that "if God willing", they might do something, or might have tomorrow. I've been thinking about that alot, and about the previous quote from the Confucian religion, and it makes me think. Is Christianity the only religion that doesn't pay warrant to the fact that relying on what will happen or may happen is resting faith in uncertainty?  Something to ponder, crazies.

      I'm a lucky person.  I'm really truly fortunate.  Well, anyways...I finished my homework at 6:30 this morning and I felt really sick because of my allergies and the fact that I have no voice...so I slept. Until 4. Oh boy.  "Sunday was a day of rest, now it's one more day for progress, and we can't slow down, 'cuz more is best, it's all an endless process..."  Boy is that ever true.  I still haven't written this english paper that was due today. But I know what I'm writing about, and it's going to be...great. It's awesome stuff. Like my TAKS essay...boy oh boy I wish I had written that for something more important than some gay standardized test shit.  Tic Tacs are addictive. The orange ones mostly. Yummy.  Got my pictures developed yesterday...fantastic. Fantastic that SO MANY DIDN'T TURN OUT!  Oh well, my mom still has to get the digital ones developed. That's good.  I don't know how I have such great friends. They're not just those high school buddies that will party with you and hang out and chill and stuff. I mean, they do, but they're more than that. They'll watch my back, and I'll do the same for them in a sec. They kick some major ass.  Boy summer is coming upon me fast. I can FEEL it on it's way. I'm really connected to the summer.  It's MY season...I mean, I was born in summer, I grew up in summer, I've laughed in summer, I've loved in summer...I live for the summer.  I'm definately gonna party lots this summer.  I need to start getting a freakin' tan! And working out. God I suck.  Ehh, I'll get to it...as for now...homework and I need to mess with this template cuz I have no links to my archives.  Shine on, crazies.

      Wow last night was so insane. I went to some party in Dallas with a a bunch of people I had just met. They had a ton of everclear jello shots, and I had 4 of em, and then I mixed some Hennessy and Hypnotiq (my favorite)...and drank some of that...I was like wtf I'm pretty fucked up. I had a tab too...that's when things really got fucked up. Some guy brought some shrooms over and said he'd give me some if I fucked him. Well...I had taken a tab earlier so...what do you think happened. Well I got the shrooms, and I'm savin' em for lata of course. He also gave me a bunch of ambien, which was pretty cool. Of course he bummed like 5 cigarettes off me, which kinda sucked. Then me and a few guys went down in this dude's basement and smoked a few bowls...that was aight. The rest of the night is pretty much a blur...but when I woke up...I was in this completely different house, laying in a bed with 3 guys I'd never seen before in my life. :-\  I'm not so sure about that. Well this morning, I felt like shit, so I took a couple codeines and now I'm feeling just fine.  Hahahaha I hope you liked that story...it was complete and total BULLSHIT.  Hahaha actually I didn't do much of anything last night. Rofl.  Keep it real, crazies.

      Well I got back from Europe/Africa on Wednesday. It was awesome. Honestly...totally amazing. And being so close to the bombings in Madrid...seeing all the candles in the train station and the streets...was quite humbling. Wednesday was also very humbling. Very awful, and it makes me wonder why such horrible things happen to such great people. I've been thinking about that alot over the past few days...and it really makes me sad to think about what a tragedy it was. I hate death. Death of cause by others...or by accidents. Like the deaths of those innocent people on the trains...like the death of my manager's 11 year old daughter in a car accident... I have a newspaper from Paris, and one from Madrid, that show pictures of the train accidents. The pictures that just kill me are the ones of the people. The newspaper from Paris showed these pictures of people...dead...lying in the destruction. And they are such normal people...they are all just like me. And it makes me scared to think that something like that could easily happen to myself, or the people I love and care about. It humbles me.  Anyways...back to the trip. I have to say that the most unforgetable place we visited was Morocco. It was amazing. We met this guy who took us across the border from the spanish territory (while muslims were yelling stuff at us in arabic, and the guy was yelling back, and I was scared for my freaking life), and then we took a taxi into the city. Oh my dear God those cab drivers are insane psychos. So once we got to the city, we walked inside the city walls, where people set up markets along the narrow walkways. The walkways were paved between tall buildings, and the city was like a dream. It reminds me of some sort of Aladin-like, arabian night kind of place. I can't even describe it really...you'd have to see the pictures. And of course we stood out ALOT. The country is a monarchy, and it's 97% islam. Yeah....you try to blend in. We then went up to the palace in the midst of the city, and as we were up there, we got to hear one of the prayer calls over speakers in the city. Many people went running frantically to go pray. However, Morocco isn't an immensely strict country, so prayer isn't always a requirement (if you have an excuse). My parents used to live in Saudi Arabia, and the women were required to cover their entire faces, except for their eyes, whereas in Morocco the women typically only covered their heads, leaving their faces exposed. Also, in Saudi Arabia, during the 5 prayers in the day, everything would close, and prayer was strictly enforced. After that, our 'tour guide' took us up on the roof of this building and gave us this absolutely amazing view. I took lots of photos. We had a view of all the city, and the casbah, and far past even. Then we went back down inside the building, and he introduced us to this Moroccan carpet designer. We all sat and had tea (a Moroccan tradition), and he went through his carpet selling skatch (yeah...it's not a word...but i'm sure you get the idea so who cares...but if you use it I swear I will rip your bloody face off), and my parents "discussed the price" of two carpets and raped the price down to less than a third of the original statement. Kick ass. Go mom. So then we went back outside and I bought some silk Moroccan scarves from a little boy. (Definately cheaper than shopping in Paris:-P) Then we had to get in a taxi and race back even faster than we had raced there to get back across the border and into another taxi so we wouldn't miss the last ferry back across the Strait of Gibralter to Spain. We made it by a matter of minutes. Sweet.  So yes...the rest of the trip was awesome as well, but I just thought I'd share that part, because it was really something I'd never been around before. I mean, I've been to big cities before, like Paris and Madrid, and I'd been to Europe before, and I've been to countries where I don't speak the language. But Africa was something new, and a country that's 97% islam is also quite...different. It was a very culturally enriching experience.  Well party time tonight cray-zayz. {crazies}

      Yay! I leave tomorrow for Europe. It's gonna be some good good times. I'm so excited!  Hooray. Anyways...lots of crazy stuff going on lately. Lots. Some stuff makes me angry, some stuff makes me happy, some stuff makes me stressed, some stuff makes me nervous...some stuff makes me wanna change.  I'm kinda scared. I've been like this before and...I just don't want to talk about it.  Anyways...moving on before I depress myself the day before a great trip.  I want the chance to make things right. Please...let me make things right.  Okay...time to finish packing...getting my mind off worries...  Whew. Okay. No stress. Calm. Everything's gonna be okay.  Think about the trip, dammit!  Alright crazies, see you in a week and a half. :)

      Ahh tonight was good times. Hilariousness, to be certain.  Lots of good things in life.  And then, as my night came to a close, something familiar came back into my life.  It's my only complaint (besides school in general, which is a given). Some of you know what I mean. When you have that person in your life...that person that you can't live with, and you have to try to live without. And I know how to distance myself from that person. Honestly, I'd been kind of a bitch to that person (not that they didn't completely deserve it).  But being like that is always just a phase. And tonight I let my guard down. I let myself smile and be friendly. I let myself sit down and have a conversation. And I was strong about it, and they noticed that. Every time he sees that I'm stronger without him, it draws him back. I don't want him back. I let him run his little 'scam' once, and I'd never go back. But I swear it's hard to doubt someone who can be so genuine. It's just hard to hate them. I have this inner resentment because I know that he's not who he pretends to be. It's like befriending a con-artist. How would you ever really know who they are? You wouldn't. You would only know who they present themselves to you as. I just need to prove that I'm stronger on my own. I need to keep standing my ground. I'm doing a good job. But I almost slid. Almost.  I have to be better than that.  And here is my lesson of the day:  I've learned that you have to be a stronger person than people expect. You have to hold your ground, no matter what. People will only learn to respect you when they realize that you're independent; when they realize that you don't need them, and quite honestly, you don't want them either. I don't need anyone.  Especially not those type of people.  Of course...I still need YOU, crazies. :-P

      I think that everyone goes through the same phases in their teen years. Some people just take longer to go through them. Everyone who thinks that they are alone in unhappiness...you're not. Don't fool yourself by thinking that your situation is different. Give up the denial that no one suffers emotionally like you do.  You aren't really suffering, you're just going through that stage.  Honestly...you aren't that different...and you aren't that miserable.  Another thing...I realized that there are different kinds of happiness that people experience. The happiness you experienced as a child is something you'll never experience again, so give up the search. When I was young, I was happy because I was naive and innocent.  Now, I'm happy because I'm aware, and experienced in life.  So if awareness and experience make me happier...I have nowhere to go but up.  You have to learn to value everything. That's what makes you happy. Value who you are...don't rely so much on who you used to be.  Probably the weirdest, dumbest conversation ever: LuCkY05106:  i want to rub your arm full of shit LuCkY05106: hahahaahaha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: awwwww LuCkY05106:  and poke it CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hahaha LuCkY05106:  so the shit comes out CrazyLikeTHAT 87: and it will spew out shit CrazyLikeTHAT 87: hahaha LuCkY05106: hahahahahahhaa LuCkY05106: hahahahaha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: i sweat shit LuCkY05106:  holy shit i love it CrazyLikeTHAT 87: haha shit LuCkY05106: haha CrazyLikeTHAT 87: IF YOU CUT ME I WILL BLEEEED SHIT LuCkY05106: hahahaha LuCkY05106: ewwww LuCkY05106:  and it would smell CrazyLikeTHAT 87: aww...sick. LuCkY05106:  ALL THE F-ING TIME CrazyLikeTHAT 87: haha yummy.  omg why are we so INSANE?!?!?  ...because we're cool, of course.  Au revoir crazies.

      Yesterday and today were dramatic. Very dramatic. I did alot of crying, all out of the moment of course. And the stress of having high expectations. No, I'm not going to give them up. So my crying occured yesterday evening, this morning and this afternoon. It is done though. Sometimes stress just gets to me. I don't like to cry, but when I do, it's usually just a way of getting everything over and done with. But hey, at least it was more related to my future and stuff like that. I don't really cry over things. 99.99999999% of the times I cry, it's because I'm arguing with my parents, and I tend to get emotional, because well...when I argue with my dad, he acts like an asshole. Not a grown man asshole, but a childish narrow-minded asshole. He can say alot of things that I don't think a parent should ever say. I can really get torn apart by things he says. I just feel that sometimes he really doesn't care about anyone but himself. There are safe things parents can say when they argue...but when they completely degrade you...not only does it lack maturity...but to have a parent say those things...it kills you. And I have been frustrated with the way the rest of my family talks behind my back, and sort of exludes me from them. Last night my brother and I were sitting up at the dining room table doing homework and stuff...and then my parents were watching tv and they asked my brother to come and watch it with them. They didn't say a word to me. They didn't even acknowledge that I existed. And it was intentional, and I knew that...and I was just kinda sitting there with tears running down my face, and they just kept ignoring me. It can make a person feel dead. I know that sounds touchy and stupid, but the entire situation was just awful. There was mucho arguing last night...and this morning...and this afternoon, after "school". Obviously I didn't go to school. I went over to Bo's house instead. But yeah, I've been gay, emotional Shauna over the past two days. I'm such a lose. Ah well, at least I don't get emotional over teen drama shit, right?  So life is still good...as long as I get my grades rescued. I have faith in myself. I can DO IT. If I try really really really really really really really really really hard. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* So anyways...I got ice cream today and life is good. Adios crazies.

      Hey!  Yeah, so It's been almost 2 weeks...I figured I'd update.  I got a kitty on Thursday! She's so precious! Her name is Alexxis.  I'm going to banquet on Saturday. That'll be interesting.  This past Saturday = no bueno. Shauna got sick...from...well, u know. What else.  Today I went and got sushi, and then went tanning, picked up my paycheck and blah.  I'm at my final little push...2 more weeks and I can just chill out for a while. Sort of.  All these AP tests are just the most stressful thing ever.  But otherwise, everything seems to be running fairly smoothly.  Oh, except work is gay.  Haha, alright that's all for now.  Keep on movin' crazies.

I'm definately confused by a few minor, insignificant issues right now, but I'll figure them all out. They aren't anything important at all.  Ah well...later. Salaam, crazies.

      My nail place is under new management. I miss the old people who did my nails, because I knew them pretty well, but I think these new people do a better job.  Gah my life is so crazy. Some day when I'm much older I will write my twisted memoirs for you all to see. Boy would that have mixed results. Because no one can imagine just how crazy my life really is.  Mostly because I'm having a hard time opening up to people. About certain things in my life. Certain aspects that I can't share with people. Not that it's like "my life is a negative dark little hole where I hide in shame", but it's just crazy. CRAZY LIFE.  And I love it. :)  Haha. Wowza. Yeah. yEa!!!!!~  Don't try to understand me, it's alright.  Ahhhh damn incoherence.  Damn english outline. Damn french class and being really really really really really far behind because I'm a lazy, ADD dumbass.  Lates crazies.

      Everything is changing lately.  Everyone is drifting away sorta.  I don't think I really like it.  I'm sorta losing touch with things. But at the same time I feel so incredibly in-touch.  I feel like I'm destined for greater things than where I'm at right now.  "Help me get out of here...the walls are closin' in..."  I think all in all everything's going pretty good.  I'm out living and having a good time, and I'm hardly concerned with petty issues.  Just nothing...really great going on right now.  Ah la de da whatever I'm gonna go be productive I guess.

      Don't feel like partying tonight. I have a point to prove tomorrow night though, so I'll be drinking to my limit...and beyond.  Tonight's been gay. Had to work, and it sucked. People are so dramatic and really really annoying. Not all people, just namely a certain portion.  Went and got bbq with the manda and the brachel earlier today. Bueno bueno.  I'm tired...and I don't feel like doing anything else tonight. I work at 6 tomorrow evening but I should get off by like 7 or 7:30, so that'll be cool. And Sunday night...ooooh buddy I'm gonna drink myself crazy.  At least I'd better.  Well crazies, I'll talk at ya later.

      Well. Things are good.  They are normal and stable.  But they always are on the outside.  Oh well. I'm optimistic, and looking forward to this summer. Oh boy, I have so much to look forward to.  Well, let's have a look shall we: My birthday is June 23rd. Warped Tour is June 26th. My parents are going out of town for a week some time this month. I've got many colleges to visit. I'm going to PA in July. The lake. Camping. Wakeboarding. Parties. Parties.   Parties. Parties. Parties. Parties...  You get the idea.  Well well well. No work tomorrow. Amen. I'll I've done since school's out is worked and cleaned. And slept some.  I wish I could control what people inhabited the earth. God that would be cool. Because they would all be stupid. And I would rule them. Bah hah. Those sorry sorry suckers. And I would let some of my friends be smart too. And I guess some old people could be smart as well. But the old people wouldn't be able to rule anyone, because they'd be crippled as punishment for have intelligence comparable to mine. Rofl. And I would have sex slaves. But none of them could be fertile (no worries, u know). And no people with STD's either. Rofl, WHAT A WORLD BABY!  Haha yeah, you can all start bowing down now.  G'night crazies, I'm out.

      Well, it's summer again. Finally. I love summer. I feel very connected to summer. But every year, summer changes a little bit. True, it continues to give me insomnia, false hopes and pensive moments. But every year, it gets a little deeper. A little darker. Every year, there are a few more memories I'd like to forget. I miss being naive. Why is it that in society, being naive is looked at as being foolish, unintelligent, superficial? Being naive is a blessing. One I'm certainly not fortunate for the have. I think too much. It's taking too much energy.  Time to relax.  This life of yours, crazies, is a pensive waste.

      "Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops..."  *Someday I will make a bigger difference than anyone could ever imagine. I'm just waiting for my moment.*  You know what I've realized? I did a great thing. I won over my enemies with unfaltering kindness. For months...I never sunk down to their level. I refused to fight back when they verbally attacked me. I stood strong, even when it was so tempting to fight.  And for a while I was losing hope that I would ever accomplish anything out of it. But even through my doubt I  never  echoed a word of spite.  And I've come to realize that...it worked.  I feel like a stronger, better person from that. I used to think that just taking discriminations and accusations without fighting back would hurt my *oh so precious pride*, but in the end I feel much more proud than I ever would have.  :)  I kick ass.  Haha  "The loss of friends, you didn't have..."  Anyway, things are okay. Not to say that they are good, because they aren't.  Life is adequate enough right now that I can wait things out...let things calm down (hopefully).  Sort of. C'est la vie. Parfois, j'ai peur du futur...j'ai peur que ma vie devenira un grand disastre. Je dit souvent (et plus souvent je le pense): "Ceci est ma  destruction fantastique." Et c'est vrai...Ma vie est ma destruction. C'est une drame...une drame fanastique. Et je deteste la drame. Mais JE SUIS une drame...Est-ce que je deteste moi-meme? Non...je deteste ma vie. It's sad really. Mais je ne le deteste que parfois.  Okay...most a good amount of time. It just kind of comes and goes. It empties, refills, and cyles through and through.  Okay, fing Physics.  I hate Physics crazies. Don't you?

      *This is my 355th post. Take that you amateur bitches :-P*  Today was another awful day. Everything just builds up.  My emotions are like a bucket filling constantly with water.  And every so often, when the water becomes too heavy and strenuous, the bucket tips over and it all pours out.  I fell over today.  I collapsed from the strain of containment. I curled up on the ground and I cried with every bit of energy I had.  Everything just feels so hopeless. I knew it was coming. I just felt locked up in this miserable place. I am always locked up in that miserable place.  Sometimes I wish it was easier to make people understand what I feel. I have trouble conveying my emotions sometimes.  I just felt dead. As dead as one can feel and still be able to breathe and hold a pulse. There have been two times in my life that I have ever felt so dead.  The first was the other week. The second was today.  And while I was crying I just kept repeating "Please give me strength so that I can get out of here."  There were no outbursts or confrontations with anyone that fueled my breakdown this time though.  My heart just felt too weak to support everything.  It's different than people think.  People don't see how dark of a world this life can be.  ONWARD.  I really like this song:  "Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could Recall the moments that once have Retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor I wouldn't ask this of you  Good eye sniper I'll shoot you run  The words you scribbled on the walls The loss of friends, you didn't have I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out From them all to know the end of us all  Run quick they're behind us Didn't think we'd ever make it This close to safety in one piece Now you want to kill me In the act of what could maybe Save us from sleep and what we are  Bye, bye beautiful Don't bother to write Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars Face step let down, face step...step down"  -"A Favor House Atlantic"  Coheed and Cambria  Well, all for now crazies.

      People seem to construct more tunnels than mountains.  People dig themselves holes far too often. People are their own downfall, and that's really depressing. Yes it is. People are depressing.  Even when people are happy, they are depressing.  Not the way they act, or carry themselves, but the things they say.  It is the way that people make everything into such a facade. Tell me what you did yesterday.  What you're going to do this weekend.  Your favorite moment. Tell me all the things about your life. 'Nothing' is an impractical lie, and anything else is depressing. Even if yesterday was the best day of your life, it was depressing.  Maybe not for you, maybe not for me (maybe for me?), but for someone.  Something in everything we say is destructive.  Something leaves a knot in someones stomach when you speak. Don't convince yourself that I'm preaching about self-hating, humanity-hating, or even hating you (far too much self consciousness/pompousness, though I too and victim of such self accusations).  It's not about hate.  I don't have hate (I would throw in some humourous little blurb of something that happened yesterday, but why waste the energy right?) for anything really. People are just depressing.  Why?  Because nothing can make a person happier than themselves.  Other people are always a let down.  All acts have the underlying purpose of one thing: self.  The self is the only thing that humanity has to offer that wont depress you.  When someone speaks, they depress you.  Because they are themselves, and your own self wants to deny their relevance. No one wants to submit to the relevance of anything else but...what? Themselves. And that is why we all speak.  Because when we speak we are reassuring ourselves. And we ramble on and on either with our without coherence, tactless or thoughtful: we will talk.  Even the quiet ones who hardly utter a word; in their minds they speak.  And why do the quiet ones seem so shy and reserved?  It is their depression of listening to everyone else. A pitiful cycle. Language is the most self gratifying purpose mankind has ever proposed. "Let us speak, and love the words we utter."  Depression is found in the words of others, and the cure is sought after in dumbfounded incoherence.   Thanks crazies. I think I've completely lost it.

      I have never felt as worthless as I do today. I have never given up like this before.  But I've given up.  I'm numb. I'm empty. I'm alone, and I'm hurting the people I love. I can't live like that.  I can't live knowing that it's killing everyone else. I just don't feel anything. Except failure. I give up.  I can't describe what it's like to feel so empty. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to keep hurting people. I'm ruining my family. I'm tearing everyone apart and I just don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to have to wake up tomorrow morning. It would hurt too much.  It would hurt everyone else.  Nothing good can come out of my life if I can't cause anything good in anyone else's.  I bring out something awful in people and it needs to go away. I need to go away.  Please don't tell my secrets...even if I'm not around to stop you. Please don't cause people the pain of truthfulness. Sometimes not knowing the truth is the only thing that keeps a person alive. Don't forget the person I want to be. I don't mean to be the person I am. I don't want to be the person I am. I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  And if I do wake up tomorrow, please don't dwell on my darker moments. Please don't dwell on my pitfalls. Please don't remind me of the things I try to forget.  Please help me. I can't....i just cant...please dont argue, dont yell...please...

      La la la la la.  I don't think Zoloft really does anything.  La la la la la.  I wasn't being sarcastic either. I've seen no effects. Not that I expected to.  So...I received a compliment the other day, and I thought that it was interestingly genuine, and quite possibly one of the best, most meaningful compliments I've ever received.  Of course when I tell you all, you won't think it's that big of a deal.  But I do.  I was told I'm weird. And when I asked why, I was told this: People who don't really know me would probably tend to think I'm a bit stuck up because of the way I carry myself. I tend to carry myself at a higher regard and such. But when you get to know me, I'm "really cool and down to earth".  I liked that.  Why you ask?  Because a) they said I was cool and down to earth, which is always complimentary, and b) because it's comforting to know that I carry myself a bit 'stuck up'.  I would much much rather carry myself like I'm up on a pedestal than like I'm just your average girl.  Because I could never ever ever ever ever ever settle for average. I could never live with keeping my head down, or even level for that matter.   If you're ever going to make a difference, you have to be a little more than down to earth.   Thank you, complimentor.  My birthday is TOMORROW crazies!

You know, I start taking my Zoloft tomorrow...can you imagine...someone without depression on that stuff?  I wonder what affect it's going to have on me.  So yup yup...Umm...I guess things are fabulous right now. Sure. Why not.  I was thinking yesterday and I was wondering why I evoke the emotions out of people that I do.  I think it's because I'm bad ass.  Rofl, okay, I sound so gay right now.

      Things are so weird.  Sheesh. I am one confused chica.  I mean...what am I supposed to do when I'm being torn in a million-bazillion different directions? Break free?  Not that any of this is negative. Certainly not. Sometimes I like being torn in several directions...it gives me choices and choices are what make life interesting.  I think the worst of these directions...is the one that I've been holding on to for far too long.  But now...I fear, I'm going to lose someone forever.  What do you do when someone who has meant so much to you...just isn't there anymore? Do I say good-bye? What kind of goodbye is that?  It's the kind of goodbye I've been trying to say for months...but haven't been able I guess. Maybe I'm not as strong as I like to pretend.  All in all...everything is good. It's confusing and spontaneous and outrageous and a little odd...and that's just how I like it.     (I'm going to miss you.)  Coughcraziescough

      Yeah, so...post surgury appointment...went okay I suppose. Except they're putting me on allllll this medication. I have to go on Lupron Depot to get rid of the endometriosis, which is like a monthly shot, and it sort of makes you, well, menopausal...yeah, I know. Weird. Then I have to go on Actonel to counteract the bone loss from Lupron, and Zoloft to counteract the depression. Lovely, just lovely. And I'm supposed to get hot flashes n shit? Wtf. I thought you only had to go through that shit once in your life. Haha, ahh gayness. And my mom and I both got a good laugh (later) after my doctor was like "you can't lay down for 30 minutes to an hour after you take Actonel because IT WILL BURN YOU"...Ah blah blah blah.  Anyways, then I worked, and then I went and drank some. I have off today sooo...I think drinking is in store.  Okay crazies, catch ya later.

      Humm Humm...wrote something this morning. Not sure how good it is:   Alone in a velvet breeze, Softly, sweetly stroking my veins Warm with vital serenity- Slowly suppressed by chills-  Your fingers grazed my arms In laconic, lethargic, emotionless spirals Chills danced from your palms And lingered through my body-  I watched in silence As storms brewed anxiously in a distance Far away I saw the suffering- Those hopeful dreams clouded in thunderous confusion  And I glanced at you Though never quite looked over my shoulder- Just the knowledge of your presence Painted a picture my eyes studied in the dark  Carefully I memorized lines across you Lines I knew far too well I knew, for tonight, no words would utter But in my mind I fashioned my thoughts into letters-  ‘I watch you my love -my hate- My disposition, remorse, regret- Your careless disregard for me Ensues a desire – a lack of desire – To spend one more minute in your arms For tonight I silence myself And for times ahead, I predict the same You my love –my hate- My weakness, unhealthy desire- My carcinogenic habit –I don’t smoke- But I breathe you in –into my veins- For another night Of an addiction I will not kick So instead, I silence myself...to you My lovely antagonist’  Hours pass in silence Anticipant of storm clouds Easing slowly into this uncomfortable quiet Soon I will make my retreat  In a short time I will feel the comfort of loneliness -The relief of your absence- But the moments remaining of my stay Will undoubtedly be the loneliest of all.

      Ahh. Pain.  So I haven't told anyone yet, but the other night, I had this crazy dream. It was long and incoherent. First I was dating this *really* ugly guy, and it was freaking weird as hell. Like...it made no sense why I was dating him, I think it was out of pity, because I wasn't really hanging out with his friends, because they were all ugly, and I was being all pimpish and such, and yet I was dating this dirty dirty guy. And he didn't have a car, so I guess I was supposed to take him home, and we were both walking out to my car, with distance between us, and this guy was parked next to my car. So he opens the door and I lean in and kiss him, with my "boyfriend" standing right there, looking destroyed. Bahahahahahaha......well shit, it didn't make me feel bad. I just kinda looked at him like it was time for him to run and that was that. Then me and someone else were like going back in time to all these fucked up events, all of which my life was in immediate danger. And I guess it was supposed to give me some understanding...but after a long long journey I suppose...I was angry. I was pissed off. Something about the past made me realize that...everything was shit. But it didn't make sense because I don't know what pissed me off. And I got back and all these people were happy to see me and I was like "Yeah...YOU FUCKING SEE ME!" And I ran off all pissed off, full of rage and such.  Stupid ass dream.  So lots of crazy stuff has happened in the course of the past week.  Oh, and I have this big problem with zoning out. Like, dangerous problem. Like big portions of events just disappear. I mean, we're talking running red lights and crazy shit. Not remembering what I'd been doing for 3 or 4 minutes prior to the current.  You know what's good? When you wake up from a night of drinking, not really hungover...but really really freaking thirsty. And you go and you drink like 70 billion gallons of soda. God that's so good.  Haha. Okay okay, I'm sorry...I quit.  Until next time, crazies.

      Blah blah.  Well, I've got some time before I go out (like...an hour)...so I figured I would ramble a bit.  I've made my summer reading list, it's pretty RAD, BITCHES! Yeah. Okay. I suck. I'm a sucky loser.  I've almost finished  House of Leaves , then I'll probably get  Hamlet , and  Cry, The Beloved Country  out of the way for school. I've got to read  Candide  for french, and I'm gonna read  Carnets  by Saint-Exupery as well. Just to keep caught up in the language stuff. Then I figure I'll read  The Picture of Dorian Gray , because well, it sounds good. And I picked out Bob Woodward's  Shadow , because lets face it, keeping a head into politics is vital if you don't want to be labeled 'ignorant', and Woodward is the god of current events/political journalism. I wanted to pick up  All The President's Men  instead, but they didn't have it. So I settled.  So that covers it. I guess I'll be pretty busy...I'm gonna have to balance the whole work/play/party thing.  But umm...right now...I'd say it's time for the partying to commence. I've been reading all day.  Okay, crazies, I'm out for the night.

      *My stomach hurts.....yarrghhh this surgury gayness*  Well well...Not sure why I'm posting. Probably because I'm just thinking to myself and rather than do that solely...I guess I'll ending up telling 500 billion people as well.  Oh well...it's not like it's actually important anyway. I was just thinking about how I'm not really serious about anything. Except at home, where life is a drama, especially when living with a psychotic deranged idiot? Sometimes crazy people say things that make no sense...and they are obnoxious. They are repetitive, can't remember jack shit, get waaay too deep into things that just plain don't fucking matter....oh, like right now. Annoying me. Just now. Seriously, like the other day, he just goes off into this deep "meaningful" shit (he'd had too much to drink too), and the rest of us, namely myself, were like "umm...no, you deranged idiot, shut up and think on the normal." I hate people like that who try to make every tiny little minute thing into something it's completely NOT. Overanalysis, or plain senselessness. I don't give a shit. It's like talking to a brick wall. A really really stupid brick wall. Like the dumbest, most stubborn brick wall ever. No matter how fucking stupid he is, he will never ever ever ever realize that some of the shit he says is fucking gay. Like comparing a kitten to the life of...me. I'm like 'hey dipshit, IT'S A FUCKING CAT. IT ACTS LIKE A FUCKING CAT, HOLY SHIT, MAYBE IT IS ONE!!!!!!!!!'  Gah. I hate stupid people. Blah blah blah blah blah especially when they PISS ME OFF LIKE NONE OTHER.  No one on earth can make me as mad as he does. No one. Everything he does, though I try to not let it get to me...PISSES ME OFF.  Okay okay...maybe I'm just frustrated. Because it's hard to live a normal carefree life when you have someone constantly dragging you down and everyone else around them.  Then he tells me everything I do and say makes him feel like shit...and he tries to get my mom to agree and she's like 'wtf...no...' but I guess he assumed she was lying...because that's the kind of deranged jackass he is so...whatever.  Stupid stupid stupid. Screw it, I'm gonna go read or some shit.  Later crazies.

      Well. well. I'm kinda dizzy.  So Thursday I had my pre-op, and of course, when they were taking my blood I started getting dizzy and I was just kinda like 'uh oh....' and passed out. When I woke up there were 3 nurses freaking out because I sort of had a seizure? They tested my blood sugar, and of course, it was low. My family has a history of diabetes, and I don't have it, but it's something I'm aware of and have to watch out for later in life. Ahh well, I was really lethargic dont-give-a-crap about it. It was funny how little I cared. Then I went and had my hair streaked RED over the BLACK I dyed it the day before. *sweet stuff*  Okay, so yesterday I had my surgury. And yeah...I guess I'm okay except my stomach sorta hurts whenever the hydrocodone starts wearing off, and my shoulders hurt a bit from the CO2, and my throat is sore from the tube they put down it, and I have two incisions in my stomach, and I get dizzy when I sit or stand up, and it's kinda hard to do either with much ease....but other than that...I'm fine.  Yeah...I guess I'd better go lay down again. LoL.  Okay crazies, see you when I'm recovered (tomorrow most likely).

      Well, screw the normal, good shit. It all just got ruined.  Oh blah blah, I'm being dramatic...right.  You can not imagine you FREAKIN' ANGRY I AM.  God...but, this time, I have no one to be angry at but myself. I did this to myself, because I freaking suck and now I get to deal with the consequences. GOD, WHY?!?  I hate it...I'm in this infallible good mood, and I walk in the door, and bam. It's like...couldn't the news wait for when things sucked?  65. That's all I have to say. 65. SIXTY FREAKIN' FIVE!!  Screw it screw it. That's life, and it's my fault.  Well, now that I'm on this whole ranting thing...I'll just let it out.  You know what I hate? When people feel the need to announce to the world that THEY DON'T LIKE YOU. Guess what? No one gives a shit. I don't care who doesn't like me, unless they have a valid reason. But the truth...no one ever has a truly valid reason for hating anyone. Because the only people that give them reason to hate, they cling to. People are so weak. You hate the people you hardly know, that you never will know. Then what is this desire to announce it? My god, if I don't like someone, I don't go telling everyone. Stupid, childish little games people play. Oh well, only little people play little games, so that says alot for anyone who this so consequently refers to. No one in particular...everyone. Because every fool does it. I think it's pretty obvious when someone doesn't like me, but I prefer the demeanor of acting completely oblivious to it. "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."  Some people have no strategy in life. No account of their actions, not a whim as to how what they do will affect who they will become- where their successes (or lack thereof) will unveil. For most of you, I wish nothing but failure. Note that most people I wish such failure upon are probably too ignorant to read this anyway, so I suppose chances are, if you're reading this, then no harm done, all the more power to you. But to those of you who show no regard for your actions...please. Get a head on your fucking shoulders, grow up just a little bit quicker, and lose your ego/attitude/demeanor or whatever it is that makes you such a fucking dumbass.  Ughh, now I'm stressed. This is overwhelming. God, I want to throw up.  Well on to more ranting, since, well...Oh, I suppose I'll get over it. Pick up my pride and all the pieces that have shattered, and I'll get it over with. But for now, I just need to be really really pissed off.  You know what else I hate?  People who only come and go with your emotions. Not all...just the ones who are only there when you are at your lowest. I don't understand why people see those people as such blessings. Why do we feel so damn grateful for people who are there to support us when we fall down? That come to our side (though never in any other occasion) and guide us through our dark moments. They offer an ear, their advice, their support, when we are in trouble/trauma/drama...  God, I hate those people. No one sees it...they just feed off of your weaknesses. Something inside them enjoys lifting you up, like they're some sort of hero. Everyone just wants to be important, and heroic. Please. Go save a fucking whale. They're like crutches. People who make it seem as though you NEED their words, their support and commitment to you, to make it through. But as soon as you're alright (sooner than later, people have such shifty moods...and drama is a facade that drifts in and out on a whim of attention), they disappear. Leave you to your lives as normal...they basically don't give a shit unless you're miserable. Stand on your own two feet, believe me, you'll need them if you ever want to walk alone.  Then again, how few people can actually perform such a feat. To walk on one's own is..unimaginable. Because everyone has a crutch. Most people enjoy the comfort and support of a crowd, of their drama-heroes.  Stand on your own. Don't praise the people who wipe your tears, but never share in your laughter. They're dark, mental, twisted fools who will never make much of themselves, but rather, feed off of the sadness of other.  I suppose, all in all, my only complaint, really, besides (65) is that people are weak, foolish, blind, oblivious....oh and really blatantly stupid.  It's all people. People people people. Ughh. Okay, it's not all people...it's just the ones who get in my way. And not all who I cross paths with...just the ones who can't think on their own or grow up or something.  Yarghh. whyyyyy???  Okay okay okay...I'm sorry, I'm not so cheerful, not like I was this morning or this afternoon or this evening or right before I walked in the door.  Alright I work tomorrow. And I've got lots of shit to worry about.  GOD SOMETIMES THINGS JUST SUCK REALLY REALLY BAD.  Well, crazies...be smart...and shut up in the theater okay?

      I have a feeling that my life is returning to a sense of being what I consider "normal". You know, less family drama, a bit more freedom, fewer obligations, less worries, fewer cares or concerns, a bit more spontaneous, a hell of a lot more fun/exciting/enthralling/engaging/interesting... yeah, that's what normal is for me I suppose. That's what I want at least. And that's what summer's about.   It suddenly occured to me how fleeting our times together will be - how quickly they will expire - how soon we will be gone.   None to worry, none to worry.  Life is good, life is good. Oh baby.  Okay, enough of this phrase repetition, you'd think I was singing a song. An obviously gay song. Oh wait, that gay song would be...my life..song?  Haha I'm retarded.  Live a bit more interesting, crazies.

      :)  Something interesting happened yesterday. I'm not sure if I should talk about it, but for some reason, although it would typically upset most people, and for a few others make them overjoyed :-\...it set me free somewhat. Free from the constraints that have been placed upon me. I'm free because I've got something to fight with. Everything can't be my fault anymore. I don't have to sit back and watch my heart wear and dissipate. NO MORE. I'm not sure whether I'm happy about it or not, needless to say it doesn't so much upset me.  It's interesting.  So things will get better. They've already begun to, infact.  Here's a tip for all of you fools out there: If you can shrink down the credibility of your oppressive authority, you can weaken their power to enforce such authority.  It's like that whole 'lead by example' thing. If your leaders make some seriously little follies, then hey, can't you do the same? If they express that you should do as they have done, then do so.  But never, ever expose the truth until you have to. You have to undermine authority until they can catch YOU and expose YOU. Then you may expose them.  Because, why would you want to throw something out on the floor that you could save for when you really really need it?   Life is a card game. It does, I admit, have alot to do with the cards you are dealt. But it has much, much more to do with strategy.   Play smart, crazies.

       Current Song: Rascal Flatts - Feels Like Today     (My jaw is sooo swolen and in soo much pain. I guess this is my punishment. I guess I should deal with it.)  I owe many many people many many words:  *~*~*~*  You inspire me. Your optimism is bigger than life. You make the best out of everything. You amaze me, because you are stronger than anyone I know. I admire you.   *~*~*~*   I thought about you today. I thought about the last time I saw you. You were so full of energy. You criticized the way she dressed, and you joked sarcastically about it. But you didn't know you'd never see her again.  Do you still have your energy? Do you still have your optimism? I pray that you never lose your spirit. Have you already? Don't dismay, dear...all will be okay.   *~*~*~*   You always put a smile on my face. You always cheer me up. You are always there for me, through good and bad. I am myself with you. I am honest with you.  And honesty is so hard for me these days. Please don't ever ever fall out of touch. I just don't think I would be okay.   *~*~*~*   I'm sorry. It's been so long. I'm sorry. Don't rely on me. I'm horrible. I'm so sorry I make so many mistakes. I'd be surprised if you're still there for me...   *~*~*~*   For the record, I'm not trying to be emotional or depressing. This is just my outpouring.  :)  Ahhh work at 7 tomorrow. :-/  "She left the suds in the bucket, and the clothes hangin' out on the line..."  Tomorrow's gonna be good. If I remember to take some meds. Like my Actonel. And the Zoloft I haven't taken in many days. Oh dear.  I called it an early night tonight so I can read and rest up. I need it.  OOooOOooHHhhHH my jaw. Omfg.... so much awful pain.  Okay time to read.  CrAzIeS....;)

      I looked back. I admit it. I reminisced. I have never felt so completely lost.  Somewhere in the mess of life I lost something. We all lost something. Something big, something wonderful, something that I'm afraid none of us can replace. Somewhere in the drama, and the fun - the wild excitement - somewhere in all that we lost something. We've lost ourselves. We lost our spirits, our hearts, our minds...we all let go.  What happened to us? We used to be so alive; so vibrant and so carefree. None of us are alive anymore. Not like before. Not like then. Everyone was so different. Now we're all different from one another, but all same unfortunately.  We're nothing. I'm nothing.  -Is that all you've got? -...I've got nothing.  I hate us all. Because we never saw it coming.  "and we never planned on this disaster"  God dammit it's true.  I can't be this anymore. I can't be anything because I can't be who I once was.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year. One more year.  Then I can go. I can start over. God I want to start over. God I want to start over.  I'm sick of who I am. In a year...in a year I start a new life.  The life I left.  i hate myself.  i hate us all.  we've all lost ourselves.  don't reminisce crazies. it hurts.

       Current Song: Something Corporate - Fall    &nbsp; (ghetto ass music, huh?)  So blah blah blah I'm quite a bit hungover this morning.  Cedar Hill guy is an asshole. He called me and bitched me out last night because I guess I'm a bitch. Okay he wins...I did ditch him twice. So there shall be no more of him....ahh tough shit I guess.  I not = feel me so good.  No that statement didn't make sense and was not coherent.  I have to get my stupid shot today. Yarr yarr fucking yarr.  Okay...I'm all out of things to say.  find what you need, crazies.

       Current Song: Less Than Jake - Plastic Cup Politics    &nbsp; Well last night sucked lots and lots and lots.  I figured out that something is not right. Someone is messing around in my trunk, and now I don't know if that bottle was spilled or is someone messed with it. I think my dad might know. Now you're wondering why he wouldn't say something to me? It's simple. He'll probably hide it from my mom until some day when I piss him off and he brings it all out. Now honestly...yes, that will suck. But let's not forget that I know things that could be revealed at such a time. Because the only way to win with parents is to invalidate their authority. Cha-ching. If you're lost...then it's all for the better. :)  So I'm not really too worried.  So last night also sucked because I was crawling out of my window in my room (please don't ask...) and my belly button ring got caught on the brick and it kinda stretched it and it started bleeding pretty hardcore. :( painful.  Okay time to go. fear me crazies.

Especially when you are young. And have to go through it again in like 50 years.  (If you're confused, it's this medication I'm on. Holy hell hot flashes are the worst thing ever.)  Anyways, Thursday is official camping day.  Yep yep excitement whoo hoooo.  Ahh I have nothing else to say. Just wanted to bitch about my hot flashes.

       Current Song: A Perfect Circle - Thinking of You    &nbsp; Ahhh my kitty is a crazy fool.  Anyways...the past couple days=awesome!!!  Sunday my mom and I went out to Conway, Arkansas to visit MY SCHOOOOL! aka Hendrix College.  Monday I attended the summer preview day. Let me tell you this: I have fallen in love with Hendrix College. It is absolutely definately without a doubt where I want to attend next fall. The campus itself is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL, the academic rigor is amazing, the social activities are exciting, the students are motivated, the professors are beyond-qualified and have a genuine interest in the well-being of the students, the scenery is breathtaking, hell, even the campus' cafeteria is award-winning.  I'm going back in the fall to visit when the school is in session, sit in on a class, and spend the night on campus in the dorms.   I'm going there.   My doctor is an alumni of the school, and he offered to send a letter of recommendation. He's actually the one who brought more attention to the school as being a serious option. And I can see why he's so passionate about the place. Because it's a place to be passionate about. It's a place for passionate people. Really.  Anyways, blah blah blah I could go on forever about it really, but I'll spare you.  Yay, crazies!

      Brar brar brar.  Last night was pretty cool.  I finally agreed to meet up with that Cedar Hill guy last night. Boy oh boy he is much hotter than I remember. Oh buddy oh buddy. Because I didn't really remember what he looked like, and then I was like 'oh yeah...damn he was hotter than I remembered.' So I guess I will have to make it a point to answer those phone calls more often and...hang out and shit.  So last night was adventure night and even though it wasn't a super-insane outrageous adventure of death it was pretty cool. And I ended up in the back of a police vehicle. ;)  Hahaha I'm so dumb.  Keller is starting to feel more and more like a small town. Maybe it's because everywhere you turn you run into someone.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Yuuuuuup  Okay okay I'm done that's enough.  Oh oh I added commenting to my blog. Please feel free to use or abuse.  blah blah crazies *boom*

Anyways, my  school  just called (Hendrix) to confirm my visit monday. Oh boy oh boy.  I want this school year to just like...fly by. Because I'm ready to get away.  I'm supposed to have a date tonight...but I don't know if I wanna go and spread my diseases and such.  There is also a party tonight. Maybe I could just invite this guy (whatever-his-name-is-i-really-am-not-sure-but-hey-he's-hot-okay?) to this party. My God that boy called me about 5000034504304300 times yesterday. :- Blah blah blah I need a new job. Maybe I will go hunt for one today. In Southlake...so I won't end up with a job that's crappy like mine.  Maybe I will go shopping while I'm down there too.  :)  It's a date...with myself.  So last night we talked to this FRIKKIN KICK ASS COP in the Tom Thumb parking lot. He was cool as hell. He showed us all of his cool cop stuff in the back of his cop suv. Rofl, crazy awesome guy.  Alright. Meet you there crazies.

      He was something she could never understand.  Others were simple-minded tools she would thumb through day after day, using and casually discarding by the break of light seeping under her door.  But not him.  He was a puzzle; a tireless enigma of a trackless mind fumbling in and out of expectation in a way that never ceased to amuse her.  She could never predict what to expect from him. Once she had loved him. Now she simply fell victim to her own curiosity. What plans, what schemes could&nbsp;bury themselves in his actions? What motives lay behind those exotic eyes...and why did they seem to long for her? Why did feelings of love, or lust, or whatever feelings these were...why did they seem to linger in him?  She...she was through with love. It was nothing more than the well-read novel of a child's fantasy, and she had long since grown. She had grown up, and no longer had time for the surrealism he danced in.  Secretely she longed for one more dance.  But perhaps this time she felt his absence. Perhaps this time her feelings were stronger than before.  He used to tease her. He told her that someday he would leave.  Perhaps this time he had.  &nbsp; She followed I-35 southbound for hours that morning. The sun had not yet broken the day, but she could not stay for the others. They were nothing like him.  As light began to scratch the surface of the sky, she glanced down the road before her.  As the next exit approached she beared to the right, and turned around.  &nbsp; He had not left her yet.

I got a bottle of Hpnotiq and that makes me oh so very very very very very&nbsp;very happy.  This guy I met from Cedar Hill wants to hang out and drink it with me but I think this bottle is gonna be saved for the  girls.   Too bad I don't have any Hennessey to compliment it oh so nicely.  :)  Oh and I got my schedule, but I don't feel like posting it on here right now...so maybe later.  It's a bitch though, I'll tell you that.  :)  Oh well.  :) :) Crazies.

      I am super sexified tonight.  With nothing to do.  I met a hot boy last night. At a gas station.  What is it with gas stations? I swear they are like hot boy breeding grounds or something. I don't know if that makes sense.  Anyways, this hot boy called me today, but I had left my phone at home and was out.  So he said he'd call back later on the message.  But has failed to do so as of yet.  I thought it was funny that he called in the first place.  Anyways...I guess I'll be going out here in a little bit.  Check it crazies.

      Yarrrrrrrrr &nbsp; Well well well... &nbsp; Things are good. Things are good. &nbsp; I feel like going on an adventure. Tonight. I have this really really awesome plan. And it's gonna be awesome. Ya heeaaaar me? &nbsp; :) &nbsp; Oops. Forgot my Actonel again. GOD DAMMIT. I'm supposed to take it on Sundays but yesterday as soon as I woke up I took my Zoloft and a Clarinex. Big no-no before taking Actonel. Then this morning I ate a donut as soon as I woke up. Another no-no. I just hate having to wake up once a week, be tired as hell, take that stupid pill with a full glass of water...and then I have to put everything on hold for 30 minutes. No eating, no drinking, no taking medicine, no laying down. For 30 minutes. So dumb. &nbsp; Well, I guess the new day for Actonel will have to be Tuesday. :-&nbsp; Whoops. &nbsp; And my counselor called this morning to tell me there was a conflict with my schedule. Grrrr. Comparative Government and French 5 are only offered at one time...the same time, of course. So I dropped Comparative Government. :( &nbsp; *tears* I actually wanted to take that freaking class. I mean seriously. I did. I wanna major in Political Science for Christ's sake...of course I wanted to take that class. But I also want to double major...in Political Science and  International Relations.  &nbsp; Yes. And it seems that&nbsp;although the 2 compliment each other quite nicely in the real world, they conflict with one another at f-ing Keller High School. &nbsp; Okay okay. Enough is enough. &nbsp; Oh oh. I burned this kick ass cd last night. It's all country songs about drinking. And I'm going to listen to it whenever I'm intoxicated. Heavily. And sing along and be merry. &nbsp; And I'll even listen to it when I'm sober. &nbsp; Bitches. &nbsp; Okay, crazies, ride em high.

Thrilling story I must say. &nbsp; Surprisingly, as I have found, this summer has not let me down. &nbsp; It's&nbsp; been good...anti-dramatic, fun-loving, crazy...just a damn good summer. &nbsp; :) &nbsp; I  &nbsp; :) &nbsp; Haha oh my oh my. My mood is just so carefree and I really really am enjoying it. &nbsp; But really, this summer has definately reached my expectations...in fact...summer always seems to meet my approval. But this summer has just had more spontanaeity. You know? &nbsp; Yeah. I'm rambling. &nbsp; Anyways, I've got some reading to do...and then some cleaning *maybe* and then some....partying? &nbsp; Yes yes...partying. As it should be. &nbsp; Alright crazies.

      Well... &nbsp; I don't know why I'm posting. &nbsp; I'm dying, so I guess this is my farewell. &nbsp; *coughcoughgagchokewheezecoughdyingnoises* &nbsp; I'm afraid I've contracted some fatal diseases. &nbsp; First, I was bit by a brown recluse. I developed a fatal rash on my arm and it is quickly worsening. Then, I contracted malaria. When I went to the doctor, to do testing for my fatal diseases, he discovered I have the very late stages of skin cancer...why it was not sooner diagnosed I am not sure. Well, they decided to do do further testing and discovered a malignant brain tumor lodged deep in my cranium, with no hope of operating. Now, you'd suppose that this much bad news in the course a day, would dampen my spirits, but I remained hopeful that perhaps I could pull through. That is, until they discovered I had SARS. Now now...SARS is not too deadly so I still kept my head high. Until this morning they told me that I am HIV positive...and it will soon evolve into full-blown AIDS. Okay, so my esteems have waivered a bit. &nbsp; Okay...I was pretty pissed. &nbsp; Then, they discovered I have herpes. Yeah. That's probably the biggest blow. In fact...that just sucks. &nbsp; But you know what really sucks? &nbsp; I missed this party last night. &nbsp; &nbsp; My life is freakin' over. &nbsp; &nbsp; .. .. .. .. .. &nbsp; I've nothing left crazies.

Awesome. Yes, I know.  &nbsp;  Now, need to get the 3rd hole in my right ear re-done. Yet again. Why does it ALWAYS close up??  &nbsp;  Maybe it is retarded.  &nbsp;  Like you. Asshole.  &nbsp;  :)  &nbsp;  Wow my parents have some pretty gay cd's I am noticing. Except the Van Halen. Think I might be stealing that one right about...soon.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Blllllaaaaaaaaaaahhhh  &nbsp;  I'm a crazy fool  &nbsp;  Somebody help me before I  &nbsp;  .....  &nbsp;  ......  &nbsp;  .......  &nbsp;  ........  &nbsp;  Well I'm not sure, but wtf I'll get back to you on that one, crazies.  &nbsp;  ;)  &nbsp;  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* &nbsp;  (wtf is wrong with me?)

I mean, Less Than Jake let me and two other people in without a problem, or an ID check, let us talk to the band for a while, chill before the show...you know. But hey. It was still cool.  Today I got my belly button pierced. Fun stuff.  Oh, and I went out to eat with my dad and our waiter was really hot, and right before we left he looked over and winked at me. Oh sexy beast.  I swear, I've developed this 'guy' mentality when it comes to...sex. Or just sexuality for that matter. Gender roles. It's like that "I'd do him...and him...and him...oh he's hot, I'd probably do him too" attitude.  Whatever, I'm stupid.  LoL, make me shut up.  I know you all want to. Tough shit though, huh?  Aaaaannnnddd....forgot what else I had to say.  Oh yes, I remember.  People are so bitch-bitch-bitchy. :)  Not people I hang out with...we're cool.  I'm glad I don't know alot of bitch-bitch-bitchy people. I'd have to find a loaded gun.  ....and gun laws are a bitch these days.  Bang bang crazies.

      Ugh.  Pain.  I wish I was sleeping right now...but I just took my Actonel so I can't lay down. And I can't take any pain medication.  Damn you Actonel. I hate you so much.    Don't get wrapped up in meaning. It'll never be clear if all you do is search. Live in the moment, for the moment. Understanding won't come to those who sit around waiting for it to arrive.  It's okay. You don't have to care that much.   I know it sounds like a senseless philosophy, but it sure can be a damn good one to live by. At least if you like to live with a little less weight on your shoulders. A little less burden of drama, I suppose.  So this college search thing is going well. I'm pretty sure I've got my heart set on one school. Easily attainable, fairly affordable (given I get some pretty good scholarships/financial aid), and all around just the type of school I'm really looking for. Hendrix College in Arkansas. It's a small, private, liberal arts school with a population smaller than KHS (about 1100). For one, they offer both of my majors of interest (International Relations and Political Science), not to mention that their entire curriculum really focuses on my interests and the types of ideals that I hope to carry into a career someday. Something about that school just makes me...excited to head off next year.  Blah.  I've nothing more to say crazies.

And...I am the only damn person on the guest list for that show. That's right. Guest list, VIP, awesome shit.  Because hey...I'm awesome.  Whoo I'm excited. It's gonna be a damn good show. And if I have any trouble getting in, I'll just talk to the tour manager, and it's all good. Got the HOOK UP.  And...I am hungry. Amazing. Really. Think it's time I go get some foooooood.  Why do places close so early on Saturdays? It's like...hey...screw me over why don't you.  Quite literally.  Tomorrow night is gonna kick ass.  Hunger is an abnormality, crazies.

      *375th post* I've almost hit the two year mark.  Ahh I hate all my medication. I'm not myself anymore. I'm someone else and I don't like her and neither does anyone else.  This blows.  Blah blah blah blah blah anyways I got very very drunk last night.  And then I started throwing things?  Don't ask me why, I'm telling you, I've never acted like that when I'm drunk.  Must be the meds.  And when I woke up this morning I threw up and my whole body of course aches sooooooooo bad because of my Actonel. Damn you Actonel and your pain inducing power.  So I was 2 hours late to work, but only because I called in around 8 and Sherry said I could come in at 10. Then I left early too. Amen.  Je ne me sens pas bien.  I'm getting really really really really really sad lately. Like this Zoloft doesn't do shit. In fact it really just blows. I just...don't give a fuck anymore.  I am going downhill. I'm such a wasteland.  Okay okay.  Leaving Friday.  Tomorrow I meet this lady about some job opportunity she wants to offer me?  I have no idea who she is or what it's about...but...okay?  7 pm. Can't forget.  I need to wash my car really bad. It's awful and crazy. Rofl. Yup.  Okay boys, that's it for now.  carefully fall apart, crazies.

But it's a surrrprrriiiseeee. :)  Given that my dad doesn't back down on his word.  But the piercing is definite.  So to sum up things: Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. :-P Haha. Okay. Right.

      In a provocative society as the one we live in today, how can one not see that the age of conservatism is quickly diminishing? Our culture has, over the past hundred years, and noteably further back in history, become more and more open-minded. Such a label as being 'open-minded' is in general association with liberalism in today's society. So, in correlation with this association, is conservatism close-minded?  I would personally consider myself moderate to liberal; riding the fence while leaning to the left considerably. In no way a radical, but in  no way  conservative. So the question remains: is there room for conservatism in a liberal society? Conservatives would obviously argue that liberalism is simply one side of the fence, and that society itself can not be liberal. But how is society  not  liberal? Our world is relying more and more heavily on youth, change, and radical movement.  Perhaps it would be easy to ramble with case after case, example after example as to why and how society is liberal. But I think the best example of society's leftism is in education.  While visiting the college I plan to attend, a woman commented that the small, liberal arts college was 'a bit too liberal' for her and her daughters. I was taken back by her statement, because I wonder: how can education be  too  liberal? There are very few institutions of higher education that aren't leaning toward liberalism these days. And education should be open-minded, a bit radical, and, well, liberal. Education makes the generations, and generations form society.  Even conservatives are becoming liberals. The far-right conservatism of the past really doesn't serve the same purpose (or even appropriateness) in society that it once did. Modern conservatism is fusing with moderation and blending with the open-mindedness of liberalism.  For that matter, society as a whole is fusing into one giant, liberal community. Social acceptance of all issues is on the rise in the world today, from gay marriage to pro-choice to feminism. Truly, of course, no society can realistically stay too far left. We are not in an era where society is swinging left, but rather, an era where society is coming to a slow rest in the middle. In the past several hundred years we recovered from far right society, and are soon to peak far to the left, if we have not done so already. We have learned from the problems facing a radically conservative society and also from the problems facing a radically liberal society. Conservatism, to put it bluntly, is facing a sharp decline. And in our current course, liberalism may very well do the same. Our society is headed for moderation.  So why would I spend my time contemplating the fact that society is headed in a general direction of balance and well-being? Because of exactly that. It is my theory that balance is the key for a completely distopian society. Our society, our economy, our future as a growing, excelling race is based upon radical distinction. Radical separation. The direction of restitution in society that we are heading for is in no way a positive middle ground. Balance in such a way would be the downfall of the economy, the downfall of productive society, and the downfall of an excelling race.  So what is this liberal trying to say? Within the next 100 years, it is necessary for conservatism to make a rebound. Conservatism is vital to society. We must continue the swinging pendulum between leftism and rightism. For the sake of our economy, for the sake of our society, and for the sake of our race, radicalism is vital. -Shauna Zajac

      Ahhh. I love life. It is so great.  Haha so...weekendness. Friday Me, Manda, Rachel, Chad and Bryan went to Skate World because we kick ass obviously. I hadn't been there since 6th grade...and it actually was kinda fun. Saturday my mother and I went shopping. Now, I shall interrupt this review for a quick, embarrassing, retarded story:  So my mom and I are shopping. And I was looking at shoes n such and I found this really cute pair of clear heels. If you know anything about me, I love heels. LOVE them. Clear ones especially. So I was like "hey, I'm gonna try these on"...so I try them on but don't really walk around in them, just kinda stand and see how they fit. And I liked them mucho, so I bought them. Well when I got home I tried them on and I started to walk around and suddenly noticed something down at my feet:  flashing lights.  Yes...it is true....they fucking light up. I started cracking up, out of stupidity for buying them and not even reading the damn tag that says "yes...they light up!" Ooooh so I have a certain return to make.  Okay back to weekendness. Saturday evening I worked from 5-11,  then went home and then to Steven's house. Well, my parents said I had to be home at 1:30 and well...that doesn't work for me. So I came home, yes, around 1:45 or so and 'went to bed'. AKA waited till about 2:45 and crawled out my window. Oh yeah, what a rebel. Rofl. It was kinda fun though. Knowing that it actually WORKS. I got home around 5:30. And so far so good.  Now now, time for homework. Then I'm gonna read some.  Special special awesome freakin great, crazies.

      Ugh.  Damn you Lupron Depot. F-ing damn you.  My hot flashes are worsening. Today...yes first day of school, we'll get to that in a minute...every 20 minutes I was getting these damn hot flashes. It's almost embarrassing when everyone else is freezing and you're nearly sweating you're so hot. It's awful. Every 20 minutes. This is sooo awful.  And to make things better...I have a panic disorder. Yes...yes...I'm freakin' falling apart. Endometriosis involving surgury and an assload of meds and then a panic disorder. Which I don't think I'll go on meds for unless I start getting more frequent panic attacks. Right now they aren't so bad...they're somewhat rare. I had one about two weeks ago though...what a bitch.  So first day back for my last year of school. Hurry hurry let's get this shit over with.  Then HENDRIX. Pray God. God willing. Please. God.  So my classes this semester are...yes...kinda tough. But not impossible.  English 4 AP Sociology (blow off) Calculus AB BC Microeconomics  Next 9 weeks I have AP Psychology 2nd period and Macroeconomics 4th period.  Okay crazies...live large.

       Current Song: Tool - Lateralus      Lalalalalalala      Hey I just found a really cute pair or earrings. Fun.      Okay, so nothing too interesting going on...I have to work at 4 :( until 10 :(      But umm...I have to read ALOT today. And tomorrow.      And tomorrow I need to:      go get my nails done   go shopping   go get my shot   read some more   read more   do misc. things   sulk over the last day of summer   get my ass ready   not quite sure what else...      okay okay. You get the idea.      So why is it that the Ft. Worth Star Telegram insists that every year they absolutely MUST publish a feature story about Keller being one of the first school districts in the state to go back to school. True it does help their case that this year they're opening several new schools and have about 1,600 new students entering the district, and that we have a new superintendent...but COME ON ALREADY! Everyone has already entertained this fact about Keller's early start a dozen times...do we need it again?   Aren't there more interesting things going on in the world...in this country...in this area?...than Keller students going back to school?   I guess not. Not for Keller students anyway.      Okay, so I've entertained you all long enough. I quit.      Far and gone,crazies.
